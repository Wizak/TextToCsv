first four volumes of the flashman papers has been the generous response from readers and students of history in many parts of the world since the discovery of flashmans remarkable manuscript in a leicestershire saleroom in when it was realised that it was the hithertounsuspected autobiographical memoir of the notorious bully of tom browns schooldays letters have reached the editor from such diverse places as ascension island a gi rest camp in vietnam university faculties and campuses in britain and america a modern caravanserai on the khyber pass road a policestation cell in southern australia and many others what has been especially gratifying has been not only the interest in flashman himself but the close historical knowledge which correspondents have shown of the periods and incidents with which his memoirs have dealt so far the first afghan war the solution of the schleswigholstein question the afroamerican slave trade and the crimean war many have contributed interesting observations and one or two have detected curious discrepancies in flashmans recollections which regrettably escaped his editor a lady in athens and a gentleman in flint michigan have pointed out that flashman apparently saw the duchess of wellington at a london theatre some years after her death and a letter on foreign office notepaper has remarked on his careless reference to a british ambassador in washington in when in fact her majestys representative in the american capital held a less exalted diplomatic title such lapses are understandable if not excusable in a hardliving octogenarian equally interesting have been such communications as those from a gentleman in new orleans who claims to be flashmans illegitimate greatgrandson and from a british serving officer who asserts that his grandfather lent fifty dollars and a horse to flashman during the same campaign neither apparently was returned it is possible that these and other matters of interest will be resolved when the later papers are edited the present volume deals with flashmans adventures in the indian mutiny where he witnessed many of the dramatic moments of that terrible struggle and encountered numerous victorian celebrities monarchs statesmen and generals among them as in previous volumes his narrative tallies closely with accepted historical fact as well as furnishing much new information and there has been little for his editor to do except correct his spelling deplore his conduct and provide the usual notes and appendices gmf they dont often invite me to balmoral nowadays which is a blessing those damned tartan carpets always put me off my food to say nothing of the endless pictures of german royalty and that unspeakable statue of the prince consort standing knockkneed in a kilt king teddys company is something id sooner avoid than not anyway for hes no better than an upperclass hooligan of course hes been pretty leery of me for fortyodd years and when he finally wheezed his way on to the throne i gather he thought of dropping me altogether said something about my being falstaff to his prince hal falstaff mark you from a man with piggy eyes and a belly like a conestoga wagon cover vile taste in cigars he has too in the old queens time of course i was at balmoral a great deal she always fancied me from when she was a chit of a girl and pinned the afghan medal on my manly breast and after i had ridden herd on that same precious teddy through the tranby croft affair and saved him from the worst consequences of his own folly she couldnt do enough for me each september after that regular as clockwork there would come a command for dear general flashman to take the train north to kailyard castle and there would be my own room with a bowl of late roses on the windowsill and a bottle of brandy on the sidetable with a discreet napkin over it they knew my style so i put up with it she was all right little vicky as long as you gave her your arm to lean on and let her prattle on endlessly and the rations were adequate but even then i never cottoned to the place not only as ive said was it furnished in a taste that would have offended the sensibilities of a nigger costermonger it had the most awful highland gloom about it all drizzle and mist and draughts under the door and holy melancholy even the billiardroom had a print on the wall of a dreadful ancient scotch couple glowering devoutly praying i dont doubt for me to be snookered but i think what really turns me against balmoral in my old age is its memories it was there that the great mutiny began for me and on my rare excursions north nowadays theres a point on the line where the rhythm of the wheels changes and in my imagination they begin to sing merajhansidengenay merajhansidengenay over and over and in a moment the years have dropped away and im remembering how i first came to balmoral half a century ago aye and what it led to the stifling heat of the parade ground at meerut with the fetteringhammers clanging the bite of the muzzle of the ninepounder jammed into my body and my own blood steaming on the sunscorched iron old wheeler bawling hoarsely as the black cavalry sabres come thundering across the maidan towards our flimsy rampart the burning bungalows a skeleton hand in the dust colin campbell scratching his grizzled head the crimson stain spreading in the filthy water below suttee ghat a huge glittering pile of silver and gold and jewels and ivory bigger than anything youve ever seen and two great brown liquid eyes shadowed with kohl a single pearl resting on the satin skin above them open red lips trembling and blast him heres the stationmaster beaming and knuckling his hat and starting me out of the only delightful part of that waking nightmare with his cry of welcome back tae deeside sir harry here we are again then and as he hands me down to the platform you may be sure the local folk are all on hand bringing their brats to stare and giggle at the big old buffer in his tweed cape and monstrous white whiskers so i acknowledge the cheers with a wave bluff and hearty as i step into the dogcart stepping briskly to escape the inevitable bemedalled veteran who comes shuffling after me hoping ill slip him sixpence for a dram when he assures me that we once stood together in the highlanders line at balaclava lying old bastard he was probably skulking in bed not that id blame him if he was mark you given the chance id have skulked in mine and not just at balaclava neither but at every battle and skirmish ive sweated and scampered through during fifty inglorious years of unwilling soldiering but to return to the point which is the mutiny and that terrible incredible journey that began at balmoral well it was as ghastly a road as any living man travelled in my time ive seen a deal of war and agree with sherman that its hell but the mutiny was the seventh circle under the pit of course it had its compensations for one i came through it pretty whole which is more than havelock and harry east and johnny nicholson did enterprising lads that they were i did and it brought me my greatest honour and a tidy enough slab of loot which bought and maintains my present place in leicestershire i reckon the plunders better employed keeping me and my tenants in drink than it was decorating a nigger temple for the edification of a gang of bloodsucking priests and along the mutiny road i met and loved that gorgeous wicked witch lakshmibai there were others too naturally but she was the prime piece one other thing about the mutiny before i get down to cases i reckon it must be about the only one of my campaigns that i was pitched into through no fault of mine on other occasions ill own ive been to blame for a man with a white liver a yard wide ive had a most unhappy knack of landing myself neckdeep in the slaughter through my various follies to wit talking too much playing the fool in poolrooms believing everything abraham lincoln told me inviting a halfbreed hunkpapa whore to a regimental ball and so on the lists as long as my arm but my involvement in the mutiny was all palmerstons doing it came out of as clear and untroubled a sky as you could wish a few months after my return from the crimea where as you may know id won fresh laurels through my terrified inability to avoid the most gruelling actions i had stood petrified in the thin red streak charged with the heavies and lights been taken prisoner by the russians and after a most deplorable series of adventures had emerged breathless and lousy at peshawar there as if i hadnt had trouble enough i was restoring my powers by squandering them on one of those stately hungry afghan amazons and she must have been a long sight better at coupling than cooking for something on her menu gave me the cholera i was on the broad of my back for months and it took a slow restful voyage home before i was my own man again in prime fettle for the reunion with my loving elspeth and to enjoy the role of a returned hero about town and i may add a retired hero oxen and wainropes werent going to drag flashy back to the front again however there i was in the summer of safely content on halfpay as a staff colonel with not so much as a sniff of war in sight except the persian farce and that didnt matter i was comfortably settled with elspeth and little havvy in a fine house off berkeley square which elspeths inheritance maintained in lavish style dropping by occasionally at horse guards leading the social life clubbing and turfing whoring here and there as an occasional change from my lawful brainless beauty and being lionised by all london well id stood at armageddon and battled for the lord hadnt i and enough had leaked out about my subsequent secret exploits in central asia to suggest that flashy had surpassed all his former heroics so with the country in a patriotic fever about its returning braves i was acehigh in popular esteem there was even talk that id get one of the new victoria crosses but its my belief that airey and cardigan scotched it between them jealous bastards i suspect that airey whod been chief of staff to raglan in crimea hadnt forgotten my minor dereliction of duty at the alma when the queens randy little cousin willy got his fool head blown off while under my care and cardigan loathed me not least because id once emerged drunk in the nick of time from a wardrobe to prevent him cocking his lustful leg over my loving elspeth and since coming home i hadnt given him cause to love me any better you see there was a deal of fine malicious tittletattle going about that summer over cardigans part in the light brigade fiasco not so much about his responsibility for the disaster which was debatable if you ask me but for his personal behaviour at the guns hed been at the head of the charge right enough with me alongside on a bolting horse farting my fearful soul out but after wed reached the battery hed barely paused to exchange a cut or two with the ruski gunners before heading for home and safety again shocking bad form in a commander says i who was trying to hide under a gun limber at the time not that i think for a moment that he was funking it he hadnt the brains to be frightened our lord hawhaw but he had retreated without undue delay and since he was never short of enemies eager to believe the worst the gossips were having a field day now there were angry letters in the press and even a lawsuit l and since id been in the thick of the action it was natural that i should be asked about it in fact it was george paget whod commanded the th lights in the charge who put the thing to me pointblank in the cardroom at whites in front of a number of people civilians mostly but i know spottswood was there and old scarlett of the heavies i think you were neck and neck with cardigan says paget and in the battery before anyone else now god knows hes not my soulmate but all this talks getting a shade raw did you see him in the battery or not well i had but i wasnt saying so far be it from me to clear his lordships reputation when there was a chance of damaging it so i said offhand dont ask me george i was too busy hunting for your cigars which caused a guffaw no gammon flash says he looking grim and asked again in his tactful way did cardigan cut out or not there were one or two shocked murmurs and i shuffled a pack frowning before i answered there are more ways than one of damning a mans credit and i wanted to give cardigan of my best so i looked uncomfortable and then growled slapped the pack down as i rose looked paget in the eye and said its all by and done with now aint it lets drop it george shall we and i went out then and there leaving behind the impression that bluff gallant flashy didnt want to talk about it which convinced them all that cardigan had shirked better than if id said so straight out or called him a coward to his face i had a chance to do that too a bare two hours later when the man himself came raging up to me with a couple of his toadies in tow just as spottswood and i were coming out of the guards club the hall was full of fellows goggling at the sensation fwashman you there sir he croaked they were absolutely the first words between us since the charge nearly two years before he was breathing frantically like a man who has been running his beaky face all mottled and his grey whiskers quaking with fury fwashman this is intolewable my honour is impugned scandalous lies sir and they tell me that you dont deny them well sir well hawhaw i tilted back my tile with a forefinger and looked him up and down from his bald head and pop eyes to his stamping foot he looked on the edge of apoplexy a delightful sight what lies are these my lord says i very steady you know vewy well he cried bawacwava sir the storming of the battewy word george paget has asked you in pubwic whether you saw me at the guns and you have the effwontewy to tell him you dont know damnation sir and one of my own officers too a former member of your regiment my lord i admit the fact blast your impudence he roared frothing at me will you give me the lie will you say i was not at the guns i settled my hat and pulled on my gloves while he mouthed my lord says i speaking deliberately clear i saw you in the advance in the battery itself i was otherwise engaged and had no leisure nor inclination to look about me to see who was where for that matter i did not see lord george himself until he pulled me to my feet i assumed and i bore on the word ever so slightly that you were on hand at the head of your command but i do not know and frankly i do not care good day to you my lord and with a little nod i turned to the door his voice pursued me cracking with rage colonel fwashman he cried you are a viper i turned at that making myself go red in the face in righteous wrath but i knew what i was about he was getting no blow or challenge from me he shot too damned straight for that indeed my lord says i yet i dont wriggle and turn and i left him gargling well pleased with myself but as i say it probably cost me the vc at the time for all the rumours he was still a power at horse guards and well insinuated at court too however our little exchange did nothing to diminish my popularity at large a few nights later i got a tremendous cheer at the guards dinner at surrey gardens with chaps standing on the table shouting huzza for flash harry and singing garryowen and tumbling down drunk how they did it on a third of a bottle of bubbly beat me cardigan wasnt there sensible fellow theyd have hooted him out of the kingdom as it was punch carried a nasty little dig about his absence and wondered that he hadnt sent along his spurs since hed made such good use of them in retiring from the battery of course lord hawhaw wasnt the only general to come under the public lash that summer the rest of em like lucan and airey got it too for the way theyd botched the campaign so while we gallant underlings enjoyed roses and laurels all the way our idiot commanders were gainfully employed exchanging recriminations writing furious letters to the papers saying twasnt their fault but some other fellows and there had even been a commission set up to investigate their misconduct of the war unfortunately government picked the wrong men to do the investigating macneill and tulloch for they turned out to be honest and reported that indeed our high command hadnt been fit to dig latrines or words to that effect well that plainly wouldnt do so another commission had to be hurriedly formed to investigate afresh and this time get the right answer and no nonsense about it well they did and exonerated everybody hiphiphurrah and rule britannia which was what youd have expected any halfcompetent government to stagemanage in the first place but palmerston was in the saddle by then and he wasnt really good at politics you know to crown it all in the middle of the scandal the queen herself had words about it with hardinge the commanderinchief at the aldershot review and poor old hardinge fell down paralysed and never smiled again its true i was there myself getting soaked through and hardinge went down like a shanghaied sailor with all his faculties gone not that he had many to start with some said it was a judgement on the army and government corruption so there all of which mattered rather less to me than the width of elspeths crinolines but if ive digressed it is merely to show you how things were in england then and also because i can never resist the temptation to blackguard cardigan as he deserves meanwhile i was going happily about my business helping my dear wife spend her cash which she did like a clipperhand in port im bound to say and you would have said we were a blissful young couple turning a blind eye to each others infidelities and galloping in harness when we felt like it which was frequent for if anything she got more beddable with the passing years and then came the invitation to balmoral which reduced elspeth to a state of nervous exultation close to hysterics and took me clean aback id have imagined that if the royal family ever thought of me at all it was as the chap whod been remiss enough to lose one of the queens cousins but mind you she had so many of em she probably didnt notice or if she did hadnt heard that i was to blame for it no ive puzzled over it sometimes and can only conclude that the reason we were bidden to balmoral that september was that russia was still very much the topic of the day what with the new tsars coronation and the recent peace and i was one of the most senior men to have been a prisoner in russias hands i didnt have leisure to speculate at the time though for elspeths frenzy at the thought of being in attendance as she chose to call it claimed everyones attention within a mile of berkeley square being a scotch tradesmans daughter my darling was one degree more snobbish than a penniless spanish duke and in the days before we went north her condescension to her middleclass friends would have turned your stomach between gloating and babbling about how she and the queen would discuss dressmaking while albert and i boozed in the gunroom she went into declines at the thought that she would come out in spots or have her drawers fall down when being presented you must have endured the sort of thing yourself oh harry jane speedicut will be green you and i guests of her majesty it will be the finest thing and i have my new french dresses the ivory the beige silk the lilac satin and the lovely lovely green which old admiral lawson so admired if you think it is not a leetle low for the queen and my barrege for sunday will there be members of the nobility staying also will there be ladies whose husbands are of lower rank than you ellen parkin lady parkin indeed was consumed with spite when i told her oh and i must have another maid who can manage my hair for sarah is too maladroit for words although she is very passable with dresses what shall i wear to picnics for we shall be bound to walk in the lovely highland countryside oh harry what do you suppose the queen reads and shall i call the prince highness or sir i was glad i can tell you when we finally reached abergeldie where we had rooms in the castle where guests were put up for balmoral was very new then and albert was still busy having the finishing touches put to it elspeth by this time was too nervous even to talk but her first glimpse of our royal hosts reduced her awe a trifle i think we took a stroll the first afternoon in the direction of balmoral and on the road encountered what seemed to be a family of tinkers led by a small washerwoman and an usher who had evidently pinched his headmasters clothes fortunately i recognised them as victoria and albert out with their brood and knew enough simply to raise my hat as we passed for they loathed to be treated as royalty when they were playing at being commoners elspeth didnt even suspect who it was until we were past and when i told her she swooned by the roadside i revived her by threatening to carry her into the bushes and molest her and on the way back she observed that really her majesty had looked quite royal but in a common sort of way by the time we were presented at balmoral though the next day she was high up the scale again and the fact that we shared the waitingroom beforehand with some lord or other and his beaknosed lady who looked at us as though we were riffraff reduced my poor little scatterbrain to quaking terror id met the royals before of course and tried to reassure her whispering that she looked a stunner and not to be put out by lord and lady puffbuttock who were now ignoring us with that icy incivility which is the stamp of our lowerclass aristocracy it was quite handy that our companions kept their noses in the air though for it gave me the chance to loop a ribbon from the ladys enormous crinoline on to an occasional table without her knowing and when the doors to the royal drawingroom were opened she set off and brought the whole thing crashing down crockery and all in full view of the little court circle i kept elspeth in an iron grip and steered her round the wreckage and so colonel and mrs flashman made their bows while the doors were hurriedly closed behind us and the muffled sounds of the puffbuttocks being extricated by flunkeys was music to my ears even if it did make the queen look more popeyed than usual the moral is dont put on airs with flashy and if you do keep your crinolines out of harms way and as it turned out to elspeths lifelong delight and my immense satisfaction she and the queen got on like port and nuts from the first elspeth you see was one of those females who are so beautiful that even other women cant help liking em and in her idiot way she was a lively and engaging soul the fact that she was scotch helped too for the queen was in one of her jacobite moods just then and by the grace of god someone had read waverley to elspeth when she was a child and taught her to recite the lady of the lake i had been dreading meeting albert again in case he mentioned his whoremongering nephew willy now deceased but all he did was say ah colonel flashmann haff you read tocquevilles lancien regime i said i hadnt yet but id be at the railway library first thing in the morning and he looked doleful and went on it warns us that bureaucratic central government far from curing the ills of revolution can actually arouse them i said id often thought that now that he mentioned it and he nodded and said italy is very unsatisfactory which brought our conversation to a close fortunately old ellenborough whod been chief in india at the time of my kabul heroics was among those present and he buttonholed me which was a profound relief and then the queen addressed me in that high singsong of hers your dear wife colonel flashman tells me that you are quite recovered from the rigours of your russian adventures which you shall tell us of presently they seem to be a quite extraordinary people lord granville writes from petersburg that lady wodehouses russian maid was found eating the contents of one of her ladyships dressingtable pots it was castor oil pomatum for the hair what a remarkable extravagance was it not that was my cue of course to regale them with a few domestic anecdotes of russia and its primitive ways which went down well with the queen nodding approval and saying how barbarous how strange while elspeth glowed to see her hero holding the floor albert joined in in his ribtickling way to observe that no european state offered such fertile soil for the seeds of socialism as russia did and that he feared that the new tsar had little intellect or character so lord granville says was the queens prim rejoinder but i do not think it is quite his place to make such observations on a royal personage do you not agree mrs flashman old ellenborough who was a cheery boozy buffer said to me that he hoped i had tried to civilise the russians a little by teaching them cricket and albert who had no more humour than the parish trough looked stuffy and says i am sure colonel flashmann would do no such thing i cannot unnerstend this passion for cricket it seems to me a great waste of time what is the proffit to a younk boy in crouching motionless in a field for hours on end em i nott right colonel well sir says i ive looked out in the deep field myself long enough to sympathise with you its a great fag to be sure but perhaps when the boys a man his life may depend on crouching motionless behind a khyber rock or a burmese bush so a bit of practice may not come amiss when hes young which was sauce if you like but i could never resist the temptation in grovelling to albert to put a pinch of pepper down his shirt it was in my character of bluff nononsense harry too and a nice reminder of the daring deeds id done ellenborough said hear hear and even albert looked only halfsulky and said all disscipline was admirable but there must be better ways of instilling it the prince of wales he said should nott play cricket but some more constructiff game after that we had tea very informal and elspeth distinguished herself by actually prevailing on albert to eat a cucumber sandwich shell have him in the bushes in a minute thinks i and on that happy note our first visit concluded with elspeth going home on a cloud to abergeldie but if it was socially useful it wasnt much of a holiday although elspeth revelled in it she went for walks with the queen twice and even made albert laugh when charades were played in the evening by impersonating helen of troy with a scotch accent i couldnt even get a grin out of him we went shooting with the other gentlemen and it was purgatory having to stalk at his pace he was keen as mustard though and slaughtered stags like a ghazi on hashish youll hardly credit it but his notion of sport was that a huge long trench should be dug so that we could sneak up on the deer unobserved hed have done it too but the local ghillies showed so much disgust at the idea that he dropped it he couldnt understand their objections though to him all that mattered was killing the beasts for the rest he prosed interminably and played german music on the piano with me applauding like hell things werent made easier by the fact that he and victoria werent getting on too well just then she had just discovered that she was in foal for the ninth time and she took her temper out on dear albert the trouble was he was so bloody patient with her which can drive a woman to fury faster than anything i know and he was always right which was worse so they werent dealing at all well and he spent most of the daylight hours tramping up glen bollocks or whatever they call it roaring ze gunn and butchering every animal in view the only thing that seemed to cheer up the queen was that she was marrying off her oldest daughter princess vicky the best of the whole family in my view a really pretty greeneyed little mischief she was to wed frederick william of prussia who was due at balmoral in a few weeks and the queen was full of it elspeth told me however enough of the court gossip it will give you some notion of the trivial way in which i was being forced to pass my time toadying albert and telling the queen how many acute accents there were on determines the trouble with this kind of thing is that it dulls your wits and your proper instinct for selfpreservation so that if a blow falls youre caught clean offside as i was on the night of september i recollect the date absolutely because it was the day after florence nightingale came to the castle id never met her but as the leading crimean on the premises i was summoned to join in the teteatete she had with the queen in the afternoon it was a frost if you like pious platitudes from the two of em with flashy passing the muffins and joining in when called on to agree that what our wars needed was more sanitation and texts on the wall of every dressingstation there was one nearfacer for me and that was when miss nightingale asked me calm as you like what regimental officers could do to prevent their men from contracting certain indelicate social infections from hemhem female campfollowers of a certain sort i near as dammit put my teacup in the queens lap but recovered to say that id never heard of any such thing not in the light cavalry anyway french troops another matter of course would you believe it i actually made her blush but i doubt if the queen even knew what we were talking about for the rest i thought la nightingale a waste of good womanhood handsome face well set up and titted out but with that cold dontlayalecherouslimbonmemylad look in her eye the kind in short that can be all right if youre prepared to spend time and trouble making em cry roger but i seldom have the patience anywhere else i might have taken a squeeze at her just by way of research but a queens drawingroom cramps your style elspeth and i spent the following evening at a birthday party at one of the big houses in the neighbourhood it was a cheery affair and we didnt leave till close on midnight to drive back to abergeldie it was a close thundery night with big raindrops starting to fall but we didnt mind i had taken enough drink on board to be monstrously horny and if the drive had been longer and elspeths crinoline less of a hindrance id have had at her on the carriageseat she got out at the lodge giggling and squeaking and i chased her through the front door and there was the messenger of doom waiting in the hall a tall chap almost a swell but with a jaw too long and an eye too sharp very respectable with a hard hat under his arm and a billy in his hippocket ill wager i know a genteel strong man from a government office when i see one he asked could he speak to me so i took my arm from elspeths waist patted her towards the stairs with a whispered promise that id be up directly to sound the charge and told him to state his business he did that smart enough i am from the treasury colonel flashman says he my name is hutton lord palmerston wishes to speak with you it took me flat aback slightly foxed that i was my first thought was that he must want me to go back to london but then he said his lordship is at balmoral sir if you will be good enough to come with me i have a coach but but you said lord palmerston the prime what the deuce palmerston wants me at once sir if you please the matter is urgent well i couldnt make anything of it i never doubted it was genuine as ive said the man in front of me had authority written all over him but its a fair start when you come rolling innocently home and are told that the first statesman of europe is round the corner and wants you at the double and now the fellow was positively ushering me towards the door hold on says i give me a moment to change my shoes what i wanted was a moment to put my head in the washbowl and think and despite his insistence i snapped at him to wait and hurried upstairs what the devil was pam doing here and what could he want with me id only met him once for a moment before i went to the crimea id leered at him ingratiatingly at parties too but never spoken and now he wanted me urgently me a mere colonel on halfpay id nothing on my conscience either leastways not to interest him i couldnt see it but there was nothing but to obey so i went to my dressingroom fretting donned my hat and topcoat against the worsening weather and remembered that elspeth poor child must even now be waiting for her crossbuttocking lesson well it was hard lines on her but duty called so i just popped my head round her door to call a chaste farewell and there she was dammit reclining languorously on the coverlet like one of those randy classical goddesses wearing nothing but the big ostrichplume fan id brought her from egypt and her sniggering maid turning the lamp down low elspeth clothed could stop a monk in his tracks naked and pouting expectantly over a handful of red feathers shed have made the grand inquisitor burn his books i hesitated between love and duty for a full second and then the hell with palmerston let him wait cries i and was plunging for the bed before the abigail was fairly out of the room never miss the chance as the duke used to say lord palmerston ooooah harry what do you mean neer mind cries i taking hold and bouncing away but harry such impatience my love and dearest youre wearing your hat the next ones going to be a boy dammit and for a few glorious stolen moments i forgot palmerston and minions in the hall and marvelled at the way that superb idiot woman of mine could keep up a stream of questions while performing like a harem houri we were locked in an astonishing embrace on her dressingtable stool i recall when there was a knock on the door and the maids giggling voice piped through to say the gentleman downstairs was getting impatient and would i be long tell him im just packing my baggage says i ill be down directly and presently keeping my mouth on hers to stem her babble of questions i carried my darling tenderly back to the bed always leave things as you would wish to find them i cannot stay longer my love i told her the prime minister is waiting and with bewildered entreaties pursuing me i skipped out trousers in hand made a hasty toilet on the landing panted briefly against the wall and then stepped briskly down its a great satisfaction looking back that i kept the government waiting in such a good cause and i set it down here as a deserved tribute to the woman who was the only real love of my life and as the last pleasant memory i was to have for a long time ahead its true enough too as ko dalis daughter taught me that theres nothing like a good rattle for perking up an edgy chap like me it had shaken me for a moment and it still looked rum that palmerston should want to see me but as we bowled through the driving rain to balmoral i was telling myself that there was probably nothing in it after all considering the good odour i stood in just then hobnobbing with royalty and being admired for my russian heroics it was far more likely to be fair news than foul and it wasnt like being bidden to the presence of one of your true ogres like the old duke or bismarck or dr wrathofgod arnold no pam might be an impatient old tyrant when it came to bullying foreigners and sending warships to deal with the dagoes but everyone knew he was a decent kindly old sport at bottom who put folk at their ease and told a good story why it was notorious that the reason he wouldnt live at downing street but on piccadilly was that he liked to ogle the goodlookers from his window and wave to the cads and crossingsweepers who loved him because he talked plain english and would stump up a handsome subscription for an old beaten prizepug like tom sayers that was pam and if anyone ever tells you that he was a politically unprincipled old scoundrel who carried things with a high and reckless hand i can only say that it didnt seem to work a whit worse than the policies of more highminded statesmen the only difference i ever saw between them and pam was that he did his dirty work barefaced and grinned about it so i was feeling pretty easy as we covered the three miles to balmoral and even pleasantly excited which shows you how damned soft and optimistic i must have grown i should have known that its never safe to get within range of princes or prime ministers when we got to the castle i followed hutton smartly through a sidedoor up some backstairs and along to heavy double doors where a burly civilian was standing guard i gave my whiskers a martial twitch as he opened the door and stepped briskly in you know how it can be when you enter a strange room everything can look as safe and merry as ninepence and yet theres something in the air that touches you like an electric shock it was here now a sort of bristling excitement that put my nerves on edge in an instant and yet there was nothing out of the ordinary to see just a big cheerful panelled room with a huge fire roaring under the mantel a great table littered with papers and two sober chaps bustling about it under the direction of a slim young fellow barrington palmerstons secretary and over by the fire were three other men ellenborough with his great flushed face and his belly stuck out a slim keenlooking old file whom i recognized as wood of the admiralty and with his back to the blaze and his coattails up the man himself peering at ellenborough with his bright shortsighted eyes and looking as though his dyed hair and whiskers had just been rubbed with a towel old squire pam as ever was as i came in his brisk sharp voice was ringing out so if hes to be prince consort it dont make a haporth of difference you see not to the country or me however as long as her majesty thinks it does thats what matters what havent you found that telegraph of quilters yet barrington well look in the persian packet then and then he caught sight of me and frowned sticking out his long lip ha thats the man cries he come in sir come in what with the drink id taken and my sudden nervousness i tripped over the mat which was an omen if you like and came as near as a toucher to oversetting a chair by george says pam is he drunk all these young fellows are nowadays here barrington see him to a chair before he breaks a window there at the table barrington pulled out a chair for me and the three at the fireplace seemed to be staring ominously at me while i apologised and took it especially pam in the middle with those bright steady eyes taking in every inch of me as he nursed his port glass and stuck a thumb into his fob for all the world like the marshal of a kansas trailtown surveying the street he was very old at this time with the gout and his false teeth forever slipping out but he was evidently full of ginger tonight and not in one of his easygoing moods he didnt beat about either young flashman growls he very good staff colonel on halfpay at present what well from this moment youre back on the full list an what you hear in this room tonight is to go no further understand not to anyone not even in this castle you follow i followed sure enough what he meant was that the queen wasnt to know it was notorious that he never told her anything but that was nothing it was his tone and the solemn urgency of his warning that put the hairs up on my neck very good says he again now then before i talk to you lord ellenborough has somethin to show you want your opinion of it all right barrington ill take that persian stuff now while colonel flashman looks at the damned buns i thought id misheard him as he limped past me and took his seat at the tablehead pawing impatiently among his papers but sure enough barrington passed over to me a little lead biscuitbox and ellenborough seating himself beside me indicated that i should open it i pushed back the lid mystified and there in a ricepaper wrapping were three or four greyish stalelooking little scones no bigger than captains biscuits there says pam not looking up from his papers dont eat em tell his lordship what you make of those i knew right off that faint eastern smell was unmistakable but i touched one of them to make sure theyre chapattis my lord says i astonished indian chapattis ellenborough nodded ordinary cakes of native food you attach no signal significance to them though why no sir wood took a seat opposite me and you can conjecture no situation colonel says he in his dry quiet voice in which the sight of such cakes might occasion you alarm obviously ministers of the crown dont ask damnfool questions for nothing but i could only stare at him pam apparently deep in his papers at the tablehead wheezing and sucking his teeth and muttering to barrington paused to grunt serve the dam things at dinner an theyd alarm me and ellenborough tapped the biscuit box these chapattis came last week from india by fast steam sloop sent by our political agent at a place called jhansi know it its down below the jumna in maharatta country for weeks now scores of such cakes have been turning up among the sepoys of our native indian garrison at jhansi not as food though it seems the sepoys pass them from hand to hand as tokens have you ever heard of such a thing wood interrupted i hadnt so i just shook my head and looked attentive wondering what the devil this was all about while ellenborough went on our political knows where they come from all right the native village constables you know the chowkidars bake them in batches of ten and send one apiece to ten different sepoys and each sepoy is bound to make ten more and pass them on to his comrades and so on ad infinitum its not new of course ritual cakepassing is very old in india but there are three remarkable things about it firstly it happens only rarely second even the natives themselves dont know why it happens only that the cakes must be baked and passed and third he tapped the box again they believe that the appearance of the cakes foreshadows terrible catastrophe he paused and i tried to look impressed for there was nothing out of the way in all this straight from alice in wonderland if you like but when you know india and the amazing tricks the niggers can get up to you cease to be surprised it seemed an interesting superstition but what was more interesting was that two ministers of the government and a former governorgeneral of india were discussing it behind closed doors and had decided to let flashy into the secret but theres something more ellenborough went on which is why skene our political man at jhansi is treating the matter as one of urgency cakes like these have circulated among native troops quite apart from civilians on only three occasions in the past fifty years at vellore in at buxar and at barrackpore you dont recall the names well at each place when the cakes appeared the same reaction followed among the sepoys he put on his house of lords face and said impressively mutiny looking back i suppose i ought to have thrilled with horror at the mention of the dread word but in fact all that occurred to me was the facetious thought that perhaps they ought to have varied the sepoys rations i didnt think much of the political man skenes judgement either id been a political myself and its part of the job to scream at your own shadow but if he or ellenborough who knew india outside in was smelling a sepoy revolt in a few mouldy biscuits well it was ludicrous i knew john sepoy for the most loyal ass who ever put on uniform and so he should have been the way the company treated him however it wasnt for me to venture an opinion in such august company particularly with the prime minister listening hed pushed his papers aside and risen and was pouring himself some more port well now says he briskly taking a hearty swig and rolling it round his teeth youve admired his lordships cakes what damned unappetisin they look too all right barrington your assistants can go our special leaves at four does it very well he waited till the junior secretaries had gone muttered something about ungodly hours and the queens perversity in choosing a country retreat at the north pole and paced stiffly over to the fire where he set his back to the mantel and glowered at me from beneath his gorsebush brows which was enough to set my dinner circulating in the old accustomed style tokens of revolution in an indian garrison says he very good been readin that report of yours again flashman the one you made to dalhousie last year in which you described the discovery you made while you were a prisoner in russia about their scheme for invadin india while we were busy in crimea course we say nothin about that these days peace signed with russia all good fellowship an be damned et cetera dont have to tell you but somethin in your report came to mind when this cake business began he pushed out his big lip at me you wrote that the russian march across the indus was to be accompanied by a native risin in india fomented by tsarist agents our politicals have been chasin that fox ever since pickin up some interestin scents of which these infernal buns are the latest now then he settled himself eyes halfshut but watching me tell me precisely what you heard in russia touchin on an indian rebellion every word of it so i told him exactly as i remembered it how scud east and i had lain quaking in our nightshirts in the gallery at starotorsk and overheard about item seven which was the russian plan for an invasion of india theyd have done it too but yakub begs riders scuppered their army up on the syr daria with flashy running about roaring with a bellyful of bhang performing unconscious prodigies of valour id set it all out in my report to dalhousie leaving out the discreditable bits it was a report of nicelyjudged modesty that official one calculated to convince dalhousie that i was the nearest thing to hereward the wake he was ever likely to meet and why not id suffered for my credit but the information about an indian rebellion had been slight all wed discovered was that when the russian army reached the khyber their agents in india would rouse the natives and particularly john companys sepoys to rise against the british i didnt doubt it was true at the time it seemed an obvious ploy but that was more than a year ago and russia was no threat to india any longer i supposed they heard me out in a silence that lasted a full minute after id finished and then wood says quietly it fits my lord too dam well says pam and came hobbling back to his chair again its all pat you see flashman russia may be spent as an armed power for the present but that dont mean shell leave us at peace in india what this scheme for a rebellion by george if i were a russian political invasion or no invasion i fancy i could achieve somethin in india given the right agents couldnt i just though he growled in his throat heaving restlessly and cursing his gouty foot did you know theres an indian superstition that the british raj will come to an end exactly a hundred years after the battle of plassey he picked up one of the chapattis and peered at it dam thing isnt even sugared well the hundredth anniversary of plassey falls next june the twentythird interestin now then tell me what dyou know about a russian nobleman called count nicholas ignatieff he shot it at me so abruptly that i must have started a good six inches theres a choice collection of ruffians whose names you can mention if you want to ruin my digestion for an hour or two charity spring and bismarck rudi starnberg and wesley hardin for example but id put n p ignatieff up with the leaders any time he was the brute whod nearly put paid to me in russia a gotcheyed freezing ghoul of a man whod dragged me halfway to china in chains and threatened me with exposure in a cage and knouting to death and like pleasantries i hadnt cared above half for the conversation thus far with its bloody mutiny cakes and the sinister way they kept dragging in my report to dalhousie but at the introduction of ignatieffs name my bowels began to play the hallelujah chorus in earnest it took me all my time to keep a straight face and tell pam what i knew that ignatieff had been one of the late tsars closest advisers and that he was a political agent of immense skill and utter ruthlessness i ended with a reminiscence of the last time id seen him under that hideous row of gallows at fort raim ellenborough exclaimed in disgust wood shuddered delicately and pam sipped his port interestin life youve led says he thought i remembered his name from your report he was one of the prime movers behind the russian plan for invasion an indian rebellion as i recall capable chap what my lord says i hes the devil and thats a fact just so says pam an the devil will find mischief he nodded to ellenborough tell him my lord pay close heed to this flashman ellenborough cleared his throat and fixed his boozy spaniel eyes on me count ignatieff says he has made two clandestine visits to india in the past year our politicals first had word of him last autumn at ghuznee he came over the khyber disguised as an afridi horsecoper to peshawar there we lost him as you might expect one disguised man among so many natives but my lord that cant be i couldnt help interrupting you cant lose ignatieff if you know what to look for however hes disguised theres one thing he cant hide his eyes one of ems halfbrown halfblue he can if he puts a patch over it says ellenborough indias full of oneeyed men in any event we picked up his trail again and on both occasions it led to the same place jhansi he spent two months there all told usually out of sight and our people were never able to lay a hand on him what he was doing they couldnt discover except that it was mischief now we see what the mischief was and he pointed to the chapattis brewing insurrection beyond a doubt and having done his infernal work back over the hills to afghanistan this summer he was in st petersburg but from what our politicals did learn hes expected back in jhansi again we dont know when no doubt it was the subject under discussion but there didnt seem to be an ounce of heat coming from the blazing fire behind me the room felt suddenly cold and i was aware of the rain slashing at the panes and the wind moaning in the dark outside i was looking at ellenborough but in his face i could see ignatieffs hideous particoloured eye and hear that soft icy voice hissing past the long cigarette between his teeth plain enough what says pam the mines laid in jhansi an if it explodes god knows what might follow india looks tranquil enough but how many other jhansis how many other ignatieffs are there he shrugged we dont know but we can be certain theres no more sensitive spot than this one the russians have picked jhansi with care we only annexed it four years ago on the old rajas death an weve still barely more than a foothold there thug country it used to be an still pretty wild for all its one of the richest thrones in india worst of all its ruled by a woman the rani the rajas widow she was old when she married him i gather an there was no legitimate heir so we took it under our wing an she didnt like it she rules under our tutelage these days but she remains as implacable an enemy as we have in india fertile soil for master ignatieff to sow his plots he paused and then looked straight at me aye the mines laid in jhansi but precisely when an where theyll try to fire it an whether itll go off or not this we must know an prevent at all costs the way he said it went through me like an icicle id been sure all along that i wasnt being lectured for fun but now looking at their heavy faces i knew that unless my poltroon instinct was sadly at fault some truly hellish proposal was about to emerge i waited quaking for the axe to fall while pam stirred his false teeth with his tongue which was a damned unnerving sight i may tell you and then delivered sentence last week the board of control decided to send an extraordinary agent to jhansi his task will be to discover what the russians have been doing there how serious is the unrest in the sepoy garrison and to deal with this hostile beldam of a rani by persuadin her if possible that loyalty to the british raj is in her best interest he struck his finger on the table an if an when this man ignatieff returns to jhansi again to deal with him too not a task for an ordinary political youll agree no but i was realising with mounting horror who they did think it was a task for but i could only sit with my spine dissolving and my face set in an expression of attentive idiocy while he went inexorably on the board of control chose you without hesitation flashman i approved the choice myself you dont know it but ive been watchin you since my time as foreign secretary youve been a political an a deuced successful one i dare say you think that the work you did in middle asia last year has gone unrecognised but thats not so he rumbled at me impressively wagging his great fat head youve the highest name as an active officer youve proved your resource you know india fluent in languages includin russian which could be of the first importance what you know this man ignatieff by sight an youve bested him before you see i know all about you flashman you old fool i wanted to shout you dont know anything of the bloody sort you aint fit to be prime minister if thats what you think and i know of no one else so fitted to this work how old are you thirtyfour young enough to go a long way yet for your country and yourself and the old buffoon tried to look sternly inspiring with his teeth gurgling it was appalling god knows ive had my crosses to bear but this beat all as so often in the past i was the victim of my own glorious and entirely unearned reputation flashy the hero of jallalabad the last man out of the kabul retreat and the first man into the balaclava battery the beau sabreur of the light cavalry queens medal thanks of parliament darling of the mob with a liver as yellow as yesterdays custard if theyd only known it and there was nothing with pams eye on me and ellenborough and wood looking solemnly on that i could do about it oh if id followed my best instincts i could have fled wailing from the room or fallen blubbering at some convenient foot but of course i didnt with sick fear mounting in my throat i knew that id have to go and that was that back to india with its heat and filth and flies and dangers and poxy niggers to undertake the damndest mission since bismarck put me on the throne of strackenz but this was infinitely worse bismarcks crew had been as choice a collection of villains as ever jumped bail or slit a throat but they were civilised by comparison with ignatieff the thought of dealing with that devil as pam so nicely put it was enough to send me into a decline and if that wasnt enough i was to sneak about some savage indian kingdom spying on some withered old bitch of an indian princess and trying to wheedle her to british interest against her will and she probably the kind of hag whose idea of fun would be to chain malefactors to a rogue elephants foot but there wasnt the slightest chance to wriggle all i could do was put on my muscular christian expression look palmerston fearlessly in the eye like dick champion when the headmaster gives him the job of teaching the fags not to swear and say id do my best well enough says he i know you will who knows perhaps the signs are false what tokens of mutiny in a place where russias been stirrin the pot an the local rulers chafin under our authority its happened before an it may amount to nothin in the end but if the signs are true make no mistake and he gave me his steady stare its the gravest peril our country has faced since bonaparte its no light commission were placin in your hands sir but theyre the safest hands in england i believe so help me god its absolutely what he said it makes you wonder how these fellows ever get elected i believe i made some manly sounds and as usual my sick terror must have been manifesting itself by making me red in the face which in a fellow of my size is often mistaken for noble resolution it must have satisfied pam anyway for suddenly he was smiling at me and sitting back in his chair now you know why youre sittin here talkin to the prime minister what been sittin on eggshells havent you neer mind im glad to have had the opportunity of instructin you myself of course youll be more fully informed before you sail of all the intelligence youll need his lordship here an mangles at the board in london will be talkin to you when dyou take leave of her majesty another week come thats too long when does the india sloop sail barrington monday youd best be off to town on friday then leave pretty little mrs flashman to take care of royalty what stunnin gal that never see her from my window on piccadilly but it sets me in humour must make her acquaintance when you come home bring her along to number some evenin dinner an so forth what he sat there beaming like pickwick it turned my stomach at the time and small wonder considering the stew he was launching me into and yet when i think back on pam nowadays thats how i see him painted whiskers sloppy false teeth and all grinning like a happy urchin you never saw such young peepers in a tired old face i can say it now from the safety of my declining years in spite of the hellish pickle he landed me in id swap any politician i ever met for old pam damn him however now that hed put the doom on me he couldnt get rid of me fast enough before id been properly shooed out of the room he was snapping at barrington to find some american telegraph or other and chivvying at wood that they must soon be off to catch their special train at aberdeen it must have been about three in the morning but he was still full of bounce and the last i saw of him he was dictating a letter even as they helped him into his coat and muffler with people bustling around him and he was breaking off to peer again at the chapattis on the table and ask ellenborough did the hindoos eat em with meat or any kind of relish blasted buns says he might do with jam dyou think what no better not crumble an get under my confounded teeth probably he glanced up and caught sight of me bowing my farewell from the doorway good night to you flashman he sings out an good huntin you look out sharp for yourself mind so that was how i got my marching orders in a snap of the fingers almost two hours earlier id been rogering happily away with not a care in the world and now i was bound for india on the most dangerous lunatic mission id ever heard of by god i cursed the day id written that report to dalhousie glorifying myself into the soup and fine soup it promised to be rumours of mutiny mad old indian princesses thugs and ignatieff and his jackals lurking in the undergrowth you can imagine i didnt get much rest in what was left of the night elspeth was fast asleep looking glorious with the candlelight on her blonde hair tumbled over the pillow and her rosebud lips half open snoring like the town band i was too fretful to rouse her in her favourite way so i just shook her awake and i must say she bore the news of our impending parting with remarkable composure at least she wept inconsolably for five minutes at the thought of being bereft while her hector was braving the dangers of india fondled my whiskers and said she and little havvy would be quite desolate whimpered sadly while she teased me in an absentminded way into mounting her and then remembered she had left her best silk gloves behind at the evenings party and that she had a spot on her left shoulder which no amount of cream would send away its nice to know youre going to be missed i had three days still left at balmoral and the first of them was spent closeted with ellenborough and a sharp little creature from the board of control who lectured me in maddening detail about my mission to jhansi and conditions in india i wont weary you with it here for youll learn about jhansi and its attendant horrors and delights in due course sufficient to say it did nothing but deepen my misgivings and then on the wednesday morning something happened which drove everything else clean out of my mind it was such a shock such an unbelievable coincidence in view of what had gone before that i can still think back to it with disbelief aye and start sweating at the thought id had a thoroughly drunken night at abergeldie to take my mind off the future and when i woke clothheaded and surly on the wednesday morning elspeth suggested that instead of breakfast id be better going for a canter i damned her advice and sent for a horse left her weeping sulkily into her boiled egg and ten minutes later was galloping the fumes away along the balmoral road i reached the castle and trotted up as far as the carriage entrance beyond it on the far side of the gravel sweep one of the big castle coaches that brought quality visitors from aberdeen station was drawn up and flunkies were handing down the arrivals and bowing them towards the steps leading to the side door some more poor fools of consequence about to savour the royal hospitality thinks i and was just about to turn my horse away when i happened to glance again at the group of gentlemen in travelling capes who were mounting the steps one of them turned to say something to the flunkies and i nearly fell from the saddle and only saved myself by clutching the mane with both hands i believe i nearly fainted for it was something infinitely worse than a ghost it was real even if it was utterly impossible the man on the steps spruce in the rig of an english country gentleman and now turning away into the castle was the man id last seen beside the line of carrion gallows at fort raim the man palmerston was sending me to india to defeat and kill count nicholas pavlevitch ignatieff youre sure croaked ellenborough no no flashman it cant be count ignatieff whom we were discussing two nights since here impossible my lord says i ive good cause to know him better than most and i tell you hes in the castle now gotcheye and all cool as damnyoureyes in a tweed cape and deerstalker hat so help me he was there at the door not ten minutes ago he plumped down on a chair mopping at the shavingsoap on his cheeks id practically had to manhandle his valet to be admitted and id left a trail of startled minions on the backstairs in my haste to get to his room i was still panting from exertion to say nothing of shock i want an explanation of this my lord says i for ill not believe its chance what dye mean says he goggling two nights ago we talked of precious little else but this russian monster how hed been spying the length and breadth of india in the very place to which im being sent and now he turns up the very man is that coincidence i was in such a taking i didnt stand on ceremony how comes he in the country even will you tell me lord palmerston didnt know my god flashman his big mottled face looked shocked what dyou mean by that i mean my lord says i trying to hold myself in that theres precious little that happens anywhere let alone in england that lord palmerston doesnt know about is it possible that hes unaware that the most dangerous agent in russia and one of their leading nobles to boot is promenading about as large as life and never a word the other night when wait wait cries he wattling thats a monstrous suggestion contain yourself sir are you positive its ignatieff i was ready to burst but i didnt im positive stay here says he and bustled out and for ten minutes i chewed my nails until he came back shutting the door behind him carefully he had got his normal beetroot colour back but he looked damned rattled its true says he count ignatieff is here with lord aberdeens party as a guest of the queen it seems you know we have granville in petersburg just now for the new tsars coronation well a party of russian noblemen the first since the war have just arrived in leith yesterday bringing messages of good will or god knows what from the new monarch to the queen someone had written to aberdeen i dont know it all yet and he brought them with him on his way north with this fellow among em its extraordinary the damndest chance chance my lord says i ill need some convincing of that good god what else ill allow its long odds but im certain if lord palmerston had had the least inkling he trailed off and you could see the sudden doubt of his own precious prime minister written on his jowly face oh but the notions preposterous what purpose could it serve not to tell us no he would certainly have told me and you im sure well i wasnt sure from what id heard of pams sense of humour id have put nothing past him and yet it would have been folly surely with me on the point of setting off for india ostensibly to undo ignatieffs work to have let him come face to face with me and then the wildest thought was it possible ignatieff knew about my mission never trumpets ellenborough no that couldnt be the decision to send you out was taken a bare two weeks since it would be to credit the russian intelligence system with superhuman powers and if he did what could he accomplish here dammit in the queens own home this isnt middle asia its a civilised country my lord thats not a civilised man says i but whats to be done i cant meet him let me think says he and strode about heaving his stomach around then he stopped heavy with decision i think you must says he if he has seen you or finds out that you were here and left before your time wait though it might be put down to tact on your part still no he snapped his fingers at me no you must stay better to behave as though there was nothing untoward leave no room to excite suspicion after all former enemies meet in time of peace dont they and well watch him by george we will perhaps well learn something ourselves hahha and this was the portsodden clown who had once governed india id never heard such an idiot suggestion but could i shift him i pleaded in the name of common sense that i should leave at once but he wouldnt have it i do believe that at the back of his mind was the suspicion that pam had known ignatieff was coming and ellenborough was scared to tinker with the chiefs machinations whatever they were youll stay he commanded and thats flat what the devil its just a freak of fate and if its not theres nothing this russian rascal can do i tell you what though im not going to miss his first sight of you what the man he threatened with torture and worse disgusting brute aye and the man who bested him in the end haha and he clapped me on the shoulder aye hope nothing happens to embarrass the queen though youll mind out for that flashman wont you it wouldnt do any unpleasantness hey i minded out all right strangely enough by the time i came back to the castle with elspeth that afternoon my qualms about coming face to face again with that russian wolf had somewhat subsided id reminded myself that we werent meeting on his ground any more but on mine and that the kind of power hed once had over me was a thing quite past still i wont pretend i was feeling at ease and id drummed it into elspeths head that not a hint must be let slip about my ensuing departure for india or pams visit she took it in wideeyed and assured me she would not dream of saying a word but i realised with exasperation that you couldnt trust any warning to take root in that beautiful empty head as we approached the drawingroom doors she was prattling away about what wedding present she should suggest to the queen for mary seymour and preoccupied said offhand why not a lusty young coachman and immediately regretted it you couldnt be sure she wouldnt pass it on and then the doors opened we were announced and the heads in the room were all turning towards us there was the queen in the middle of the sofa with a lady and gentleman behind albert propping up the mantelpiece and lecturing to old aberdeen who appeared to be asleep on his feet half a dozen assorted courtiers and ellenborough staring across the room as we made our bows and the queen says ah mrs flashman you are come just in time to help with the service of tea i was following ellenboroughs glance and there was ignatieff with another russianlooking grandee and a couple of our own gentry he was staring at me and by god he never so much as blinked or twitched a muscle i made my little bow towards albert and as i turned to face ignatieff again i felt god knows why a sudden rush of tohellwithit take hold of me my dear count says astonished and everyone stopped talking the queen looked popeyed and even albert left off prosing to the noble corpse beside him surely its count ignatieff cries and then broke off in apology your pardon maam says i to vicky i was quite startled i had no notion count ignatieff was here forgive me but of course by this time she was all curiosity and i had to explain that count ignatieff was an old comradeinarms so to speak what and beam in his direction while she smiled uncertainly but not displeased and ellenborough played up well and told albert that hed heard me speak of being ignatieffs prisoner during the late war but had had no idea this was the same gentleman and albert looked disconcerted and said that was most remarkable indeed highness i had that honour says ignatieff clicking his heels and the sound of that chilly voice made my spine tingle but there was nothing he could do but take the hand i stretched out to him this is splendid old fellow says i gripping him as though he were my longlost brother wherever have you been keeping yourself one or two of them smiled to see bluff flash harry so delighted at meeting an old enemy just what theyd have expected of course and when the queen had been made quite au fait with the situation she said it was exactly like fitzjames and roderick dhu so after that it was quite jolly and albert made a group with ignatieff and ellenborough and me and questioned me about our acquaintance and i made light of my captivity and escape and said what a charming jailer ignatieff had been and the brute just stood impassive with his tawny head bowed over his cup and looking me over with that amazing halfblue halfbrown eye he was still the same handsome brokennosed young iceberg i remembered if id closed my eyes i could have heard the lash whistling and cracking in arabat courtyard with the cossacks grip on my arms albert of course was much struck by the coincidence of our meeting again and preached a short sermon about the brotherhood of menatarms to which ignatieff smiled politely and i cried hear hear it was difficult to guess but i judged my muscovite monster wasnt enjoying this too much he must have been wondering why i pretended to be so glad to see him but i was all affability i even presented him to elspeth and he bowed and kissed her hand she was very demure and cool so i knew she fancied him the little trollop the truth is my natural insolence was just asserting itself as it always does when i feel its safe when a moment came when ignatieff and i were left alone together i thought id stick a pin in him just for sport so i asked quietly brought your knout with you count he looked at me a moment before replying it is in russia says he waiting so i have no doubt is count pencherjevskys daughter oh yes says i little valla is she well dyou know i have no idea but if she is it is no fault of yours he glanced away towards elspeth and the others is it she never complained to me says i grinning at him on that tack if im well its no fault of yours either that is true says he and the eye was like a swordpoint however may i suggest that the less we say about our previous acquaintance the better i gather from your charade a little while ago designed no doubt to impress your queen that you are understandably reluctant that the truth of your behaviour there should be made public oh come now says i twasnt a patch on yours old boy what would the court of balmoral think if they knew that the charming russian nobleman with the funny eye was a murderous animal who flogs innocent men to death and tortures prisoners of war thought about that if you think you were tortured colonel flashman says he pokerfaced then i congratulate you on your ignorance he put down his cup i find this conversation tedious if you will excuse me and he turned away oh sorry if youre bored says i i was forgetting you probably havent cut a throat or burned a peasant in a week it was downright stupid of me no doubt two hours earlier id been quaking at the thought of meeting him again and here i was sassing him to my hearts content but i can never resist a jibe and a gloat when the enemys hands are tied as thomas hughes would tell you ignatieff didnt seem nearly as fearsome here among the teacups with chaps toadying the royals and cress sandwiches being handed round and ellenborough flirting ponderously with elspeth while the queen complained to old aberdeen that it was the press which had killed lord hardinge in her uncle leopolds opinion no not fearsome at all without his chains and gallows and dungeons and power of life and death and never so much as a cossack thug to bless himself with i should have remembered that men like nicholas ignatieff are dangerous anywhere usually when you least expect it and i was far from expecting anything the next day the last full one i was to spend at balmoral it was a miserable freezing morning i remember with flurries of sleet among the rain and low clouds rolling down off lochnagar the kind of day when you put your nose out once and then settle down to punch and billiards with the boys and build the fire up high but not prince albert there were roe deer reported in great numbers at balloch buie and nothing would do but we must be drummed out cursing for a stalk id have slid back to abergeldie if i could but he nailed me in the hall with ellenborough why colonel flashmann where are your gaiters haff you nott called for your loader yet come gentlemen in this weather we haff only a few hours let us be ofd and he strutted about in his ridiculous alpine hat and tartan cloak while the loaders were called and the brakes made ready and the ghillies loafed about grinning on the terrace with the guns and pouches they knew i loathed it and that ellenborough couldnt carry his guts more than ten yards without a rest and the brutes enjoyed our discomfiture there were four or five other guns in the party and presently we drove off into the rain huddling under the tarpaulin covers as we jolted away from the castle on the unmade road the country round balmoral is primitive at the best of times on a dank autumn day its like an illustration from bunyans holy war especially near our destination which was an eery dreary forest of firs among the mountains with great patches of bog and gullies full of broken rocks and heather waistdeep on the valley sides the road petered out there and we clambered out of the brakes and stood in the pouring wet while albert full of energy and bloodlust planned the campaign we were to spread out singly with our loaders and drive ahead up to the high ground because the mist was hanging fairly thick by this time and if we kept together we might miss the stags altogether we were just about to start on our squelching climb when another brake came rolling up the road and who should pile out but the russian visitors with one of the local bigwigs all dressed for the hill albert of course was delighted come gentlemen cries he this is capital what there are no bearss in our scottish mountains but we can show you fine sport among the deer general menshikof will you accompany me count ignatieff ah where iss flashmann i was having a quick swig from ellenboroughs flask and as the prince turned towards me and i saw ignatieff at his elbow very trim in tweeds and top boots with a fur cap on his head and a heavy piece under his arm i suddenly felt as though id been kicked in the stomach in that second i had a vision of those lonely gullycrossed crags above us with their great reaches of forest in which you could get lost for days and mist blotting out sight and sound of all companions and myself alone with ignatieff downwind of me armed and with that split eye of his raking the trees and heather for a sight of me it hadnt even occurred to me that he might be in the shooting party but here he came strolling across and behind him a great burly unmistakable moujik in smock and boots carrying his pouches ellenborough stiffened and shot a glance at me for myself i was wondering frantically if i could plead indisposition at the last minute i opened my mouth to say something and then albert was summoning ellenborough to take the left flank and ignatieff was standing watching me coolly with the rain beating down between us i have my own loader says he indicating the moujik he is used to heavy game bears as his royal highness says and wolves however he has experience of lesser animals and vermin even i i it had all happened so quickly that i couldnt think of what to say or do albert was dispatching the others to their various startingpoints the first of them were already moving off into the mist as i stood dithering ignatieff stepped closer glanced at my own ghillie who was a few yards away and said quietly in french i did not know you were going to india colonel my congratulations on your appointment a regimental command perhaps eh what dyou mean i started in astonishment surely nothing less says he for such a distinguished campaigner as yourself i dont know what youre talking about i croaked have i been misinformed or have i misunderstood your charming wife when i had the happiness to pay my respects to her this morning i understood her to say but there i may have been mistaken when one encounters a lady of such exceptional beauty i fear one tends to look rather than to listen he smiled something id never seen him do before it reminded me of a frozen river breaking up but i think his royal highness is calling you colonel flashmann i tore myself away from the hypnotic stare of that split eye there was albert waving at me impatiently will you take the lead on the right flank come sir we are losing time it will be dark before we can come up to the beasts if id had any sense id have bolted or gone into a swoon or claimed a sprained ankle but i didnt have time to think the royal nincompoop was gesticulating at me to be off my loader was already ploughing into the trees just ahead one or two of the others had turned to look and ignatieff was smiling coldly at my evident confusion i hesitated and then started after the loader as i entered the trees i took one quick glance back ignatieff was standing beside the brake lighting a cigarette waiting for albert to set him on his way i gulped and plunged into the trees the ghillie was waiting for me under the branches he was one of your grinning freckled redhaired highlanders called maclehose or something equally unpronounceable id had him before and he was a damned good shikari they all are of course well i was going to stick to him like glue this trip i told myself and the farther we got away from our russian sportsmen in quick time the better as i strode through the fir wood ducking to avoid the whippy branches i heard alberts voice faintly behind us and pressed on even harder at the far side of the wood i paused staring up at the hillside ahead of us what the devil was i getting in such a stew for my heart racing like a triphammer and the sweat running down me in spite of the chill this wasnt russia it was a civilised shootingparty in scotland ignatieff wouldnt dare to try any devilment here it had just been the surprise of his sudden appearance at the last minute that had unmanned me wouldnt he though by god hed try anything that one and he knew about my going to india thanks to that blathering idiot id married in an evil hour shooters had been hit before up on the crags in bad light it could be made to look like an accident mistaken for a stag heavy mist tragic error never forgive himself come on i yammered and stumbled over the rocks for a gully that opened to our left there was another one straight ahead but i wasnt having that the ghillie protested that if we went left we might run into the nearest shooters that was all right with me and i ignored him and clambered over the rubble at the gully foot plunging up to the knee in a boggy patch and almost dropping my gun i stole a glance back but there was no sign of anyone emerging from the wood i sprang into the gully and scrambled upwards it was a gruelling climb through the huge heatherbushes that flanked the stream and then it was bracken six feet high with a beaten rabbitpath that i went up at a run at the top the gully opened out into another great mass of firs and not until we were well underneath them did i pause heaving like a bellows and the ghillie padded up beside me not even breathing hard and grinning surprise on his face crackey good gracious says he youre eager to be at the peasties the day whats the great running whatever is this piece loaded says i and held it out what for would it be says the clown well no be near a deer for half an hour yet theres no occasion load the dam thing says i and have you plowing your pluidy head off the haste youre in shell look well then right enuff damn you do as youre told says i so he shrugged and spat and looked his disgust as he put in the charge mind theres two great pullets in there now says he as he handed it back if youve as much sense as a whaups neb youll keep the caps in your pooch until we sight the deer theyve no respect those people i snatched it from him and made off through the wood and for ten minutes we pushed on always upwards through another long gully and along a rocky ledge over a deep stream where the mist hung in swirls among the rowan trees and the foam drifted slowly by on the brown pools it was as dark as dusk although it was still early afternoon there was no sound of another living soul and nothing moving on the low cliffs above us by this time i was asking myself again if i hadnt been overanxious and at the same time wondering if it wouldnt be safest to lie up here till dark and buy the ghillies silence with a sovereign or keep moving to our left to reach the other guns and then he gave a sudden exclamation and stopped frowning and putting a hand on his belly he gave a little barking cough and his ruddy face was pale as he turned to me oh says he whats this all of a sudden my puddens is pad what is it says i impatiently and he sat down on a rock holding himself and making strained noises i i dont know its my belly theres some mischief in herself owf are you ill oh goad i dont know his face was green what do these foreign puggers tak to drink its it must be the spirits yon great hairy fella gave me before we cam up oh mither isnt it hellish oh stop you till i vomit but he couldnt try as he would but leaned against the rock in obvious pain rubbing at himself and groaning and i watched him in horror for there was no doubt what had happened ignatieffs man had drugged or poisoned him so that id be alone on the hill the sheer ruthlessness of it the hellish calculation had me trembling to my boots they would come on me alone and but wait whatever hed been given it couldnt be fatal two corpses on one shoot would be too much to explain away and one of them poisoned at that no it must just be a drug to render him helpless and of course i would turn back down the hill to get help and theyd be there stay where you are ill get help says i and lit out along the ledge but not in the direction wed come it was up and over the hills for flashy and my groaning ghillie could be taken care of when time served i scudded round the corner of rock at the ledges end and through a forest of bracken out into a clear space and then into another fir wood where i paused to get my bearings if i bore off left but which way was left wed taken so many turnings among the confounded bogs and gullies i couldnt be sure and there was no sun to help suppose i went the wrong way and ran into them god knows in this maze of hills and heather it would be easy enough should i go back to the stricken ghillie and wait with him id be safer in his company but they might be up with him by now lurking on the gullyside waiting i stood clutching my gun sweating it was silent as death under the firtrees close as a tomb and dim i could see out one side where there was bracken that would be the place to lie up so i stole forward on tiptoe making no noise on the carpet of mould and needles near the woods edge i waited listening no sound except my own breathing i turned to enter the bracken and stood frozen biting back a yelp of fear behind me on the far side of the wood a twig had snapped for an instant i was paralysed and then i was across the open space of turf and burrowing into the bracken for dear life i went a few yards and then writhed round to look back through the stems and fronds i could see the trees id just left gloomy and silent but i was deep in cover if i lay still not to shake the bracken above me no one could hope to spot me unless he trod on me i burrowed down in the sodden grass panting and waited with my ears straining for five minutes nothing happened there was only the dripping of the fronds and my own heart thumping what made the suspense so hellish was the sheer unfairness of my predicament id been in more tight corners before than i care to count but always in some godless savage part of the world like afghanistan or madagascar or russia or st louis it was damnable that i should be lurking in fear of my life in england or scotland even i hadnt been in this kind of terror on british soil since id been a miserable fag at rugby carrying bully dawsons game bag for him and wed had to hide from keepers at brownsover theyd caught me too and id only got off by peaching on dawson and his pals and showing the keepers where and suddenly where there had been nothing a moment ago a shadow moved in the gloom beneath the trees stopped and took on form in the halflight ignatieff was standing just inside the edge of the fir wood i stopped breathing while he turned his head this way and that searching the thickets he had his gun cocked and by god he wasnt looking for stags then he snapped his fingers and the moujik came padding out of the dimness of the wood he was heeled and ready as well his eyes glaring above his furze of beard ignatieff nodded to the left and the great brute went prowling off that way his piece presented in front of him ignatieff waited a few seconds and then took the way to the right they both disappeared noiselessly and i was left fumbling feverishly for my caps i slipped them under the hammers with trembling fingers wondering whether to stay where i was or try to wriggle farther back into the undergrowth they would be on either side of me shortly and if they turned into the bracken they might easily and with the thought came a steady rustling to my left deep in the green it stopped and then started again and it sounded closer no doubt of it someone was moving stealthily and steadily towards my hiding place it takes a good deal to stir me out of petrified fear but that did it i rolled on my side trying to sweep my gun round to cover the sound it caught in the bracken and i hauled frantically at it to get it clear god what a din i must be making and then the damned lock must have caught on a stem for one barrel went off like a thunderclap and i was on my feet with a yell tearing downhill through the bracken i fairly flung myself through the high fronds there was the crack of a shot behind me and a ball buzzed overhead like a hornet i went bounding through came out in a clearing with firs on either side sprang over a bank of ferns and plunged straight down into a peat cutting i landed belly first in the stinking ooze but i was up and struggling over the far side in an instant for i could hear crashing in the bracken above me and knew that if i lost an instant hed get a second shot i was plastered with muck like a tarandfeather merchant but i still had my gun and then i must have trod on a loose stone for i pitched headlong and went rolling and bumping down the slope hit a rock and finished up winded and battered in a burn trying frantically to scramble up and slithering on the slimy gravel underfoot there was a thumping of boots on the bank i started round and there was the moujik not ten yards away i didnt even have time to look for my gun i was sprawling half out of the burn and the bastard had his piece at his shoulder the muzzle looking me straight in the face i yelled and grabbed for a stone there was the crash of a gunshot and the moujik dropped his piece shrieking and clutched at his arm as he toppled backwards among the rocks careful colonel says a voice behind me hes only winged and there standing not five yards off with a smoking revolver in his hand was a tall fellow in tweeds he just gave me a nod and then jumped lightly over the rocks and stood over the moujik who was groaning and clutching his bleeding arm murderous swine aint you says the newcomer conversationally and kicked him in the face its the only punishment hell get im afraid he added over his shoulder no diplomatic scandals you see and as he turned towards me i saw to my amazement who it was hutton the tall chap with the long jaw whod taken me to palmerston only a few nights before he put his pistol back in his armpit and came over to me no bones broken bless me but youre a sight he pulled me to my feet ill say this colonel youre the fastest man over rough country i ever hope to follow i lost you in five minutes but i kept track of our friends all right nice pair aint they though i wish to god it had been the other one i pulled trigger on oh we wont see him again never fret not until everyones down the hill and hell turn up cool as you like never having been near you all day what but but you mean you expected this noo not exactly anyway but ive been pretty much on hand since the russian brotherhood arrived you know we dont believe in taking chances eh not with customers like master ignatieff enterprising chap that so when i heard hed decided to join the shoot today i thought id look along just as well i did i think says this astonishing fellow now if youve got your wind back i suggest we make our way down never mind our little wounded bird yonder if he dont bleed to death hell find his way back to his master pity he shot himself by accident aint it thatll be their story i dare say and we wont contradict it here what are you about sir i was lunging for my fallen gun full of murderous rage now that the danger was past im going to blow that bloody peasants head off i roared fumbling with the lock ill teach hold on cries he catching my arm and he was positively grinning capital idea i agree but we mustnt you see one bullet in him can be explained away by his own clumsiness but not two eh we mustnt have any scandal colonel not involving her majestys guests come along now lets be moving down so that count ignatieff who ive no doubt is watching us this minute can come to his stricken servants assistance after you sir he was right of course the irony of it was that although ignatieff and his brute had tried to murder me we darent say so for diplomacys sake god knows what international complications there might have been this didnt sink in with me at once but his reminder that ignatieff was still prowling about was enough to lend me wings down the hill not that even hed have tried another shot with hutton about but i wasnt taking chances ill say this for the secret service which is what hutton was of course theyre damned efficient he had a gig waiting on the road one of his assistants was dispatched to the help of my ghillie and within a halfhour i was back in balmoral through the servants entrance being cleaned up and instructed by hutton to put it about that id abandoned the shoot with a strained muscle ill inform my chiefs in london that colonel flashman had a fortunate escape from an unexpected danger arising from a chance encounter with an old russian friend says he and that he is now fit and well to proceed on the important task ahead of him and that in the meantime im keeping an eye on him no sir im sorry i cant answer any of your questions and i wouldnt if i could which left me in a fine state of consternation and bewilderment wondering what to make of it all my immediate thought was that palmerston had somehow arranged the whole thing in the hope that id kill ignatieff but even in my excited condition that didnt make sense a likelier explanation was that ignatieff coming innocently to balmoral and finding me on the premises had decided to take advantage of the chance to murder me in revenge for the way id sold him the previous year that knowing the man and his icecold recklessness was perfectly sound reasoning but there was also the horrid possibility that he had found out about the job palmerston had given me and had been out to dispose of me in the way of business a preposterous notion was ellenboroughs answer when i voiced my fears to him that night he could not know why the board decision was highly secret and imparted only to the prime ministers most intimate circle no this is merely another example of the naked savagery of the russian bear he was full of port and wattling furiously and virtually in her majestys presence too damnable but of course we can say nothing flashman it only remains says he booming sternly for you to mete out conclusive justice to this villain if you chance to encounter him in india in the meantime ill see that the lord chamberlain excludes him from any diplomatic invitations which may be extended to st petersburg in future by gad i will i ventured the cautious suggestion that it might be better after what had happened to send someone else to jhansi just in case ignatieff had tumbled to me but ellenborough wasnt even listening he was just full of indignation at ignatieffs murderous impudence not on my account youll note but because it might have led to a scandal involving the queen so of course we kept mum and as hutton had foreseen it was put about and accepted that ignatieffs loader had had an accident with a gun and everyone wagged their heads in sympathy and the queen sent the poor unfortunate fellow some shortbread and a tot of whisky ignatieff even had the crust to thank her after dinner and i could feel ellenborough at my elbow fairly bubbling with suppressed outrage and to cap it all the brute had the effrontery to challenge me to a game of billiards and beat me hollow too in the presence of albert and half a dozen others i had to be certain there was a good crowd on hand for god knows what hed have tried if wed gone to the poolroom alone ill say it for nicholas ignatieff he was a bearcat for nerve hed have been ready to brain me and claim afterwards that it was a miscue so now having heard the prelude to my indian mutiny adventure you will understand why i dont care much for balmoral and if what happened there that september was trivial by comparison with what followed well i couldnt foresee that indeed as i soothed my bruised nerves with brandy fomentations that night i reflected that there were worse places than india there was aberdeenshire with ignatieff loose in the bracken hoping to hang my head on his gunroom wall i hadnt been able to avoid him here but if we met again on the coral strand it wasnt going to be my fault ive never been stagshooting from that day to this either ellenborough was right the companys too damned mixed i remember young fred roberts once saying that everyone hated india for a month and then loved it forever i wouldnt altogether agree but ill allow that it had its attractions in the old days you lived like a lord without having to work waited on hand and foot made money if you set your mind to it and hardly exerted yourself at all except to hunt the beasts thrash the men and bull the women you had to look sharp to avoid active service of course of which there was a lot about i never fell very lucky that way but even so it wasnt a halfbad station most of the time personally i put that down to the fact that in my young days india was a middleclass place for the british where society people didnt serve if they could help it its different now of course since it became a safe place many of our best and most highlyconnected people have let the light of their countenances shine on india with the results you might expect prices have gone up service has gone down and the women have got clap so they tell me mind you i could see things were changing even in when i landed at bombay my first voyage to india sixteen years before had lasted four months on a creaking east indiaman this time in natty little government steam sloops it had taken just about half that time even with a vile journey by camel across the suez isthmus in between and even from bombay you could get the smell of civilisation theyd started the telegraph and were pushing ahead with the first railways there were more white faces and businesses to be seen and people werent talking as theyd used to of india as though it were a wild jungle with john company strongholds here and there in my early days a journey from calcutta to peshawar had seemed half round the world but no longer it was as though the company was at last seeing india as one vast country and realising that now the wars with the sikhs and maharattas and afghans were things of the past it was an empire that had to be ruled and run quite apart from fighting and showing a nice profit in leadenhall street it was far busier than i remembered it and somehow the civilians seemed more to the fore nowadays than the military once the gossip on the verandahs had all been about war in the north or the thugs or the bandit chiefs of the ghats whod have to be looked up some day now it was as often as not about new mills or factories and even schools and how there would be a railroad clear over to madras in the next five years and youd be able to journey from mrs blackwells in bombay to the auckland in calcutta without once putting on your boots all sounds very peaceful and prosperous says i over a peg and a whore at mother sousas like a good little political you see i was conducting my first researches in the best gossipmart i could find the chap whod bought me the peg laughed and said prosperous i should just think so my firms divvy is up forty per cent and well have new factories at lahore and allahabad working before easter building churches and when the universities come therell be contracts to last out my service i can tell you universities says i not for the niggers surely the native peoples says he primly and the little snirp hadnt been out long enough to get his nose peeled will soon be advanced beyond those of any country on earth heathen countries that is lie still you black bitch cant you see im fagged out yes lord canning is very strong on education i believe and spreading the gospel too well thats bricks and mortar aint it thats where to put your money my boy dear me says i at this rate ill be out of a job i can see military are you well dont fret old fellow you can always apply to be sent to the frontiers quiet as that is it even round jhansi wherevers that my dear chap he was just a pipsqueak of course and knew nothing the little yellow piece i was exercising hadnt heard of jhansi either and when i asked her at a venture what chapattis were good for except eating she didnt bat an eye but giggled and said i was a verree fonnee maan and must buy her meringues not chapattis yaas you may think i was wasting my time sniffing about in bombay but its my experience that if theres anything untoward in a country even one as big as india you can sometimes get a scent in the most unexpected places just from the way the natives look and answer but it was the same whoever i talked to merchant or military whore or missionary no ripples at all after a couple of days when id got the old urdu bat rolling familiarly off my palate again i even browned up and put on a puggaree and coat and pyjamys and loafed about the bund bazaar letting on i was a mekran coast trader and listening to the clack i came out rotten with fleas stinking of nautchoil and cheap perfume and cooking ghee with my ears full of beggars whines and hawkers jabbering and the clang of the booths but that was all still it helped to get india back under my hide again and thats important if you intend to do anything as a political hullo says you whats this not flashy taking his duty seriously for once surely well i was and for a good reason i didnt take pams forebodings seriously but i knew i was bound to go to jhansi and make some sort of showing in the task hed given me the thing was to do it quickly if i could have a couple of official chats with this rani woman look into the business of the sepoys cakes and conclude that skene the jhansi political was a nervous old woman i could fire off a report to calcutta and withdraw gracefully what i must not do was linger because if there was any bottom to pams anxieties jhansi might be full of ignatieff and his jackals before long and i wanted to be well away before that happened so i didnt linger in bombay on the third day i took the road northeast towards jhansi travelling in good style by bullockhackery which is just a great wooden room on wheels in which you have your bed and eat your meals and your groom and cook and bearer squat on the roof theyve gone out now of course with the railway but they were a nice leisurely way of travelling and i stopped off at messes along the road and kept my ears open none of the talk chimed with what id heard at balmoral and the general feeling was that the country had never been so quiet which was heartening even if it was what youd expect downcountry i purposely kept clear of any politicals because i wanted to form my own judgements without getting any uncomfortable news that i didnt want to hear however up towards mhow who should i run into but johnny nicholson whom i hadnt seen since afghanistan fifteen years before trotting along on a persian pony and dressed like a baluchi robber with a beard down to his belly and a couple of sikh lancers in tow we fell on each other like old chums he didnt know me well you see but mostly by my fearsome reputation he was one of your playupandfeargod paladins full of zeal and athirst for glory was john and said his prayers and didnt drink and thought women were either nuns or mothers he was very big by now i discovered and just coming down for leave before he took up as resident at peshawar by rights i shouldnt have mentioned my mission to anyone but this was too good a chance to miss there wasnt a downier bird in all india than nicholson or one who knew the country better and you could have trusted him with anything money even so i told him i was bound for jhansi and why the chapattis the rani and the russians he listened fingering his beard and squinting into the distance while we squatted by the road drinking coffee jhansi eh says he pindari robber country thugs too trust you to pick the toughest nut south of the khyber maharatta chieftains wouldnt turn my back on any of em and if you tell me there have been russian agitators at work im not surprised any number of uglylooking copers and traders have been sliding south with the caravans up our way this year past but not many guns you see thats what we keep our accounts by but i dont like this news about chapattis passing among the sepoys you dont think it amounts to anything surely i found all his cheerful references to thugs and pindaris damned disconcerting he was making jhansi sound as bad as afghanistan i dont know says he very thoughtful but i do know that this whole countrys getting warm dont ask me how i know irish instinct if you like oh i know it looks fine from bombay or calcutta but sometimes i look around and ask myself what were sitting on out here look at it were holding a northern frontier against the toughest villains on earth pathans sikhs baluchis and afghanistan thrown in with russia sitting on the touchline waiting their chance in addition downcountry were nominal masters of a collection of native states half of them wild as barbary ruled by princes whod cut our throats for threepence why because weve tried to civilise em weve clipped the tyrants wings abolished abominations like suttee and thugee cancelled their worst laws and instituted fair ones weve reformed em until theyre sick and started the telegraph the railroad schools hospitals all the rest of it this sounded to me like a man riding his pet hobby i couldnt see why any of this should do anything but please the people the people dont count they never do its the rulers that matter the rajas and the nabobs like this rani of yours in jhansi theyve squeezed this country for centuries and dalhousie put a stop to it of course its for the benefit of the poor folk but they dont know that they believe what their princes tell em and what they tell em is that the british sirkar is their enemy because it stops them burning their widows and murdering each other in the name of kali and will abolish their religion and force christianity on them if it can oh come john says i theyve been saying that for years well theres something in it he looked troubled in a stuffy religious way im a christian i hope or try to be and i pray i shall see the day when the gospel is the daily bread of every poor benighted soul on this continent and his praise is sung in a thousand churches but i could wish our people went more carefully about it these are a devout people flashman and their beliefs misguided though they are must not be taken lightly what do they think when they hear christianity taught in the schools in the jails even and when colonels preach to their regiments let the prince or the agitator whisper in their ears see how the british will trample on thy holy things which they respect not see how they will make christians of you they will believe him and they are such simple folk and their eyes are closed dyou know he went on theres a sect in kashmir that even worships me good for you says i dye take up a collection i try to reason with them but it does no good i tell you india wont be converted in a day or in years it must come slowly if surely but our missionaries good worthy men press on apace and cannot see the harm they may do he sighed yet can one find it in ones heart to blame them old fellow when one considers the blessings that gods grace would bring to this darkened continent it is very hard and he looked stern and nobly anguished arnold would have loved him then he frowned and growled and suddenly burst out it wouldnt be so bad if we werent so confounded soft if we would only carry things with a high hand the reforms and the missionary work even either let well alone or do the thing properly but we dont you see we take halfmeasures and are too gentle by a mile if we are going to pull down their false gods and reform their old and corrupt states and amend their laws and make em worthy men and women then let us do it with strength dalhousie was strong but i dont know about canning i know if i were he id bring these oily smirking treacherous princes under my heel his eyes flashed as he ground his boot in the dust id give em government firm and fair id be less soft with the sepoys too and with some of our own people thats half the trouble you havent been back long enough but depend upon it we send some poor specimens out to the army nowadays and to the company offices brokendown tapsters and serving mens sons eh well youll see em ignorant slothful fellows of poor class and we put em to officer highcaste hindoos of ten years service they dont know their men and treat em like children or animals and think of nothing but drinking and hunting and and he reddened to the roots of his enormous beard and looked aside some of them consort with with the worst type of native women he cleared his throat and patted my arm there im sorry old fellow i know its distasteful to talk of such things but its true alas i shook my head and said it was heartbreaking now you see why your news concerns me so these omens at jhansi they may be the spark to the tinder and ive shown you i hope that the tinder exists in india because of our own blindness and softness if we were stronger and dealt firmly with the princes and accompanied our enlightenment of the people with proper discipline why the spark would be stamped out easily enough as it is he shook his head again i dont like it thank god they had the wit to send someone like you to jhansi i only wish i could come with you to share whatever perils may lie ahead its a strange wild place from all ive heard says this confounded croaker with pious satisfaction as he shook my hand come old fellow shall we pray together for your safety and guidance in whatever dangers you may find yourself and he plumped down there and then on his knees with me alongside and gave god his marching orders in no uncertain fashion telling him to keep a sharp eye on his servant i dont know what it was about me but holy fellows like nicholson were forever addressing heaven on my behalf even those who didnt know me well seemed to sense that there was a lot of hard graft to be done if flashy was ever to smell salvation i can see him yet his great dark head and long nose against the sunset his beard quivering with exhortation and even the freckles on the back of his clasped hands poor wild john he should have canvassed the lord on his own behalf perhaps for while im still here after half a century he was stiff inside the year shot in the midriff by a pandy sniper in the attack on delhi and left to die by inches at the roadside thats what his duty earned for him if hed taken proper precautions hed have made viceroy and delhi would have fallen just the same whatever his prayers accomplished for my solid flesh his talk about jhansi had done nothing for my spirits a strange wild place hed said and talked of the pindari bandits and thugs and maharatta scoundrels well i knew it had been hells punchbowl in the old days but id thought since wed annexed it that it must be quieter now mangles at the board of control in london had described it as tranquil beneath the companys benevolent rule but he was a pompous ass with a talent for talking complete bosh about subjects on which he was an authority as i pushed on into bandelkand it began to look as though he was wrong and nicholson was right it was broken hilly country with jungle on the slopes and in the valleys never a white face to be seen and the black ones getting uglier by the mile the roads were so atrocious and the hackery jolted and rolled so sickeningly that i was forced to take to my pegu pony there was devil a sign of civilisation but only walled villages and every so often a sinister maharatta fort squatting on a hilltop to remind you who really held the power in this land the toughest nut south of the khyber i was ready to believe it as i surveyed those unfriendly jungly hills seeing nothing cheerier than a distant tiger skulking among the waitabit thorn and this was the country that we were ruling with one battalion of suspect sepoy infantry and a handful of british civilians to collect the taxes my first sight of jhansi city wasnt uplifting either we rounded a bend on the hill road and there it was under a dull evening sky a massive fort embattled and towered on a great steep rock and the walled city clustered at its foot it was far bigger than id imagined the walls must have been four miles round at least and the air over the city was thick with the smoke of a thousand cooking fires on this side of the city lay the orderly white lines of the british camp and cantonment god it looked tiny and feeble beneath that looming vastness of jhansi fort my mind went back to kabul and how our camp had seemed dwarfed by the bala hissar and even at kabul with an army of ten thousand only a handful of us had escaped i told myself that here it was different that less than a hundred miles ahead of me there were our great garrisons along the grand trunk and that however forbidding jhansi might look it was a british state nowadays and under the sirkars protection only there wasnt much sign of that protection just our pathetic little village like a flea on the lions lip and somewhere in that great citadel where our troops never went that brooding old bitch of a rani scheming against us with her thousands of savage subjects waiting for her word thus my imagination as if it hadnt been full enough already what with ignatieff and thugs and wild pindaris and dissident sepoys and nicholsons forebodings my first task was to look up skene the political whose reports had started the whole business so i headed down to the cantonment which was a neat little compound of perhaps forty bungalows with decent gardens and the usual groups already meeting on the verandahs for sundown pegs and cordials there were a few carriages waiting with their grooms and drivers to take people out for dinner and one or two officers riding home but i drove straight through and got a chowkidars direction to the little star fort where skene had his office hed still be there the chowkidar said which argued a very conscientious political indeed frankly i hoped to find him scared or stupid he wasnt either he was one of these fair intent young fellows who fall over themselves to help and will work all the hours god sends he hopped from one leg to another when i presented myself and seemed fairly overwhelmed to meet the great flashy but the steady grey eye told you at once that here was a boy who didnt take alarm at trifles he had clerks and bearers running in all directions to take my gear to quarters saw to it that i was given a bath and then bore me off for dinner at his own bungalow where he lost no time in getting down to business no one knows why youre here sir except me says he i believe carshore the collector suspects but hes a sound man and will say nothing of course erskine the commissioner at saugor knows all about it but no one else he hesitated im not quite clear myself sir why they sent you out and not someone from calcutta well they wanted an assassin you see says i easily just for bounce it so happens im acquainted with the russian gentleman whos been active in these parts and dealing with him aint a job for an ordinary political what it was true after all pam himself had said it also it seems calcutta and yourself and commissioner erskine with all respect havent been too successful with this titled lady up in the city palace then there are these cakes all told it seemed better to lord palmerston to send me lord palmerston says he his eyes wide open i didnt know it had gone that far i assured him hed been the cause of the prime ministers losing a nights sleep and he whistled and reached for the decanter thats neither here nor there anyway says i you cost me a nights sleep too for that matter the first thing is have any of these russian fellows been back this way to my surprise he looked confused truth is sir i never knew theyd been near that came to me from calcutta our frontier people traced them down this way three times i believe and i was kept informed but if they hadnt told me id never have known that rattled me if you like you mean if they do come back or if theyre loose in your bailiwick now you wont know of it until calcutta sees fit to tell you oh our frontier politicals will send me word as soon as any suspected person crosses over says he and i have my own native agents on the lookout now some pretty sharp men sir they know especially to look out for a oneeyed man yes sir he has a curious deformity which he hides with a patch you know one of his eyes is halfblue halfbrown you dont say says i by george i hadnt realised our political arrangements were as ramshackle as this that captain skene is the man im here to kill so if any of your sharp men have the chance to save me the trouble they may do it with my blessing oh of course sir oh they will you know some of them says he impressively are pindari bandits or used to be that is but well know in good time sir before any of these ruski fellows get within distance i wished i could share his confidence calcutta has no notion what the russian spies were up to down here i asked him but he shook his head nothing definite at all only that theyd been here we were sure it must be connected with the chapattis going round but those have dried up lately none have passed since october and the sepoys of the th ni thats the regiment here you know seem perfectly quiet their colonel swears theyre loyal has done from the first and was quite offended that i reported the cakes to calcutta perhaps hes right ive had some of my men scouting the sepoy lines and they havent heard so much as a murmur and calcutta was to inform me if cakes passed at any other place but none have apparently come thinks i this is decidedly better pams been up a gumtree for nothing all i had to do was make a show of brief activity here and then loaf over to calcutta after a few weeks and report nothing doing give em a piece of my mind too for causing me so much inconvenience well skene says i this is how i see it theres nothing to be done about what the prime minister calls those blasted buns unless they make a reappearance what as to the russians well when we get word of them ill probably drop out of sight dyou see i would too to some convenient haven which the lord would provide and emerge when the coast was clear but i doubted it would even come to that yes you wont see me but ill be about never fear and if our oneeyed friend or any of his creatures shows face well he looked suitably impressed with a hint of that awe which my fearsome reputation inspires i understand sir youll wish to er work in your own way of course he blinked at me and then exclaimed reverently by jove i dont envy those ruski fellows above half if you dont mind my saying so sir skene old chap says i and winked at him neither do i and believe me he was my slave for life from that moment theres the other thing i went on the rani i have to try to talk some sense into her now i daresay there isnt much i can do since i gather shes shown you and erskine that shes not disposed to be friendly but im bound to try you see so ill be obliged to you if youll arrange an audience for me the day after tomorrow id like to rest and perhaps look around the city first for the present you can tell me your own opinion of her he frowned and filled my glass youll think its odd sir i daresay but in all the time ive been here ive never even seen her ive met her frequently at the palace but she speaks from behind a purdah you know and as often as not her chamberlain does the talking for her shes a stickler for form and since government granted her diplomatic immunity after her husband died as a sop really when we assumed suzerainty well it makes it difficult to deal with her satisfactorily she was friendly enough with erskine at one time but ive had no change out of her at all shes damned bitter you see when her husband died old raja gangadar he left no children of his own well he was an odd bird really and skene blushed furiously and avoided my eye used to go about in female dress most of the time and wore bangles and and perfume you see no wonder she was bitter says i no no what i mean is since he left no legitimate heir but only a boy whom hed adopted dalhousie wouldnt recognise the infant the new succession law you know so the state was annexed and the rani was furious and petitioned the queen and sent agents to london but it was no go the adopted son damodar was dispossessed and the rani whod hoped to be regent was deprived of her power officially between ourselves we let her rule pretty well as she pleases well we cant do otherwise can we weve one battalion of sepoys and thirty british civilians to run the state administration but shes the law where her people are concerned absolute as caesar doesnt that satisfy her then not a bit of it she detests the fact that officially she only holds power by the sirkars leave you see and shes still wild about the late rajas will youd think that with a quarter of a million in her treasury shed be content but there was some jewellery or other that calcutta confiscated and shes never forgiven us interesting lady says i dangerous dyou think he frowned politically yes given the chance shed pay our score off double quick thats why the chapatti business upset me shes got no army as such but with every man in jhansi a born fighter and robber she dont need one do she and theyll jump if she whistles for they worship the ground she treads on shes proud as lucifers sister and devilish hard not to say cruel in her own courts but shes uncommon kind to the poor folk and highly thought of for her piety spends five hours a day meditating although she was a wild piece they say when she was a girl they brought her up like a maharatta prince at the old peshwas court taught her to ride and shoot and fence with the best of them they say she still has the fiends own temper he added grinning but shes always been civil enough to me at a distance but make no mistake shes dangerous if you can sweeten her sir well all sleep a deal easier at nights there was that of course however withered an old trot she might be shed be an odd female if she was altogether impervious to flashys manly bearing and cavalry whiskers which was probably what pam had in mind in the first place cunning old devil still as i turned in that night i wasnt absolutely looking forward to poodlefaking her in two days time and as i glanced from my bungalow window and saw jhansi citadel beetling in the starlight i thought well take a nice little escort of lancers with us when we go to take tea with the lady so we will but that was denied me i had intended to pass the next day looking about the city perhaps having a discreet word with carshore the collector and the colonel of the sepoys but as the syce was bringing round my pony to the dakbungalow up comes skene in a flurry when hed sent word to the palace that colonel flashman a distinguished soldier of the sirkar was seeking an audience for the following day hed been told that distinguished visitors were expected to present themselves immediately as a token of proper respect to her highness and colonel flashman could shift his distinguished rump up to the palace forthwith i i thought in the circumstances of your visit says skene apologetically that you might think it best to comply you did did you says i does every briton in jhansi leap to attention when this beldam snaps her fingers then shall we say we find it convenient to humour her highness says he he was more of a political than he looked this lad so i blustered a bit to be in character and then said he might find me an escort of lancers to convoy me in im sorry sir says he we havent any lancers and if we had weve agreed not to send troop formations inside the city walls also since i was excluded from the er invitation i fear you must go alone what says i damnation who governs here the sirkar or this harridan i didnt fancy above half risking my hide unguarded in that unhealthylooking fortress but i had to cover it with dignity youve made a rod for your own backs by being too soft with this this woman shes not queen bess you know she thinks she is says he cheerfully so in the end of course i had to lump it but i changed into my lancer fig first sabre revolver and all for i could guess why she was ensuring that i visited her alone upcountry on the frontier they judge a man on his own looks but down here they go on the amount and richness of your retinue one mounted officer wasnt going to impress the natives with the sirkars power well then hed look his best and be damned to her so i figged up and when i regarded myself in skenes cracked mirror blue tunic and breeches gold belt and epaulettes white gauntlets and helmet wellbristled whiskers and flashys stalwart fourteen stone inside it all it wasnt half bad i took a couple of packages from my trunk stowed them in my saddlebag waved to skene and trotted off to meet royalty with only the syce to show me the way jhansi city lies about a couple of miles from the cantonment and i had plenty of time to take in the scenery the road which was welllined with temples and smaller buildings was crowded into the city with bullockcarts churning up the dust camels palankeens and hordes of travellers both mounted and on foot most of them were country folk on their way to the bazaars but every now and then would come an elephant with red and gold fringed howdah swaying along carrying some minor nabob or rich lady or a portly merchant on his mule with a string of porters behind and once the syce pointed out a group who he said were members of the ranis own bodyguard a dozen stalwart khyberie pathans of all things trotting along very military in double file with mail coats and red silk scarves wound round their spiked helmets the rani night not have a army but she wasnt short of force with those fellows about there was a hundred years company service among them if there was a day and her city defences were a sight to see massive walls twenty feet high and beyond them a warren of streets stretching for near a mile to the castle rock with its series of curtain walls and round towers it would be the deuce of a place to storm after youd fought through the city itself there were guns in the embrasures and mailclad spearmen on the walls all looking like business we had to force our horses through a crowded inferno of heat and smells and noise and jostling niggers to get to the palace which stood apart from the fort near a small lake with a shady park about it it was a fine foursquare building its outer walls beautifully decorated with huge paintings of battles and hunting scenes i presented myself to another pathan very splendid in steel backandbreast and longtail puggaree who commanded the gate guard and sat sweating in the scorching sun while he sent off a messenger for the chamberlain and as i chafed impatiently the pathan walked slowly round me eyeing me up and down and presently stopped stuck his thumbs in his belt and spat carefully on my shadow now close by the gate there happened to be a number of booths and sideshows set tip the usual things lemonadesellers a fakir with a plant growing through his palm sundry beggars and a kind of punchand judy show which was being watched by a group of ladies in a palankeen as a matter of fact theyd already taken my eye for they were obviously maharatta females of quality and four finer little trotters you never saw there was a very slim languidlooking beauty in a gold sari reclining in the palankeen another plump piece in scarlet trousers and jacket beside her and a third very black but fineboned as a swede with a pearl headdress that must have cost my years pay sitting in a kind of campchair alongside even the ladies maid standing beside the palankeen was a looker with great almond eyes and a figure inside her plain white sari like a hindoo temple goddess i was in the act of touching my hat to them when the pathan started expectorating at this the maid giggled the ladies looked and the pathan sniffed contemptuously and spat again well as a rule anyone can insult me and see how much it pays him especially if hes large and ugly and carrying a tulwar but for the credit of the sirkar and my own face in front of the women i had to do something so i looked the pathan up and down glanced away and said quietly in pushtu you would spit more carefully if you were still in the guides hubshi he opened his eyes at that and swore who calls me hubshi who says i was in the guides and what is it to thee feringhee pig you wear the old coat under your breastplate says i but belike you stole it from a dead guide for no man who had a right to that uniform would spit on bloody lances shadow that set him back on his heels bloody lance says he thou he came closer and stared up at me art thou that same iflassman who slew the four gilzais at mogala says i mildly it had caused a great stir at the time in the gilzai country and won me considerable fame along the kabul road in fact old mohammed iqbal had killed the four horsemen while i lit out for the undergrowth but nobody living knew that and obviously the legend endured for the pathan gaped and swore again and then came hastily to attention and threw me a barra salaam that would have passed at horse guards sher khan havildar lately of ismeet sahibs company of the guides as your honour says croaks he now shame on me and mine that i put dishonour on bloody lance and knew him not think not ill of me husoor for let the ill think ill says i easily the spittle of a durwan will not drown a soldier i was watching out of the corner of my eye to see how the ladies were taking this and noted with satisfaction that they were giggling at the pathans discomfiture boast to your children ghazi thatwasaguideandisnowaranis porter that you spat on bloody lance flassmans shadow and lived and i walked my horse past him into the courtyard well pleased it would be all round jhansi inside the hour it was a trifling enough incident and i forgot it with my first glance at the interior of the ranis palace outside it had been all dust and heat and din but here was the finest garden courtyard you ever saw a cool pleasant enclosure where little antelopes and peacocks strutted on the lawns parrots and monkeys chattered softly in the surrounding trees and a dazzling white fountain played there were shaded archways in the carved walls where welldressed folk whom i took to be her courtiers sat and talked waited on by bearers one of the richest thrones in india pam had said and i could believe it there were enough silks and jewellery on view there to stuff an army with loot the statuary was of the finest in marble and coloured stones that i took to be jade and even the pigeons that pecked at the spotless pavements had silver rings on their claws until youve seen it of course you cant imagine the luxury in which these indian princes keep themselves and there are folk at home wholl tell you that john company were the robbers i was kept waiting there a good hour before a majordomo came salaaming to lead me through the inner gate and up a narrow winding stair to the durbar room on the first storey here again all was richness splendid silk curtains on the walls great chandeliers of purple crystal hanging from the carved and gilded ceiling magnificent carpets on the floor and every kind of priceless ornament gold and ivory ebony and silverwork scattered about it would have been in damned bad taste if it hadnt all been so bloody expensive and the dozen or so men and women who lounged about on the couches and cushions were dressed to match the ones down in the courtyard must have been their poor relations handsome as hebe the women were too i was just running my eye over one alabaster beauty in tight scarlet trousers who was reclining on a shawl playing with a parakeet when a gong boomed somewhere everyone stood up and a fat little chap in a huge turban waddled in and announced that the durbar had begun at which music began to play and they all turned and bowed to the wall which i suddenly realised wasnt a wall at all but a colossal ivory screen fine as lace that cut the room in two through it you could just make out movement in the space beyond like shadows behind thick gauze this was the ranis purdah screen to keep out prying heathen eyes like mine i seemed to be first man in for the chamberlain led me to a little gilt stool a few feet from the screen and there i sat while he stood at one end of the screen and cried out my name rank decorations and my london clubs there was a murmur of voices beyond and then he asked me what i wanted or words to that effect i replied in urdu that i brought greetings from queen victoria and a gift for the rani from her majesty if she would graciously accept it i handed it over the chamberlain passed it through listened attentively and then asked me who the fat child in the picture was i told him he relayed the glad news and then announced that her highness was pleased to accept her sisterrulers gift the effect was spoiled a trifle by a clatter from behind the screen which suggested the picture had fallen on the floor but i just stroked my whiskers while the courtiers tittered behind me its hell in the diplomatic you know there was a further exchange of civilities through the chamberlain and then i asked for a private audience with the rani he replied that she never gave them i explained that what i had to say was of mutual but private interest to jhansi and the british government he looked behind the screen for instructions and then said hopefully does that mean you have proposals for the restoration of her highnesss throne the recognition of her adopted son and the restitution of her property all of which have been stolen from her by the sirkar well it didnt of course what i have to say is for her highness alone says i solemnly and he stuck his head round the screen and conferred before popping back there are such proposals says he and i said i could not talk in open durbar at which there were sounds of rapid female muttering from behind the screen the chamberlain asked what i could have to say that could not be said by captain skene and i said politely that i could tell that to the rani and no other he conferred again and i tried to picture the other side of the screen with the rani sharpfaced and thin in her silk shawl muttering her instructions to him and puzzled to myself what the odd persistent noise was that i could hear above the soft pipes of the hidden orchestra a gentle rhythmic swishing from beyond the screen as though a huge fan were being used and yet the room was cool and airy enough not to need one the chamberlain popped out again looking stem and said that her highness could see no reason for prolonging the interview if i had nothing new from the sirkar to impart to her i was permitted to withdraw so i got to my feet clicked my heels saluted the screen picked up the second package which i had brought thanked him and his mistress for their courtesy and did a smart aboutturn but i hadnt gone a yard before he stopped me the packet you carry says he what is that id been counting on this i told him it was my own but it is wrapped as the gift to her highness was wrapped says he surely it also is a present yes says i slowly it was he stared was summoned behind the screen and came out looking anxious then you may leave it behind says he i hesitated weighing the packet in my hand and shook my head no sir says i it was my own personal present to her highness but in my country we deliver such gifts face to face as honouring both giver and receiver by your leave and i bowed again to the screen and walked away wait wait cries he so i did the rhythmic sound from behind the screen had stopped now and the female voice was talking quietly again the chamberlain came out redfaced and to my astonishment he bustled everyone else from the room shooing the silken ladies and gentlemen like geese then he turned to me bowed indicated the screen and effaced himself through one of the archways leaving me alone with my present in my hand i listened a moment the swishing sound had started again i paused to give my whiskers a twirl stepped up to the end of the screen and rapped on it with my knuckles no reply so i said your highness but there was nothing except that damned swishing well here goes i thought this is what you came to india for and you must be civil and adoring for old pams sake i stepped round the screen and halted as though id walked into a wall it wasnt the gorgeouslycarved golden throne or the splendour of the furniture which outshone even what ld left or the unexpected sensation of walking on the shimmering chinese quilt on the floor nor was it the bewildering effect of the mirrored ceiling and walls with their brilliantlycoloured panels the astonishing thing was that from the ceiling there hung by silk ropes a great cushioned swing and sitting in it wafting gently to and fro was a girl the only soul in the room and such a girl my first impression was of great dark almond eyes in a skin the colour of milky coffee with a long straight nose above a firm red mouth and chin and hair as black as night that hung in a jewelled tail down her back she was dressed in a white silk bodice and sari which showed off the dusky satin of her bare arms and midriff and on her head was a little white jewelled cap from which a single pearl swung on her forehead above the castemark i stood and gaped while she swung to and fro at least three times and then she put a foot on the carpet and let the swing drag to a halt she considered me one smooth dusky arm up on the swing rope and then i recognised her she was the ladies maid who had been standing by the palankeen at the palace gate the ranis maid then the lady of the palankeen must be your mistress says i where is she mistress i have no mistress says she tilting up her chin and looking down her nose at me i am lakshmibai maharani of jhansi for a moment i didnt believe it i had become so used to picturing her over the past three months as a driedup old shrew with skinny limbs that i just stood and gaped and yet as i looked at her there couldnt be any doubt the richness of her clothes shouted royalty at you and the carriage of her head with its imperious dark eyes told you as nothing else could that here was a woman whod never asked permission in her life there was strength in every line of her too for all her femininity by george i couldnt remember when id seen bouncers like those thrusting like pumpkins against the muslin of her blouse which was open to the jewelled clasp at her breast bone if it hadnt been for a couple of discreetly embroidered flowers on either side there would have been nothing at all concealed i could only stand speechless before such queenly beauty wondering what it would be like to tear the muslin aside thrust your whiskers in between em and go brrrrr you have a gift to present says she speaking in a quick soft voice which had me recollecting myself and clicking my heels as i presented my packet she took it weighed it in her hand still halfreclining in her swing and asked sharply why do you stare at me so forgive me highness says i i did not expect to find a queen who looked so id been about to say young and lovely but changed it hurriedly for a less personal compliment so like a queen like that queen says she and indicated the picture of vicky and albert which was lying on a cushion each of your majesties says i with mountainous diplomacy looks like a queen in her own way she considered me gravely and then held the packet out to me you may open it i pulled off the wrapping opened the little box and took out the gift you may smile but it was a bottle of perfume you see flashy aint as green as he looks it may be coals to newcastle to take perfume to india but in my experience which isnt inconsiderable theres not a woman breathing who isnt touched by a gift of scent and it dont matter what age she is either and it was just the gift a blunt honest soldier would choose in his simplicity furthermore it was from paris and had cost the dirty old goat who presented it to elspeth a cool five sovs i handed it over with a little bow and she touched the stopper daintily on her wrist french says she and very costly are you a rich man colonel that took me aback i muttered something about not calling on a queen every day of my life and why have you called says she very cool what is there that you have to say that can be said only face to face i hesitated and she suddenly stood up in one lithe movement by jove they jumped like blancmanges in a gale come and tell me she went on and swept off out on to the terrace at that end of the room with a graceful swaying stride that stirred the seat of her sari in a most disturbing way she jingled as she walked like all rich indian females she seemed to affect as much jewellery as she could carry with bangles at wrist and ankle a diamond collar beneath her chin and even a tiny pearl cluster at one nostril i followed admiring the lines of the tall full figure and wondering for the umpteenth time what i should say to her now that the moment had come pam and mangles you see had given me no proper directions at all i was supposed to wheedle her into being a loyal little british subject but id no power to make concessions to any of her grievances and it wasnt going to be easy an unexpected stunner she might be and therefore all the easier for me to talk to but there was a directness about her that was daunting this was a queen and intelligent and experienced she wasnt going to be impressed by polite political chat so what must i say the devil with it thinks i theres nothing to lose by being as blunt as she is herself so when shed settled herself on a daybed and id forced myself to ignore that silky midriff and the shapely brown ankle peeping out of her sari i set my helmet on the ground and stood up foursquare your highness says i i cant talk like mr erskine or captain skene even im a soldier not a diplomat so i wont mince words and thereafter i minced them for all i was worth telling her of the distress there was in london about the coolness that existed between jhansi on the one hand and the company and sirkar on the other how this state of affairs had endured for four years to the disadvantage of all parties how it was disturbing the queen who felt a sisterly concern for the ruler of jhansi not only as a monarch but as a woman and so on i rehearsed jhansis grievances the willingness of the sirkar to repair them so far as was possible threw in the information that i came direct from lord palmerston and finished on a fine flourish with an appeal to her to open her heart to flashy plenipotentiary extraordinary so that we could all be friends and live happy ever after it was the greatest gammon but i gave it my best with noble compassion in my eye and a touch of ardour in the curl shaken down over my brow she heard me out not a muscle moving in that lovely face and then asked you have the power to make redress then to alter what has been done i said i had the power to report direct to pam and she said that so in effect had skene her agents in london had spoken direct to the board of control without avail well says i this is a little different highness dont you see his lordship felt that if i heard from you at ftorsthand so to speak and we talked there is nothing to talk about says she what can i say that has not been said that the sirkar does not know what can you i can ask maharaj what actions by the sirkar short of removing from jhansi and recognising your adopted son would satisfy your grievances or go some way to satisfying them she came up on one elbow at that frowning at me with those magnificent eyes for what i was hinting at without the least authority mind you was concessions and devil a smell of those shed had in four years why says she thoughtfully they know well enough they have been told my grievances my just demands for four years now and yet they have denied me how can repetition serve a disappointed client may find a new advocate says i with my most disarming smile and she gave me a long stare and then got up and walked over to the balustrade looking out across the city if your highness would speak your mind to me openly wait says she and stood for a moment frowning before she turned back to me she couldnt think what to make of this she was suspicious and didnt dare to hope and yet she was wondering god she was a black beauty sure enough if id been the sirkar she could have had jhansi and a pound of tea with it just for half an hour on the daybed if lord palmerston says she at last and old pam himself would have been tempted to restore her throne just to hear the pretty way she said lud pammerstan wishes me to restate the wrongs that have been done me it can only be because he has discovered some interest to serve by redressing them or promising redress i do not know what that interest is and you will not tell me it is no charitable desire to set right injustices done to my jhansi and she lifted her head proudly that is certain but if he wishes my friendship for whatever purpose of his own he may give an earnest of his good will by restoring the revenues which should have come to me since my husbands death but which the sirkar has confiscated she stopped there chin up challenging so i said and after that highness what else will he concede as much will the company i cant say says i but if a strong case can be made when i report to lord palmerston and you will put the case yourself that is my mission maharaj and such other cases as i may advance she looked the question and there was just a hint of a smile on her mouth so and i must first put them to you and no doubt you will suggest to me how they may best be phrased or modified you will advise and persuade well says i ill help your highness as i can to my astonishment she laughed with a flash of white teeth her head back and shaking most delightfully oh the subtlety of the british cries she such delicacy like an elephant in a swamp lord palmerston wishes for his own mysterious reasons of policy to placate the rani of jhansi so he invites her to repeat the petition which has been repeatedly denied for years but does he send a lawyer or an advocate or even an official of the company no just a simple soldier who will discuss the petition with her and how it may best be presented to his lordship could not a lawyer have advised her better she folded her hands and came slowly forward sauntering round me but how many lawyers are tall and broadshouldered and aye quite handsome and persuasive as flashman bahadur not a doubt but he is best fitted to convince a silly female that a modest claim is most likely to succeed and she will abate her demands for him poor foolish girl and be less inclined to insist on fine points and stand upon her rights is this not so highness you misunderstand entirely i assure you do i says she scornfully but laughing still i am not sixteen colonel i am an old lady of twentynine and i may not know lord palmerstons purpose but i understand his methods well well it may not have occurred to his lordship that even a poor indian lady may be persuasive in her turn and she eyed me with some amusement confident in her own beauty the damned minx and the effect it was having on me he paid me a poor compliment do you not think what could i do but grin back at her do his lordship justice highness says i hed never seen you how many have since you are purdahnishin enough to have told him what i am like i should have hoped how did he instruct you humour her whatever she is fair or foul young and silly or old and ugly charm her so that she keeps her demands cheap captivate her as only a hero can she stirred an eyebrow who could resist the champion who killed the four gilzais where was it at mogala in afghanistan as your highness heard at the gate was it to test me that you had the pathan spit on my shadow his insolence needed no instruction says she he is now being flogged for it she turned away from me and sauntered back into the durbarroom you may have the tongue which insulted you torn out if you wish she added over her shoulder that brought me up sharp i can tell you wed been rallying away famously and id all but forgotten who and what she was an indian prince with all the capricious cruelty of her kind under that lovely hide unless she was just mocking me with the reminder whether or no i would play my character not necessary highness says i i had forgotten him she nodded and struck a little silver gong with her wristbangle it is time for my noon meal and this afternoon i hold my court you may return tomorrow and we shall discuss the representations you are to make to the subtle lord palmerston she smiled slightly in dismissal and i thank you for your gift colonel her maids were coming in and the little fat chamberlain so i made my bow maharaj says i your most humble obedient she inclined her head regally and turned away but as i backed out round the screen i noticed that she had picked up my perfumebottle from the table and was inviting her maids to have a sniff at it i came away from that audience thinking no small diplomatic beer of myself at least i seemed to have got further with her than any other representative of the sirkar had ever done even if id had to lie truth out of jhansi to do it god knew id not the slightest right to promise redress of any of her grievances against the raj and if i trotted back a list of them to london the board would turn em down flat again no question but she didnt know that and if i could jolly her along for a week for two hinting at this or that possible concession she might grow more friendly disposed which was what pam wanted after all her hopes would revive and while they were sure to be dashed in the end id be back snug in england by then that was the official aspect of course the important thing was the delightful surprise that the old beldam of jhansi was as prime a goer as ever wriggled a hip and just ripe for my kind of diplomacy she was a cocky bitch with a fine sense of her queenly consequence but i wasnt fooled by her airs or the setdown shed tried to give me by warning me not to try to come round her with whiskery blandishments that was pure flirtation to put me on my mettle i know these beauties you see and it dont matter whether theyre queens or commoners when they start to play the cool mocking grand dame its a sure sign that theyre wondering what kind of a mount youll make id seen the glint in this ones eye when she walked round me and thought quietly to myself well have you gasping for more my girl before this fortnights out you may think me a presumptuous ambassador on short notice especially since the object of my carnal ambitions was royal clever dangerously powerful and a highcaste hindoo lady of reputed purity to boot but that means nothing when a woman fancies a buck like me besides i knew about these highborn indian wenches randy as ferrets the lot of them and with all the opportunity to gratify it too a woman with a shape and face like lakshmibais hadnt let it go to waste in four years widowhood not with the stallions of her palace guard available at the crook of her little finger well id make a rare change of bedding for her and if her lusty inclinations needed any prompting she might find it in the thought that being amiable to ambassador flashy was the likeliest way of getting what she wanted for herself and her state dulce et decorum est pro patria rogeri she could say to herself and i cantered back to the cantonments full of cheery thoughts imagining what that voluptuous tawny body would look like when i peeled the sari off it and speculating on the novel uses to which the pair of us could put that swing of hers in the interests of diplomatic relations in the meantime i had pams other business to attend to so i spent the afternoon in the native infantry lines looking at the company sepoys to gauge for myself what their temper was i did it idly enough for they seemed a properly smart and docile lot and yet it was a momentous visit for it led to an encounter that was to save my life and set me on one of the queerest and most terrifying adventures of my career and perhaps shaped the destiny of british india too i had just finished chatting to a group of the jawans and telling em that in my view theyd never be called on to serve overseas in spite of the new act when the officer with me fellow called turnbull asked me if id like to look at the irregular horse troop who had their stables close by being a cavalryman i said yes and a fine mixed bunch they were too punjabis and frontiersmen mostly big strapping ruffians with oiled whiskers and their shirts inside their breeches laughing and joking as they worked on their leather and as different from the smoothfaced infantry as cheyennes are from hottentots i was having a good crack with them for these were the kind of scoundrels with whom id ridden in my afghan days when their rissaldar came up and at the sight of me he stopped dead in the stable door gaping as though he couldnt believe his eyes he was a huge bearded ghazi of a fellow afghan for certain by the devils face of him id have said gilzai or dourani with a skull cap on the back of his head and the old yellow coat of skinners riders over his shoulders jehannum says he and stared again and then stuck his hands on his hips and roared with laughter salaam rissaldar says i what do you want with me a sight of thy left wrist bloody lance says he grinning like a deaths head is there not a scar there to match this and he pulled up his sleeve while i stared in disbelief at the little puckered mark for the man who bore it should have been dead fifteen years ago and hed been a mere slip of a gilzai boy when it had been made with his bleeding forearm against mine and his mad father sher afzul doing the honours and howling to heaven that his sons life was pledged eternally to the service of the white queen ilderim says i flabbergasted ilderim khan of mogala and then he flung his arms round me roaring and danced me about while the sowars grinned and nudged each other flashman he pounded my back how many years since ye took me for the sirkar stand still old friend and let me see thee bismillah thou hast grown high and heavy in the service such a barra sahib and a colonel too now praise god for the sight of thee and then he was showing me off to his fellows telling them how wed met in the old kabul days when his father had held the passes south and how id killed the four gilzais and hed been pledged to me as a hostage and wed lost sight of each other in the great retreat its all there in my earlier memoirs and pretty gruesome too even if it was the basis of my glorious career so now it was speech day with a vengeance while we relieved old memories and slapped each other on the shoulder for half an hour or so and then he asked me what i was doing here and i answered vaguely that i was on a mission to the rani but soon to go home again and at this he looked at me shrewdly but said nothing more until i was leaving it will be palitikal beyond doubt says he do not tell me listen instead to a friends word if ye speak with the rani be wary of her she is a hindoo woman and knows too much for a womans good what dyou know about her says i little enough says he except that she is like the silver krait in that she is beautiful and cunning and loves to bite the sahibs the company have made a cutchrani of her flashman but she still has fangs this he added bitterly comes of soft government in calcutta by ducks and mulls who have been too long in the heat so beware of her and go with god old friend and remember while thou art in jhansi ilderim is thy shadow or if not me then these loosewallahs and jangliadmis of mine they have their uses and he jerked a thumb towards his troopers that coming from an afghan upper roger who was also a friend was the best kind of insurance policy you could wish not that i now had any fears fool that i was about my stay in jhansi as to what hed said of the rani well i knew it already and afghans views on women are invariably sour beastly brutes anyway i didnt doubt my ability to handle lakshmibai in every sense of the word still i found his simile coming to mind next day when i attended her durbar again and watched her sitting enthroned to hear petitions dressed in a clothofsilver sari that fitted her like a skin with a silverembroidered shawl framing that fine dark face when she moved it was for all the world like a great gleaming snake stirring she was very grave and queenly and her courtiers and suppliants fairly grovelled and scuttled about if she raised her pinky when the last petitioner had been heard and a gong had boomed to end the durbar she sat with her chin in the air while the mob bowed itself out backwards leaving only me and her two chief councillors standing there and then she slipped out of her throne with a little cry of relief hissed at one of her pet monkeys and chased it out on to the terrace clapping her hands in mock anger and then returned perfectly composed to lounge on her swing now we can talk says she and while my vakeel reads out the matter of my petition you may refresh yourself colonel and she indicated a little table with flasks and cups on it ah and see she added flicking a flimsy little handkerchief from her sari i am wearing french perfume today do you care for it my lady vashki thinks i am no better than an infidel it was my perfume right enough i bowed acknowledgement while she smiled and settled herself and the vakeel began to drone out her petition in formal persian its worth repeating perhaps for it was a fair sample of the objections that many indian princes had to british rule the demand for restoration of her husbands revenues compensation for the slaughter of sacred cows reappointment of court hangerson dismissed by the sirkar restitution of confiscated temple funds recognition of her authority as regent and the like all a waste of time had she but known it but splendid stuff for me to talk to her about over the next week or two while i pursued the really important work of charming her into a recumbent position i had no doubt she was willing enough for me to make the running there she was wearing my scent and letting me know it and she was as pleasant as pie in her cool way at that meeting nodding graciously as i talked to her wise men about the petition smiling if i ventured a joke inviting them to admire my reasoning even asking my advice occasionally and always considering me languidly with those dark slanting eyes as i talked all of which might have seemed suspiciously amiable after her frankness at our first encounter but since then shed had time to weigh the political advantages of being pleasant to me and was setting out to make me enjoy my work but i knew politics wasnt the half of it i know when a womans got that little flutter in her midriff about me and in our ensuing meetings i could watch her enjoying using her beauty on me and she could do that with a touch that montez might have envied ill admit it now i found her enchanting she had the advantage of being a queen of course which makes a beauty all the more tantalising well even i on short acquaintance could hardly have taken her belly in one hand her bum in the other and fondled her flat on her back with passionate murmurs as one would do in ordinary circumstances no with royalty you have to wait a little not that i wasnt tempted in those early talks when she had dismissed her councillors and we were alone and just once or twice from the warm gleam in her eye as she swayed on her swing or lay on her daybed i wondered if perhaps but i decided to make haste slowly and play the bowling as it came down it came mighty fast too sometimes for if she was generally content just to politick flirtatiously i soon discovered that she could be dead serious when jhansi and her own ambitions were concerned let the talk turn that way and you saw the passion of her feeling five years ago how many beggars were on the streets she rounded on me once one for every ten today and who has accomplished this who but the sirkar by assuming the affairs of the state so that one white sahib comes to do the work that employed a dozen of our people who must be turned out to starve who guards the state why the company soldiers so jhansis army must be disbanded and they too can shift or steal or go hungry well now highness says i its hard to blame the sirkar for being efficient and as for your unemployed soldiers theyll be more than welcome in the company service in a foreign army and will there be room in its ranks too for the indian craftsmen whom the sirkars efficiency has put out of work for the traders whose commerce has decayed under the benevolent rule of the raj you must give us a little time maharaj says i humouring her and it aint all bad you know banditry has ceased the poor folk are safe from dacoits and thugs why your own throne is secure against greedy neighbours like kathe khan and the dewan of orcha my throne is safe says she stopping the swing on which she had been swaying and lifting her brows at me oh very safe for the sirkar to enjoy its revenues and usurp my place and disinherit my son ha as to kathe khan and that jackal of orcha whom the company in their wisdom allow to live if i ruled this state and had my soldiers kathe khan and his fellowviper would come against me once she picked up a fruit from the tray at her elbow considered it and nibbled daintily and crawl home again without their hands and feet no doubt maam says i but the fact is that when jhansi ruled itself it couldnt deal with these foes nor were the thugs put down oh aye we hear much of them and how the company suppressed their wickedness and why because they slew travellers or was it because they served a hindoo god and so offended the christian company she eyed me contemptuously belike had the thugs been jesusworshippers they would have been roaming yet especially if they had chosen hindoo victims you cant argue with gross prejudice so i just looked amiable and said and doubtless had suttee that fine old hindoo custom whereby widows were tortured to death been a christian practice we would have encouraged it but in our ignorance and spite we forbade it along with the law which condemned those widows who had escaped burning to a life of slavery and degradation with their heads shaved and heaven knows what else come maharaj can we do nothing right and without thinking i added id have thought your highness as a widow would have cause to thank the sirkar for that at least as soon as the words were out i saw id put my foot in it the swing stopped abruptly and she sat upright with a face like a mask staring at me i says she i thank the sirkar and she suddenly flung her fruit across the room and stood upright blazing at me you dare to suggest that well i could grovel or face it out but i dont hold with grovelling to pretty women not unless the dangers desperate or im short of cash so i started to hum and haw placatingly while she snapped in a voice like ice i owe the company nothing if the company had never been do you think i would have submitted to suttee or allowed myself to be made a menial do you take me for a fool by god no maam says i hastily anything but and if ive offended i beg your pardon i simply thought that the law was binding on all ah ladies you see and the maharani makes the law says she all good queen bess damning the dagoes and i hurriedly cried thank heaven for that at which she looked down her nose at me that is not the view of your company or your country why should you be different why should you care that was my cue of course i hesitated a second and then looked at her very frank and manly because ive seen your highness says i quietly and well i do care a great deal you see i stopped there giving her my steadiest smile with a touch of ardent admiration thrown in and after a long moment her stare softened and she even smiled as she sat down again and said shall we return to the confiscated temple funds altogether it was a rum game in those first few days rum for her because she was a fair natural tyrant yet whenever a disagreement in our discussions arose she would allow it to smooth over with that warm mysterious smile and rum for me because here i was day after day closeted with this choice piece of rump and not so much as touching her let alone squeezing and grappling but i had to bide my time and since she took such obvious and natural pleasure in my company i contained my horniness for the moment in the interests of diplomacy in the meantime i occasionally paid attention to the other side of pams business talking with skene and carshore the collector and reassuring myself that all continued to go well among the sepoys there wasnt a hint of agitation now my earlier fears about ignatieff and his scoundrels were beginning to seem like a distant nightmare and now that i was so well established in the ranis good graces the last cloud over my mission appeared to have been dispelled laughable you may think when you recollect that this was drawing to a close you will ask how i and the others could have been so blind to the fact that we were living on the very edge of hell but if youd been there what would you have seen a peaceful native state ruled by a charming young woman whose grievances were petty enough and who gave most of her time to seducing the affections of a dashing british colonel a contented native soldiery and a tranquil happy british cantonment i was about it a great deal and allour people were so placid and at ease i remember a dinner at carshores bungalow with his family and skene and his pretty little wife so nervous and pleased in her new pink gown and jolly old dr mcegan with his fund of irish stories and the garrison men with their red jackets slung on the backs of their chairs matching their smiling red faces and their gossipy wives and myself raising a laugh by coaxing one of the wilton girls to eat a country captain with the promise that it would make her hair curl when she grew older it was all so comfy and easy it might have been a dinnerparty at home except for the black faces and gleaming eyes of the bearers standing silent against the chickscreens and the big moths fluttering round the lamps afterwards there was a silly card game and truth or consequences and local scandal and talk of leave and gameshooting with our cheroots and port on the verandah trivial enough memories when you think what happened to all of them i can still feel the younger wilton chit pulling at my arm and crying oh colonel flashman papa says if i ask you ever so nicely you will sing us the galloping major will you please oh please do and see those shining eyes and the ringlets as she tugged me to where her sister was sitting at the piano we couldnt see ahead then and life was pleasant especially for me with my diplomatic duties to attend to and they became more enjoyable by the hour ill say that for rani lakshmibai she knew how to make business a pleasure much of the time we didnt talk in the palace at all she was as skene had told me a fine horsewoman and loved nothing better than to put on her jodhpurs and turban with two little silver pistols in her sash and gallop on the maidan or go hawking along a wooded river not far from the city there was a charming little pavilion there of about a dozen rooms on two storeys hidden among the trees and once or twice i was taken on picnics with a few of her courtiers and attendants at other times we would talk in the palace garden among the scores of pet beasts and birds which she kept and once she had me into one of her henparties in the durbar room at which she entertained all the leading ladies of jhansi to tea and cakes and i found myself called on to discourse on european fashions to about fifty giggling indian females in saris and bangles and kohldark eyes excellent fun too although the questions they asked about crinolines and panniers would have made a sailor blush but her great delight was to be out of doors riding or playing with her adopted son damodar a gravefaced imp of eight or inspecting her guards at field exercise she even watched their wrestlingmatches in the courtyard and a racemeeting in which some of our garrison officers took part i was intrigued to see that on this occasion she wore a purdah veil and an enveloping robe for about the palace she went barefaced and pretty barebodied too and if she could be as formal as a stockbroker with a newbought peerage she had a delightful way with the ordinary folk she was never so gay and happy as when she held a party for children from the city in her garden letting them run among the birds and monkeys and at one of her almsgivings i saw her quite concerned as her treasurer scattered coins among the mob of hideous and stinking beggars clamouring at her gate not at all like a rani sometimes she was a queer mixture of schoolgirl and sophisticated woman all scatter one moment all languor and dignity the next damned unpredictable oh and captivating there were times when even i found myself regarding her with an interest that wasnt more than fourfifths lustful and that aint like me it was directly after that almsgiving when we rode out to her pavilion among the trees and i had just remarked that what was needed for india was a poor law and a few parish workuses that she suddenly turned in her saddle and burst out can you not see that that is not our way that none of our ways are your ways you talk of your reforms and the benefits of british law and the sirkars rule and never think that what seems ideal to you may not suit others that we have our own customs which you think strange and foolish and perhaps they are but they are ours our own you come in your strength and your certainty with your cold eyes and pale faces like like machines marching out of your northern ice and you will have everything in order tramping in step like your soldiers whether those you conquer and civilise as you call it whether they will or no do you not see that it is better to leave people be to let them alone she wasnt a bit angry or id have agreed straight off but she was as intense as id known her and the great dark eyes were almost appealing which was most unusual i said that all id meant was that instead of thousands going sick and ragged and hungry about her city it might be better to have some system of relief come cheaper on her too if they had the beggars picking yarn or mending roads for their dole you talk of a system says she striking her riding crop on the saddle we do not care for systems oh we admire and respect those which you show us but we do not want them we would not choose them for ourselves you remember we spoke of how twelve indian babus did the work of one white clerk well thats waste maam says i respectfully theres no point wasteful or not does it matter if people are happy says she impatiently where lies the virtue of your boasted progress your telegraphs your railway trains when we are content with our sandals and our oxcarts i could have pointed out that the price of her sandals would have kept a hundred jhansi coolie families all their lives and that shed never been within ten yards of an oxcart but i was tactful we cant help it maharaj says i we have to do the best we can dont you know as we see it and it aint just telegraphs and trains though youll find those useful enough in time why im told there are to be universities and hospitals to teach philosophies that we do not want and sciences that we do not need and a law that is foreign to us which our people cannot understand well that doesnt leave em far behind the average englishman says i but its fair law and with respect thats more than you can say for most of your indian courts look now when there was a brawl in the street outside your palace two days since what happened your guards didnt catch the culprits so they laid hands on the first poor soul they met haled him into your divan guilty or not and you have him hanging by his thumbs and sundrying at the scene of the crime for two solid days fellow near died of it and hed done nothing i ask you maam is that justice he was a badmash and well known says she wideeyed would you have let him go for that offence yes since he was innocent of it we punish only the guilty and if you cannot find them is there to be no example made there will be no more brawls outside the palace i think and seeing my look she went on i know it is not your way and it seems unfair and even barbarous to you but we understand it should that not be enough you find it strange like our religions and our forbidden things and our customs but can your sirkar not see that they are as precious to us as yours are to you why is it not enough to your company to drive its profit why this greed to order peoples lives it isnt greed highness says i but you cant drive trade on a battlefield now can you there has to be peace and order surely and you cant have em withoutwell a strong hand and a law thats fair for all or for most people anyway i knew she wouldnt take kindly if i said the law was as much for her as for her subjects and when we make mistakes well we try to put em right you see which is what im here for to see that justice our justice if you like is done to you do you think that is all that matters says she we had stopped in the pavilion garden and the horses were cropping while her attendants waited out of earshot she was looking at me frowning and her eyes were very bright do you think it is the revenues and the jewels even my sons rights do you think that is all i care for these are the things that can be redressed but what of the things that cannot what of this life this land this country that you will change as you change everything you touch today it is still bright but you will make it grey today it is still free oh and no doubt wrong and savage by your lights and you will make it tame and orderly and bleak and the people will forget what they once were that is what you will do and that is why i resist as best i can as you and lord palmerston would tell him says she and by george her voice was shaking but the pretty mouth was set and hard when you go home that whatever happens i will not give up my jhansi mera jhansi denge nay i will not give up my jhansi i was astonished id never been in doubt that under the delectable feminine surface there was a tigress of sorts but i hadnt thought it was such a passionately sentimental animal dyou know for a moment i was almost moved she seemed such a damned spunky little woman i felt like saying there there or stroking her hand or squeezing her tits or something and then she had taken a breath and sat upright in the saddle as though recovering herself and she looked so damned royal and so damned lovely that i couldnt help myself maharaj you dont need me to say it go to london yourself and tell lord palmerston and i swear hell not only give you jhansi but bombay and hackney wick as well and i meant it shed have been a sensation had em eating out of her dusky little palm see the queen herself why dont you she stared thoughtfully ahead for a moment and then murmured under her breath the queen god save the queen what strange people you british are dont you worry about the british says i theyll sing god save the queen all right and theyll be thinking of the queen of jhansi now that is disloyal colonel says she and the languid smile was back in her eyes as she turned her horse and trotted off with me following now you may be thinking to yourself whats come over old flash he aint going soft on this female surely well you know i think the truth is that i was a bit soft on all my girls lola and cassie and valla and ko dalis daughter and susie the bawd and takesawaycloudswoman and the rest of em dont mistake me it was always the meat that mattered but i had a fair affection for them at the same time every now and then weather permitting you cant help it feeling randy is a damned romantic business and its my belief that galahad was a bigger beast in bed than ever lancelot was thats by the way but worth remembering if you are to understand about me and lakshmibai and ive told you a good deal about her on purpose because she was such a mysterious contrary female that i cant hope to explain her but must just leave you to judge for yourselves from what ive written and from what was to follow for on the morning after that talk at the pavilion two weeks to the day since id arrived in jhansi things began to happen in earnest to me at any rate i sensed there was something up as soon as i presented myself in the durbar room she was perfectly pleasant vivacious even as she told me about some new huntingcheetah shed been given but her vakeel and chief minister werent meeting her eye and her foot was taptapping under the edge of her gold sari ah thinks i someones been getting the sharp side of missys tongue she didnt have much mind to business either and once or twice i caught her eyeing me almost warily when she would smile quickly with anyone else i would have said it was nervousness finally she cut the discussion off abruptly saying enough for today and we would watch the guardsmen fencing in the courtyard even there i noticed her finger tapping on the balcony as we looked down at the pathans sabring away damned active dangerous lads they looked too but in a little while she began to take notice talking about the swordplay and applauding the hits and then she glanced sidelong at me and says do you fence as well as you ride colonel i said pretty fair and she gave me her lazy smile and says then we shall try a bout and blow me if she didnt order a couple of foils up to the durbar room and go off to change into her jodhpurs and blouse i waited wondering of course skene had said shed been brought up with boys and could handle arms with the best of them but it seemed deuced odd and then she was back ordering her attendants away tying up her hair in a silk scarf and ordering me on guard very businesslike theyll never believe this at home thinks i but i obeyed indulgently enough and she touched me three times in the first minute so i settled down in earnest and in the next minute she hit me only once laughing and told me to try harder that nettled me i confess i wasnt having this royalty or not so i went to work im a strong swordsman but not too academic and i pushed her for all i was worth she was bettermuscled than she looked though and fast as a cat and i had to labour to make her break ground gasping with laughter until her back was against one of the glass walls she took to the point holding me off and then unaccountably her guard seemed to falter i jumped in with the old heavy cavalry trick punching my hilt against the forte of her blade her foil spun out of her hand and for a moment we were breast to breast with me panting within inches of that dusky face and open laughing mouth the great dark eyes were wide and waiting and then my foil was clattering on the floor and i had her in my arms crushing my lips on hers and tasting the sweetness of her tongue with that soft body pressed against me revelling in the feel and fragrance of her i felt her hands slip up my back to my head holding my face against hers for a long delicious moment and then she drew her lips away sighing opened her eyes and said how well do you shoot colonel and then she had slipped from my arms and was walking quickly towards the door to her private room with me grunting endearments in pursuit but as i came after her she just raised a hand without turning or breaking stride and said firmly the durbar is finished for the moment the door closed behind her and i was left with the fallen foils panting like a bull before business but thinking my boy were home the damned little teaser i hesitated wondering whether to invade her boudoir when the little chamberlain came pottering in eyeing the foils in astonishment so i took my leave and presently was riding back to the cantonment full of buck and anticipation id known shed call play in the end and now there was nothing to do but enjoy the game that was why shed been jumpy earlier of course wondering how best to bring me to the boil the cunning minx how well do you shoot forsooth shed find out soon enough when we finished the durbar tomorrow no doubt so by way of celebration i drank a sight more bubbly than was good for me at dinner and even took a magnum back to my bungalow for luck it was as well i did for about ten ilderim dropped by for a prose as hed taken to doing and theres nobody thirstier than a dry gilzai if you think all muslims abstain i can tell you of one who didnt so we popped the cork and gassed about the old days and smoked and i was enjoying myself with carnal thoughts about my lucky lakshmibai and thinking about turning in when there came a scraping on the chick at the back of the bungalow and the khitmagar appeared to tell me that there was a bibi who insisted on seeing me ilderim grinned and wagged his ugly head and i cursed thinking here was some bazaar houri plying her trade where it was least wanted but i staggered out and sure enough at the foot of the steps was a veiled woman in a sari but with a burlylooking escort standing farther back at the gate she didnt look like a slut somehow and when i asked what she wanted she came quickly up the steps salaamed and held out a little leather pouch i took it wondering inside there was a handkerchief and even through the champagne fumes there was no mistaking it was heavy with my perfume from my mistress says the woman as i goggled at it by god says i and sniffed it again who the blazes name no names says she and it was a wellspoken voice for a hindoo my mistress sends it and bids you come to the river pavilion in an hour and with that she salaamed again and slipped down the steps i called after her and took an unsteady step but she didnt stop and she and her escort vanished in the dark well im damned thinks i surprise giving way to delight she couldnt wait by heaven and of course the river pavilion at night was just the place far better than the palace where all sorts of folk were prying nice and secluded very discreet just the place for a rowdy little rani to entertain syce i shouted and strode back inside a trifle unsteadily damning the champagne but chortling as i examined my chin in the glass decided it would do and roared for a clean shirt now where away says ilderim who was squatting on the rug not after some trollop from the bazaar at this time no brother says i something much better than a trollop if you could see this one youd forswear small boys and melons for good by jove i was feeling prime i dandied myself up in no time rinsed my face to clear some of the booze away and was out champing on the verandah as the syce brought my pony round youre mad growls ilderim do you go alone where to im not sharing her if thats what you mean ill take the syce for i wasnt too sure of the way at night and it was pitch black i must have been drunker than i felt for it took me three shots to mount and then with a wave to ilderim who was glowering doubtfully from the verandah i trotted off with the syce scrambling up behind now ill admit i was woozy and say at the same time that id have gone if id been cold sober i dont know when ive been pawing the ground quite so hard for a woman probably the two weeks spooning had worked me up and i couldnt cover the two miles to the pavilion fast enough fortunately the syce was a handy lad for he not only guided us but held me from tumbling out of the saddle i dont remember much of the journey except that it lasted for ages and then we were among trees with the hooves padding on grass the syce was shaking my arm and there ahead was the pavilion halfhidden by the foliage i didnt want the syce spying so i slid down and told him to wait and then i pushed on in spite of the night air the booze seemed to have increased its grip but i navigated well enough leaning on a trunk every now and then i surveyed the pavilion there were dim lights on the ground floor and in one room upstairs and by george there was even the sound of music on the slight breeze i beamed into the dark what these indians dont know about the refinements of romping isnt worth knowing an orchestra underneath privacy and soft lights upstairs and no doubt refreshments to boot i rubbed my face and hurried forward through the garden to the outside staircase leading to the upper rooms staggering quietly so as not to disturb the hidden musicians who were fluting sweetly away behind the screens i mounted the staircase holding on tight and reached the little landing there was a small passage and a slatted door at the end with light filtering through it i paused to struggle out of my loose trousers at least i wasnt so tight that id been fool enough to come out in boots took a great lusty breath padded unsteadily forward and felt the door give at my touch the air was heavy with perfume as i stepped in stumbled into a muslin curtain swore softly as i disentangled myself took hold of a wooden pillar for support and gazed round into the halfgloom there were dim pink lamps burning on the floor against the walls giving just enough light to show the broad couch shrouded in mosquito net against the far wall and there she was silhouetted against the glow sitting back among the cushions one leg stretched out the other with knee raised there was a soft tinkle of bangles and i leaned against my pillar and croaked lakshmibai lucky its me darling chabeli im here she turned her head and then in one movement raised the net and slipped out standing motionless by the couch like a bronze statue she was wearing bangles all right and a little gold girdle round her hips and some kind of metal headdress from which a flimsy veil descended from just beneath her eyes to her chin not another stitch i let out an astonishing noise and was trying to steady myself for a plunge but she checked me with a lifted hand slid one foot forward crooked her arms like a nautchdancer and came gliding slowly towards me swaying that splendid golden nakedness in time to the throbbing of the music beneath our feet i could only gape whether it was the drink or admiration or what i dont know but i seemed paralysed in every limb but one she came writhing up to me bangles tinkling and dark eyes gleaming enormously in the soft light i couldnt see her face for the veil but i wasnt trying to she retreated turning and swaying her rump and then approached again reaching forward to brush me teasingly with her fingertips i grabbed gasping but she slid away faster now as the tempo of the music increased and then back again hissing at me through the veil lifting those splendid breasts in her hands and this time i had the wit to seize a tit and a buttock fairly hooting with lust as she writhed against me and lifted the veil just enough to bring her mouth up to mine her right foot was slipping up the outside of my left leg past the knee up to the hip and round so that her heel was in the small of my back god knows how they do it double joints or something and then she was thrusting up and down like a demented monkey on a stick raking me with her nails and giving little shrieks into my mouth until the torchlight procession which was marching through my loins suddenly exploded she went limp in my arms and i thought oh lord now iettest thou thy servant depart in peace as i slid gently to the floor in ecstatic exhaustion with that delightful burden clinging and quivering on top of me the instructors who taught dancing to young indian royalty in those days must have been uncommon sturdy she had just about done for me but somehow i must have managed to crawl to the couch for the next i knew i was there with my face cradled against those wonderful perfumed boobies i tried feebly to go brrr but she turned my head and lifted a cup to my lips as if i hadnt enough on board already but i drank greedily and sank back gasping and was just deciding i might live after all when she set about me again lips and hands questing over my body fondling and plaguing writhing her hips across my groaning carcase until she was astride my thighs with her back to me and the torchlight procession staggered into marching order once more eventually erupting yet again with shattering effect after which she left me in peace for a good halfhour as near as i could judge in my intoxicated state one thing im certain of that if id been sober and in my right mind she could never have teased me into action a third time as she did by doing incredible things which i still only halfbelieve as i recall them but i remember those great eyes over the veil and the pearl on her brow and her perfume and the tawny velvet skin in the halflight i came awake in an icy sweat my limbs shivering trying to remember where i was there was a cold wind from somewhere out in the dark and i turned my aching head the pink lamps were burning casting their shadows but she was no longer there someone was though surely over by the door there was a dark figure but it wasnt naked for i could see a white loincloth and instead of the gold headdress there was a tight white turban a man and he was holding something a stick no it had a strange curved head on it and there was another man just behind him and even as i watched they were gliding stealthily into the room and i saw that the second one had a cloth in his right hand for perhaps ten seconds i lay motionless gazing and then it rushed in on me that this wasnt a dream that they were moving towards the couch and that this was horrible inexplicable danger the net was gone from the couch and i could see them clearly the white eyes in the black faces i braced for an instant and then hurled myself off the couch away from them slipped recovered and rushed at the shutters in the screenwall there was a snarl from behind me something swished in the air and thudded and i had a glimpse of a small pickaxe quivering in the shutter as i flung myself headlong at the screen yelling in terror thank god im fourteen stone it came down with a splintering crash and i was sprawling on the little verandah thrashing my way out of the splintered tangle and heaving myself on to the verandah rail from the tail of my eye i saw a dark shape springing for me over the couch there was a tree spreading its thick foliage within five feet of the verandah and i dived straight into it crashing and scraping through the branches clutching vainly and taking a tremendous thump across the hips as i struck a limb for a second i seemed suspended and then i shot down and landed flat on my back with a shock that sickened me i rolled over trying to heave myself up as two black figures dropped from the tree almost on top of me i blundered into one of them smashed a fist into its face and then something flicked in front of my eyes and i only just got a hand up in time to catch the garotte as it jerked back on to my throat i shrieked hauling at it my wrist was clamped under my chin by the stranglers scarf but my right arm was free and as i staggered back into him i scrabbled behind me was fortunate enough to grab a handful of essentials and wrenched for all i was worth he screamed in agony the scarf slackened and he went down but before i could flee for the safety of the wood the other one was on my back and he made no mistake the scarf whipped round my windpipe his knee was into my spine and i was flailing helplessly with his breath hissing in my ear five seconds it hashed across my mind is all it takes for an expert garotter to kill a man oh jesus my sight was going my head was coming off with a horrible pain tearing in my throat i was dying even as i fell floating down to the turf and then i was on my back gasping down huge gulps of air and the faces that were swimming in front of my eyes glaring horribly were merging into one ilderim khan was gripping my shoulders and urging flashman be still there now lie a moment and breathe inshallah the stranglers touch is no light thing his strong fingers were massaging my throat as he grinned down at me see what comes of lusting after loose women a moment more and we would have been sounding retreat over thee so give thanks that i have a suspicious mind and followed with my badmashes to see what kind of cunchunee it was who bade thee to her bed so mysteriously how is it old friend can you stand what happened i mumbled trying to rise ask why rather has she a jealous husband perhaps we saw the lights and heard music but presently all was still and many came out to a palankeen in which ladies travel and so away but no sign of thee till we heard thee burst out with these hounds of hell behind thee and following his nod i saw there were two of his ruffians squatting in the shadows over two dark shapes lying on the grass one was ominously still but the other was gasping and wheezing and from the way he clutched himself i imagine he was the assassin whose courtingtackle id tried to rearrange one of ilderims sowars was ostentatiously cleaning his khyber knife with a handful of leaves and presently a third came padding out of the dark the sahibs syce is dead yonder says he bitten with a tooth from kalis mouth what says ilderim starting up now in gods name and he went quickly to the body of the dead strangler snatching a lantern from one of his men and peering into the dead face i heard him exclaim and then he beckoned me look there says he and pulled down the dead mans eyelid with his finger even in the flickering light i could see the crude tattoo on the skin thug says ilderim through his teeth now flashman what does this mean i was trying to take hold of my senses with my head splitting and my neck feeling as though it had been through the mangle it was a nightmare one moment id been in a drunken frenzy of fornication with lakshmibai with a houseful of musicians beating time and the next i was being murdered by professional stranglers and thugs at that but i was too shocked to think so ilderim grunted and turned to the groaning prisoner this one shall tell us says he and seized him by the throat look now thou art dead already but it can be swift or i can trim off the appurtenances and extremities from thy foul carcase and make thee eat them that for a beginning so choose who sent thee and why the thug snarled and spat at him so ilderim says take him to the tree yonder and while they did he hauled out his knife stropped it on his sole says bide here husoor and then strode grimly after them i couldnt have moved if id wanted to it was a nightmare unbelievable but in those few minutes while dreadful grunts and an occasional chokedoff scream came out of the dark i strove to make some sense of it lakshmibai had plainly left me asleep or drunk or drugged or both in the pavilion and shortly after the thugs had arrived but why why should she seek my death it made no sense no by god because if she had just been luring me out for assassination shed have had me ambushed on the way shed certainly not have pleasured me like a crazy spinster first and there was no earthly reason why she should want me killed what had i done to merit that shed been so friendly and straight and kind i could have sworn shed been falling in love with me for two weeks past oh ive known crafty women sluts whod tickle your buttons with one hand and reach for a knife with the other but not her i couldnt swallow that i wouldnt i could even understand her slipping out and leaving me it had been a clandestine gallop after all she had a reputation to consider what better way of concluding it than by vanishing swiftly back to the palace leaving her partner to find his own way home i reflected moodily that shed probably done the same thing countless times in that very pavilion whenever she felt like it she was no novice that was certain no wonder her late husband had lost interest and curled up and died the poor devil must have been worn to a shadow but who then had set thugs on me or were they just stray indiscriminate killers as thugs usually were slaying anyone who happened in their way for fun and religion had they just spotted me out at night and decided to chalk up another score for kali and then ilderim came striding out of the dark whipping his knife into the turf and squatting down beside me stubborn says he rubbing his beard but not too stubborn flashman it is ill news he stared at me with grave eyes there is a fellowship hunting thee they have been out this week past the brotherhood of deceivers whom everyone thought dead or disbanded these years past with orders to seek out and slay the colonel flashman sahib at jhansi that one yonder is a chief among them six nights since he was at firozabad where his lodge met to hear a strange fakir who offered them gold and he tapped my knee an end to the raj in due time and a rebirth of their order of thugee they were to prepare against the day and as grace before meat they were to sacrifice thee to kali i knew all along says he with a grim satisfaction that this was palitikal and ye walked a perilous road well thou art warned in time but it must be a fast horse to the coast and ship across the kala pani for if these folk are riding thy tail then this land is death to thee there will not be a safe nook from the deccan to the khyber gate i sat limp and trembling taking this horror in i was afraid to ask the question but i had to know this fakir i croaked who is he no one knows except that he is from the north a oneeyed man with a fair skin from beyond the passes there are those who think he is a sahib but not of thy people he has money and followers in secret and he preaches against the sahiblog in whispers ignatieff i almost threw up so it had happened as pam had thought it might the bastard was back and had tracked me down and devil a doubt he knew all about my mission too somehow and he and his agents were spreading their poison everywhere and seeking to revive the devilish thugee cult against us with me at the top of the menu and ilderim was right there wasnt a hope unless i could get out of india but i couldnt this was what i was meant to be here for why pam in his purblind folly had sent me out to tackle ignatieff at his own game and dispose of him i couldnt run squealing to bombay or calcutta bawling gangway and a firstclass ticket home quick this was the moment i was meant to earn my corn against bloody dacoits and ruski agents i gulped and sweated and then another thought struck me was lakshmibai part of this god knew shed no cause to love the sirkar was she another of the spiders in this devilish web playing delilah for the russians but no no even to my disordered mind one thing remained clear shed never have walloped the mattress with me like that if shed been false no this was ignatieff impure and anything but simple and i had to think as id never thought before with ilderims eye on me while i took my head in my hands and wondered christ how can slide out this time and then inspiration dawned slowly i couldnt leave india or be seen to be running away but id told skene that if the crisis came i might well vanish from sight locally to go after ignatieff in my own way well now i would vanish right enough that shouldnt be difficult i schemed it fast as i can when im truly up against it and turned to ilderim look brother says i this is a great palitikal affair as you guessed i cannot tell thee and i cannot leave india then thou art dead says he cheerfully kalis hand will be on thee through these messengers and he pointed at the dead thug hold on says i sweating theyre looking for colonel flashman but if colonel flashman becomes say a khyekeen ponypedlar or an abizai who has done his time in the guides or lancers how will they find him then ive done it before remember dammit i speak pushtu as well as you do and urdu even better wasnt i an agent with sekundar sahib all i need is a safe place for a season to lie up and sniff the wind before and i started lying recklessly for effect before i steal out again having made my plans to break this oneeyed fakir and his rabble of stranglers and loosewallahs dyou see inshallah cries he grinning all over his evil face it is the great game to lie low in disguise and watch and listen and wait and conspire with the other palitikal sahibs of the sirkar until the time is ripe and then go against these evil subverters in a secret razzia and when that time comes i may share the sport and hallal these hindoo and foreign swine with my lads thou wouldst not forget thy old friend then he grabbed my hand the bloodthirsty devil thoud send me word surely when the knives are out thy brother ilderim youll wait a long time for it my lad thinks i give me a good disguise and a pony and youll not see me again not until everything has safely blown over and some other idiot has disposed of ignatieff and his bravos thats when id emerge with a good yarn to spin to calcutta about how id gone after him secretly and dammit id missed the blighter bad luck that would serve and sound sufficiently mysterious and convincing but for the moment my urgent need was a disguise and a hidingplace at a safe distance some jungly or desert spot might be best id lived rough that way before and as id told ilderim i could pass as a frontiersman or afghan with any of em when there are ruski throats to be cut youll be the first to know i assured him and he embraced me chuckling and swearing i was the best of brothers the matter of disguise reminded me that i was still stark naked and shivering i told him i wanted a kit exactly like that of his sowars and he swore id have it and a pony too and you may tell skene sahib from me says i that the time has come and he can start feeling sorry for the ruskis hell understand for i wasnt going back to the cantonment i wanted to ride out tonight wherever i was going tell him of the oneeyed fakir that the thugs are abroad again and the axles are getting hot you may say ive had a brush with the enemy already but you neednt tell him what else i was doing tonight i winked at him understand oh aye and if he has inquiries after me from the rani of jhansi he may say i have been called away and present my apologies the rani says he and his eye strayed towards the pavilion aye he coughed and grinned that was some rich ladys palankeen i saw tonight and many servants perchance was it a gilzai and a grandmother for scandal i quoted mind your own dam business and now be a good lad and get me that outfit and pony he summoned one of his rascals and asked if the tortured thug was dead yet nay but he has no more to tell says the other for he said nothing when i you wouldnt wish to know what he said next shall i pass him some of his own tobacco he added aye says ilderim and tell rafik tamwar i want all his clothes and his knife and his horse go thou for answer the sowar nodded took out his khyber knife and stepped back under the trees to where his companions were guarding the prisoner or what was left of him i heard him address the brute even at that time and place it was an extraordinary enough exchange to fix itself in my mind one of the most astonishing things i ever heard even in india it is over deceiver says he here is the knife in the throat or the heart choose the thugs reply was hoarse with agony in the heart then quickly youre sure as you wish no wait gasps the thug put the point behind my ear so thrust hard thus i will bleed less and go undisfigured now there was a pause and then the sowars voice says he was right he bleeds hardly at all trust a deceiver to know a few moments later and rafik tamwar appeared grumbling in a rag of loincloth with his clothes over his arm and leading a neat little pony i told ilderim that skene sahib must see his kit replaced and he could have my own pegu pony at which the good tamwar grinned through his beard and said he would willingly make such an exchange every day i slipped into his shirt and cavalry breeches drew on the soft boots donned his hairy poshteen stuck the khyber cleaver in my sash and was winding the puggaree round my head and wishing i had a revolver as well when ilderim says thoughtfully where wilt thou go flashman have ye an eyrie to wait in where no enemy can find thee i confessed i hadnt and asked if he had any suggestions at which he frowned thoughtfully and then smiled and then roared with laughter and rolled on his back and then stood up peering and grinning at me some juice for thy skin says he aye and when thy beard has grown thoult be a rare peshawar ruiner so ye swagger enough and curl thy hair round thy finger and spit from the back of thy throat i know all about that says i impatiently where dyou suggest i do all these things in the last place any illwiller would ever look for a british colonel sahib says he chortling look now wouldst thou live easy for a spell and eat full and grow fat what time thou art preparing to play the game against these enemies of the raj aye and get well paid for it rupees a month and batta also he slapped his hands together at my astonishment why not join the sirkars army what a recruit for the native cavalry why given a month theyll make thee a daffadar he stuck his tongue in his cheek maybe a rissaldar in time who knows are you mad says i me enlist as a sowar and how the devil dyou expect me to get away with that what hinders thou hast passed in kabul bazaar before today and along the kandahar road stain thy face as i said and grow thy beard and thoult be the properest sirkars bargain in india does it not meet thy need and will it not place thee close to affairs within reach of thine own folk and ready to move at a fingersnap it was ridiculous and yet the more i thought of it the more obvious it was how long did i want to hide a month two or three perhaps i would have to live and for the life of me i couldnt think of a more discreet and comfortable hidingplace than the ranks of a native cavalry regiment i had all the qualifications and experience if i was careful but id have to be that whatever i did i stood considering while ilderim urged me full of enthusiasm see now there is my mothers cousin gulam beg who was malik in one of my fathers villages and is now woordymajor in the rd cavalry at meerut garrison if thou goest to him and say ilderim sent thee will he not be glad of such a fine sturdy trooper ye may touch the hilt and eat the salt and belike hell forget the assami for my sake let me see now says this mad rascal chuckling as he warmed to his work thou art a yusufzai pathan of the peshawar valley no no better still well have thee a hasanzai of the black mountain they are a strange folk touched and given to wild fits so much may be excused thee oh it is rare thou art makarram khan late of the peshawar police and so familiar with the ways of the sahibs thou hast skirmished along the line too never fear there was a makarram khan until i shot him on my last furlough he will give thee a shabash from hell for he was a stout rider in his time careless though or hed have watched the rocks as he rode well makarram says he grinning like a wolf in the gloom wilt thou carry a lance for the sirkar id been determining even as he talked i was in the greatest fix and there was no other choice if id known what it would lead to id have damned ilderims notion to his teeth but it seemed inspired at the time bind thy puggaree round thy jaw at night lest thou babble in english in thy sleep says he at parting be sullen and speak little and be a good soldier bloodbrother for the credit of ilderim khan he laughed and slapped my saddle as we shook hands in the dark under the trees when thou comest this way again go to bull temple beyond the jokan bagh i will have a man waiting for an hour at sunrise and sunset salaam sowar cries he and saluted and i dug my heels into my pony and cantered off in the dawn still like a man in a wild dream you might think it impossible for a white man to pass himself off as a native soldier in john companys army and indeed i doubt if anyone else has ever done it but when youve been called on to play as many parts as i have its a bagatelle why ive been a danish prince a texas slavedealer an arab sheik a cheyenne dog soldier and a yankee navy lieutenant in my time among other things and none of em was as hard to sustain as my lifetimes impersonation of a british officer and gentleman the truth is we all live under false pretences much of the time you just have to put on a bold front and brazen it through ill admit my gift of languages has been my greatest asset and i suppose im a pretty fair actor anyway id carried off the role of an asianafghan nigger often enough and before i was more than a days ride on the way to meerut i was thoroughly back in the part singing kabuli bazaar songs through my nose sneering sideways at anyone i passed and answering greetings with a grunt or a snarl i had to keep my chin and mouth covered for the first three days until my beard had sprouted to a disreputable stubble apart from that i needed no disguise for i was dark and dirtylooking enough to start with by the time i struck the grand trunk my own mother wouldnt have recognised the big hairy border ruffian jogging along so raffishly with his boots out of his stirrups and his lovelock curling out under his puggaree on the seventh day when i cursed and shoved my pony through the crowded streets of meerut city spurning the rabble aside as a good hasanzai should i was even thinking in pushtu and if youd offered me a sevencourse dinner at the cafй royal id have turned it down for muttonandrice stew with boiled dates to follow my only anxiety was ilderims cousin gulam beg whom i had to seek out in the native cavalry lines beyond the city he would be sure to run a sharp eye over a new recruit and if he spotted anything queer about me id have a hard job keeping up the imposture indeed at the last minute my nerve slackened a little and i rode about for a couple of hours before i plucked up the courage to go and see him i rode on past the native infantry lines and over the nullah bridge up to the mall in the british town it was while i was sitting my pony brooding under the trees that a dogcart with two english children and their mother went by and one of the brats squealed with excitement and said i looked just like ali baba and the forty thieves that cheered me up for some reason anyway i had to have a place to eat and sleep while i shirked my duty so i finally presented myself at the headquarters of the rd native light cavalry and demanded to see the woordymajor i neednt have worried gulam beg was a stout whitewhiskered old cove with silverrimmed spectacles on the end of his nose and when i announced that ilderim khan of mogala was my sponsor he was all over me hasanzai was i and late of the polis that was good i had the look of an able man yes doubtless the colonel sahib would look favourably on such a fine upstanding recruit i had seen no military service though hm he looked at me quizzically and i tried to slouch a bit more not in the guides perhaps says he with his head on one side or the cutchcavalry no then doubtless it is by chance that you stand the regulation three paces from my table and clench your hand with the thumb forward and that the pony i see out yonder is girthed and bridled like one of ours he chuckled playfully a mans past in his own affair makarram khan what should it profit us to pry and discover that a new recruit had once quit the sirkars service over some small matter of feud or bloodletting eh you come from ilderim it is enough be ready to see the colonel sahib at noon hed spotted me for an old soldier you see which was all to the good having detected me in a small deception it never occurred to him to look for a large one and he must have passed on his conclusion to the colonel for when i made my salaam to that worthy officer on the orderlyroom verandah he looked me up and down and says to the woordymajor in english shouldnt wonder if you werent right gulam beg hes heard boots and saddles before thats plain probably got bored with garrison work and slipped off one night with halfadozen rifles on his back and now having cut the wrong throat or lifted the wrong herd hes come well south to avoid retribution he sat back fingering the big white moustache which covered most of his crimson face uglylooking devil aint he though hasanzai of the black mountain eh yes thats what id have thought very good he frowned at me and then said very carefully company cavalry apka mangta which abomination of bad urdu i took to mean did i want to join the company cavalry so i showed my teeth and says han sahib and thought i might as well act out my part by betraying some more military knowledge i ducked my head and leaned over and offered him the hilt of my sheathed khyber knife at which he burst out laughing and touched it saying that gulam beg was undoubtedly right and i wasnt half knowledgeable for a chap who pretended never to have been in the army before he gave instructions for me to be sworn in and i took the oath on the sabreblade ate a pinch of salt and was informed that i was now a skirmisher of the rd native light cavalry that my daffadar was kudrat ali that i would be paid one rupee per day with a quarteranna dyeing allowance and that since i had brought my own horse i would be excused the customary recruit deposit also that if i was half as much a soldier as the colonel suspected and kept my hands off other peoples throats and property i might expect promotion in due course thereafter i was issued with a new puggaree halfboots and pyjamy breeches a new and very smart silvergrey uniform coat a regulation sabre a belt and bandolier and a tangle of saddlery which was old and stiff enough to have been used at waterloo and informed by a betelchewing havildar that if i didnt have it reduced to gleaming suppleness by next morning i had best look out finally he took me to the armoury and i was shown a new rifled enfield musket serial number some things a soldier never forgets which i was informed was mine henceforth and more precious than my own mangy carcase without thinking i picked it up and tested the action as id done a score of times at woolwich and the goanese storewallah gaped who taught you that says he and who bade you handle it jangli pig it is for you to see you touch it only when it is issued on parade and he snatched it back from me i thought another touch of character would do no harm so i waited till he had waddled away to replace it in the rack and then whipped out my khyber knife and let it fly intending to plant it in the wall a foot or so away from him my aim was off though the knife imbedded itself in the wall all right but it nicked his arm in passing and he squealed and rolled on the floor clutching at his bloodsmeared sleeve bring the knife back i snarled baring my fangs at him and when he had scrambled up greyfaced and terrified and returned it i touched the point on his chest and says call makarram khan a pig just once more ulla kabaja and i will carry thine eyes and genitals on this point as kebabs then i made him lick the blood off the blade spat in his face and respectfully asked the havildar what i should do next he being a mussulman was all for me and said grinning that i should make a fair recruit he told my daffadar kudrat ali about the incident and presently the word went round the big airy barrackroom that makarram khan was a genuine saddleandlance man from up yonder who would strike first and inquire after doubtless a border lifter and a feudcarrier but a man who knew how to treat hindoo insolence and therefore to be properly respected so there i was colonel harry paget flashman late of the th hussars th lancers and the staff former aide to the commanderinchief and now actingsowar and rear file in the skirmishing squadron rd cavalry bengal army and if you think it was a madbrained train of circumstance that had taken me there well so did i but once i had got over the unreality of it all and stopped imagining that everyone was going to see through my disguise i settled in comfortably enough it was an eery feeling though at first to squat on my charpai against the wall with my puggaree off combing my hair or oiling my light harness and look round that room at the brown halfnaked figures laughing and chattering of all the things that soldiers talk about women and officers and barrack gossip and women and rations and women but in a foreign tongue which although i spoke it perfectly and even with a genuine frontier accent was still not my own while id been by myself as i say id even been thinking in pushtu but here i had to hold on tight and remember what i was meant to be for one thing i wasnt used to being addressed in familiar terms by native soldiers much less ordered about by an officious naik whod normally have leaped to attention if id so much as looked in his direction when the man who bunked next to me pir ali a jolly rascal of a baluch tapped my shoulder in suggesting that we might visit the bazaar that first evening i absolutely stared at him and just managed to bite back that damn your impudence that sprang to my tongue it wasnt easy for a while quite apart from remembering obeisances at the prescribed times and making a show at cooking my own dinner at the choola there were a thousand tiny details to beware of i must remember not to cross my legs when sitting or blow my nose like a european or say mmh if someone said something i couldnt catch or use the wrong hand or clear my throat in the discreet british fashion or do any of the things that would have looked damned odd in an afghan frontiersman of course i made mistakes once or twice i was just plain ignorant of things that i ought to have known like how to chew a majoon when pir ali offered me one or how to cut a sheeptail for curry or even how to sharpen my knife in the approved fashion when i blundered and anyone noticed i found the best way was to stare them down and growl sullenly but more often than not my danger lay in betraying knowledge which makarram khan simply wouldnt have had for example when kudrat ali was giving us sword exercise i found myself once falling into the rest position of a german schlagerfencer and again daydreaming about fagging days at rugby while cleaning my boots one evening i found myself humming widdicombe fair fortunately under my breath my worst blunder though was when i was walking near a spot where the british officers were playing cricket and the ball came skipping towards me without so much as thinking i snapped it up and was looking to throw down the wicket when i remembered and threw it back as clumsily as i could once or two of them stared though and i heard someone say that big nigger was a deuced smart field that rattled me and i trod even more carefully than before my best plan i soon discovered was to do and say as little as possible and act the surly reserved hillman who walked by himself and whom it was safest not to disturb the fact that i was by way of being a protйgй of the woordymajors and a hasanzai led to my being treated with a certain deference my imposing size and formidable looks did the rest and i was left pretty much alone once or twice i walked out with pir ali to lounge in the old market and ogle the bints or dally with them in the boutique doorways but he found my grunts a poor return for his own cheery prattle and abandoned me to my own devices it wasnt as you can guess the liveliest life for me at first but i only had to think of the alternative to resign myself to it for the present it was easy enough soldiering and i quickly won golden opinions from my naik and jemadar for the speed and intelligence with which i appeared to learn my duties at first it was a novelty drilling working eating and sleeping with thirty indian troopers rather like being on the other side of the bars of a monkey zoo but when youre closed into a world whose four corners are the barrackroom the choola the stables and the maidan it can become maddening to have to endure the society of an inferior and foreign race with whom youve no more in common than if they were russian moujiks or irish bogtrotters what makes it ten times worse is the outcast feeling that comes of knowing that within a mile or two your own kind are enjoying all the home comforts damn em drinking underofficer barra pegs smoking decent cigars flirting and ramming with white women and eating ices for dessert you gather within a fortnight id have given anything to join an english conversation again instead of listening to pir ali giggling about how hed bullocked the headmans wife on his last leave or the endless details of sita gopals uncles lawsuit or ram mangals reviling of the havildar or gobinda dals whining about how he and his brothers being soldiers had lost much of the petty local influence theyd formerly enjoyed in their oudh village now that the sirkar had taken over when it got too bad i would loaf up to the mall and gape at the memsahibs with their big hats and parasols driving by and watch the officers cantering past flicking their crops as i clumped my big boots and saluted or squat near the church to listen to them singing greenlands icy mountains of a sunday evening dammit i missed my own folk then far worse than if theyd been a hundred miles away i missed lakshmibai too odd aint it but i think what riled me most was the knowledge that if shed seen me as i now was well she wouldnt even have noticed me however it had to be stuck out i just had to think of ignatieff so i would trudge back to barracks and lie glowering while the sowars chattered it had this value i learned more about indian soldiers in three weeks than id have done in a lifetimes ordinary service youll think im being clever afterwards but i soon realised that all wasnt as well with them as id have thought at first sight they were northern muslims mostly with a sprinkling of highcaste oudh hindoos the practice of separating the races in different companies or troops hadnt come in then good soldiers too the rd had distinguished itself in the last sikh war and a few had frontier service but they werent happy smart as youd wish on parade but in the evening they would sit about and croak like hell as first i thought it was just the usual military soreheadedness but it wasnt at first all i heard was vague allusions which i didnt inquire about for fear of betraying a suspicious ignorance they talked a deal about one of the padres in the garrison reynolds sahib and how colonel carmikalismeet ought to keep him off the post and there was a fairly general repeated croak about polluted flour and the enlistment act but i didnt pay much heed until one night i remember an oudh sowar came back from the bazaar in a tremendous taking i dont even remember his name but what had happened was that hed been taking part in a wrestling match with some local worthy and before hed got his shirt back on afterwards some british troopers from the dragoon guards who were there at the time had playfully snapped the sacred cord which he wore over his shoulder next the skin as his kind of hindoos did banchuts scum he was actually weeping with rage it is defiled i am unclean and for all that his mates tried to cheer him up saying he could get a new one blessed by a holy man he went on raving they take these things very seriously you know like jews and muslims with pork if it seems foolish to you you may compare it with how youd feel if a nigger pissed in the font at your own church i shall go to the colonel sahib says he finally and one of the hindoos gobinda dal sneered why should he care the man who will defile our atta will not rebuke an english soldier for this whats all this about the atta says i to pir ali and he shrugged the hindoos say that the sahibs are grinding cow bones into the sepoys flour to break their caste for me they can break any hindoos stupid caste and welcome why should they do that says i and sita gopal who overheard spat and says where have you lived hasanzai the sirkar will break every mans caste aye and what passes for caste even among you muslims there are pig bones in the atta too in case you didnt know it naik shere afzul in the second troop told me did he not see them ground at the sahibs factory at cawnpore wind from a monkeys backside says i what would it profit the sahibs to pollute your food since when do they hate their soldiers to my astonishment about half a dozen of them scoffed aloud at this listen to the black mountain munshi the sahibs love their soldiers and so the goracavalry broke lals string for him tonight have you never heard of the dumdum sweeper makarram khan and so on ram mangal who was the noisiest croaker of them all spat out it is of a piece with the padre sahibs talk and the new regulation that will send men across the kala pani they will break our caste to make us christians do they not know this even where you come from hillman why it is the talk of the army i growled that i didnt put any faith in latrinegossip especially if the latrine was a hindoo one and at this one of the older men sardul somethingorother shook his head and says gravely it was no latrinerumour makarram khan that came out of dumdum arsenal and for the first time i heard the astonishing tale that was i discovered accepted as gospel by every sepoy in the bengal army of the sweeper at dumdum whod asked a caste sepoy for a drink from his dish and on being refused had told the sepoy that he neednt be so dam particular because the sahibs were going to do away with caste by defiling every soldier in the army by greasing their cartridges with cow and pig fat this thing is known says old sardul positively and he was the kind of old soldier that men listen to thirty years service aliwal medal and clean conduct sheet damn your eyes is not the new enfield musket in the armoury are not the new greased cartridges being prepared how can any man keep his religion they say that at benares the jawans have been permitted to grease their own loads says pir ali but they hooted him down they say cries ram mangal it is like the tale they put about that all the grease was muttonfat if that were so where is the need for anyone to make his own grease it is a lie just as the enlistment act is a lie when they said it was a provision only and no one would be asked to do foreign service ask the th at behrampore where their officers told them they must serve in burma if they refused the cartridge when it was issued aye but they will refuse then well see he waved his hands in passion the polluted atta is another link in the chain like the preaching of that owl reynolds sahib with his jesustalk which carmikalismeet permits to our offence he wants to put us to shame it is true enough says old sardul sadly yet i would not believe it if such a sahib as my old colonel macgregor did he not take a bullet meant for me at kandahar were to look in my eye and say it was false the pity is that carmikalismeet is not such a sahib there are none such nowadays says he with morbid satisfaction and the army is but a poor ruin of what it was you do not know today what officers were if you had seen sale sahib or larrinsh sahib or cotton sahib you would have seen men they would have died before they would have put dishonour on their sepoys their children they used to call us and we would have followed them to hell but now he wagged his head again these are cutchsahibs not pakkasahibs and the english common soldiers are no better why in my young day an english trooper would call me brother give me his hand offer me his waterbottle and now these common men spit on us call us monkeys and hubshis and break lals string most of their talk was just patent rubbish of course and id no doubt it was the work of agitators spreading disaffection with their nonsense about greased cartridges and polluted food i almost said so but decided it would be unwise to draw attention to myself and anyway it wasnt such a burning topic of conversation most of the time that one could take it seriously i knew they put tremendous store by their religion the hindoos especially and i supposed that whenever an incident like lals string stirred them up all the old grievances came out and were soon forgotten but ill confess that what sardul had said about the british officers and troops reminded me of john nicholsons misgivings i had hardly seen a british officer on parade since my enlistment they seemed content to leave their troops to the jemadars and ncos addiscombe tripe of course and there was no question the british rankers in the meerut garrison were a poorer type than say the th whom id known in the old afghan days or campbells highlanders i got firsthand evidence of this a day or two later when i accidentally jostled a dragoon in the bazaar and the brute turned straight round and lashed out with his boot aht the way yer black bastard says he think yer can shove a sahib arahnd banchut and he would have taken a swipe at me with his fist too but i just put my hand on my knifehilt and glared at him it wouldnt have been prudent to do more christ says he and took to his heels until he got to the end of the street where he snatched up a stone and flung it at me it smashed a plate on a booth nearby and then made off ill remember you my lad thinks i and the dayll come when ill have you triced up and flogged to ribbons ive never been so wild that the scum of a whitechapel gutter should take his boot to me ill be honest and say that if id seen him do it to a native two months earlier i wouldnt have minded a bit and still wouldnt much its a niggers lot to be kicked but it aint mine and i cant tell you how i felt afterwards filthy in a way because i hadnt been able to pay the swine back thats by the way the point is that old sardul was right there wasnt the respect for jawans among the british that there had been in my young day we probably lashed and kicked niggers just as much but there was a higher regard for the sepoys at least on the whole i doubt if any commander in the old days would have done what carmichaelsmith did in the way of preachingparades either i hadnt believed it in the barrack gossip but sure enough the next sunday this coffinfaced anglican fakir the rev reynolds had a muster on the maidan and we had to listen to him expounding the parable of the prodigal son if you please he did it through a brazenlunged rissaldar who interpreted for him and you never heard the like reynolds lined it out in english from the bible and the rissaldar stood there with his staff under his arm at attention with his whiskers bristling bawling his own translation there was a zamindar with two sons he was a mad zamindar for while he yet lived he gave to the younger his portion of the inheritance doubtless he raised it from a moneylender and the younger spent it all whoring in the bazaar and drinking sherab and when his money was gone he returned home and his father ran to meet him for he was pleased god alone knows why and in his foolishness the father slew his only cow he was evidently not a hindoo and they feasted on it and the older son who had been dutiful and stayed at home was jealous i cannot tell for what reason unless the cow was to have been part of his inheritance but his father who did not like him rebuked the older son this story was told by jesus the jew and if you believe it you will not go to paradise but instead will sit on the righthand side of the english lord god sahib who lives in calcutta and there you will play musical instruments by order of the sirkar parade dismiss i dont know when ive been more embarrassed on behalf of my church and country im as religious as the next man which is to say ill keep in with the local parson for forms sake and read the lessons on feastdays because my tenants expect it but ive never been fool enough to confuse religion with belief in god thats where so many clergymen like the unspeakable reynolds go wrong and it makes em arrogant and totally blind to the harm they may be doing this idiot was so drunk with testaments that he couldnt conceive how illmannered and offensive he was making himself look i suppose he thought of highcaste hindoos as being like wilful children or drunken costermongers perverse and misguided but ripe for salvation if he just pointed em the way he stood there with his unctuous fat face and piggy eyes blessing us soapily while the muslims being worldly in their worship tried not to laugh and the hindoos fairly seethed id have found it amusing enough i dare say if i hadnt been irritated by the thought that these irresponsible christian zealots were only making things harder for the army and company who had important work to do it was all so foolish and unnecessary the heathen creeds for all their nonsensical mumbo jumbo were as good as any for keeping the rabble in order and what else is religion for in any event this misguided attempt to cure hindoo souls took place not just at meerut but elsewhere according to the religious intoxication of the local commanders and in my opinion was the most important cause of the mischief that followed i didnt appreciate this at the time and couldnt have done anything if i had besides i had more important matters to engage my attention a few days after that parade there was a gymkhana on the maidan and i rode for the skirmishers in the nezabazi apart from languages and fornication horsemanship is my only accomplishment and id been wellgrounded in tentpegging by the late muhammed iqbal so it was no surprise that i took the greatest number of pegs and would have got even more if id had a pony that i knew and my lance hadnt snapped in a touch peg on the last round it was enough to take the cup though and old bloody bill hewitt the garrison commander slipped the handle over my broken lancepoint in front of the marquee where all the top numbers of meerut society were sitting applauding politely the ladies in their crinolines and the men behind their chairs shabash sowar says bloody bill where did you learn to manage a lance peshawar valley hussor says i company cavalry says he and i said no peshawar police didnt know they was lancers says he and carmichaelsmith who was on hand laughed and said to hewitt in english no more they are sir its a rather delicate matter i suspect this bird here pretends hes never served the sirkar before but hes got guide written all over him shouldnt wonder if he wasnt rissaldar havildar at least but we dont ask embarrassing questions what hes a dam good recruit anyway ah says hewitt grinning he was a fat kindly old buffer nough said then and i was in the act of saluting when a little puff of wind sprang up scattering the papers which were on the table behind him and blowing them under the ponys hooves like a good little toady i slipped out of the saddle and gathered them up and without thinking set them on the table and put the inkpot on top of them to hold them steady a simple ordinary thing but i heard an exclamation and looked up to see duff mason one of the infantry colonels staring at me in surprise i just salaamed and saluted and was back in my saddle in a second while they called up the next man for his prize but as i wheeled my pony away i saw that mason was looking after me with a puzzled smile on his face and saying something to the officer next to him hollo thinks i has he spotted something but i couldnt think id done anything to give myself away until next morning when the rissaldar called me out of the ranks and told me to report to masons office in the british lines forthwith i went with my heart in my mouth wondering what the hell i was going to do if he had seen through my disguise only to find it was the last thing my guilty conscience might have suspected makarram khan isnt it says mason when i stood to attention on his verandah and went through the ritual of hilttouching he was a tall brisk wiry fellow with a sharp eye which he cast over me hasanzai peshawar policeman but only a few weeks army service he spoke good urdu which suggested he was smarter than most and my innards quaked well now makarram says he pleasantly i dont believe you nor does your own colonel youre an old soldier you ride like one you stand like one and whats more youve held command dont interrupt no ones trying to trap you or find out how many throats youve cut in the khyber country in your time thats nothing to me youre here now as an ordinary sowar but a sowar who gathers up papers as though hes as used to handling em as i am unusual in a pathan even one whos seen service dont you agree in the police husoor says i woodenly are many kitabs and papers to be sure there are says he and then added ever so easily in english whats that on your right hand i didnt look but i couldnt help my hand jerking and he chuckled and leaned back in his chair pleased with himself i guessed you understood english when the commander and your colonel were talking in front of you yesterday says he you couldnt keep it out of your eyes well never mind its all to the good but see here makarram khan whatever youve done whatever youve been wheres the sense in burying yourself in the ranks of a native cavalry pultan youve got education and experience why not use em how long will it take you to make subedar or havildar even in your present situation twenty years thirty with downcountry cavalry ill tell you what you can do better than that well it was a relief to know my disguise was safe enough but the last thing i wanted was to be singled out in any way however i listened respectfully and he went on i had a pathan orderly ayub jan firstclass man with me ten years and now hes gone back home to inherit i need someone else well youre younger than he was and a sight smarter or im no judge and he wasnt a common orderly never did a menial task or anything of that order wouldnt have asked him to for he was yusufzai and a gentleman as i believe you are dyou see he looked at me very steady smiling so what i want is a man of affairs who is also a man of his hands someone i can trust as a soldier messenger steward aide guide shieldonshoulder he shrugged when i saw you yesterday i thought thats the kind of man well what dye say i had to think quickly about this if i could have looked at myself in the mirror i suppose i was just the sort of ruffian id have picked myself in duff masons shoes pathans make the best orderlybodyguardscomrades there are as id discovered with muhammad iqbal and ilderim and it would be a pleasant change from barracks but it was risky it would draw attention to me on the other hand my character was established by now and any lapses into englishness might be explained from the past which mason and carmichaelsmith had wished upon me i hesitated and he said quietly if youre thinking that coming out of the ranks may expose you to greater danger of being recognised by the police say or some inconvenient acquaintance from the past have no fear of that at need therell always he a fast horse and a dustuck to see you back to the black mountain again it was ironic he thought i went in fear of discovery as a deserter or border raider when my only anxiety was that id be unmasked as a british officer bit of a lark really and on that thought i said very good id accept his offer thank you makarram khan says he and nodded to a table that was set behind his chair against the chick there was a drawn sabre lying on it and i knew what was expected of me i went past him and put my hand on the blade it had been so arranged that with my body in between he couldnt see from where he sat whether i was touching the steel or not the old dodge thinks i but i said aloud on the haft and hilt i am thy man and soldier good says he and as i turned he held out his hand i took it and just for devilment i said have no fear husoor you will smell the onion on your fingers i knew you see that in anticipation of the oath he would have rubbed onion on the blade so that he could tell afterwards if id truly touched it while i swore a pathan who intended to break his oath wouldnt have put his hand on the steel and consequently wouldnt have got the onionsmell on his fingers by jove says he and quickly sniffed his hand then he laughed and said i was a pathan for wiliness all right and we would get along famously which im bound to say we did mind you our association wasnt a long one but while it lasted i thoroughly enjoyed myself playing majordomo in his household for thats what it amounted to as i soon discovered his bungalow was a pretty big establishment you see just off the east end of the mall near the british infantry lines with about thirty servants and since there was no proper memsahib and his khansamah was almost senile there was no order about the place at all rather than have me spend my time dogging him about his office where there wasnt much for me to do except stand looking grim and impressive duff mason decided i should make a beginning by putting his house and its staff into pukka order and i set about it flashy jackofalltrades you see in the space of a few months id already been a gentleman of leisure staff officer secret political agent ambassador and sepoy so why not a nigger butler for a change you may think it odd and looking back it seems damned queer to me too but the job was just nuts to me i was leading such an unreal existence anyway and had become so devilish bored in the sepoy barracks that i suppose i was ready enough for anything that occupied my time without too much effort duff masons employ was just the ticket it gave me the run of a splendid establishment the best of meat and drink a snug little bunk of my own and nothing to do but bully menials which i did with a hearty relish that terrified the brutes and made the place run like clockwork all round i couldnt have picked a softer billet for my enforced sojourn in meerut if id tried ive said there were no proper memsahibs in the house by which i mean that there was no colonels lady to supervise it hence the need for me but in fact there were two white women there both useless in management miss blanche a thin twitchy little spinster who was duff masons sister and mrs leslie a vague relative who was either a grass widow or a real one and reminded me rather of a sailors whore she was a plumpish paleskinned woman with red frizzy hair and a roving eye for the garrison officers with whom she went riding and flirting when she wasnt lolling on the verandah eating sweets however if neither of the resident ladies was any help in setting me about my duties there was another who was mrs captain macdowall who lived farther down the mall and who bustled in on my first afternoon on the pretext of taking tea with miss blanche but in fact to see that duff masons new orderly started off on the right foot she was a rawboned old scotch trot not unlike my motherinlaw the kind who loves nothing better than to interfere in other folks affairs and put their lives in order for them she ran me to earth just as i was stowing my kit i salaamed respectfully and she fixed me with a glittering eye and demanded if i spoke english now then makarram khan this is what youll do says she this house is a positive disgrace youll make it what it should be the best in the garrison after general hewitts mind that ye can begin by thrashing every servant in the place and if youre wise youll do it regularly my father says she believed in flogging servants every second day after breakfast so now have you the slightest the slightest notion of how such an establishment as this should be run i dont suppose ye have i said submissively that i had been in a sahibs house before aye well says she attend to me your first charge is the kitchen without a wellordered kitchen theres no living in a place now i dined here two nights since and i was disgusted so i have lists here prepared she whipped some papers from her bag ye cant read i suppose no well ill tell you whats here and youll see to it that the cook who is none too bad considering prepares her menus accordingly i shouldnt need to be doing this she went on with a withering glance towards the verandah where miss blanche and mrs leslie were sitting but if i dont who will id like to know hmf poor colonel mason she glared at me thats none of your concern you understand she adjusted her spectacles breakfast aye chopssteaksquailfriedfishbakedminced chickenprovidedthebirds nomorethanadayold no servants in the breakfast room it can all be placed on the buffet can ye make tea i mean tea thats fit to drink bemused by these assaults i said i could aye says she doubtfully a mistress should always make the tea herself but here she sniffed well then always two teapots with no more than three spoonfuls to each and a pinch of carbonate of soda in the milk see that the cook makes coffee very strong first thing in the morning and adds boiling water during the course of the day boiling i said and fresh hot milk or cold whipped cream now then and she consulted another list luncheon also on the buffet muttonbrothalmondsoupmulligatawny whitesoup coldclear soupmilk puddingstewedfruit no heavy cooked dishes this with a glare over her spectacles theyre unhealthy afternoon tea brown bread and butter scones devonshire cream and cakes have ye any apostle spoons memsahib says i putting my hands together and ducking my head i am only a poor soldier i do not know what ill have two dozen sent round dinner saddleofmuttonboiledfowlsroastbeef ach says she ill tell the cook myself but you she wagged a finger like a marlinspike will mind what ive said and see that my instructions are followed and that the food is cleanly and promptly served and see that the salt is changed every day and that no one in the kitchen wears woollen clothes and if one of them cuts a finger straight round with them to my bungalow every inch of this house will be dusted twice a day before callers come between noon and two and before dinner is that clear han memsahib han memsahib says i nodding vigorously heaven help me she regarded me grimly and said she would be in from time to time to see that all was going as it should because colonel mason must be properly served and if she didnt attend to it and see that i kept the staff hard at their duties well this with further sniffy looks towards the verandah after which she went to bully the cook leaving me to reflect that there was more in an orderlys duties than met the eye i tell you this because although it may seem not to have much to do with my story it strikes me it has a place if youre to understand india and the mutiny and the people who were caught up in it and how they fared then women like mrs captain macdowall matter as much as outram or lakshmibai or old wheeler or tantia tope terrible women in their way the memsahibs but it would have been a different country without em and im not sure the raj would have survived the year if they hadnt been there interfering at all events under her occasional guidance and blistering rebukes i drove masons menials until the place was running like a homebound tea clipper youll think it trivial perhaps but i got no end of satisfaction in this supervising there was nothing else to occupy me you see and as arnold used to say what thy hand findeth to do i welted the backsides off the sweepers terrorised the mateys had the bearers parading twice a day with their dusters feather brooms and polish bottles and stalked grimly about the place pleased as punch to see the tabletops and silver polished till they gleamed the floors boneclean and the chota hazri and darwazaband trays carried in on the dot strange looking back to remember the pride i felt when duff mason gave a dinner for the garrisons best and i stood by the buffet in my best grey coat and new red sash and puggaree with my beard oiled looking dignified and watching like a hawk as the khansamah and his crew scuttled round the candlelit table with the courses as the ladies withdrew mrs captain macdowall caught my eye and gave just a little nod probably as big a compliment in its way as i ever received so a few more weeks went by and i was slipping into this nice easy life as is my habit whenever things are quiet i reckoned id give it another month or so and then slide out one fine night for jhansi where id surprise skene by turning up a la pathan and pitch him the tale about how id been pursuing ignatieff in secret and getting nowhere id see ilderim too and find if the thugs were still out for me if it seemed safe id shave become flashy again and make tracks for calcutta protesting that id done all that could be done might even pay my respects to lakshmibai on the way however in the meantime id carry on as i was eating duff masons rations seeing that his bearer laid out his kit harrying his servants and tupping his kitchenmaid she was a poor substitute for my rani and once or twice when it seemed to me that mrs leslies eye lingered warmly on my upstanding pathan figure or my swarthy bearded countenance i toyed with the idea of having a clutch at her better not though too many prying eyes in a bungalow household which is what made life hard for grass widows and unattached white females in indian garrisons they couldnt do more than flirt in safety every now and then i had to go back to barracks carmichaelsmith had been willing enough to detach me to duff mason but i still had to muster on important parades when all sepoys on the regimental strength were called in it was on one of these that i heard the rumour flying that the th nj had rioted at behrampore over the greased cartridge as sepoy ram mangal had predicted they have been disbanded by special court says he to me out of the corner of his mouth as we clattered back to the armoury to hand in our rifles he was full of excitement the sahibs have sent the jawans home because the sirkar fears to keep such spirited fellows under arms so much for the courage of your british colonels they begin to fear aye presently they will have real cause to be fearful it will need to be better cause than a pack of whining monkeys like the th says pir ali who minds if a few hindoos get cowgrease on their fingers have you seen this then mangal whipped a paper from under his jacket and thrust it at him here are your own people you mussulmen who so faithfully lick the sahibs backsides even they are beginning to find their manhood read here of the great jihad that your mullahs are preaching against the infidels not just in india either but arabia and turkestan read it and learn that an afghan army is preparing to seize india with ruski guns and artillerymen what does it say thousands of ghazis strong as elephants he laughed jeeringly they may come to help but who knows perhaps they will be behind the fair the goddess kali may have destroyed the british already as the wise men foretold it was just another scurrilous pamphlet no doubt but the sight of that grinning black ape gloating over his sedition riled me i snatched the paper and rubbed it deliberately on the seat of my trousers pir ali and some of the sepoys grinned but the rest looked pretty glum and old sardul shook his head if the th have been false to their salt it is an ill thing says he and mangal broke in excitedly to say hadnt the sahibs broken faith first by trying to defile the sepoys caste first behrampore then where cries he which pultan will be next it is coming brothers it is coming and he nodded smugly and went off chattering with his cronies i didnt value this at the time but it crossed my mind again a couple of nights later when duff mason had archdale wilson the binkynabob and hewitt and carmichaelsmith and a few others on his verandah and i heard jack waterfield a senior man in the rd native cavalry talking about behrampore and wondering if it was wise to press ahead with the issue of the new cartridge of course it is snaps carmichaelsmith especially now when its been refused at behrampore give way on this and where will it end its a piece of damned nonsense some crawling little agitator fills the sepoys heads with rubbish about beefgrease and pigfat when its been made perfectly plain by the authorities that the new cartridge contains nothing that could possibly offend muslim or hindoo but it serves as an excuse for the troublemakers and there are always some fortunately not in our regiment says another plowden who commanded my own company by god thinks i thats all you know and then carmichaelsmith was growling on that hed like to see one of his sepoys refuse the issue by god he would no chance of that sir says another major of the rd richardson our fellows are too good soldiers and no fools cant think what happened with the th too many senior officers left regimental service for the staff i shouldnt wonder new men havent got the proper grip but suppose our chaps did refuse says one young fellow in the circle mightnt it that is damned croaking says carmichaelsmith angrily you dont know sepoys gough and thats plain i do and i wont countenance the suggestion that my soldiers would have their heads turned by this this seditious bosh what the devil they know their duty but i i they get the notion that any of us have doubts or might show weakness well thats the worst thing imaginable ill be obliged if youll keep your halfbaked observations to yourself that shut up gough sharp enough and duff mason tried to get the pepper out of the air by saying he was sure carmichaelsmith was right and if gough had misgivings why not settle them then and there your colonel wont mind im sure if i put it to one of his own sowars dont fret smith hes a safe man and he beckoned me from where i stood in the shadows by the servingtable from which the bearers kept the glasses topped up now makarram khan says he you know about this cartridge nonsense well youre a muslim will you take it i stood respectfully by his chair glancing round the circle of faces carmichaelsmith red and glistening waterfield thin and shrewd young gough flustered old hewitt grinning and belching quietly if it will drive a ball three hundred yards and straight husoor says i i shall take it they roared of course and hewitt said there was a real pathan answer what and your comrades asks archdale wilson if they are told truly by the colonel sahib that the cartridge is clean why should they refuse says i and they murmured agreement well thinks i thats a plain enough hint and carmichaelsmith can put master mangals croaking into the shade he might have done too but the very next day the barracks was agog with a new rumour and we heard for the first time a name that was to sweep across india and the world pandy says i to pir ali who may he be a sepoy of the th at barrackpore says he he shot at his captain sahib on the paradeground they say he was drunk with sharab or bhang and called on the sepoys to rise against their officers what do i know perhaps it is true perhaps it is rumour ram mangal is busy enough convincing those silly hindoo sheep that it really happened so he was with an admiring crowd round him in the middle of the barrackroom applauding as he harangued them it is a lie that the sepoy pandy was drunk cries he a lie put about by the sahibs to dishonour a hero who will defend his caste to the death he would not take the cartridge and when they would have arrested him he called to his brothers to beware because the british are bringing fresh battalions of english soldiers to steal away our religion and make slaves of us and the captain sahib at barrackpore shot pandy with his own hands wounding him and they keep him alive for torture even now he was working himself into a terrible froth over this what surprised me was that no one not even the muslims contradicted him and naik kudrat ali who was a good soldier was standing by chewing his lip but doing nothing eventually when mangal had raved himself hoarse i thought id take a hand so i asked him why he didnt go to the colonel himself and find out the truth whatever it was and ask for reassurance about the cartridge hear him cries he scornfully ask a sahib for the truth hah only the goracolonels lapdog would suggest it maybe i will speak to carmikalismeet though in my own time he looked round at his cronies with a significant ugly grin yes maybe i will we shall see well one swallow dont make a summer or one illnatured agitator a revolt no doubt what im telling you now about barrackroom discontent among the sepoys looks strong evidence of trouble brewing but it didnt seem so bad then of course there was discontent and ram mangal played on it and every rumour for all he was worth but you could go into any barracks in the world you know at any time and find almost the same thing happening no one did anything just sullen talk the parades went on and the sepoys did their duty and the british officers seemed content enough anyway i was only occasionally in the barracks myself so i didnt hear much of the grumbling when the word came through that sepoy pandy had been hanged at barrackpore for mutiny i thought there might be some kind of stir among our men but they never let cheep in the meantime i had other things to claim my attention mrs leslie of the red hair and lazy disposition had begun to take a closer interest in me it started with little errands and tasks that put me in her company then came her request to duff mason that i should ride escort on her and miss blanche when they drove out visiting and fmally i found myself accompanying her when she went riding alone the excuse was that it was convenient to her to have an attendant who spoke english and could answer her questions about india in which she professed a great interest i know what interests you my girl thinks i but youll have to make the first move i didnt mind she was a wellfleshed piece in her way it was amusing too to see her plucking up her courage i was a black servant to her you see and she was torn between a natural revulsion and a desire to have the big hairy pathan set about her on our rides she would flirt a very little in a hoitytoity way and then think better of it i maintained my correct and dignified noble animal pose with just an occasional ardent smile and a slight squeeze when i helped her dismount i knew she was getting ready for the plunge when she said one day you pathans are not truly indian are you i mean in some ways you look well almost white we are not indian at all memsahib says i we are descended from the people of ibrahim ishak and yakub who were led from the khedives country by one moses you mean youre jewish says she oh she rode in silence for a while i see how strange she thought some more i i have jewish acquaintances in england most respectable people and quite white of course well the pathans believe it and it made her happy so i hurried the matter along by suggesting next day that i show her the ruins at aligaut about six miles from the city its a deserted temple very overgrown but what i hadnt told her was that the inside walls were covered with most artisticallycarved friezes depicting all the hindoo methods of fornicating you know the kind of thing effeminatelooking lads performing incredible couplings with fattitted females she took one look and gasped i stood behind with the horses and waited i saw her eyes travel round from one impossible carving to the next while she gulped and went crimson and pale by turns not knowing whether to scream or giggle so i stepped up behind her and said quietly that the fortyfifth position was much admired by the discriminating she was shivering with her back to me and then she turned and i saw that her eyes were wild and her lips trembling so i gave my swarthy ravishers growl swept her up in my arms and then down on to the mossy floor she gave a little frightened moan opened her eyes wide and whispered youre sure youre jewish not not indian han memsahib says i thrusting away respectfully and she gave a contented little squeal and grappled me like a wrestler we rode to aligaut quite frequently after that studying indian social customs and if the fortyfifth position eluded us it wasnt for want of trying she had a passion for knowledge did mrs leslie and i can think back affectionately to that cool dim musty interior the plump white body among the ferns and the thoughtful way she would gnaw her lower lip while she surveyed the friezes before pointing to the lesson for today pity for some chap she never remarried aye and more of a pity for her she never got the chance for by now april had turned into may the temperature was sweltering and there was a hot wind blowing across the meerut paradeground and barracks that had nothing to do with the weather you could feel the tension in the air like an electric cloud the sepoys of the rd nc went about their drill like sullen automatons the native officers stopped looking their men in the eye the british officers were quiet and wary or explosively shorttempered and there were more men on report than anyone could remember there were ugly rumours and portents the th ni the executed sepoy pandys regiment had been disbanded at barrackpore a mysterious fakir on an elephant had appeared in meerut bazaar predicting that the wrath of kali was about to fall on the british chapattis were said to be passing in some barrackrooms the plassey legend was circulated again out of all the grievances and mistrust that folk like ram mangal had been voicing a great discontented unease grew in those few weeks and one thing suddenly became known throughout the meerut garrison without a word said the certainty was there when the new greased cartridge was issued the rd native cavalry would refuse it now you may say knowing what followed something should have been done i with respect will ask what the thing was while everyone knew that feeling was rising by the hour no one could foresee for a moment what was about to happen it was unimaginable the british officers couldnt conceive that their beloved sepoys would be false to their salt dammit neither could the sepoys if theres one thing i will maintain it is that not a soul not even creatures like ram mangal thought that the bitterness could explode in violence even if the cartridge was refused well the worst that could follow was disbandment and even that was hard to contemplate i didnt dream of what lay ahead not even with all my forewarning over months and i was there and no one can take fright faster than i so when i heard that carmichaelsmith had ordered a firingparade at which the skirmishers would demonstrate the new cartridge i simply thought well this will settle it either theyll accept the new loads and itll all blow over or they wont and calcutta will have to think again waterfield tried to smooth things beforehand singling out the older skirmishers and reassuring them that the loads were not offensively greased but they wouldnt have it they even pleaded with him not to ask them to take the cartridge i think he tried to reason with carmichaelsmith but the word came out that the firingparade would take place as ordered after waterfields failure this was really throwing down the gauntlet if you like id not have done it if id been carmichaelsmith for one thing ive learned as an officer is never to give an order unless theres a good chance of its being obeyed and if youd fallen in with the skirmishers that fine morning having seen the sullen faces as they put on their belts and bandoliers and drew their enfields from the armoury youd not have wagered a quid to a hundred on their taking the cartridge but carmichaelsmith the ass was determined so there we stood in extended line between the other squadrons of the regiment facing inwards the native officers at ease before their respective troops and the rissaldar calling us to attention as carmichaelsmith looking thunderous rode up and saluted we waited with our enfields at our sides while he rode along the extended rank looking at us there wasnt a sound we stood with the baking sun at our backs every now and then a little puff of warm wind would drive a tiny dustdevil across the ground plowdens horse kept shying as he cursed and tried to steady it i watched the shadows of the rank swaying with the effort of standing igid and the sweat rivers were tickling my chest naik kudrat ali on my right was straight as a lance on my other side old sarduls breathing was hoarse enough to be audible carmichaelsmith completed his slow inspection and reined up almost in front of me his red face under the service cap was as heavy as a statues then he snapped an order and the havildarmajor stepped forward saluted and marched to carmichaelsmiths side where he turned to face us jack waterfield sitting a little in rear of the colonel called out the orders from the platoon exercise manual prepare to load says he adding quietly rifleatfullextentofleftarm the havildarmajor shoved out his rifle load cries jack adding again cartridgeisbroughttothelefthandrightelbowraisedtearofftopofcartridgewithfmgersbydroppingelbow this was the moment you could feel the rank sway forward ever so little as the havildarmajor his bearded face intent held up the little shiny brown cylinder tore it across and poured the powder into his barrel a hundred and eighty eyes watched him do it there was just a suspicion of a sigh from the rank as his ramrod drove the charge home then he came to attention again waterfield gave him the present and fire and the single demonstration shot cracked across the great paradeground on either side the rest of the regiment waited watching us now says carmichaelsmith and although he didnt raise his voice it carried easily across the parade now you have seen the loading drill you have seen the havildarmajor a soldier of high caste take the cartridge he knows the grease with which it is waxed is pure i assure you again nothing that could offend hindoo or muslim is being offered to you i would not permit it carry on havildarmajor what happened was that the havildarmajor came along the rank with two naiks carrying big bags of cartridges of which he offered three to each skirmisher i was looking straight to my front sweating and wishing the back of my kg would stop itching i couldnt see what was happening along the rank but i heard a repeated murmur as the havildarmajor progressed nahin havildarmajor sahib nahin havildarmajor sahib carmichaelsmiths head was turned to watch i could see his hand clenched white on his rein the havildarmajor stopped opposite kudrat ali and held out three cartridges i could feel kudrat stiffen he was a big rangy punjabi mussulman a veteran of aliwal and the frontier proud as lucifer of his stripes and himself the kind of devoted ass who thinks his colonel is his father and even breaks wind by numbers i stole a glance at him his mouth was trembling under his heavy moustache as he muttered nahin havildarmajor sahib suddenly carmichaelsmith broke silence his temper must have boiled higher with each refusal what the devil do you mean his voice cracked hoarsely dont you recognise an order dyou know what insubordination means kudrat started violently but recovered he swallowed with a gulp you could have heard in poona and then says colonel sahib i cannot have a bad name bad name by god roars smith dyou know a worse name than mutineer he sat there glowering and kudrat trembled then the havildarmajors hand was thrust out to me his bloodshot brown eyes glaring into mine i looked at the three little brown cylinders aware that waterfield was watching me intently and old sardul was breathing like a walrus on my other side i took the cartridges there was a sudden exclamation farther along the rank but i stuffed two of them into my belt and held up the third as i glanced at it i realised with a start that it wasnt greased it was waxed i tore it across with a shaky hand poured the powder into the barrel stuffed the cartridge after it and rammed it down then i returned to attention waiting old sardul was crying as the cartridges were held out to him he put up a shaking hand but not to take them he made a little feeble gesture and then sings out colonel sahib it is not just never never have i disobeyed never have i been false to my salt sahib do not ask this of me ask anything my life even but not my honour he dropped his enfield wringing his hands sahib i fool shouts carmichaelsmith dyou suppose i would ask you to hurt your honour when did any man know me do such a thing the cartridges are clean i tell you look at the havildarmajor look at makarram khan are they men of no honour no and theyre not mutinous dogs either it wasnt the most tactful thing to say to that particular sepoy i thought sardul would go into a frenzy the way he wept but he wouldnt touch the cartridges so it went along the line when the end had been reached only four other men out of ninety had accepted the loads four and that stalwart pillar of loyalty flashy makarram khan so there it was carmichaelsmith could hardly talk for sheer fury but he cussed us something primitive promising dire retribution and then dismissed the parade they went in silence some stonyfaced others troubled a number weeping openly but mostly just sullen for those of us who had taken the cartridges by the way there were no reproaches from the others proper lot of longsuffering holy little tom browns they were that of course was something that carmichaelsmith didnt understand he thought the refusal of the cartridges was pure pigheadedness by the sepoys egged on by a few malcontents so it was but there was a genuine religious feeling behind it and a distrust of the sirkar if hed had his wits about him hed have seen that the thing to do now was to drop the cartridge for the moment and badger calcutta to issue a new one that the sepoys could grease themselves he might even have made an example of one or two of the older disobedients but no that wasnt enough for him hed been defied by his own men and by god he wasnt having that so the whole eightyfive were courtmartialled and the court composed entirely of native officers gave them all ten years hard labour i cant say i had much sympathy with em anyone whos fool enough to invite ten years on the rockpile for his superstitions deserves all he gets in my view but im hound to say that once the sentence had been passed it couldnt have been worse carried out instead of shipping the eightyfive quietly off to jail the buffoon hewitt decided to iet the world and other sepoys especially see what happened to mutineers and so a great punishment parade was ordered for the following saturday as it happened i quite welcomed this myself because i had to attend and so was spared an excursion to aligaut with mrs leslie that womans appetite for experiment was increasing and id had a wearing if pleasurable week of it but from the official point of view that parade was a stupid dangerous farce and came near to costing us all india it was a red morning oppressive and grim with a heavy overcast sky and a hot wind driving the dust in stinging volleys across the maidan the air was suffocatingly close like the garrison there the dragoon guards with their sabres out the bengal artillery with their british gunners and native assistants in leather breeches standing by their guns line on line of redcoated native infantry completing the hollow square and in the middle hewitt and his staff with carmichaelsmith and the regimental officers all mounted and then the eightyfive were led out in double file all in full uniform but for one thing they were in their bare feet i dont know when ive seen a bleaker sight than those two grey ranks standing there hangdog while someone bawled out the courts findings and sentence and then a drum began to roll very slow and the ceremony began now ive been on more punishment parades than i care to remember and quite enjoyed em by and large theres a fascination about a hanging or a good flogging and the first time i saw a man shot from a gun at kabul that was i couldnt take my eyes off it ive noticed too that the most pious and humanitarian folk always make sure they get a good view and while they look grim or pitying or shocked they take care to miss none of the best bits really what happened at meerut was tame enough and yet it was different from any other drummingout or execution i remember usually theres excitement or fear or even exultation but here there was just a doomed depression that you could feel hanging over the whole vast parade while the drum beat slowly a havildar and two naiks went along the ranks of the prisoners tearing the buttons off the uniform coats they had been half cut off beforehand to make the tearing easy and soon in front of the long grey line there were little scattered piles of buttons gleaming dully in the sultry light the grey coats hung loose like sacks each with a dull black face above it then the fettering began groups of armourers each under a british sergeant went from man to man fastening the heavy lengths of irons between their ankles the fast clanging of the hammers and the drumbeat made the most uncanny noise clinkclankboom clinkclankclinkboom and a thin wailing sounded from beyond the ranks of the native infantry keep those damned people quiet shouts someone and there was barking of orders and the wailing died away into a few thin cries but then it was taken up by the prisoners themselves some of them stood others squatted in their chains crying i saw old sardul kneeling smearing dust on his head and hitting his fist on the ground kudrat all stood stiff at attention looking straight ahead my halfsection pir ali who to my astonishment had refused the cartridge in the end was jabbering angrily to the man next to him ram mangal was actually shaking his fist and yelling something a great babble of noise swelled up from the line with the havildarmajor scampering along the front yelling chubbarao silence while the hammers clanged and the drum rolled you never heard such an infernal din old sardul seemed to be appealing to carmichaelsmith stretching out his hands ram mangal was bawling the odds louder than ever close beside where i was an english sergeant of the bombay artillery knocked out his pipe on the gunwheel spat and says theres one black bastard id have spread over the muzzle o this gun by jesus scatter his guts far enough eh paddy aye says his mate and paced about scratching his head tis a bad business though mike right enough i am niggers bad business oughter be a bleedin sight worse says mike pampered sods lissen em squeal if they ad floggin in the nigger army theyd ave summat to whine about touch o the catd ave them bitin each others arses never mind cartridges but all they gets the chokey an put in irons thats what riles me englishmen get flogged fast enough an these black pigs can stand by grinnin at it but somebody pulls their buttons off an they yelp like bleedin kids ahh says the other disgustin an pitiful pitiful i suppose it was if youre the pitying kind those patheticlooking creatures in their shapeless coats with the irons on their feet some yelling some pleading some indifferent some silently weeping but mostly just sunk in shame and out in front hewitt and carmichaelsmith and the rest sat their horses and watched unblinking im not soft but i had an uneasy feeling just then youre making a mistake hewitt thinks i youre doing more harm than good he didnt seem to know it but he was trampling on their pride and yet he could have seen the danger in the sullen stare of the watching native infantry they were feeling the shame too as those fetters went on and the prisoners wept and clamoured and old sardul grovelled in the dust for one of his fallen buttons and clenched it against his chest with the tears streaming down his face he was one i confess that i felt a mite sorry for when the fettering was done and the band had struck up the rogues march and they shuffled off dragging their irons as they were herded away to the new jail beyond the grand trunk road he kept turning and crying out to carmichaelsmith it reminded me somehow of how my old guvnor had wept and pleaded when i saw him off for the last time to the bluedevil factory in the country where he died bawling with delirium tremens damned depressing and as i walked my pony off with the four other loyal skirmishers and glanced at their smug black faces i thought well you bloody toadies after all they were hindoos i wasnt however i soon worked off my glums back at duff masons bungalow by lashing the backside off one of the bearers whod lost his oilfunnel and then i had to be on hand for the dinner that was being given for carmichaelsmith that night and mrs leslie dressed up to the nines for the occasion was murmuring with a meaning look that she intended to have a long ride in the country next day so i must see picnic prepared and there were the mateys to chase and the kitchenstaff to swear at and little miss langley the ridingmasters daughter to chivvy respectfully away she was a pretty wee thing seven years old and a favourite of miss blanches but she was the damnedest nuisance when she came round the back verandah in the evenings to play keeping the servants from their work and being given sugar cakes with all this id soon forgotten about the punishment parade until after dinner when duffmason and carmichaelsmith and archdale wilson had taken their pegs and cheroots on to the verandah and i heard smiths voice suddenly raised unusually loud i stopped a matey who was taking out a tray to them and took it myself so i was just in time to hear smith saying of all the damned rubbish i ever heard who is this havildar then imtiaz ahmed and hes a good man sir it was young gough mighty red in the face and carrying his crop for all he was in dinner kit damned good croaker you mean snaps smith angrily and you stand there and tell me that he has given you this cockandbull about the cavalry plotting to march on the jail and set the prisoners free utter stuff and youre a fool for listening to i beg your pardon sir says gough but ive been to the jail and it looks ugly and ive been to barracks the men are in a bad way and now now now says wilson easy there young fellow you dont know em perhaps as well as we do of course theyre in a bad way what theyve seen their comrades marched off in irons and theyre upset theyre like that theyll cry their eyes out half of em all right makarram khan says he spotting me at the buffet you can go so that was all i heard for what it was worth and since nothing happened that night it didnt seem to be worth too much next morning mrs leslie wanted to make an early start so i fortified myself against what was sure to be a taxing day with half a dozen raw eggs beaten up in a pint of stout and we rode out again to aligaut she was in the cheeriest spirits curse her climbing all over me as soon as we reached the temple and by the end of the afternoon i was beginning to wonder how much more hindoo culture i could endure delightful though it was i was a sore and weary native orderly by the time we set off back and dozing pleasantly in my saddle as we passed through the little village which lies about a mile east of the british town indeed i could just hear the distant chiming of the church bell for evening service when mrs leslie gave an exclamation and reined in her pony whats that says she and as i came up beside her she hushed me and sat listening sure enough there was another sound a distant indistinct murmur like the sea on a far shore i couldnt place it so we rode quickly forward to where the trees ended and looked across the plain straight ahead in the distance were the bungalows at the end of the mall all serene far to the left there was the outline of the jail and beyond it the huge mass of meerut city nothing out of the way there and then beyond the jail i saw it as i peered at the red horizon where the native cavalry and infantry lines lay dark clouds of smoke were rising against the orange of the sky and flickers of flame showed in the dusk buildings were burning and the distant murmur was resolving itself into a thousand voices shouting louder and ever louder i sat staring with a horrid suspicion growing in my mind halfaware that mrs leslie was tugging at my sleeve demanding to know what was happening i couldnt tell her because i didnt know nobody knew in that first moment on a peaceful warm may evening when the great indian mutiny began if id had my wits about me or more than an inkling of what was happening id have turned our ponies north and ridden for the safety of the british infantry lines a mile away but my first thought was gough was right some crazy bastards are rioting and trying to break the prisoners loose and of course theyll fail because hewittll have british troops marching down to the scene at once maybe theyre there already cutting up the niggers i was right and wrong you see but above all i was curious once my first qualms had settled so it wasnt in any spirit of chivalry that i sang out to mrs leslie ride to the bungalow directly memsahib hold tight now and cut her mare hard across the rump she squealed as it leaped forward and called to me but i was already wheeling away down towards the distant jail i wanted to see the fun whatever it was and i had a good horse tinder me to cut out at the first sign of danger her plaintive commands echoed after me but i was putting my pony to a bank and clattering off towards the outlying buildings of the native city bazaar skirting south so that id pass the jail at a distance and see what was happening at first there didnt seem to be much this side of the bazaar was strangely empty but in the gathering dark i could hear rather than see confused activity going on between the jail and the grand trunk shouting and the rush of hurrying feet and sounds of smashing timber i wheeled into the bazaar following the confusion of noise ahead the whole of the sky to my front beyond the bazaar was glowing orange now whether with fire or sundown you couldnt tell but the smoke was hanging in a great pall beyond the city its a hell of a fine fire thinks i and forged on into the bazaar between booths where dim figures seemed to be trying to get their goods away or darting about in the shadows chattering and wailing i bawled to a fat vendor who was staring down the street asking what was up but he just waddled swiftly into his shop slamming his shutters try to get sense out of an excited indian if you like then i reined up with a chico scampering almost under my hooves and the mother after it crouching and shrieking and before i knew it there was a swarm of folk in the street all wailing and running in panic stumbling into my pony while i cursed and lashed out with my quirt behind them the sounds of riot were suddenly closer hoarse yelling and chanting and the sudden crack of a shot and then another time to withdraw to a safer distance thinks i and wheeled my pony through the press into a sidealley someone went down beneath my hooves they scattered like sheep and then down the alley ahead of me running pellmell for his life was a man in the unmistakable stable kit of the dragoon guards bareheaded and wildeyed and behind him like hounds in full cry a screaming mob of niggers he saw me ahead and yelled with despair of course what he saw was a great hairy native villain blocking his way he darted for a doorway and stumbled and in an instant they were on him a clawing animal mob tearing at him while he lashed out yelling obscenities for an instant he broke free blood pouring from a wound in his neck and actually scrambled under my pony the mob was round us in a trice dragging him out bodily while i struggled to keep my seat there was no question of helping him even if id been fool enough to try they bore him up everyone shrieking like madmen and smashed him down on the table of a popshop holding his limbs while others broke the popbottles and slashed and stabbed at him with the shards it was a nightmare i could only clutch my reins and stare at that screaming thrashing figure halfcovered in the pop foam as those glittering glass knives rose and fell in seconds he was just a hideous bloody shape and then someone got a rope round him and they swung him up to a beam with his life pouring out of him in panic i drove my heels into the pony blundered to the corner and rode for dear life it was the shocking unexpectedness of it that had unmanned me to see a white man torn to pieces by natives perhaps you cant imagine what that meant in india it was something you could not believe even when you saw it for a few moments i must have ridden blind for the next thing i knew i was reining up on the edge of the grand trunk where it comes north out of meerut city gazing at a huge rabble pouring up towards the british town to my amazement half of them were sepoys some of them just in their jackets others in full fig down to the crossbelts brandishing muskets and bayonets and yelling in unison mat karo mat karo sipahi jai and the like slogans of death and rebellion there was one rascal on a cart brandishing ankleirons above his head and a heaving mass of sepoys and bazaarwallahs pushing his vehicle along yelling like drunkards beyond the road the native cavalry barracks were in full flame even as i watched i saw one roof cave in with an explosion of sparks behind me there were buildings burning in the bazaar and even as i turned to look i saw a gang of ruffians hurling an oillamp into a booth while others were steadily thrashing with clubs at the fallen body of the owner finally they picked him up and tossed him into the blaze dancing and yelling as he tried vainly to struggle out he was a human torch his mouth opening and closing in unheard screams and then he fell back in the burning ruin i dont know how long i sat there staring at these incredible things but i know it was dark with flames leaping up everywhere and an acrid reek pervading the air before i came to my senses enough to realise that the sooner i lit out the better of course i was safe enough in that i was to all outward appearance a native and a big ugly one at that but it made no sense to linger any moment there must be the sound of bugles up the road heralding a british detachment and i didnt want to be caught up in the ensuing brawl so i put my ponys nose north and trotted along the edge of the road with that stream of mad humanity surging in the same direction at my elbow even then i hadnt determined what it all meant but any doubts i might have had were resolved as i came level with the jail and there was a huge crowd clamouring and applauding round a bonfire and forming up in their prison dhotis but with their ankles freed were some of the prisoners i recognised gobinda and one or two others and a sepoy whom i didnt know was standing on a cart haranguing the mob although you could hardly hear him for the din it is done death to the goralog sahibs are already running away see the broken chains on brothers kill kill to the white town the whole mob screamed as one man leaping up and down and then bore the prisoners shoulderhigh streaming out on to the grand trunk towards the distant mall god i could see flames up there already out towards the eastern end there must be bungalows burning on this side of the mall beyond the nullah there was only one way for me to go behind was meerut city and the bazaar which was being smashed up and looted by the sound of things to my left lay the burning native barracks ahead between me and the british town the road was jammed with thousands of crazy fanatics bent on blood and destruction i waited till the press thinned a little and swung right heading for the nullah north of the jail i would cross the east bridge and make a long circle north past the mall to come to the british camp lines the first part was easy enough i crossed the nullah and skirted the east end of the british town riding carefully in the halfdark for the moon wasnt up yet it was quiet here in the groves of trees the tumult was far off to my left but now and then i saw little groups of natives servantwomen probably scurrying among the bushes and one ominous sign that some of the killers had come this way an old chowkidar with his broken staff beside him lying with his skull beaten in were they butchering anyone then even their own folk of course any natives suspected of loyalty would be fair game including the goracolonels lapdog as ram mangal had charmingly called me i pressed on quickly not far behind me i could hear chanting voices and see torchlight among the trees the sooner i help help in gods name help us it came from my right a little bungalow behind a white gate and as i stopped uncertain another voice tied shut up tommy god knows who it is see the lights yonder but marys dead cries the first voice and it would have made your hair stand up shes dead i tell you theyve they were english anyway and without thinking i slipped from the saddle vaulted the gate and cried its a friend who are you oh thank god cries the first voice quickly theyve killed mary mary i glanced back the torches were still two hundred yards away among the trees if i could get the occupants of the bungalow moving quickly they might get away i strode up the verandah steps looked through the space where a chick had been torn down and saw a wrecked room with an oillamp burning feebly and a white man his left leg soaked in blood lying against the wall a sabre in his hand staring at me with feverish eyes are you he began and then yelled christ its a mutineer rd cavalry jim and i hadnt got my mouth open when out of the shadows someone sprang i had an instants vision of a white face red moustache staring eyes and whirling sabre and then i was locked with him crashing to the floor while i yelled you bloody idiot im english damn you but he seemed to have gone mad even as i wrestled his sabre from him and sprang away he yelled to his pal who feebly shoved his sabre towards him the next thing he was slashing at me yelling curses and i was guarding and trying to shout sense at him i broke ground fell over something soft and realised as i struck the ground that it was a white woman in evening dress or rather it was her body for she was lying in a pool of blood i flung up my sabre to guard another maniac slash but too late i felt a fiery pain across my skull just above the left ear and the fellow on the floor screams go it jim finish him finish the crash of musketry filled the room the fellow above me twisted grotesquely dropping his sabre and tumbled down across my legs there were black faces grinning at the window above me through the powder smoke and then they were in the room yelling with triumph as they drove their bayonets into the wounded tommy hacking at him smashing the furniture and finally one of them was helping me up shouting just in time brother thank the th ni sowar aieee three of the pigs god be praised have ye been at their goods then i was dizzy with pain so he dropped me and while they ransacked the bungalow growling like beasts i crawled out on to the verandah and into the bushes i lay there staunching the blood that was running down my cheek it wasnt a bad wound no worse than the schlager cut beside it which de gautet had given me years ago but i didnt come out even after theyd gone taking my pony with them i was too shaken and scared that idiot jim had come within an ace of fmishing me my god it had been jim lewis of course the veterinary id bowed him out of masons bungalow only a couple of nights before and now he was dead and his wife mary and i was alive saved by the mutineers whod murdered them i lay there still halfdazed trying to make sense of it this was mutiny no doubt of it and on the grand scale the rd cavalry were out of course and id seen th ni men under arms on the grand trunk the fellows whod inadvertently saved me were th ni so that was the whole indian garrison of meerut but where the devil were the two british regiments their lines werent more than a halfmile from where i was lying beyond the mall but although two or three hours must have passed since the rioting started there wasnt a sign of any activity by the authorities i lay listening to the crackle of firing and the distant tumult of voices and wrecking and burning there were no bugle calls no sound of volleys no shouted orders no heavy gunfire amidst the confusion hewitt couldnt just be sitting doing nothing a terrible thought struck me they couldnt have been wiped out surely no you cant beat two thousand disciplined soldiers with a mutinous mob but what the hell was keeping em quiet then in the long run i decided id have to make a break for at up to the mall and across towards the british infantry imes it would take me past duff masons bungalow and the macdowalls so i could see what was happening there though no doubt the people would have withdrawn already to the safety of the british camps yes i could see when i stood up that some of the bungalows south of the mall were burning and there was a hell of a din and shooting coming from the british town farther west i would have to keep well clear of that i moved cautiously through the trees and found the little drive that led up to the eastern end of the mall there was a bungalow burning like blazes a hundred yards ahead and half a dozen sepoys standing by its fence cursing and occasionally firing a shot into it on the other side of the road a crowd of servants were huddled under a tree and as i stole quietly towards them in the shadows i could hear them wailing that was surgeon dawsons bungalow as i came level with it i remembered that dawson had been down with smallpox he and his wife and children had all been confined to the house and there was its roof caving in with a thunderous whoosh of sparks i felt giddy and ill at the thought and then hurried on past that hellish scene the drive ahead was deserted as far as i could see in the light of the rising moon our bungalow wasnt burning anyway but just before i reached it my eye was caught by something on the verandah of the courtneys place across the way something was moving it was a human figure trying to crawl i hesitated fearfully and then slipped through the gate and up the path the figure was wheezing horribly it suddenly rolled over on its back and i saw it was a native servant with a bayonet buried in his chest as i stood appalled his head rolled and he saw me he tried to lift a hand pointing towards the house and then he flopped back groaning for the life of me i cant think what made me go inside and i wish i hadnt mrs courtney was dead in her chair shot and bayonetted with her head buried in the cushions and when i looked beyond i vomited on the spot her three children were there as well it was a sight to blast your eyes the place was like a slaughterhouse stinking with blood i turned and ran retching and didnt stop until i found myself stumbling on to duff masons verandah the place was still as death but i had to go in for i knew that in duff masons bottom deskdrawer there was a colt and a box of ammunition and i wanted them both as i wanted my next breath i glanced through the trees towards the dawsons burning home but there was no sign of approaching mutineers so i slipped through the chickdoor into the hall and there i fainted dead away something i havent done more than twice in my life the reason ill tell you quickly mrs leslies head was lying on the hall table her body stripped naked that same plump white body that id fondled only a few hours earlier was lying a few feet beyond unspeakably gashed and in the doorway to the diningroom mrs captain macdowall was huddled grotesquely against the jamb with a tulwar pinning her to the wall clenched in one hand was a small vase with the flowers it had held scattered on the boards i realised that she must have snatched it up as a weapon i dont remember getting duff masons revolver but i know that later i was standing in the hall keeping my eyes away from those ghastly things on the floor loading it with cartridges and weeping and cursing to myself together why why the hell should they do this i found myself blubbering it aloud ive seen death and horror more than most men but this was worse than anything it was beyond bestiality gobinda pir ali old sardul ram mangal even they couldnt have done this they wouldnt have done it to the wives of their bitterest enemies but it had been done if not by them then by men like them it was mad senseless incredible but it was there and if i tell you of it now it is not to horrify but to let you understand what happened in india in and how it was like nothing that any of us had ever seen before and none of us not even i was ever the same again you know me and what a damned coward and scoundrel i am and not much moved by anything but i did an odd thing in that house i couldnt bring myself to touch mrs leslie or even to look again at that ghastly head with its frizzy red hair and staring eyes but before i left i went to mrs captain macdowall and forced the vase from her fingers and i collected the flowers and put them in it i was going to set it on the floor beside her and then i remembered that carping scotch voice and her contemptuous sniff so i set it on a little table instead with a napkin under it just so i took one more look round at the wreckage of the place that my bearers had made the finest house on the station the polished wood scarred and broken the ornaments smashed the rug matted with blood the fine chandelier that had been miss blanches pride wantonly shattered in a corner and i went out of that house with such hate in my heart as ive never felt before or since there was something i wanted to do and quickly i had my chance in the next five minutes as i slipped up to the corner of the drive and looked westward along the mall the shots were still crackling in the british town were there any of our folk left alive down there i wondered how many bungalows burned or whole contained the same horrors that id found i wasnt going to look and i wasnt going a step farther either burning buildings screaming mobs death and wreckage they were all there ahead of me as i looked north through the trees i could see torchlight and hear yelling between me and the british lines whatever hewitt and carmichaelsmith and the rest of them were doing supposing they were still alive id now decided they could do without me all i wanted was to get out of meerut and away from that hell as fast as i could and find peace and safety and rest the hellish pain in my wounded head but first i must do what i lusted above all things to do and here came the chance in the shape of a trooper cantering along the mall swaying in his saddle singing drunkenly to himself as he rode behind him against the distant flames there were a few parties of sepoys straggling on the mall eastward the road was quite empty i stepped into the mall as he rode up he had a bloody tulwar in one hand a foolish animal grin on his filthy black face and the grey coat of the rd cavalry on his back seeing me in the same rig he let out a whoop and reined in unsteadily ramram sowar says i and forced myself to leer at him have you slain as many as i have eh and whose blood is that i pointed at his sword heeheeheehee giggles he lurching in the saddle is it blood it is whose why maybe it is carmikalismeets he waved the blade goggling drunkenly or hewitt sahibs nay nay nay whose then says i genially and laid a hand on his crupper ah now says he studying the blade the ridingmaster langley sahibs eh that son of a stinking mangy porkeating dog nay nay nay he leaned precariously from the saddle not langley heeheeheehee he will have no grandchildren by his daughter heeheeheehee and id chased her growling off the verandah just the previous night i had to hold on to his leather to keep my balance biting back the bile that came into my mouth i took another quick glance along the mall the nearest sepoys were still some distance off shabash says i that was a brave stroke and as he leered and chortled i brought my hand up with the colt in it aimed carefully just above his groin and fired he reared up and i clutched the bridle to steady the horse as he went flying from the saddle a second and i had it managed then i was up and in his place and he was threshing on the ground screaming in agony with luck he would take days to die i circled him once snarling down at him looked back along the mall at those distant black figures like dantes demons against the burning inferno behind them and then i was thundering eastward past the last bungalows and the sights and sounds of horror were fading behind me god knows how far i rode that night probably no great distance i dont think i was quite right in the head partly from the shock of what id seen but much more from the pain of my wound which began to act up most damnably it felt as though my left temple was wide open and white heat was getting into my brain i could hardly see out of my left eye and was haunted by the fear that the cut would send me blind i had enough sense though to know which way i wanted to go south by east at first to skirt meerut city and then south by west until i struck the delhi road at a safe distance delhi meant the safety of a great british garrison and since there were telegraph lines between it and meerut i felt certain that id meet help coming along it i wasnt to know that the fool hewitt hadnt even sent a message to tell of the meerut outbreak so that was the course i followed halfblind with pain and constantly losing my bearings even in the bright moonlight so that i had to stop and cast about among the groves and hamlets i forged ahead and when i came on the delhi road at last what did i see but two companies of sepoys tramping along under the moon in fair order singing and chanting as they went with their muskets slung and the havildars calling the step for an instant i thought they must be reliefs from delhi and then it dawned on me that they were marching in the wrong direction but i was too done up to care i just sat my pony by the roadside and when they spotted me half a dozen of them broke ranks crying that it was a rd cavalryman and cheering me until they saw the blood on my face and coat then they helped me down and sponged my head and gave me a drink and their havildar says youre in no case to catch your pultan tonight bhai they must be halfway to delhi by now at which the rest of them cheered and threw up their hats are they so says i wondering what the devil he meant aye first among the loot as usual cries another they have the advantage of us on their ponies but well be there too and they all cheered and laughed again black faces with grinning white teeth looking down at me even in my bemused state this seemed to mean only one thing has delhi fallen then i asked and the havildar says not yet but the three regiments there would surely rise and with the whole of the meerut garrison marching to help them the sahibs would be overthrown and slaughtered within the day we were only the beginning says he sponging away at my wound soon delhi then agra cawnpore jaipur aye and calcutta itself the madras army is on the move also and from one end of the grand trunk to the other the sahibs have been driven into their compounds like mice into their holes the north is rising there lie still man there will be sahibs enough for your knifeedge when your wound is healed best come with us if you can travel see we hold together in good company like soldiers lest the sahibs send out riders who may snap us up piecemeal no no says i struggling up ill ride on to join my pultan and despite their protests i clambered on to my pony again he thirsts for white blood shouts one shabash sowar but leave enough for the rest of us to drink i shouted something incoherent about wanting to be first in at the death and as they halloed encouragement after me i put my pony to a trot hanging on grimly and set off down the road the other company was yelling and singing as i passed i remember noting that they were wearing flower garlands round their necks i carried on until i had distanced them my head splitting at every step and swelling up like a balloon and then i remember swinging off into the forest and blundering until i slumped out of the saddle and lay where i fell utterly exhausted when i came to if you can call it that i was extremely ill ive no clear idea of what followed except that there were long periods of confused dreaming and moments of vivid clarity but its difficult to tell one from the other im sure that at one point i was lying facedown in a tank gulping down brackish water while a little girl with a goat stood and watched me i can even remember that the goat had a red thread round its horns on the other hand i doubt if dr arnold truly did come striding through the trees in an enormous turban crying flashman you have been fornicating with lakshmibai during first lesson how often must i tell you there is to be no galloping after morning prayers sir or that john charity spring stood there foursquare shouting amo amas amat lay into him doctor the horny young bastard is always amoing hae nugae in seria ducent mala by god and then they changed into a wrinkled old native woman and a scrawny nigger with a white moustache she was holding a chatti to my mouth it felt hard and cold but it became suddenly soft and warm and the chatti was mrs leslies lips against mine and what was running into my mouth wasnt water but blood and i screamed silently while all the grinning faces whirled round me and the whole world was burning while a voice intoned cartridge is brought to the left hand with right elbow raised and then the old man and woman were there again peering anxiously down at me while i slipped into black unconsciousness it was in their hut that i finally came to myself with a halfhealed wound on my temple having lost heaven knows how much blood and weight verminous and stinking and weak as a kitten but with my head just clear enough to remember what had happened unfortunately it wasnt to prove quite so clear about thinking ahead ive since calculated that i lay ill and delirious in their hovel for nearly three weeks perhaps longer they didnt seem to know apart from being the lowest kind of creatures they were scared stiff of me and it wasnt until id prevailed on them to fetch someone from a nearby village that i could get any notion of what was happening they finally drummed up an ancient pensioner who shied off as soon as he saw me my cavalry coat and gear and my filthy appearance must have marked me as a mutineer par excellence but before he could get out of the door i had soothed him with my revolver held in a shaky hand and in no time he was crouching beside my charpoy babbling like the man from reuters while the rest of his village peeped through cracks in the walls shivering delhi had fallen he had been there and there had been a terrible slaughter of sahibs and all their folk the king of delhi had been proclaimed and now ruled all india it had been the same everywhere meerut bareilly aligarh etawah mainpuri the splendid sepoys had triumphed all along the line and soon every peasant in the land would receive a rupee and a new chicken the sahibs had tried to fall treacherously on the native soldiers at agra cawnpore and lucknow but there was no doubt that these places would succumb also two regiments of mutineers had passed through his own village last night with cannon to assist in the overthrow of agra everywhere there were dead sahibs obviously there would soon be none left in the world bombay had risen afghan fighters were pouring in from the north a great muslim jihad had been proclaimed fort after fort of the hated goralog was going down with fearful slaughter doubtless i had already borne my part excellent i would certainly be rewarded with a nawabs throne and treasure and flocks of amorous women what less did i deserve rd cavalry was i not doughty fighters he had been in the bombay sappers himself thirtyone years service and not so much as a naiks stripes to swell his miserable pinshun aieee it was time the mean corrupt and obscene sirkar was swept away some of his news would be exaggerated bosh of course but i couldnt judge how much and i didnt doubt his information about the local mutinies perhaps i was too ready to swallow his gammon about afghan invasion and bombay being in flames but remember id seen the stark staring impossible happen at meerut after that anything was credible after all there was only one british soldier in india for every fifty sepoys to say nothing of banditti frontiersmen dacoits bazaar ruffians and the like dear god if the thing spread there wasnt an earthly damned reason why they shouldnt swallow every british garrison cantonment and residency from khyber to coromandel and it would spread i didnt doubt it as i sat numb and shaking on my charpai cowards reasoning if you like but i dont know any other kind thank heaven at least it prepares you for the worst and there couldnt be much worse than my present situation plumb in the eye of the storm damnation of all the places to hide in what malign fate had taken me to meerut and how to get away my native disguise was sound enough but i couldnt skulk round india forever as a footloose nigger id have to fmd a british garrison a large safe one cawnpore not by a mile the whole ganges valley seemed to be ablaze north wasnt any good delhi was gone and agra on the brink south gwalior jhansi indore i found myself chattering the names aloud and repeating one over and over jhansi jhansi now you must remember i was in my normal state of great pusillanimity and halfbarmy to boot as a result of shock and the clout id taken otherwise id never have dreamed of jhansi two hundred and fifty miles away but ilderim was at jhansi and if there was one thing certain in this dreadful world it was that hed keep his tryst and would either wait for me at bull temple as hed promised or leave word and jhansi must be safe dammit id spent weeks with its ruler in civilised discussion and hectic banging she was a lovely wonderful girl and would have her state well in hand surely yes jhansi it was madness and i know it now but in my weak feverish state it seemed the only course at the time so south i went talking to myself most of the time and shying away from everyone and everything except the meanest villages where i put in for provisions i didnt stand on ceremony but just lurched in snarling and brandishing my colt kicking the cowed inhabitants aside and lifting whatever i fancied ive never been more grateful for my english public school upbringing than i was then whether i was unlucky or not i dont know but as i worked my way south past khurjah and hathras and firozabad over the river and down past gohad to the jhansi border everything i saw confirmed my worst fears i must have skulked in the brush a dozen times to avoid bands of sepoys one of em a full regiment blow me with colours and band tootling away but plainly mutineers from the din they made and the slovenly way they marched i know now that there were britishheld towns and stations along the way and even bands of our cavalry scouring the country but i never ran across them what i did see was a sickening trail of death burnedout bungalows looted villages bodies all swollen up and halfeaten by vultures and jackals i remember one little garden beside a pretty house and three skeletons among the flowers picked clean by ants i daresay two were fullgrown and one was a baby now and then i would see smoke on the horizon or over the trees and crowds of villagers fleeing with their miserable belongings it was like the end of the world to me then and if youd known india youd have thought the same imagine it in kent or hampshire for thats how it seemed to us fortunately thanks to my curiously lightheaded condition my recollections of that wandering ride are not too clear it wasnt until the very morning that i came down out of the low hills to jhansi city and saw the distant fortcrowned rock above the town that my mind seemed to give a little snap i remember sitting my pony with my brain clearing understanding what id done and why i was here breaking out in a sweat at my own temerity and then realising that id perhaps done the wise thing after all it all looked peaceful enough although i was on the wrong side of the city to see the british cantonment i decided to lie up during the afternoon and then slip into bull temple which was not far from the jokan bagh a garden of little beehive temples not far outside the town if ilderims messenger wasnt there by sundown id scout the cantonment and if all was well id ride in and report myself to skene the sun was just slipping away and the shadows lengthening when i skirted the woods where lakshmibais pavilion lay who knows thinks i perhaps well dance another haymarket hornpipe before long and came down to bull temple just after dusk i didnt see a soul as i came but i was cheered by the sound of a buglecall in the distance and i was pressing ahead more boldly up towards the temple ruin when someone clicked his tongue in the shadows and i reined up sharply who goes there says i fingering the colt and a man lounged out spreading his hands to show they were empty he was a pathan skullcap and pyjamys and all and as he came to my horses head i recognised the sowar whod given me his gear and pony when id left jhansi rafik tamwar flashman husoor says he softly ilderim said you would come and without another word he jerked his thumb towards the temple itself put his hands to his mouth and hooted softly like an owl there was an answering hoot from the ruins and tamwar nodded to me to go ahead ilderim is yonder says he and before i could ask him what the devil it meant he had dissolved into the shadows and i was staring uneasily across the tangle of weeds and broken masonry that marked the old temple garden there was a glare of firelight from the doorway in the halffallen shell of the dome and a man was standing waiting even at that distance i knew it was ilderim khan and a moment later i was face to bearded grinning face with him shaking with very relief as his one sound arm clasped me round the shoulders the other was bound up in a sling and he was chuckling in his throat and growling that i must have a pact with shaitan since i was alive to keep the rendezvous for we have heard of meerut says he as he drew me in to the fire and the halfdozen sowars crouched round it made space for us and delhi aligarh and the rest but what the blazes are you doing here says i since when have irregular cavalry taken to bivouacking in ruins when they have their own quarters he stared at me stopping in the act of throwing a billet on the fire and something in that look turned my blood to ice they were all staring at me i glanced from one grim bearded face to another and in a voice suddenly hoarse i asked what does it mean your officer henry sahib has anything ilderim threw the billet on the fire and squatted down beside me henry sahib is dead brother says he quietly and skene sahib and the collector sahib and all their women and their children also they are all dead i can see it now as vividly as i saw it then the dark hawkface silhouetted against the temple wall that glowed ruddy in the firelight and the bright stream of a tear on his cheek you dont often see a pathan cry but ilderim khan cried as he told me what had happened at jhansi when the news came of meerut that black hindoo bitch who calls herself maharani summoned skene sahib and says she needs must enlarge her bodyguard for the safety of her person and the treasure in her palace these being unquiet times she spoke very sweetly and skene being young and foolish gave her what she wished aye he even said that we of the free cavalry might serve her and kala khan took her salt and her money and two others with him but most of her new guard were the scum of the bazaar badmashes and kliftiwallahs and streetcorner tentoone assassins and the sweepings of the jail then two weeks ago there was stirring among the sepoys of the th ni and chapattis and lotus flowers passed and some among them burned a bungalow by night but the colonel sahib spoke with them and all seemed well and a day and a night passed then faiz ali and the false swine kala khan with a great rabble of sepoys and these new heroes of the ranis guard fell on the star fort and made themselves masters of the guns and powder and marched on the cantonment to put it to the fire but skene sahib had warning from a true sepoy and while some dozen sahibs were caught and butchered by these vermin the rest escaped into the little town fort and the memsahibs and little ones with them and made it good against the mutineers and for five days they held it do i not know for i was there with rafik tamwar and shadman khan and muhammed din whom you see here and i took this he touched his wounded arm the seventh time they tried to storm the wall they came like locusts growls one of the sowars round the fire and like locusts they were driven then the food was gone and the water and no powder remained for the bundooks says ilderim and skene sahib have ye seen a young man grow old in a week brother said we could hold no longer for the children were like to die so he sent three men under a white flag to the rani to beg her help and she she told them she had no concern for the english swine i dont believe it says i listen brother and believe for i was one of the three and muhammed din here another and we went with murray sahib to her palace gate him only they admitted and flung us two in a stinking pit but they told us what passed afterwards that she had spurned murray sahib and afterwards he was racked to pieces in her dungeon he turned to stare at me with blazing eyes i do not know it is what i was told only hear what followed and then judge thou he stared into the fire clenching and unclenching his fist and then went on when no word went back to skene sahib and seeing the townsfolk all comforting the mutineers and jeering at his poor few he offered to surrender and kala khan agreed and they opened the fort gates and trusted to the mercy of the mutineers it was then i saw the tear run down into his beard he didnt look at me but just continued gazing at the flames and speaking very softly they took them all men and women and children to the jokan bagh and told them they must die and the women wept and threw themselves on their knees and begged for the childrens lives memsahibs brother you understand such ladies as you know of grovelled at the boots of the filth of the bazaar i saw it he suddenly shouted and the untouchable scum these highcaste worms who call themselves men and will shudder away if a real mans shadow falls across their chattis these creatures laughed and mocked the memsahibs and kicked them aside i saw it i and muhammed din here for they brought us out to the jokan bagh saying see thy mighty sahibs see thy proud memsahibs who looked on us as dirt see them crawl to us before they die there is a furnace thriceheated waiting says one of the sowars remember that rissaldar sahib if they burn forever it will not be hot enough says ilderim they killed the sahibs first the collector sahib andrews sahib gordon burgess taylor turnbull all of them they held them in a row and chopped them down with cleavers skene sahib they slew last of all he asked to embrace his wife but they laughed at him and struck him and bade him kneel for the knife i will die on my feet says he with no regret save that i am polluted by the touch of dishonoured lice like you strike coward see my hands are tied and bakshish ali the jail daroga cut him down and through all this they made the women and children watch crying see thy husbands blood see baby it is thy fathers head ask him to kiss thee baby and then they killed the memsahibs in another row while the townsfolk watched and cheered and threw marigolds at the executioners and skene memsahib said to faiz ali if it pleases you you may burn me alive or do what you will if you will spare the children but they threw dirt in her face and swore the children should die one of the sowars says there will be a red thread round her wrist as for a ghazi and i says ilderim fought like a tiger and foamed and swore as they held me and i cried out shabash memsahib and heepheepheephoora as the sahibs do to comfort her and they cut her down he was crying openly now his mouth working and then they took the children twenty of them little children that cried out and called for their dead mothers and they cut them all in pieces with axes and butchers knives and there they left them all in the jokan bagh without burial hearing something however horrible can never be as ghastly as seeing it the mind may take it in but mercifully the imagination cant even while i shuddered and felt sickened listening i couldnt conjure up the hideous scene he was describing all i could think of was mcegans jolly red face as he told his awful jokes and little mrs skene so anxious in case her dress was wrong for the collectors dinner and andrews talking about keatss poetry and skene saying it wasnt a patch on burns and that dainty little wilton girl singing bobbitybobbitybob along with me and laughing till she was breathless it didnt seem possible they were all dead cut down like beasts in a slaughterhouse yet what shocked me most i think was to see that great gilzai warrior whom you could have roasted alive and got nothing but taunts and curses sobbing like a child there was nothing to say after a moment i asked him how he came to be still alive they put muhammed and me in the jail with promises of death by torture but these others of my troop broke us out at night and we escaped until yesterday we hid in the woods but then the mutineers departed god knows whither and we came here shadman and two others have gone for horses we wait for them and for thee brother he wiped his face and forced a grin and gripped me by the shoulder but the rani then god send that fair foulness a lover made of redhot metal to bed her through eternity says he and spat she is in her citadel yonder while kala khan marshals her guard on the maidan perchance ye heard his bugles and sends out for levies to raise her an army for why hear this and laugh some of the mutineers chose sadasheo rao of parola as their leader he has taken karera fort and calls himself raja of jhansi in defiance of her he laughed harshly they say she will crucify him with his own bayonets god send she does then she will march against kathe khan and the dewan of orcha to bring t them under her pretty heel oh an enterprising lady this rani who knows how to take advantage of a world upside down and meanwhile they say she sends messages to the british protesting her loyalty to the sirkar rot her for a lying faithless female pidog maybe she is says i loyal i mean very well i dont doubt your story or what you saw and were told but look here ilderim i know something of her and while ill allow shes deep ill not credit that she would have children slaughtered it isnt in her do you know for a fact that she joined the mutineers or encouraged them or could have prevented them the fact is i didnt want to believe she was an enemy you see ilderim glanced at me witheringly and bit his nail in scorn bloody lance says he ye may be the bravest rider in the british army and god knows thou art no fool but with women thou art a witless infant thou has coupled this hindoo slut hast thou not damn your impudence i thought as much tell me bloodbrother how many women hast thou covered in thy time and he winked at his mates what the devil dyou mean i demanded how many come as a favour to thy old friend eh whats it to you dammit oh well lets see theres the wife and er and ah aye ye have fornicated more times than i have passed water says this elegant fellow and just because they let thee have thy way didst thou trust them therefore because they were beautiful or lecherous well thou fool enough to think it made them honest like enough this rani has beglamoured thee well then go thou up and knock on her palace gate tonight and cry beloved let me in i shall stand under the wall to catch the pieces when he put it that way of course it was ridiculous whether she was loyal or not and i could hardly credit that she wasnt it didnt seem quite the best time to test the matter with her state running over at the edges with mutineers good god was there nowhere safe in this bloody country delhi meerut jhansi how many garrisons remained i asked ilderim and told him the stories id heard and the sights id seen on my way south no one knows says he grimly but be sure the sepoys have not won as they would have the world believe they have made the land between ganges and jumna a ruin of fire and blood and gone undefeated as yet they range the country in strength but already there is word that the british are marching on delhi and bands of sahibs who escaped when their garrisons were overthrown are riding abroad in growing numbers not only men who have lost their regiments but civilian sahibs also the sirkar still has teeth and there are garrisons that hold out in strength cawnpore for one a bare four days ride from here they say the old general wheeler sahib is in great force there and has shattered an army of sepoys and badmashes when shadman brings our horses it is there we will ride cawnpore i almost squeaked the word in consternation for it was back in the dirty country with a vengeance having come out of that once id no wish to venture in again where else says he there is no safer road from jhansi farther south ye dare not go for there are few sahib places and no great garrisons nor are there to the west over the jumna the country may be hot with mutineers but it is where thine own folk are and they are mine too and my lads i looked at the ugly villains round the fire hardbitten frontier roughnecks to a man in their dirty old poshteens and the big khyber knives in their belts by george id be a sight safer going north again in their company than striking out anywhere else on my own what ilderim said was probably true too cawnpore and the other river strongholds would be where our generals would concentrate i could get back among my own kind and shed this filthy beard and sepoy kit and feel civilised again wouldnt have to spin any nonsense about why id disappeared from jhansi either in supposed pursuit of ignatieff my god id forgotten him entirely and the thugs and all the rest my mission to jhansi pam and his cakes and warnings it was all chaff in the wind now forgotten in this colossal storm that was weeping through india no one was going to fret about where id sprung from or what id been doing i felt my spirits rising by the minute when i thought of the escape id had leaving jhansi in the first place i could say that even my horrible experience at meerut had been worth while thats another thing about being a windy beggar if you scare easily you usually cheer up just as fast when the danger is past well not past yet perhaps but at least i was with friends again and by what ilderim said the mutiny wasnt by any means such a foregone thing as id imagined why once our people got their second wind it would be the bloody rebels whod be doing the running no doubt with flashy roaring on the pursuit i tom a safe distance and i might have been rotting out yonder with the others at jokan bagh i shuddered at the ghastly memory of ilderims story or burned alive with the dawsons at meerut by jove things werent so bad after all right says i cawnpore let it be how was i to know i was almost speaking my own epitaph in the meantime i had one good nights sleep feeling safe for the first time in weeks with ilderims rascals around me and next day we just lay up in the temple ruins while one sowar went to scout for shadman khan who was meant to be out stealing horses for us it was the rummest fix to be in for all day we could hear the bugles tootling out on the plain where the ranis army was mustering for her own private little wars with jhansis neighbours ilderim reported in the evening that she had assembled several hundred foot soldiers and a few troops of maharatta riders as well as half a dozen guns not a bad beginning in a troubled time but of course with a treasury like jhansis she could promise regular pay for her soldiers as well as the prospect of orchas loot when she had dealt with the dewan with the second dawn came shadman himself cackling at his own cleverness he and his pals had laid hands on six horses already they were snug in a thicket a couple of miles from the town and he had devised a delightful plan for getting another half dozen mounts as well the hindoo bitch needs riders says he so i marched into her camp on the maidan this afternoon and offered my services i can find six old company sowars who will ride round jehannum and back for a rupee a day and whatever spoil the campaign promises says i to the noseless pig who is master of her cavalry if ye have six good beasts to put under them we have horses and to spare says he bring me your six sowars and they shall have five rupees a man down payment and a carbine and embroidered saddlecloth apiece i beat him up to ten rupees each so tomorrow let six of us join her cavalry and at nightfall we shall unjoin and meet thee rissaldar and all ride off rejoicing is it not a brave scheme and will cost this slut of a rani sixty rupees as well as her steeds and furniture theres nothing as gleeful as a pathan when hes doing the dirty they slapped their knees in approval and five of them went off with him that afternoon ilderim and i and the remaining three waited until nightfall and then set off on foot to the thicket where we were to rendezvous there were the first six horses and a sowar waiting and round about midnight shadman and his companions came clattering out of the dark to join us crowing with laughter not only had they lifted the six horses they had cut the lines of a score more slit the throat of the cavalrymaster as he lay asleep and set fire to the fodderstore just to keep the ranis army happy well enough growls ilderim when he had snarled them to silence it will do till we ride to jhansi again some day there is a debt to pay at the jokan bagh is there not bloodbrother he gripped my shoulder for a moment as we sat our mounts under the trees and the others fell in two by two behind us in the distance very black against the starlit purple of the night sky was the outline of the jhansi fortress with the glow of the city beneath it ilderim was staring towards it brighteyed i remember that moment so clearly with the warm gloom and the smell of indian earth and horseflesh the creak of leather and the soft stamping of the beasts i was thinking of the horror that lay in the jokan bagh and of that lovely girl in her mirrored palace yonder with its swing and soft carpets and luxurious furniture and trying to make myself believe that they belonged in the same world it will take more than one dead rebel and a few horses to settle the score for skene sahib and the others says he much more so to cawnpore walkmarch trot he had said it was a bare four days ride but it took us that long to reach the jumna above haminpur for on my advice we steered clear of the roads and kept to the countryside where we sighted nothing bigger than villages and poor farms even there though there was ample sign of the turbulence that was sweeping the land we passed hamlets that were just smoking blackened ruins with buzzing carcases human and animal lying where they had been shot down or strung up to branches and several times we saw parties of mutineers on the march all heading northeast like ourselves that was enough to set me wondering if i wasnt going in the wrong direction but i consoled myself that there was safety in numbers until the morning of the fourth day when ilderim aroused me in a swearing passion with the news that eight of our party had slipped off in the night leaving only the two of us with muhammed din and rafik tamwar that faithless thieving reiving son of a kabuli whore shadman khan has put them up to this he was livid with rage he and that other dungbeetle asaf yakub had the dawn watch they have stolen off and left us and taken the food and fodder with them you mean theyve gone to join the mutineers i cried not they we would never have woken again if that had been their aim no they will be off about their trade which is loot and murder i should have known did i not see shadman licking his robbers lips when we passed the sacked bungalows yesterday he and the others see in this broken countryside a chance to fill their pockets rather than do honest service according to their salt they will live like the bandits they were before the sirkar enlisted them in an evil hour and when they have ravaged and raped their fill they will be off north to the frontier again they have not even the stomach to be honest mutineers and he spat and stamped raging never trust an afridi says tamwar philosophically i knew shadman was a badmash the day he joined at least they have left us our horses that was little consolation to me as we saddled up with eleven hardy riders round me id felt fairly secure but now that they were reduced to three and only one of those really trustworthy i fairly had the shakes again however having come this far there was nothing for it but to push on we werent more than a days ride from cawnpore by my reckoning and once we were behind wheelers lines we would be safe enough my chief anxiety was that the closer we got the more likely we would be to find mutineers in strength and this was confirmed when a few hours after sunup we heard very faint in the distance the dull thump of gunfire we had stopped to water our beasts at a tank beside the road which at that point was enclosed by fairly thick forest either side ilderims head came up sharp at the sound cawnpore says he now what shall that shooting mean can wheeler sahib be under siege surely before i could reply there was a sudden drumming of hooves and round a bend in the road not two hundred yards ahead came three horsemen going like hells delight i barely had time to identify them as native cavalrymen of some sort and therefore probably mutineers when into view came their pursuers and i let out a yell of delight for out in the van was an undoubted white officer with his sabre out and viewhallooing like a good un at his heels came a motley gang of riders but i hadnt time to examine them i was crouched down at the roadside with my colt out drawing a bead on the foremost fugitive i let blaze and his horse gave a gigantic bound and crashed down thrashing in the dust his two companions swung off to take to the woods but one of the mounts stumbled and threw its rider and only the other won to the safety of the trees with a group of the pursuers crashing after him the others pounced on the two whod come to grief while i ran towards them yelling hurrah bravo you fellows its me flashman dont shoot i could see now that they were sikh cavalry mostly although there were at least half a dozen white faces among them staring at me as i came running up suddenly one of dooce are you going about dressed as a nigger for you say youre flashman says another he was wearing a pith helmet and spectacles and what looked like old cricket flannels tucked into his topboots well if you are an i must say you dont look a bit like him you ought to know me because harry flashman stood godfather to my boy at lahore in whats my name eh i had to close my eyes and think it had been on my triumphal progress south after the jalallabad business an irish name yes by god it was unforgettable otoole says i you did me the honour of having your youngster christened flashman otoole i trust hes well by god i did says he staring it must be him cheeseman here wheres colonel rowbotham i confess i was curious myself rowbothams mosstroopers was a new one on me and if their commander was anything like his followers he must be a remarkable chap there was a great rumpus going on in the road behind the group who surrounded me and i saw that one of the fugitives was being dragged up between two of the sikhs and thrown forward in the dust before one of the riders who was leaning down from his saddle looking at the still form of the fellow whose horse id shot why this ones dead he exclaimed peevishly of all the confounded bad luck hold on to that other scoundrel there here cheeseman what have you got is it some more of the villains he rode over the dead man glaring at me and i dont think ive ever seen an angrierlooking man in my life everything about him was raging his round red face his tufty brindle eyebrows his bristling sandy whiskers even the way he clenched his crop and when he spoke his harsh squeaky voice seemed to shake with suppressed wrath he was short and stout and sat his pony like a hog on a hurdle his pith helmet was wrapped in a long puggaree and he wore a most peculiar loose cape like an american poncho clasped round with a snakeclasp belt altogether a most ridiculous sight but there was nothing funny about the pale staring eyes or the way his mouth worked as he considered me whos this he barked and when cheeseman told him and otoole who had been eyeing me closely said he believed i was flashman after all he growled suspiciously and demanded to know why i was skulking about dressed as a native and where had i come from so i told him briefly that i was a political lately from jhansi where i and my three followers had escaped the massacre whats that you say cries he massacre at jhansi and the others crowded their horses round staring and exclaiming while i reported what had happened to skene and the rest even as i told it i was uncomfortably aware of something not quite canny in the way they listened it was a shocking story enough but there was an excitement about them in the haggard faces and the bright eyes as though they had some fever that i couldnt account for usually when englishmen listen to a dreadful tale they do it silently at most with signs of disgust or disbelief but this crowd stirred restlessly in their saddles muttering and exclaiming and when id finished the little chap burst into tears gritting his teeth and shaking his crop god in heaven cries he will it never cease how many innocents twenty children you say and all the women my god he rocked in his saddle dashing the tears away while his companions groaned and shook their fists it was an astonishing sight those dozen scarecrows who looked as though theyd fought a long campaign in fancydress costume swearing and addressing heaven it occurred to me that they werent quite right in the head presently the little chap regained his composure and turned to me your pardon colonel says he and if his voice was low it was shaking with emotion this grievous news this shocking intelligence it makes me forget myself rowbotham james kane rowbotham at your service these are my mosstroopers my column of volunteer horse sir banded after the rebellion at delhi and myself commissioned by governor colvin at agra commissioned by a civilian it sounded deuced odd but then he and his gang looked odd i gather sir that you aint er army he flew up at that we are soldiers sir as much as you a month ago i was a doctor at delhi his mouth worked again and his tongue seemed to be impeding his speech my my wife and son sir lost in the uprising murdered these gentlemen volunteers sir from agra and delhi merchants lawyers officials people of all classes now we act as a mobile column because there are no regular cavalry to be spared from the garrisons we strive to keep the road open between agra and cawnpore but since the mutineers are now before cawnpore in force we scour the country for news of their movements and fall on them when we can vermin he choked glaring round and his eye fell on the prisoner prone in the dust with a sikh keeping a foot on his neck yes cries he we may not be soldiers sir in your eyes but we have done some service in putting down this abomination oh yes youll see youll see for yourself cheeseman how many have we now seven sir counting this one cheeseman nodded at the prisoner here comes fields with the others now what i took to be the rest of rowbothams remarkable regiment was approaching down the road at a brisk trot a dozen sikhs and two englishmen in the same kind of outlandish rig as the others running or staggering behind their wrists tied to the sikhs stirrupleathers were half a dozen niggers in the last stages of exhaustion three or four of them were plainly native infantrymen from their coats and breeches bring them up here cries rowbotham violently and when they had been untied and ranged in a straggled line in front of him he pointed to the trees behind them those will do excellently get the ropes cheeseman untie their hands and put them under the branches he was bouncing about in his saddle in excitement and there were little flecks of spittle among the stubble of his chin youll see sir says he to me youll see how we deal with these filthy butchers of women and children it has been our custom to hang them in groups of thirteen as an appropriate warning but this news of jhansi which you bring this new horror makes it necessary makes it necessary he broke off incoherently twisting the reins in his hands we must make an immediate example sir this cancer of mutiny what let these serve as a sacrifice to those dead innocent spirits so cruelly released at jhansi he wasnt mad id decided he was just an ordinary little man suddenly at war ive seen it scores of times he had reason too i who had been at meerut and jhansi was the last to deny that his followers were the same while the sikhs threw lines over the branches they sat and stared their hatred at the prisoners i glanced along and noted the bright eyes the clenched teeth the tongues moistening the lips and thought to myself youve taken right smartly to niggerkilling my boys well good luck to you youll make the pandies sorry they ever broke ranks before youre done they didnt look sorry at the moment mind just sullen as the sikhs knotted the ropes round their necks except for one of them a fat scoundrel in a dhoti who shrieked and struggled and blubbered and even broke free for a moment and flung himself grovelling before rowbotham until they dragged him back again he collapsed in the dust beating the earth with his hands and feet while the others stood resigned cheeseman says shall we put em on horses sir makes it quicker no cries rowbotham how often must i tell you i do not wish to make it quicker for these these villains they are being hanged as a punishment mr cheeseman it is not my design to make it easy for them let them suffer and the longer the better will it atone for the atrocities they have wrought no not if they were flayed alive you hear that you rascals he shook his fist at them you know now the price of mutiny and murder in a moment you shall pay it and you may thank whatever false god you worship that you obtain a merciful death you who did not scruple to torture and defile the innocent he was raving by now with both hands in the air and then he noticed again the dead fellow lying in the road and roared to the sikhs to string him up as well so that they should all hang together as a token of justice while they were manhandling the corpse he rode along behind the prisoners examining each knot jealously and then so help me he whipped off his hat and began to pray aloud beseeching a merciful god as he put it to witness what just retribution they were meting out in his name and putting in a word for the condemned although he managed to convey that a few thousand years in hell wouldnt do them any harm then he solemnly told the sikhs to haul away and they tailed on the ropes and swung the pandies into the air the fat one screeching horribly he wasnt a mutineer i was certain but it probably wouldnt have been tactful to mention that just then the others gasped and thrashed about clutching at their halters now i saw why they hadnt tied their hands for three of them managed to clutch the ropes and haul themselves upwhile the others choked and turned blue and presently hung there twitching and swaying gently in the sunlight everyone was craning to watch the struggles of the three who had got their hands on the ropes pulling themselves up to take the choking strain off their necks they kicked and screamed now swinging wildly to and fro you could see their muscles quivering with the appalling strain five to one on the rajput says otoole fumbling in his pockets gammon says another hes no stayer ill give evens on the little un less weight to support you see neither of ems fit to swing alongside that artillery havildar we caught near barthana says a third remember the one old jk found hiding under the old womans charpoy i thought hed hang on forever how long was it cheese six and a half minutes says cheeseman he had his foot cocked up on his saddle and was scribbling in a notebook thats eightysix by the way with todays batch he nodded towards the struggling figures counting the three shot last night but not the ones we killed in the mainpuri road ambush should knock up our century by tomorrow night with luck i say thats not bad hollo otoole there goes your rajput bad luck old son five chips what told you my bantam was the form horse didnt i here hell be loose in a moment though look otoole pointed to the small sepoy who had managed to pull himself well up his rope getting his elbow in the bight of it and was tugging at the noose with his other hand one of the sikhs sprang up to haul at his ankles but rowbotham barked an order and then drawing his revolver took careful aim and shot the sepoy through the body the man jerked convulsively and then fell his head snapping back as the rope tightened someone laughed and sang out shame while another huzzaed and then they all had their pistols out banging away at the hanging figures which twitched and swung under the impact of the bullets take that you bastard there thats for little jane and that and that how dye like it now you black pig of a mutineer i wish you had fifty lives to blow away die damn you and roast in hell thats for johnson thats for mrs fox that that and that for the prices they wheeled their mounts under the corpses which were running with blood now blasting at them pointblank too bloody good for em cries the whitebearded chap in the straw hat as he fumbled feverishly to reload the colonels right we ought to be flaying em alive after what theyve done take that you devil or burning the brutes i say jk why aint we burnin em they banged away until rowbotham called a halt and their frenzy died down the smoking pistols were put away and the column fell in with the flies buzzing thickly over the eight growing pools of blood beneath the bodies i wasnt surprised to see the riders suddenly quiet now their excitement all spent they sat heavy in their saddles breathing deeply while cheeseman checked their dressing its the usual way with civilians suddenly plunged into war and given the chance to kill for the first time after years spent pushing pens and counting pennies theyre suddenly free of all restraint away from wives and families and responsibility and able to indulge their animal instincts they go a little crazy after a while and if you can convince em theyre doing the lords work they soon start enjoying it theres nothing like a spirit of righteous retribution for kindling cruelty in a decent kindly godfearing man i who am not one and have never needed any virtuous excuse for my bestial indulgences can tell you that now having let off steam they were sated and some a little shocked at themselves just as if theyd been whoring for the first time which of course was something theyd never have dreamed of doing proper little christians that they were if you ask me what i think of what id just witnessed well personally id have backed otooles rajput and lost my money however now that the bloody assizes was over and rowbotham and his merry men were ready to take the road again i was able to get back to the business in hand which was getting myself safely into cawnpore fortunately they were headed that way themselves since two weeks spent slaughtering pandies in the countryside had exhausted their forage and ammunition but when as we rode along i questioned rowbotham about how the land lay and what the cannonading to the north signified i was most disagreeably surprised by his answer it couldnt have been much worse news cawnpore was under siege right enough and had been for two weeks it seemed that wheeler unlike most commanders had seen the trouble coming he didnt trust his sepoys a damned inch and as soon as he heard of the meerut rising hed prepared a big new fortification in barracks on the eastern edge of cawnpore city with entrenchments and guns so that if his four native regiments mutinied he could get inside it with every british civilian and loyal rifle in the place he knew that the city itself a great straggling place along the ganges was indefensible and that he couldnt have hoped to secure the great numbers of white civilians women and children and all unless he packed them into his new stronghold which was by the racecourse and had a good level field of fire all round so when the pandies did mutiny there he was all prepared and for a fortnight hed been giving them their bellyful in spite of the fact that the mutineers had been reinforced by the local native prince nana dondu pant sahib whod turned traitor at the last minute rowbotham hadnt the least doubt that the place would hold rumours had reached him that help was already on its way from lucknow forty miles to the north and from allahabad which lay farther off east along the ganges this was all very well but we were going to have to run the gauntlet to get inside as i pointed out wouldnt it be better to skirt the place and make for lucknow which by all accounts was still free from mutiny he wouldnt have that though his troops needed supplies badly and in the uncertain state of the country he must make for the nearest british garrison besides he anticipated no difficulty about getting in his sikhs had already scouted the pandy besiegers and while they were in great strength there was no order about their lines and plenty of places to slip through hed even got a message in to wheeler giving him a time and signal for our arrival so that we could win to the entrenchment without any danger of being mistaken for the enemy for a sawbones he was a most complete little bandolero ill say that for him but what he said gave me the blue fits straight off plainly id jumped from the jhansi fryingpan into the cawnpore fire but what the devil could i do about it from what rowbotham said there wasnt a safe bolthole between agra and allahabad no one knew how many garrisons were still holding and those that were couldnt offer any safer refuge than cawnpore i darent try a run for lucknow with ilderim a rapid fearful calculation convinced me that there wasnt a better bet than to stick with this little madman and pray to god he knew what he was doing after all wheeler was a good man id known him in the sikh war and rowbotham was positive hed hold out easily and be relieved before long and that will be the end of this wicked abominable insurrection says he when we made camp that night ten miles closer to cawnpore with the distant northern sky lighting to the flashes of gunfire rumbling away unceasingly we know that our people are already investing delhi and must soon break down the rebel defences and pull that unclean creature who calls himself king off his traitors throne that will be to root out the mischief at its heart then when lawrence moves south from lucknow and our other forces push up the river this nest of rebels about cawnpore will be trapped destroy them and the thing is done then it will only remain to restore order and visit a merited punishment upon these scoundrels they must be taught such a lesson as will never be forgotten aye if we have to destroy them by tens of thousands he was away again on that fine rising bray which reminded me of the hangings that afternoon his troopers round the campfire growled enthusiastically hundreds ofthousands even nothing less will serve ifthis foulness is to be crushed once for all mercy will be folly it will be construed as mere weakness this sermon provoked a happy little discussion on whether when all the mutineers had been rounded up they should be blown from guns or hanged or shot some favoured burning alive and others flogging to death the chap in the straw hat was strong for crucifixion i remember but another fellow thought that would be blasphemous they got quite heated about it and before you throw up your hands in pious horror remember that many of them had seen their own families butchered in the kind of circumstances id witnessed myself at meerut and were thirsting to pay the pandies back with interest which was reasonable enough also they were convinced that if they didnt make a dreadful example it would lead to more outbreaks and the slaughter of every white person in india the fear of that and the knowledge of the kind of wantonly cruel foe they were up against hardened them as nothing else could have done it was all one to me i may say i was too anxious about coming safe into cawnpore to worry about how they disposed of the mutineers it seemed a trifle premature to me they were the rummest lot though when theyd tired of devising means of execution they got into a great argument about whether hacking and carrying should be allowed in football and as i was an old rugby boy my support was naturally enlisted by the hackers it must have been the strangest sight when i come to think of it me in my garb of hairy pathan with poshteen and puggaree maintaining that if you did away with scrimmaging youd be ruining the manliest game there was and the whitebearded wallah with the blood splashes still on his coat denouncing the handling game as a barbarism most of the others joined in on one side or the other but there were some who sat apart brooding reading their bibles sharpening their weapons or just muttering to themselves it wasnt a canny company and i can get the shivers thinking about them now they could soldier though how rowbotham had licked them into shape in less than a month beat me altogether but you never saw anything more workmanlike than the way they disposed their march next day with flank riders and scouts a twentypound forage bag behind each saddle all their gear and arms padded with cloth so that they didnt jingle and even leather nightshoes for the horses slung on their cruppers pencherjevskys cossacks and custers scalphunters couldnt have made a braver show than that motley gang of clerks and counter jumpers that followed rowbotham to cawnpore we were coming in from the east and since the pandy army was all concentrated close to wheelers stronghold and in the city itself we got within two or three miles before rowbotham said we must lie up in a wood and wait for dark before then by the way wed pounced on an outlying pandy picket in a grove and killed two of them taking three more prisoner they were strung up on the spot two more stragglers were caught farther on and since there wasnt a tree handy rowbotham and the sikh rissaldar cut their heads off the sikh settled his man with one swipe but rowbotham took three he wasnt much with a sabre we lay up in the stuffy sweltering heat of the wood all afternoon listening to the incessant thunder of the cannonading one consolation was the regular crash of the artillery salvoes which indicated that wheelers gunners were making good practice and must still be well stocked with powder and shot even after nightfall they still kept cracking away and one of the sikhs who had wormed his way up to within a quartermile of the entrenchment reported that he had heard wheelers sentries singing out alls well regular as clockwork about two in the morning rowbotham called us together and gave his orders there is a clear way to the allahabad road says he but before we reach it we must bear right to come in behind the rebel gun positions no more than half a mile from the entrenchment at precisely four oclock i shall fire a rocket on which we shall burst out of cover and ride for the entrenchment at our uttermost speed the sentries having seen our rocket will pass us through the word is britannia now remember for your lives that our goal lies to the left of the church so keep that tower always to your right front our rush will take us past the racecourse and across the cricket pitch oh i say says someone mind the wicket though and then we must put our horses to the entrenchment bank which is four feet high now god bless us all and let us meet again within the lines or in heaven thats just the kind of pious reminder of mortality i like i must say while the rest ofem were shaking hands in the dark i was carefully instructing ilderim that at all costs he must stick by my shoulder i was in my normal state of chattering funk and my spirits werent raised as we were filing out of the wood and i heard someone whisper i say jinks whats the time ten past three says jinks on the bright summer morning of june the twentysecond and lets hope to god we see the twentythird june twentythird i knew that date and suddenly i was back in the big panelled room at balmoral and pam was saying the raj will come to an end a hundred years after the battle of plassey next june twentythird by george there was an omen for you and now all round was the gloom and the soft pad of the walking horses and the reins sweating in my palms as we advanced interminably my eyes glued to the faint dark shape of the rider ahead there was a mutter of voices as we halted and then we waited in the stifling dark between two rows of ruined houses five minutes ten fifteen and then a voice called ready all there was the flare of a match a curse then a brighter glare and suddenly a rush of sparks and an orange rocket shot up into the purple night sky weaving like a comet and as it burst to a chorus of cries and yells from far ahead rowbotham shouts advance and we dug in our heels and fairly shot forward in a thundering mass there was a clear space ahead and then a grove of trees and beyond more level ground with dim shapes moving as we bore down on them i realised that they must be pandies we were charging the rear of their positions and it was just light enough to make out the guns parked at intervals there were shrieks of alarm and a crackle of shots and then we were past swerving between the gunpits there were horsemen ahead and either side and ilderim crouched low in the saddle at my elbow he yelled something and pointed right and i saw an irregular tumbled outline which must be the church to its left directly ahead little sparks of light were flashing in the distance the entrenchment defenders were firing to cover us someone sang out bravo boys and then all hell burst loose behind us there was a crashing salvo of cannon the earth ahead rose up in fountains of dust and shot was whistling over our heads a horse screamed and i missed by a whisker a thrashing tangle of man and mount which i passed so close that a lashing limb caught me smack on the knee voices were roaring in the dark i heard rowbothams frantic close up ride for it a dismounted man plunged across my path and was hurled aside by my beast behind me i heard the shriek of someone mortally hit and a riderless horse came neighing and stretching frantically against my left side another shattering volley burst from the guns in our rear and that hellish storm swept through us it was balaclava all over again and in the dark to boot suddenly my pony stumbled and i knew from the way he came up that he was hit a stinging cloud of earth and gravel struck me across the face a shot howled overhead and ilderim was sweeping past ahead of me stop i bawled my screws foundered stop blast you give me a hand i saw his shadowy form check and his horse rear he swung round and as my horse sank under me his arm swept me out of the saddle by god he was strong that one my feet hit the ground but i had hold of his bridle and for a few yards i was literally dragged along with ilderim above hauling to get me across the crupper someone cannoned into us and then as i pulled myself by main force across the crupper i felt a sudden shock and ilderim pitched over me and out of the saddle even as i righted myself on the horses back the whole scene was suddenly bathed in glaring light some swine had fired a flare and its flickering illumination shone on a scene that looked like a mad artists hell men and horses seemed to be staggering and going down all round me under the hail of fire throwing grotesque shadows as they fought and struggled i saw rowbotham pinned under a fallen horse only a few yards away cheeseman his face a bloody mask was stretched supine beside him his limbs asprawl ilderim with his left arm dangling was halfup on one knee clutching at my stirrup a bare hundred yards ahead the entrenchment was in plain view with the defenders heads visible and some ass standing atop of it waving his hat behind us the red explosions of the cannon suddenly died and to my horror i saw pounding out under the umbrella of light cast by the flare a straggling line of riders sepoy cavalry with their sabres out bearing down at the charge and not more than a furlong away ilderim seized my stirrup and bawled on on ride brother didnt hesitate hed turned back to rescue me and his noble sacrifice wasnt going to be in vain if i could help it that was certain death bearing down on us i jammed in my heels the horse leaped forward and ilderim was almost jerked off his feet for perhaps five paces he kept up with the yells and hoofbeats growing behind us and then he stumbled and went down i did my damnedest to shake him free but in that instant the bloody bridle snapped and i hurled out of the saddle and hit the ground with a smash that jarred every bone in my body a shocking pain shot through my left ankle christ it was caught in the stirrup and the horse was tearing ahead dragging me behind at the end of a tangle of leatherwork which somehow was still attached to its body if any of you young fellows ever find yourself in this predicament where youre dragged over rough ironhard ground with or without a mob of yelling black fiends after you take a word of advice from me keep your head up and above all try to be dragged on your back it will cost you a skinned arse but thats better than having your organs scraped off try too to arrange for some stout lads to pour rapid fire into your pursuers and for a handy gilzai friend to chase after you and slash the stirrupleather free in the nick of time before your spine falls apart i was halfconscious and virtually buttockless when ilderim god knows wounded as he was where hed got the speed and strength hauled me up below the entrenchment and pitched me almost bodily over the breastwork i went over in a shocking tangle roaring britannia britannia for christs sake im a friend and then a chap was catching me and lowering my battered carcase to earth and inquiring will you have nuts or a cigar sir then a musket was being pushed into my hand and in shocked confusion i found myself at the rampart banging away at redcoated figures who came out of the smoke and dust and i know ilderim was alongside me relieving me of my revolver and loosing off shots into the brown all round there was the crash of volleys and a great bass voice was yelling odds fire reload evens fire reload the pain from my ankle was surging up my leg into my body making me sick and dizzy i was coughing with the reek of powder smoke there was a bugle sounding and a confused roar of cheering and the next thing i remember i was lying in the halflight of dawn with my back against a sandbagged wall staring at a big shottorn barrack building while a tall baldheaded cove with a pipe was getting my boot off and applying a damp cloth to my swollen ankle there were a couple of chaps with muskets looking on and ilderim was having his arm bandaged by a fellow in a kepi and spectacles there were others moving about carrying people towards the barrack and along the parapet there were haggardlooking fellows white and sepoy with their pieces at the ready a horrid smell seemed to hang over the place and everything was filthy with gear and litter all over the dusty ground and the people seemed to be moving slowly i was still feeling pretty dazed but i guessed it must all be a dream anyway for the chap third along the parapet to my left with a handkerchief knotted round his head was undoubtedly young harry east there couldnt be two snub noses like that in the world and since the last time id seen him id been pinned under a sledge in the snows of southern russia and he had been lighting out for safety it didnt seem reasonable that he should have turned up here ill tell you a strange thing about pain and cawnpore that ankle of mine which id thought was broken but which in fact was badly sprained would have kept me flat on my back for days anywhere else bleating for sympathy in cawnpore i was walking on it within a few hours suffering damnably but with no choice but to endure itthat was the sort of place it was if youd had both legs blown off you were rated fit for only light duties imagine a great trench with an earth and rubble parapet five feet high enclosing two big singlestorey barracks one of them a burnedout shell and the other with half its roof gone all round was flat plain stretching hundreds of yards to the encircling pandy lines which lay among halfruined buildings and trees a mile or less to the northwest was the great straggling mass of cawnpore city itself beside the river but when anyone of my generation speaks of cawnpore he means those two shattered barracks with the earth wall round them that was where wheeler with his ramshackle garrison had been holding out against an army for two and a half weeks there were nine hundred people inside it when the siege began nearly half of them women and children of the rest four hundred were british soldiers and civilians and a hundred loyal natives they had one well and three cannon they were living on two handfuls of mealies a day fighting off a besieging force of more than three thousand mutineers who smashed at them constantly with fifteen cannon subjected them to incessant musketfire and tried to storm the entrenchment the defenders lost over two hundred dead in the first fortnight men women and children from gunfire heat and disease the hospital barrack had been burned to ashes with the casualties inside and of the three hundred left fit to fight more than half were wounded or ill they worked the guns and manned the wall with muskets and bayonets and whatever they could lay hands on this i discovered to my horror was the place id fled to for safety the stronghold which rowbotham had boasted was being held with such splendid ease it was being held by starved ghosts half of whom had never fired a musket before with their women and children dying by inches in the shottorn stifling barrack behind them in the certainty that unless help came quickly that entrenchment would be their common grave rowbotham never lived to discover how mistaken hed been he and half his troop were lying stark out on the plain his final miscalculation having been to time our rush to coincide with a pandy assault i was the senior officer of those whod got safely inside and when theyd discovered who i was and bound up my ankle i was helped into the little curtained corner of the remaining barrack where wheeler had his office we stared at each other in disbelief he because i was still looking like abdul the bulbul and i because in place of the stalwart brisk commander id known ten years ago there was now a haggard sunken ancient with his grimy grizzled face his uniform coat torn and filthy and his breeches held up with string he looked like a dead gardener good god youre never young harry flashman was his greeting to me yes you are though where the dooce did you spring from i told him and in the short time i took to tell him about meerut and jhansi no fewer than three roundshot hit the building shaking the plaster wheeler just brushed the debris absently off his table and then says well thank god for twenty more men though what well feed you on i cannot think still what matter a few more mouths you sec the plight were in youve heard nothing of our people advancing from allahabad or lucknow i said i hadnt and he looked round at his chief officers vibart and moore and gave a little gesture of despair i suppose it was not be expected says he so we can only do our duty how much longer if only it was not for the children i think we could face it well enough still no croaking eh he gave me a tired grin dont take it amiss if i say im glad to see you flashman and will welcome your presence in our council in the meantime the best service you can do is to take a place at the parapet moore here will show you god bless you says he shaking hands and it was from moore a tall fairhaired captain with his arm in a bloodsmeared sling that i learned of what had been happening in the past two weeks and how truly desperate our plight was it may read stark enough but the sight of it was terrible moore took me round the entrenchment stooping as he walked and i hobbled for the smallarms fire from the distant sepoy lines kept whistling overhead smacking into the barrackwall and every so often a large shot would plump into the enclosure or smash another lump out of the building it was terrifying and yet no one seemed to pay it much attention the men at the parapet just popped up for an occasional look and those moving in the enclosure with their heads hunched down never even broke step if a bullet whined above them i kept bobbing nervously and moore grinned and said youll soon get used to it pandy marksmen dont hit a dam thing they aim at its the random shots that do the damage damnation this as a cloud of dust thrown up by a roundshot hitting the parapet enveloped us stretcher there lively now there was a body twitching close by where the shot had struck at moores shout two fellows doubled out from the barrack to attend to it after a brief look one of them shook his head and then they picked up the body between them and carried it off towards what looked like a well they just pitched it in and moore says thats our cemetery ive worked it out that we put someone in there every two hours over there thats the wet well where we get our water we wont go too close the pandy sharpshooters get a clear crack at it from that grove yonder so we draw our water at night jock mckillop worked it for a week until they got him heaven only knows how many weve lost on waterdrawing since what seemed so unreal about it and still does was the quiet conversational way he talked there was this garrison being steadily shot to bits and starving in the process and he went on pointing things out cool as dammit with the crackle of desultory firing going on around us i stomached it so long and then burst out but in gods name its hopeless hasnt wheeler tried to make terms he laughed straight out at that terms who with nana sahib look here you were at meerut werent you did they make terms they want us dead laddie they slaughtered everything white up in the city yonder and god knows how many of their own folk as well they tortured the native goldsmiths to death to get at their loot nanas been blowing loyal indians from guns as fast as they can trice em over the muzzles no he shook his head therell be no terms but what the devil i mean what whats going to come of it well i dont need to tell you of all people either a relief column wins through from allahabad in three days at most or well be so starved and short of cartridge that the pandies will storm over that wall then he shrugged but of course we dont admit that not in front of the ladies anyway however much some ofem may guess just grin and assure em that lawrence will be up with the rations any day what i wont trouble to describe my emotions as this sank in along with the knowledge that for once there was nowhere to bolt to and i couldnt have run anyway with my game ankle it was utterly hopeless and what made it worse if anything was that as a senior man i had to pretend like wheeler and moore and vibart and the rest that i was ready to do or die with the best even i couldnt show otherwise not with everyone else steady and cheery enough to sicken you ill carry to my grave the picture of that bloodsodden ground with the flies droning everywhere and the gaunt figures at the parapet the barrack wall honeycombed with the shots that slapped into it every few seconds the occasional cry of a man struck the stretcherparties running and through it all moore walking about with his bloody arm grinning and ailing out jokes to everyone wheeler with his hat on his head and the pistol through the cord at his waist staring grimfaced at the pandy lines and scratching his white moustache while he muttered to the aide scribbling notes at his elbow a cockney sergeant arguing with a private about the height of the pillars at euston square station while they cut pieces from a dead horse for the big copper boiler against the barrack wall stew today says moore to me thats thanks to you fellows coming in usually if we want meat we have to let a pandy cavalryman charge up close and then shoot the horse not the rider more meat on the orse than there is on the pandy eh jasper says the sergeant winking and the private said it was just as well since some noncoms of his acquaintance namin no names would as soon be cannibals as not these are the trivial things that stick in memory but none clearer than the inside of that great barrackroom with the wounded lying in a long sighing groaning line down one wall and a few yards away behind roughly improvised screens of chick and canvas four hundred women and children who had lived in that confined sweating furnace for two weeks the first thing that struck you was the stench of blood and stale sweat and sickness and then the sound the childrens voices a baby crying the older ones calling out and some even laughing while the firing cracked away outside the quiet murmur of the women the occasional gasp of pain from the wounded the brisk voices from the curtained corner where wheeler had his office then the gaunt patient faces the wearylooking women some in ragged aprons others in soiled evening dresses nursing or minding the children or tending the wounded the loyal sepoys slumped against the wall with their muskets between their knees an english civilian sitting writing and staring up in thought and then writing again beside him an old babu in a dhoti mouthing the words as he read a scrap of newspaper through steelrimmed spectacles a haggardlooking young girl stitching a garment for a small boy who was waiting and hitting out angrily at the flies buzzing round his head two officers in foul suits that had once been white talking about pigsticking i remember one jerking his arm to shoot his linen and him with nothing over his torso but his jacket an ayah smiling as she piled toy bricks for a little girl a stocky towheaded corporal scraping his pipe a woman whispering from the bible to a pallid goaneselooking fellow lying on a blanket with a bloody bandage round his head an old stern silverhaired memsahib rocking a cradle they were all waiting to die and some of them knew it but there was no complaint no cross words that i ever heard it wasnt real somehow the patient ordinary way they carried on it beats me i remember moore saying when i think how our dear ladies used to slang and backbite on the verandahs to see em now as gentle as nuns take my word for it theyll never look at their fellowwomen the same way again if we get out of this dont you believe it says another called delafosse its just lack of grub thats keeping em quiet a week after its all over theyll be cutting lady wheeler dead in the street as usual its all vague memory though with no sense of time to it i couldnt tell you when it was that i came face to face with harry east and we spoke but i know that it was near wheelers curtain where id been talking with two officers called whiting and thomson and a rather pretty girl called bella blair was sitting not far away reading a poem to some of the children i must have got over my funks to some extent for i know i was sufficiently myself to be properly malicious to him hallo flashman says he hallo young scud east says i quite cool you got to raglan i hear yes says he blushing yes i did good for you says i wish i could have come along but i was delayed you recollect this was all greek to the others of course so the young ass had to blurt it out for their benefit how wed escaped together in russia and hed left me behind wounded and the cossacks had got me of course he hadnt got the style to make the tale sound creditable to himself and i saw whiting cock an eyebrow and sniff east stuttered over it and blushed even redder and finally says im so glad you got out in the end though flashman i i hated leaving you old fellow yes says i the cossacks were all for it though i i hope they didnt i mean they didnt use you too badly that they didnt he was making a truly dreadful hash of it much to my enjoyment its been on my conscience you know having to go off like that whiting was looking at the ceiling by this thomson was frowning and the delectable bella had stopped reading to listen well says i after a moment its all one now you know i gave a little sigh dont fret about it young scud if the worst comes to the worst here i wont leave you behind it hit him like a blow he went chalkwhite and gasped and then he turned on his heel and hurried off whiting said good god and thomson asked incredulously did i understand that right he absolutely cut out and left you saved his own skin urn whats that says i and frowned oh now thats a bit hard no use both of us being caught and strung up in a dungeon and i stopped there and bit my lip that would just have meant the cossacks would have had two of us to play with wouldnt it doubled the chance of one of us cracking and telling em what they wanted to know thats why i wasnt sorry he cleared out i knew i could trust myself you see but lord what am i rambling about its all past i smiled bravely at them hes a good chap young east we were at school together you know i limped off then leaving them to discuss it if they wanted to and what they said i dont know but later than evening thomson sought me out at my place on the parapet and shook my hand without a word and then bella blair came biting her lip and kissed me quickly on the cheek and hurried off its truly remarkable if you choose a few words carefully how you can enhance your reputation and damage someone elses and it was the least i could do to pay back that pious bastard east between me and his own precious arnoldnurtured conscience he must have had a happy night of it i didnt sleep too well myself a cupful of horse stew and a handful of flour dont settle you especially if youre shaking with the horrors of your predicament i even toyed with the idea of resuming my pathan dress which i had exchanged for army shirt and breeches slipping over the parapet lame as i was and trying to escape but the thought of being caught in the pandy lines was more than i could bear i just lay there quaking listening to the distant crack of the rebel snipers and the occasional crump of a shot landing in the enclosure tortured by thirst and hunger cramps and i must have dozed off for suddenly i was being shaken and all round me people were hurrying and a brazen voice was bawling stand to stand to loading parties there a bugle was blaring and orders were being shouted along the parapet the fellow next me was ramming in a charge hurriedly and when i demanded what was the row he just pointed out over the barricade and invited me to look for myself it was dawn and across the flat maidan in front of the pandy gun positions men were moving hundreds of them i could see long lines of horsemen in white tunics dim through the light morning mist and in among the squadrons were the scarlet coats and white breeches of native infantry even as i looked there was the red winking of fire from the gun positions and then the crash of the explosions followed by the whine of shot and a series of crashes from the barracks behind clouds of dust billowed down from the wall to the accompaniment of yells and oaths and a chorus of wails from the children a kettledrum was clashing and here were the loading parties civilians and followers and even some of the women and a couple of bhistis and then wheeler himself with moore at his heels bawling orders and behind him on the barrackroof the torn union jack was being hauled up to flap limply in the warm dawn air theyre coming rot em says the man next to me look at em yonder th ni madras fusiliers an bengal cavalry too dont i know it those are my own fellows blast the scoundrels or were all right my bucks your old ridingmasters waiting for you he slapped the stock of his rifle ill give you more pepper than i ever did at stables the pandy guns were crashing away full tilt now and the whistle of small arms shot was sounding overhead i was fumbling with my revolver pressing in the loads all down the parapet there was the scraping of ramrods and wheeler was shouting every piece loaded mind loading parties be ready with fresh charges three rifles to each man all right delafosse moore call every second man from the south side smartly now have the fireparties stand by sergeant grady i want an orderly with bandages every ten yards on this parapet he could hardly be heard above the din of the enemy firing and the crash of the shots as they plumped home the space between the parapet and the barracks was swirling with dust thrown up by the shot and we lay with our heads pressed into the earth below the top of the barrier someone came forward at a crouching run and laid two charged muskets on the ground beside me to my astonishment i saw it was bella blair the fat babu id seen reading the previous night was similarly arming the ridingmaster and the chap on tother side of me had as his loader a very fraillooking old civilian in a dustcoat and cricket cap they lay down behind us bella was pale as death but she smiled at me and pushed the hair out of her eyes she was wearing a yellow calico dress i recall with a band tied round her brows all standing to roars wheeler he alone was on his feet gaunt and bareheaded with his white hair hanging in wisps down his cheeks he had his revolver in one hand and his sabre stuck pointfirst in the ground before him masters i want a ration of flour and half a cup of water to each a terrific concerted salvo drowned out the words the whole entrenchment seemed to shake as the shots ploughed into it and smashed clouds of brick dust from the barracks farther down the line someone was screaming highpitched there was a cry for the stretchers the dust eddied round us and subsided and then the noise gradually ebbed away even the screams trailed off into a whimper and a strange eery stillness fell steady all it was wheeler quieter now riflemen up to the parapet now hold your fire until i give you the word steady now i peered over the parapet across the maidan there was silence too suddenly broken by the shrill note of a trumpet there they were looking like a rather untidy review the ranks of redcoated infantry in open order just forward of the ruined buildings and before them within shot the horse squadrons half a dozen of them well spaced out a musket cracked somewhere down the parapet and wheeler shouted confound it hold that fire dyou hear we waited and watched as the squadrons formed and the ridingmaster cursed under his breath sickenin says he when you think i taught em that as usual c troop cant dress thats havildar ram hyder for you look at em like a bloody paul jones take a line from the righthand troop cant you rest ofem look well enough though dont they there now steady up thats better eh the man beyond him said something and the ridingmaster laughed if they must charge us id like to see em do it proper for my own credits sake thats all i tore my eyes away from that distant mass of men and glanced round the babu flat on the ground was turning his head to polish his spectacles bella blair had her face hidden but i noticed her fists were clenched wheeler had clapped his hat on and was saying something to moore one of the bhistis was crawling on hands and knees along the line holding a chaggle for the fellows to drink from suddenly the distant trumpet sounded again there was a chorus of cries from across the maidan a volley of orders and now the cavalry were moving at a walk and then at a trot and there was a bright flicker along their lines as the sabres came out oh christ i thought this is the finish there seemed to be hordes of them advancing steadily through the wisps of mist the dust coming up in little clouds behind them and the crackle of the sharpshooters started up again the bullets whining overhead steady all roars wheeler again wait for the word remember i had laid by my revolver and had my musket up on the parapet my mouth was so dry i couldnt swallow i was remembering those masses of horsemen that had poured down from the causeway heights at balaclava and how disciplined fire had stopped them in their tracks but those had been campbells highlanders shooting then and we had nothing but a straggling line of sick crocks and civilians they must break over us like a wave brushing past our feeble volleys take aim yells wheeler make every shot tell and wait for my command they were coming at the gallop now perhaps three hundred yards off and the sabres steady against the shoulders they were keeping line damned well and i heard my ridingmaster muttering look at em come though aint that a sight and aint they shaping well hold em in there rissaldar mind the dressing the thunder of the beating hooves was like surf there was a sudden yell and all the points came down with the black blobs of faces behind them as the riders crouched forward and the whole line burst into the charge they came sweeping in towards the entrenchment i gripped my piece convulsively and wheeler yelled fire the volley crashed out in a billow of smoke but it didnt stop them horses and men went down and then we were seizing our second muskets and blazing away and then our third and still they came into that hell of smoke and flame yelling like madmen bella blair ws beside me thrusting a musket into my hand and hurrying feverishly to reload the others i fired again and as the smoke cleared we looked out onto a tangle of fallen beasts and riders but half of them were still up and tearing in howling and waving their sabres i seized my revolver and blasted away there were three of them surging in towards my position and i toppled one from the saddle another went rolling down with his mount shot under him and the third came hurtling over the entrenchment with the man on my right slashing at him as he passed behind him pressed the others white coats black faces rearing beasts putting their horses to the parapet i was yelling incoherent obscenities scrabbling up the muskets as fast as they were reloaded firing into the mass men were struggling all along the entrenchment bayonets and swords against sabres and still the firing crashed out i heard bella scream and then there was a dismounted rider scrambling up the barrier directly before me i had a vision of glaring eyes in a black face and a sabre upraised to strike and then he fell back shrieking into the smoke behind me wheeler was roaring and i was grabbing for another musket and then they were falling back thank god wheeling and riding back into the smoke and the bhisti was at my elbow thrusting his chaggle at my lips stand to shouts wheeler theyre coming again they were reforming a bare hundred yards off the ground between was littered with dead and dying beasts and men i had barely time to gulp a mouthful of warm muddy water and seize my musket before they were howling in at us once more and this time there were pandy infantrymen racing behind them one more volley bawls wheeler hold your fire there aim for the horses no surrender ready present fire the whole wall blasted fire and the charge shook and wavered before it came rushing on again half a dozen of them were rearing and plunging up to the entrenchment the sabres were swinging about our heads and i was rolling away to avoid the smashing hooves of a rider coming in almost on top of me i scrambled to my feet and there was a redcoated black devil leaping at me from the parapet i smashed at him with my musket butt and sent him flying and then another one was at me with his sabre lunging i shrieked as it flew past my head and then we had closed and i was clawing at his face bearing him down by sheer weight his sabre fell and i plunged for it another pandy was rushing past me musket and bayonet extended but i got my hand on the fallen hilt slashing blindly i felt a sickening shock on my head and fell a dead weight landed on top of me and the next thing i knew i was on my hands and knees with the earth swimming round me and wheeler was bawling cease fire cease fire stretchers there and the noise of yelling and banging had died away while the last of the smoke cleared above the ghastly shambles of the parapet there seemed to be dead and dying everywhere there must have been at least a dozen pandies sprawled within ten yards of where i knelt the ground was sticky with blood wheeler himself was down on one knee supporting the fat babu who was wailing with a shattered leg the frail civilian was lying asprawl his cricket cap gone and his head just a squashed red mess one of the pandies stirred and pulled himself up on one knee wheeler his arm still round the babu whipped up his revolver and fired and the pandy flopped back in the dust the stretcher parties were hurrying up i looked out over the parapet across a maidan littered with figures of men that crawled or lay still there were screaming horses trying to rise and others that lay dead among the fallen riders two hundred yards off there were men running the other way thank god farther down the parapet someone sent up a cheer and it gradually spread along the entrenchment in a ghastly croaking yell my mouth was too dry and i was too dazed to cheer but i was alive bella blair was dead she was lying on her side her hands clutched on the stock of a musket whose bayonet was buried in her body i heard a moan behind me and there was the ridingmaster flopped against the parapet his shirt soaked in blood trying to reach for the fallen waterchaggle i stumbled over to him and held it up to his lips he sucked it groaning and then let his head fall back beat em did we says he painfully i could only nod i took a gulp at the chaggle myself and offered him another swig but he turned his head feebly aside there was nothing to be done for him his life was running out of him where he lay beat em says he again dam good thought they was going to ride clean over us there for a moment he coughed blood and his voice trailed away into a whisper they shaped well though didnt they shape well my bengalis he closed his eyes i thought they shaped uncommon well i looked down the entrenchment about half the defenders were on their feet at the parapet i reckoned in between the sprawled silent figures the groaning writhing wounded waiting for the stretchers the tangle of gear and fallen weapons the bloody rags and now the pandy guns again pounding anew at the neardead wreck of the cawnpore garrison with its tattered flag still flapping from the mast well thinks i they can walk in now any time they like theres nothing left to stop em but they didnt that last great assault of june twentythird which had come within an ace of breaking us had sickened the pandies the maidan was strewn with their dead and although they pounded us with gunfire for another two terrible days they didnt have the stomach for another frontal attack if only theyd known it half the men left on our parapet were too done up with fatigue and starvation to lift a musket the barrack was choked with more than three hundred wounded and dying the well was down to stinking ooze and our remaining flour was so much dust we couldnt have lasted two minutes against a determined assault yet why should they bother when hunger and heat and the steady rate of casualties from bombardment were sure to finish us soon anyway three folk went mad as i remember in those fortyeight hours i only wonder now that we all didnt in the furnace of the barrack the women and children were too reduced by famine even to cry even the younger officers seemed to be overcome by the lethargy of approaching certain death for that wheeler now admitted was all that remained i have sent a last message out to lawrence he told us senior men on the second night i have told him that we have nothing left but british spirit and that cannot last forever we are like rats in a cage our best hope is that the rebels will come in again and give us a quick end better that than watch our women and little ones die by inches i can still see the gaunt faces in the flickering candlelight round his table someone gave a little sob and another swore softly and after a moment vibart asked if there was no hope that lawrence might yet come to our relief wheeler shook his head he would come if he could but even if he marched now he could not reach us in under two days by then well you know me gentlemen i havent croaked in fifty years soldiering and im not croaking now when i say that short of a miracle it is all up were in gods hands so let each one of us make his preparations accordingly i was with him there only my preparations werent going to be spiritual i still had my pathan rigout stowed away and i could see that the time was fast approaching when game ankle or no flashy was going to have to take his chance over the wall it was that or die in this stinking hole so i left them praying and went to my place on the parapet to think it out i was in a blue funk at the thought of trying to decamp but the longer i waited the harder it might become i was still wrestling with my fears when someone hove up out of the gloom beside me and who should it be but east flashman says he may i have a word with you if you must says i ill be obliged if youll make it a brief one of course of course says he i understand as sir hugh said it is time for each of us to make his own soul i wont intrude on your meditations a moment longer than i must i promise the trouble is my own conscience i need your help old fellow ih i stared at him trying to make out his face in the dark what the deuce please bear with me i know youre bitter because you think i abandoned you in russia left you to die while i escaped oh i know it was my duty and all that to get to raglan but the truth is he broke off and had a gulp to himself the truth is i was glad to leave you there its out at last oh if you knew how it had been tormenting me these two years past that weight on my soul that i abandoned you in a spirit of hatred and sinful vengeance no let me finish i hated you then because of the way you had treated valla when you flung her from that sledge into the snow i could have killed you for it he was in a rare taking no error a rugby conscience pouring out is a hell of a performance he wasnt telling me a thing i hadnt guessed at the time i know these pious bastards better than they know themselves you see i loved her you see he went on talking like an old man with a hernia she meant everything to me and you had cast her away so brutally please please hear me out im confessing dont you see and and asking for your forgiveness its late in the day i know but well it looks as though we havent much longer dont it so i wanted to tell you and shake your hand old schoolfellow and hear from you that my my sin is forgiven me if you can find it in your heart that is he choked resoundingly i i trust you can ive heard some amazing declarations in my time but this babbling was extraordinary it comes of christian upbringing of course and taking cold baths all of which implants in the impressionable mind the notion that repentance can somehow square the account at any other time it would have given me some malicious amusement to listen to him even in my distracted condition it was interesting enough for me to ask him dye mean that if i hadnt given you cause to detest me youd have stayed with me and let raglans message go hang whats that says he i i dont know what you mean i i please flashman you must see my agony of spirit im trying to make you understand please tell me even now what i can do well says i thoughtfully you could go and fart in a bottle and paint it what says he bewildered what did you say im trying to indicate that you can take yourself off says i youre a selfish little swine east you admit youve behaved like a scoundrel to me and if that wasnt enough you have the cheek to waste my time when i need it for prayer so go to hell will you my god flashman you cant mean it you cant be so hard it only needs a word i own ive wronged you terribly maybe in more ways than i know sometimes ive wondered if perhaps you too loved valla if you did and placed duty first he gulped again and peered at me did you love her flashman about four or five times a week says i but you neednt be jealous she wasnt nearly as good a ride as her aunt sara you should have tried a steambath with that one he gave a shocked gasp and i absolutely heard his teeth chatter then god flashman oh oh you are unspeakable you are vile god help you unspeakable and vile i may be says but at least im no hypocrite like you the last thing you want is for god to help me you dont want my forgiveness either you just want to be able to forgive yourself well you run along and do it scud and thank me for making it easy for you after what youve heard tonight your conscience neednt trouble you any longer about having left old flashy to his fate what he stumbled off at that and i was able to resume my own debate about whether it was best to slide out or stay in the end my nerve failed me and i curled up in the lee of the parapet for the night thank god i did for on the next morning wheeler got his miracle she was the most unlikely messenger of grace you ever saw a raddled old cheethee biddy with clanking earrings and a parasol drawn in a rickshaw ghari by two pandies with another couple marching as guard and a havildar out in front brandishing a white flag wheeler ordered a standto when this strange little procession was seen approaching the east corner of the entrenchment and went off himself with moore to meet it and a few minutes later word was passed for me and vibart who was up at my end of the parapet to present ourselves wheeler and the other senior men were grouped inside the parapet while the old wife fanning herself with a leaf and sipping at a chatti was sitting just outside with her escort squatting round her wheeler was holding a paper and glancing in bewilderment from it to the old woman as we came up someone was saying i wouldnt trust it a blasted inch why should they want to treat at this time oday tell me that and wheeler shook his head and passed the paper to vibart read that says he if what it says is true the nana wishes to make terms it didnt sink in at first i studied the paper over vibarts shoulder while he read it out halfaloud it was a brief simple note written in a good hand in english and addressed to wheeler as near as i recall it said to subjects of her most gracious majesty queen victoria all who are not connected with the acts of lord dalhousie and are willing to lay down their arms shall receive a safe passage to allahabad it was signed on behalf of nana sahib with a name i couldnt make out until vibart muttered it out azeemoolah khan he looked at wheeler then at the old woman and wheeler flapped a hand and says this is mrs jacobs of ah cawnpore city she has this note from azeemoolah himself in the presence of the nana howdeedo gentlemen says mrs jacobs bowing with a great creak of stays from her seat in the ghari such jolly weather we are having yess i dont like it says wheeler quietly turning his back so that she shouldnt hear the others grouped round us as whiting says why should he offer terms when he must know were at his mercy all he needs do is wait perhaps sir says vibart he dont know how reduced we are he let out a deep breath and we have our women and children to think of at this the others broke in in a fierce babble of low voices its a plot no it aint weve stood the bastards off this long its false i can smell nigger treachery a mile away why should it be treachery my god what have we to lose were done for as it is while i tried to keep my face straight and the delicious hope began to break over me we were saved for it seemed to me in that moment that whatever anyone said whatever wheeler felt he was going to have to accept any terms the pandies offered he couldnt refuse and doom the women and children in that stinking barrack to certain death however fearful of treachery he might be we were being offered at least a chance of life against the certainty of death he had to take it so i said nothing while they wrangled in whispers there by the parapet with every drawn face along the entrenchment on either side turned anxiously in our direction and that painted old harridan sitting under the canopy of her ghari nodding and bowing whenever anyone glanced at her and sure enough wheeler finally says whats your opinion colonel flashman the temptation to sing out take it you bloody old fool offer to crawl on your belly the whole way to allahabad was strong but i mastered it and looked pretty cool well sir says i its an offer no more theres nothing to be decided until weve tested it that shut them up true enough says wheeler but someone must talk to nana sahib says i it may be that all isnt well with him or that he thinks this siege aint worth the candle maybe his precious pandies have had enough thats it by god broke in delafosse but i went on very steady but we cant accept or turn him down flat till weve heard more than is written here and i tapped the paper in vibarts hand he hasnt approached us out of charity we may be sure well it may be treachery or it may be weakness lets look him in the eye it must have sounded well bluff flashy talking calm sense while others went pink in the face they werent to know id made up my trembling mind in the moment id read the note the trick now was to make sure that wheeler made up his and in the right direction for he was obviously full of suspicion about the nana and halfinclined to listen to the hotheads who were urging him to throw the offer back in the mutineers teeth you never heard such appalling nonsense in your life here we were doomed for certain being offered an eleventhhour reprieve and more than half the idiots in that impromptu council were for rejecting it out of hand it made my innards heave to listen thinks i this is going to need delicate handling however wheeler saw the sense of what id said and decided that moore and i should go to sec the nana and hear precisely what he had to say thank god he chose me i dont care as a rule to put my head into the lions den even under a flag of truce but this was one negotiation i wanted to have a large hand in i didnt want any hitches about the surrender for surrender if i had anything to do with it was what it was going to be all that mattered besides was that i should keep my credit intact so at noon moore and i were escorted through the pandy lines with mrs jacobs in her ghari jabbering about what a shame it was oah yess that the present unsettled state of affairs had prevented her getting up to the hills during the hot weather who she was by the way i never discovered she looked like a typical halfcaste bawd whod been employed as a gobetween because she was obviously neutral and inoffensive but i may be misjudging the lady the notorious nana sahib was waiting for us in front ofi great daytent in a grove of trees with a pack of servitors and minions attending him and a score of maharatta guardsmen in breastplates and helmets ranged either side of the great afghan carpet before his chair that carpet gave me an uneasy twinge it reminded me of the one on which id seen mcnaghten seized and chopped up outside kabul at just such a meeting as this however moore and i put out our chests and looked down our noses as true britons ought to do in the presence of rebellious niggers who happen to have the drop on them nana himself was a burly fatfaced rascal with curly mustachioes and a shifty look what they call a tung admi dressed in more silks and jewels than a french whore sliding his eyes across moore and me and whispering behind a plump hand to the woman beside him she was worth a lewd thought or two by the way one of your tall heavyhipped beauties with a drooping lower lip sultana adala they called her and im sorry i never got closer to her than twenty feet we exchanged a glance or two during that interview and let our mutual imaginations work ten minutes alone together would have done the rest on nanas other side sat a nondescript and nastylooking rascal who i gather was his brotherincrime tantia tope however the man who took things in hand was azeemoolah khan a tall handsome lightskinned exquisite in a clothofgold coat and with a jewelled aigret in his turban who stepped smiling across the carpet with his hand out moore promptly put his hands behind his back i contented myself by hooking my thumbs into my belt and azeemoolah smiled even wider and withdrew his hand with a graceful flutter rudi starnberg couldnt have done it better i gave him our names and he opened his eyes wide colonel flashman but this is an honour indeed it has always been my regret that i missed you in the crimea says he flashing his teeth and how is my dear old friend mr william howard russell it was my turn to stare at that i didnt know then that this azeemoolah was a travelled man who spoke french and english as well as i did had done diplomatic work in london and gone through our sillier society women like a mad stallion at the same time a charming clever politician whose urbanity masked a nature as appealing as a hooded cobras for the occasion he was acting as interpreter for the nana who spoke no english i told him fairly cool that we were there to receive his masters proposals at which he sighed and spread his hands well gentlemen it is a most distressing business and no one is more deeply troubled by it than his highness which is why he has sent his note to general wheeler in the hope that we can put an end to all this bloodshed and suffering moore interrupted at this to say that in that case it was a pity he hadnt sent his message earlier or stayed loyal in the first place azeemoolah just smiled but we are not talking politics are we captain moore we are looking at military reality which is that your gallant resistance is at an end one way or another his highness deplores the thought of useless slaughter he is willing if you will quit cawnpore to allow your garrison to depart with the honours of war you shall have all necessary food and comforts for your women and children and safe passage to allahabad it seems to me not an ungenerous offer the nana who obviously knew the purport of what was being said leaned forward at this smiling greasily and gabbled in maharatta azeemoolah nodded and went on he says that baggage animals are already being collected to carry your wounded to the river where boats will be waiting to take you all to allahabad i asked the question wheeler wanted asked what guarantees of safeconduct does he offer azeemoolah lifted his brows but are any necessary if we intended you harm we have only to attack or wait we know your situation you see believe me gentlemen his highness is moved simply by humanity the spirit of mercy whether it was deliberately timed or not i dont know but his words were interrupted by the most hideous scream of agony a drawnout bubbling wail from behind the grove of trees it rang out again and then died into an awful whimper of pain and i felt the hairs rise on my neck moore almost jumped out of his boots what in gods name was that says he maharatta diplomacy i imagine says i with a straight face and my innards dissolving someone being flayed alive probably for our benefit so that we could hear and take note but if his highnesss word is not sufficient azecmoolah went on blandly he would raise no objection to your carrying away your personal arms and shall we say twenty rounds a man with that you will hardly be at a greater disadvantage in the open than behind that pathetic breastwork but i repeat gentlemen his highness has nothing to gain by treachery quite the reverse it is repugnant to him and would be politically damaging i didnt trust the bastard an inch but i was privately inclined to agree with him wiping out a british garrison entire was one thing but he could do that anyway without luring us into the open on the other hand getting a british garrison to haul down its flag would be a real feather in his cap but azeemoolah was a mile too shrewd to say so for nothing would have been better calculated to stiffen wheelers resistance nana started to chatter again in maharatta while i tried to efface the memory of that awful scream by exchanging a long look or two with sultana adala it never does any harm azeemoolah heard him out and then addressed us again his highness asks you to reassure general wheeler and to add that while you are considering his most generous proposal he is instructing our troops to observe an armistice i myself will come tomorrow for general wheelers answer and that was that moore and i trudged back through the pandy lines and if anything was needed to convince me that surrender was imperative it was the sight of those glowering black faces at the gun emplacements and round the bivouacs they might look less smart and orderly than theyd done as loyal company troops but by god there were plenty of them and no signs of weakening or desertion it was touch and go though when we got back to the entrenchment and reported to wheeler what nanas proposals were he called a council of all the officers and we sat or stood crowded into the stifling corner of the barrack which was his office with the moaning of the wounded beyond the partition and the wailing of the children while we heard rehearsed again all the arguments that had been whispered to and fro that morning it frightened me i may tell you for wheeler was still smelling treachery and our younger sparks were in full cry against the notion of surrender weve held out this long cries delafosse and now theyre weakening tell him to go to blazes i say and ten to one hell raise the siege there were growls of approval at this until vibart says and if he dont raise it what then well not have a child or woman alive in this hellish place three days hence are you prepared to accept that are you prepared to accept a rebels word retorts elafossc while were in a defensive position here at least we can make sonic show against him and he may raise the siege or lawrence may march but once we accept his terms and step into the open were at his mercy and well have hauled down our flag to a pack of rebels says thomson bitterly how do we go home to england and tell em that at this some cried bravo and urged wheeler to answer nana with defiance but old ewart who was so sick that he had to attend the council lying on a stretcher wondered what england would say if we condemned hundreds of women and children to die in the useless defence of a couple of ruined mud buildings the older men nodded agreement but the youngsters shouted him down and delafosse repeated the argument red in the face that nana must be weakening or hed never have made the offer wheeler whod been sitting tugging his moustache while they bickered looks at moore and me you saw his camp gentlemen what opinion did you form is he negotiating from weakness because his troops have lost heart id said nothing throughout i was biding my time and let moore answer he said wed seen no signs of flagging morale which was true enough wheeler looked glum and shook his head i cannot think the nana is to be trusted says he and yet it is a cruel choice all my nature every instinct tells me to fight this command to the last to die in my duty as a soldier should do and let my country avenge me but to do that at the cost of our loved ones lives already so many he broke off and there was an uneasy silence everyone knew that wheelers own son had died the day before finally he rubbed his face and looked round if it were ourselves alone there could be but one answer as it is i confess i should be tempted for our women and childrens sake to accept this murderers terms were it not that my judgement tells me he will play us false i forgive me sir says moore quietly but if he does weve lost nothing for if we dont trust him were dead anyway all of us we know that and at least we can die with honour cries some fool and the younger chaps cheered like the idiots they were at this wheelers head came up and i saw his stubborn lip go out and i thought now flashy nows your time or the stupid old bastard will damn us all in the name of duty and honour so i growled in my throat and scraped my heel and that caught his attention just in time and he looked at me youve said nothing flashman says he what is your thought i felt all their eyes turn to me and deliberately took my time for i knew wheeler was within an ace of deciding to fight it out to a finish and i was going to have to humbug him and the rest of them into surrendering but it was going to require my most artistic handling well sir says i like you i wouldnt trust the nana as far as the tuckshop but as moore here says that dont matter what does or so it seems to me is the fate of our ladies and the the youngsters if we accept the nanas offer at least theres a chance theyll come off safe youd surrender says wheeler in a strained voice for myself growls i and looked at the floor well i never quite got the habit goes against the grain i reckon matter of honour as someone said just now and i suppose it can be said that honour demands we fight it out to the last shabash cries delafosse well done flashy but dye know sir i went on the day my honour has to be maintained by sacrificing vibarts little boy or iunstalls mother or mrs newnhams daughter well i raised my head and stared at the circle of faces a strong simple man stirred to his depths you could have heard a pin drop i dont know i may be wrong but i dont think my honours worth that much dye know the beauty of it was while it was the most fearful gammon coming from me it was stark truth for the rest of them gallant and honourable souls that they were the irony was that for my own cowardly selfish reasons i was arguing the sane and sensible course and having to dress it up in highsounding bilge in order to break down their fatuous notions of duty reason wouldnt have done it but to suggest that the true honour demanded surrender for the women and childrens sake that shamed em into sanity old ewart put the final touch to it and that gentlemen you would do well to bear in mind he glared almost defiantly at delafosse is the opinion of the man who held pipers fort and led the light brigade wheeler put it to the formality of a vote but it was foregone now when moore and whiting voted to surrender even the fieriest of the younger men gave way and inside half an hour wheelers answer was on its way to nana agreeing to capitulate with the honours of war but he added the condition that we should not only keep our arms but sixty rounds a man instead of the proposed twenty then if there is treachery it will profit him little he told us and echoed the thought azeemoolah had expressed in the afternoon we can fight as well in the open as in this deathtrap that was all he knew he was still fearful of treachery you see i was not you may think i was deluding myself but the fact was i couldnt see that the nana had anything to gain by playing us false i state that honestly now and ive explained the details of the cawnpore surrender because it was a momentous thing not only in the mutiny but in indian history i had spoken and as ive said i believe mine was the decisive voice for surrender because i saw it as the only way to save my skin but apart from that vital consideration i still believe that surrender was right by every canon of soldiering and common sense call me a fool if you like and shake your heads in the light of history nothing could have been worse than fighting on in that doomed entrenchment whatever misgivings wheeler may have had hardly anyone else shared them when word got round of what had been decided and azeemoolah and jwala pershad had come to the entrenchment with the nanas undertakings all signed and witnessed draught animals were to arrive at dawn for the milelong journey to the river where boats would be waiting and throughout the night there was bustle and eagerness and thanksgiving all through the garrison it was as though a great shadow had been lifted cooking fires blazed outside the barrack for the first time in weeks the wounded were brought out of that stinking oven to lie in the open air and even the children frolicked on the parapet where wed been slashing at the sepoys two days before tired worn faces were smiling no one minded the dirt and stench any longer or gave a thought to the rebels massed guns and infantry a few hundred yards away the firing had stopped the fear of death had lifted we were going out to safety and throughout the night over the din of packing and preparation the sound of hymns rolled up to the night sky one of the few croakers was ilderim wheeler had told those sepoys who had remained loyal and fought in the garrison to slip away over the southern rampart for fear of reprisals from their mutinous fellows in the morning but ilderim wouldnt have it he came to me in the dark at the north entrenchment where i was smoking a cheroot and enjoying my peace of mind do i slip away like a cur when someone throws a stone at it says he no i march with wheeler sahib and the rest of you tomorrow and so that no pidog of a mutineer will take me for anything but what i am i have put this on for a killut and as he stepped closer in the gloom i saw he was in the full fig of a native officer of cavalry white coat gauntlets longtailed puggaree and all it is just a downcountry regiments coat which i took from one of those we slew the other day but it will serve to mark me as a soldier he grinned showing his teeth and i shall take my sixty rounds do thou likewise bloodbrother were not going to need em though says i and he shrugged who knows when the tiger has its paw on the goats neck and then smiles in friendship wheeler sahib does not trust the nana dost thou theres no choice is there says i but hes signed his name to a promise after all and if he breaks it the dead can complain says he and spat so i say keep thy sixty rounds to hand flashman sahib i didnt heed him much for pathans are notoriously suspicious of everyone reason or none and when day broke there was too much to do to waste time in thinking the mutineers came in the first mists of dawn with bullocks and elephants and carts to carry us to the river and we had the herculean task of getting everyone into the convoy there were two hundred wounded to be moved and all the women and children some of them just babesinarms and old people whod have been feeble enough even without three weeks on starvation rations everyone was tired and filthy and oddly dispirited now that the first flush of excitement had died away as the sun came up it shone on a strange nightmare sight that lives with me now only as a series of pictures as the evacuation of cawnpore began i can see the straggling mass of the procession the bullockcarts with their stretchers carrying the bloodstained figures of the wounded gaunt and wasted bedraggled white women either sitting in the carts or standing patiently alongside with children who looked like whitechapel waifs clinging to their skirts our own men ragged and haggard with their muskets cradled taking up station along the convoy the red coats and sullen faces of the mutineers who were to shepherd us across the maidan and down to the river ghat beyond the distant trees where the boats were waiting the dawn air was heavy with mist and suspicion and hatred as wheeler with moore at his elbow as always stood up on the rampart and reviewed the battered remnants of his command strung out along the entrenchment waiting listlessly for the word to move while all around was the confused babble of voices orders being shouted officers hurrying up and down elephants squealing the carts creaking children crying and the kites beginning to swoop down on the emptying barracks incidents and figures remain very clear two civilians hauling down the tattered flag from the barrack roof rolling it up carefully and bringing it to wheeler who stood absentmindedly with it trailing from one hand while he shouted sarnt grady is the south entrenchment clear sarnt grady a little boy with curly hair laughing and shouting plopplop as one of the elephants dropped its dung his mother a harassed young woman in a torn ballgown with a sleeping infant in her arms slapped and shook him with her free hand and then straightened her hair a group of mutineers walking round the barracks belabouring one of our native cooks who was limping along under a great load of pans a british private his uniform unrecognisable being railed at by an old memsahib as he helped her into a cart until she was settled when she said thank you my good man thank you very much and began searching her reticule for a tip four mutineers were hurrying up and down the untidy convoy calling out and searching until they spotted vibart and his family and then they ran hallooing and calling colonel sahib memsahib and seized on the familys baggage and one of them beaming and chuckling lifted vibarts little lad on to his shoulders piggyback while the others shouted and shoved and made room for mrs vibart in a wagon vibart was dumbfounded and two of the mutineers were weeping as they took his hand and carried his gear i saw another one at it too an old grizzled havildar of the th standing on the entrenchment gazing down into the ruin of the barracks with tears running down his white beard he was shaking his head in grief and then he would look no more but turned about and stared across the maidan still crying most of the mutineers werent so sentimental though one tried to snatch a musket from whiting and whiting flung him off snarling and shouting you want it do you ill give you its contents fast enough you damned dog if you dont take care the pandies fell back growling and shaking their fists and another gang of them stood and jeered while old colonel ewart was carried on a palki to his place in the line is it not a fine parade colonel sahib they were jeering is it not well drawn up and they cackled and made mock of the drill prancing up and down i didnt like the look of this a bit or of the menacinglooking crowd of pandies which was growing across the maidan promises or no promises it dont take much to touch off a crowd like that and i was relieved when moore who had hurried to the head of the column shouted and blew his whistle and the procession began to move creaking slowly away from the entrenchment and out on to the plain i was near the rear of the line where vibart had charge of the supplywagons behind us the pandies were already scavenging in the deserted barracks by god they were welcome to anything they could find it was about a mile to the river where the boats were but we were so exhausted and the convoy so haphazard and cumbersome that it took us the best part of an hour to cross the maidan alone it was a hellish trek with the mutineers trying to drive us along swearing and thrusting and our fellows cursing em back while wagons foundered and one or two of the garrison collapsed and had to be loaded aboard and the drivers thrashed at the beasts crowds of natives had come down from cawnpore city to watch and jeer at us and get in the way some of them and the more hostile pandies kept sneaking in close to shout taunts or even to strike at us and try to steal our belongings somethings going to crack in a moment thinks i and sure enough just as we were trying to manhandle one of the storewagons over a little white bridge at the far side of the maidan where the trees began there was a crackle of firing off to one side and sudden shouting and then more shots the driver of my storewagon tried to whip up in alarm a wheel caught on the bridge and i and two civilians were struggling to keep it steady when whiting comes up at the run cocking his musket and demanding to know what the row was in the same moment one of our corporals came flying out of the wood rolled clean under the wagon in front of us and jumps up yelling quick sir come quick them devils is murthering colonel ewart they got im in the trees yonder an whiting sprang forward with an oath but quick as light one of the mutineers whod been watching us at the bridge jumps in his way and flung his arm round him for a moment i thought oh god now theyre going to ambush us and the corporal must have thought the same for he whipped out his bayonet but the mutineer holding whiting was just trying to keep him back and shouting nahin sahib khabadar if you go there they will kill you let be sahib go on to the river whiting swore and struggled with him but the mutineer a big blackmoustached havildar with a chillianwallah medal threw him down and wrested his musket away whiting came up furious but the corporal understood and grabbed his wrist es right sir them swinell just sarf karot you like they done the colonel we got to git on to the river like e says otherwise maybe theyll do for everybody the wimmen an kids an all sir he was right of course id been through the same sort of retreat as this back in afghanistan and youve got to allow for a few stray slaughters and turn a blind eye or the next thing you know youll have a battle on your hands even whiting realised it i think for he wheeled on the havildar and says i must see will you come with me the fellow says han sahib and they strode into the trees it seemed a sensible time to be getting on down to the river so i told the corporal i must inform wheeler of what was happening ordered him to see the storewagon safely over the bridge and jumped up on to the coping running past the carts ahead with their passengers demanding to know what was happening i hurried on through the trees and found myself looking down the slope to the suttee choura ghat and beyond it the broad placid expanse of the ganges the slope was alive with people the foremost wagons had reached the landingstage and our folk were already getting out and making their way to the waters edge where a great line of thatched clumsylooking barges was anchored in the shallows the wagons nearer me were splitting away from the convoy to get closer to the water and everything was in confusion with some people getting out and others sitting tight already the ground was littered with abandoned gear the stretchers with the wounded were being unloaded just anywhere groups of women and children were waiting wondering which way to go while their menfolk red in the face and shouting demanded to know what the orders for embarkation were someone was calling all ladies with small children are to go in numbers twelve to sixteen but no one knew which barges were which and you couldnt hear yourself think above the elephants squealing and the babble of voices on either side of the slope there were groups of pandies with their bayonets fixed glowering but doing nothing to help and off to one side i saw a little gailydressed group of natives by a temple on a knoll azeemoolah was there talking to wheeler who was gesturing towards the barges so i walked across towards them through the silent groups of pandy riflemen and as i came up azeemoolah was saying but i assure you general the flour is already in the boats go and see for yourself ah colonel flashman good morning sir i trust i see you in good health perhaps general colonel flashman could be asked to examine the boats and see that all is as i have told you so i was dispatched down to the water and had to wade out through the shallows to the barges they were great mustysmelling craft but clean enough with halfnaked nigger boatmen in charge and sure enough there were grain sacks in most of them as azeemoolah had said i reported accordingly and then we set to with the embarkation which simply meant telling people off at random to the various barges carrying the women and children through the water bearing the stretchers of the wounded headhigh stumbling and swearing in the stinking ooze of the shallows i went under twice myself but thank god i didnt swallow any the ganges is one river you dont want to take the waters of it was desperate work gasping in the steamy heat as the sun came up the worst of it was getting the women and children and wounded properly stowed inboard i remember thinking it was ironic that my experience of packing howling niggers into the slaveship balliol college some years before should come in so handy now but there you are any special knowledge comes in useful sooner or later by god though the niggers had been easier to handle i reckon i must have carried twenty females to the barges plucked one weeping child from the waters edge where she was crying for her mama put my fist into the face of a pandy who was pestering mrs newnham and trying to snatch her parasol quieted an old crone who refused to be embarked until she was positive the barge she was going to was number and stood neck deep wrestling to replace a rotted rudder rope strange when youre working all out with things like that sweating and wrestling to make sense out of chaos you forget about death and danger and possible treachery all that matters is getting that piece of hemp knotted through the rudder stem or finding the carpetbag that mrs burtenshaws maid has left in the cart i was about done when i stumbled up through the litter of the bank for the last time and looked about me nearly all the command was loaded the barges were floating comfortably high on the oily surface and beyond them the last dawn mists were receding across the broad expanse of the river to the far bank half a mile distant with the eastern sun turning the water to a great crimson mirror there werent above fifty of our folk vibarts rearguard mostly left on the wreckstrewn mudchurned slope wheeler and moore and vibart were all together and as i came to them i heard whitings voice shaking with anger and he was shot on his palki i tell you half a dozen times at least those foresworn swine up yonder and he shook his fist towards the temple on the knoll where azeemoolah was sitting with tantia tope in a little group of the nanas officers there was no sign of nana himself though there is nothing to be done captain whiting wheelers voice was hoarse and his gaunt face was crimson and sweating he looked on the edge of collapse i know sir i know it is the basest treachery but there is no remedy now let us thank god we have come this far no no sir we are in no case to protest let alone punish we must make haste down the river before worse befalls whiting stamped and cursed but vibart eased him away the pandies who had lined the slope were moving down now through the abandoned wagons converging on the landingplace hollo flash says moore wearily like me he was plastered with mud and the sling was gone from his wounded arm they settled massie too did you know he and ewart protested when the pandies dragged off tour of our loyal sepoys so they shot em all out o hand like dogs beside the road cries whiting by god if id a gun he dashed the sweat from his eyes glaring at the pandies on the slope then he saw me flashman one of the sepoys was that pathan orderly of yours the big chap in the havildars coat they shot him in the ditch for a moment i didnt comprehend i just stared at his flushed raging face like a dog in the ditch cries he again and then it hit me like a blow he was telling me that ilderim was dead i cant describe what i felt it wasnt grief or horror so much as disbelief ilderim couldnt die he was indestructible always had been even as the boy id first met at mogala years ago one of those folk whose life is fairly bursting out of them i had a vision of that grinning bearded hawkface of just a few hours ago no pidog of a mutineer will take me for anything but what i am and hed been right and it had been the death of him but not the kind of death the great brave idiot had always looked for just a mean covert murder at the roadside oh you stupid gilzai bastard i thought why didnt you go over the wall when you had the chance come on moore was pushing at my shoulder well be last aboard were in the hollo whats that from the trees on the top of the slope a bugle sounded the notes floating clearly down to us i looked up the hill and saw a strange thing happening i suppose i was still shocked by the news of ilderims death but what i saw seemed odd rather than menacing the pandies on the slope and there must have been a couple of hundred of them were dropping to the kneeling firing position their muskets were at their shoulders and they were pointing at us for christs a voice shouted and then the hillside seemed to explode in a hail of musketry the balls were howling past i heard someone scream beside me and then moores arm flailed me to the ground and i was plunging through the ooze into the water i went under and struck out for dear life coming up with a shattering crash of my head against the middle barge overhead women were shrieking and muskets were cracking and then there was the crash of distant cannon and i saw the narrow strip of water between me and the shore ploughed up as the storm of grape hit it i reached up seizing the gunwale and heaved myself up and then the whole barge shook as though in a giant hand and i was hurled back into the water again i came up gasping the pandies were tearing down the slope now sabres and muskets and bayonets at the ready charging into the last of our shoreparty who were struggling in the shallows up on the slope others were firing at the boats and in the shade beneath the trees there was the triple flash of cannon sending grape and roundshot smashing down into the helpless lumbering boats men were struggling in the water only a few yards from me i saw a british soldier sabred down another floundering back as a sepoy shot him pointblank through the body and a third thrust through with a bayonet sinking down slowly on the muddy shore wheeler whitefaced and roaring treachery shove off quickly treachery was stumbling out into the shallows his sabre drawn he slashed at a pursuing sepoy missed his footing and went under but a hand reached out from the gunwale near me and pulled him up coughing and spewing water moore was in the water close by and vibart was trying to swim towards us with his wounded arm trailing as moore plunged towards him i sank beneath the surface dived and struck out beneath the boat and as i went i was thinking clear enough well flashy my lad you were wrong again nana sahib wasnt to be trusted after all i came up on the other side and the first thing i saw was a body falling from the boat above me overhead its thatch was burning and as a great chunk of the stuff fell hissing into the water i shoved away i trod water looking about me in the next two barges the thatches were alight as well and people were screaming and tumbling into the water i saw one woman jumping with a baby in her arms i believe it was the one who had cuffed the little boy for laughing at the elephants dung the shore was hidden from me by the loom of the barge but the crash of firing was redoubling and the chorus of screams and yells was deafening people were firing back from the barges too and in the one downriver from me two chaps were beating at the burning thatch and another was heaving at its tiller very slowly it seemed to be veering from the bank thats the boy for me thinks i and in the same moment the thatch of the barge immediately above me collapsed with a roar and a whoosh of sparks with shrieks of the damned coming from beneath it it was obvious even in that nightmare few moments what had happened nana had been meaning to play false all along he had just waited until we were in the boats before opening up with musketry grape and every piece of artillery he had from where i was i could see one barge already sinking with people struggling in the water round it at least four others were on fire two were drifting helplessly into midstream the pandies were in the water round the last three boats where most of the women and children were but then a great gust of smoke blotted the scene from my view and at the same time i heard the crackle of firing from the far bank the treacherous bastards had us trapped both sides i put my head down and struck out for the next barge ahead which at least had someone steering it and as i came under its stern there was moore in the water alongside shoving for all he was worth to turn the rudder and help it from the shore beyond him i saw wheeler and vibart and a couple of others being dragged inboard while our people blazed back at the pandies on the bank moore shouted something incoherent at me and as i seized on the rudder with him his face was within a foot of mine and then it exploded in a shower of blood and i literally had his brains blown all over me i let go shrieking and when i had dashed the hideous mess from my eyes he was gone the barge was surging out into the river as our people got the sweeps going and i was just in time to grasp the gunwale and be dragged along clinging like grim death and bawling to be hauled aboard we must have gone several hundred yards before i managed to scramble up and on to the deck and get my bearings the first thing i saw was wheeler dead or dying he had a gaping wound in the neck and the blood was pumping oozily on to his shirt all around there were wounded men sprawled on the planks the smouldering thatch filled the boat with acrid clouds of smoke and at both gunwales men were firing at the banks i clung to the gunwale looking back we were half a mile below suttee ghat by now where most of the barges were still swinging at their moorings under a pall of smoke the river round them was full of people floundering for the bank the firing seemed to have slackened but you could still see the sparkle of the muskets along the slope above the ghat and the occasional blink of a heavy gun booming dully across the water behind us two of the barges seemed to have got clear and were drifting helplessly across the river but we were the only one under way with half a dozen chaps each side tugging at the sweeps i took stock we were clear the shots werent reaching us wheeler was dead flopped out on the deck and beyond him vibart was lying against the gunwale eyes closed both arms soaked in blood someone was babbling in agony and i saw it was turner with one leg doubled at a hideous angle and the other lying in a bloody pool whiting was holding on to one of the awning supports a gory spectre fumbling onehanded at the lock of a carbine there hardly seemed to be a sound man in the barge i saw delafosse was at one of the sweeps thomson at another and sergeant grady with a bandage round his brow was in the act of loosing off a shot at the shore and then with a little shock of astonishment i saw that one of the wounded men on the deck was east and he was finished why i dont know but i dropped down beside him and felt his pulse he opened his eyes at that and looked up at me and someone at my elbow i dont know who says hoarsely pandy got him on the bank bayonet in the back poor devil east recognised me and tried to speak but couldnt you could see the life ebbing out of his eyes his lips pnverrd and very faintly i heard him say flashman tell the doctor i that was all except that he gripped my hand hard and the man beside me said something about there not being any doctor on board that aint what he meant says i its another doctor he means a schoolmaster but hes dead east gave a little ghost of a smile and his hand tightened and then went loose in mine and i found i was blubbering and gasping and thinking about rugby and hot murphies at sallys shop and a small fag limping along pathetically after the players at big side because he couldnt play himself you see being lame id hated the little bastard too man and boy for his smug manly piety but you dont see a child youve known all your life die every day maybe that was why i wept maybe it was the shock and horror of what had been happening i dont know whatever it was im sure i felt it all the more sincerely for knowing that i was still alive myself and no bones broken so far memorys the queerest thing when youve been through a hellish experience and the cawnpore siege and surrender ranks high in that line along with balaclava and kabul and greasy grass and isandlhwana the aftermath tends to be vague until some fresh horror strikes that barge is mercifully dim in my mind now i know it was the only one that got away from cawnpore and that of the rest all were shot to pieces or burned with their passengers except those which had the women and children aboard the pandies captured those and took the women and kids back ashore all the world knows what happened after that but only a few things are clear about our trip downriver thomson has left a pretty full account of it if youre interested i remember whiting dying or rather i remember him being dead looking very pale and small in the bows of the boat i remember taking a turn at the rudder and splashing and straining in the water when we grounded on a mudbank in the dark i remember hearing drums beating on the bank and vibart biting on a leather strap as they set his broken arm and the dull splashes as we put dead bodies over the side and the musty taste of dry mealies which was all we had to eat but the first time that memory becomes consecutive and coherent after east died was when a firearrow came winging out of the dark and thudded into the deck and we were shooting away at dim figures on the nearest bank and firearrows came down in a blazing rain as we hauled on the sweeps and forced the barge back into midstream out of range we rowed like fury until the fiery pinpoints of light on the bank were far behind us and the yelling and drumming of the niggers had died away and then we flopped down exhausted and the current carried us and landed us high and dry on another mudbank just before dawn this time there was no shoving off we were wedged tight in the mud along a deserted jungly shore with nothing to be heard but monkeys chattering and birds screeching in the dense undergrowth the far bank was the same a thick mass of green with the brown oily river sliding slowly past at least it looked peaceful which was i pleasant change vibart reckoned we must still be a hundred miles from allahabad and if the behaviour of the niggers whod showered us with firearrows was anything to go by we could count on hostile country most of the way there were two dozen of us in the boat perhaps half of whom were fit to stand we were low on powder and ball and desperately short of mealies there were no medical supplies and it was odds half the wounded would contract gangrene unless we reached safety quickly not a pleasant prospect thinks i as i looked round the squalid barge with its dozen wounded groaning or listless on the planks the stench of blood and death everywhere and even the whole men looking emaciated and fit to croak i was in better case than most i hadnt been through the whole siege and it was crossing my mind that i might do worse than slip away on my own and trust to luck and judgement to get to allahabad on foot after all i could always turn into a native again so when we held our little council i prepared the way for decamping in my own subtle style the others naturally were all debating how we might get refloated again and press on to allahabad i shook them up by suddenly growling that i was in no hurry to get there i agree we must get the barge refloated to take the wounded on says i for the rest of us well for me leastways id sooner head back for cawnpore they gaped at me in disbelief youre mad cries delafosse so ive been told says i see here while we had the women and children to think of they were our first concern thats the only reason we surrendered isnt it well now theyre either gone or captives of those fiends i dont much fancy running any longer i looked as belligerent as i knew how there hasnt been much time to think things out these past hours but now well i reckon ive a score to settle and the only place i want to settle it is cawnpore but but says thomson we cant go back man its certain death maybe says i very businesslike but ive seen my countrys flag hauled down once something i never thought to see ive seen us betrayed our our loved ones ravished from us i managed a manly glisten about the eye i dont like it above half so im going back and im going to get a bullet into that black bastards heart i dont care how and thats that by god says delafosse taking fire by god ive half a mind to come with you youll do no such thing this was vibart he was deathly pale with both arms useless but he was still in command our duty is to reach allahabad colonel flashman i forbid you i will not have your life flung away in in this rash folly you will carry out general wheelers orders look old fellow says i i was never one of general wheelers command you recollect i dont ask anyone to come with me but i left a friend dead back there a comrade from the old afghan days a salt man from the hills well maybe im more of a salt man than a parade soldier myself anyway i know what i must do i gave him a quizzical little grin and patted his foot anyway vibart im senior to you remember at this they cried out together telling me not to be a fool and vibart said i couldnt desert our wounded he wanted to send a shoreparty to try to find friendly villagers who would tow us off i was best fitted to lead it he said and my first duty was to carry out wheelers dying wishes and get downriver i seemed to hesitate and finally said i would lead the shoreparty but youll be going to allahabad without me in the end says i all ill need is a rifle and a knife and a handshake from each one of you so we set off a dozen of us to try to find a friendly village if we found one and the prospects of getting off for allahabad seemed good id allow myself to be persuaded and go along with them if we didnt id slip away and they could imagine id gone back to cawnpore on my mission of vengeance we hadnt gone five minutes into the jungle before i was wishing to god id been able to stay in the boat it wasnt very thick stuff once we got away from the river but eery and curiously quiet with huge tall trees shadowing a forestfloor of creeper and swampy plants like a great cathedral and only the occasional treecreature chirruping in the silence we struck a little path and followed it and presently came on a tiny temple in a clearing a lathandplaster thing that looked as though it hadnt been visited in years i clafossc and sergeant grady scouted it and reported it empty and i was just ordering up the others when we heard it very low and faroff in the forest the slow boomboom of drums i dont know any sound like it for shivering the soul ive heard it in dahomey when the amazons were after us and in south american backwaters and on a night on the papar river in borneo when the iban headhunters took the warpath the muted rumble of doom that conjures up spectres with painted faces creeping towards you through the dark theyre usually damned real spectres too as they were here for id barely given my order when there was a whistle and a thud and grady on the edge of the clearing was staggering with an arrow in his brow and with a chorus of bloodchilling screams they were on us black halfnaked figures swarming out of the trees yelling bloody murder i snapped off one shot god knows where it went and then i was haring for the temple i made it a split second ahead of two arrows which quivered in the doorpost and then we were tumbling inside with delafosse and thomson crouched in the doorway blazing away as hard as they could they came storming up to the doorway in a great rabble and for the next five minutes it was as bloody and desperate a melee as ever ive been in we were so packed in the tiny space inside the building it wasnt more than eight feet square and about that number of us had got inside that only two of us could fire through the door at once whoever the attackers were halfhuman jungle people apparently infected by the general mutiny madness they didnt appear to have firearms and the foremost of them were shot down before they could get close enough to use their spears and long swords but their arrows buzzed in like hornets and two of our fellows went down before the attack slackened off we were just getting our breath back and i was helping thomson push an arrow through and out of the fleshy part of private murphys arm and all the time we could hear our besiegers grunting and fumbling stealthily close under the temple wall when delafosse suddenly whoops out fire fire theyve set the place alight sure enough a gust of smoke came billowing in the doorway setting us coughing and stumbling a firearrow came zipping in to bury itself in private ryans side and the yells of the niggers redoubled triumphantly i staggered through the reek and thomson was clutching my arm shouting must break out two volleys straight in front run for it it was an affair of split seconds there wasnt time to think or argue he and delafosse and two of the privates stumbled to the door thomson yells fire they all let blast together and then we put our heads down and went charging out of the temple with the flames licking up behind us and drove in a body across the clearing for the shelter of the jungle the niggers shrieked at the sight of us i saw the man before me tumble down with a spear in his back i cannoned into a black figure and he fell away and then we were haring through the trees my musket was gone and no thought but flight delafosse was in front of me i followed him as he swerved on to the path with the arrows whipping past us booted feet were thumping behind me and thomson was shouting on on we can distance em come on murphy sullivan to the boat how we broke clear god knows the very suddenness with which wed rushed from the temple must have surprised them but we could hear their yells in the jungle behind and they werent giving up the hunt either my lungs were bursting as we ploughed through the thicker jungle near the river tripping on snags tearing ourselves sobbing with exhaustion and then we were on the bank and delafosse was sliding to a halt in the mud and yelling its gone vibart my god the boats gone the mudbank was empty there was the great groove where the barge had been but the brown stretch of water was unbroken to the wall of green on its far side of the barge there wasnt a sign it must have slid off delafosse was crying and i thought good for you my boy lets stop to consider how it happened eh and the niggers can come up and join in i didnt even check stride i went into the water in the mightiest racing dive i ever performed and i heard the cries and splashes as the others took to the river behind me i was striking out blindly feeling the current tugging me downstream i didnt mind anywhere would do so long as it was away from those black devils screeching in the forest behind the far bank was too distant to reach but downstream where the river curved there were islands and sandbanks and we were being carried towards them far faster than our pursuers could hope to run i swam hard with the current until the yelping of the niggers had faded into the distance and then glanced round to see how the others were getting along there were four heads bobbing in the water delafosse thomson murphy and sullivan all swimming in my wake and i was just debating whether to make for the nearest sandbank or allow myself to be carried past when delafosse reared up in the water yelling and gesturing ahead of me i couldnt make him out and then the single shrieked word muggers reached me and as i looked where he was pointing the steamy waters of the ganges seemed to turn to ice on a mudbank a hundred yards ahead and to my right shapes were moving long brown hideously scaly dragons waddling down to the water at frightening speed plashing into the shallows and then gliding out inexorably to head us off their halfsubmerged snouts rippling the surface for an instant i was paralysed then i was thrashing at the water in a frenzy of terror trying to get out into midstream fighting the sluggish current i knew it was hopeless they must intercept us long before we could reach the islands but i lashed out blindly ploughing through the water too terrified to look and expecting every moment to feel the agonising stab of crocodile teeth in my legs i was almost done with exhaustion and panic and then sullivan was alongside tugging at me pointing ahead and i saw that the placid surface was breaking up into a long swirling race where the water ran down between two little scrubby mudbanks there was just a chance if we could get into that broken water that the faster current might carry us away muggers hate rough water anyway and i went for it with the energy of despair one glance i spared to my right my god there was one of the brutes within ten yards swirling towards me i had a nightmare glimpse of that hideous snout breaking surface of the great tapering jaws suddenly yawning in a cavern of teeth and i regret to say i did not notice whether the fourth tooth of the lower jaw was overlapping or not a naturalist chap to whom i described my experience a few years ago tells me that if id taken note of this id have known whether i was being attacked by a true crocodile or gavial or by some other species which would have added immense interest to the occasion as it was i can only say that the bloody thing looked like an iron maiden rushing at me through the water and i was just letting out a last wail of despair when sullivan seized me by the hair the current tore at our legs and we were swept away into the rough water between the islands striking out any old way going under into the choking brown coming up again and struggling to stay afloat and then the water had changed to clinging black ooze and sullivan was crying up up sir for christs sake and he was halfdragging me through the slime towards the safety of a tangled mass of creeper on top of a mudbank delafosse was staggering out beside us thomson was kneedeep in the water smashing with a piece of root at the head of a mugger which lunged and snapped before swirling away with a flourish of its enormous tail murphy his arm trickling blood was already up on the top of the bank reaching down to help us i heaved up beside him shuddering and i remember thinking that must be the end nothing more can happen now and if it does i dont care ill just have to die because theres nothing i can do sullivan was kneeling over me and i remember i said god bless you sullivan you are the noblest man alive or something equally brilliant although i meant it by god and he replied i daresay youre right sir youll have to tell my missus for damn me if she thinks so and then i must have swooned away for all i can remember is delafosse saying i believe they are friends see thomson they are waving to us they mean us no harm and myself thinking if its the muggers waving dont you trust the bastards an inch theyre only pretending to be friendly luck as ive often observed is an agile sprite who jumps both ways in double quick time you could say it had been evil chance that took me to meerut and the birth of the mutiny but id escaped only to land in the hell of cawnpore from which i was one of only five to get clear away after the ghat massacre it had been the foulest luck to run into those wild men in the jungle and the infernal muggers but if they hadnt chased us we mightnt have fetched up on a mudbank under the walls of one of those petty indian rulers who stayed loyal to the sirkar for that was what had happened the new niggers whom delafosse saw waving and hallooing from the shore turned out to be the followers of one diribijah singh a tough old maharaj who ruled from a fort in the jungle and was a steadfast friend of the british so you see all that matters about luck is that it should run good on the last throw not that the game was over you understand when i think back on the mutiny even on cawnpore i can say that the worst was still to come and yet i feel that the tide turned on that mudbank at least after a long nightmare i can say that there followed a period of comparative calm for me in which i was able to recruit my tattered nerves and take stock and start planning how to get the devil out of this indian pickle and back to england and safety for the moment there was nothing to do but thank god and the loyal savages who picked us up from that shoal with the muggers snuffling discontentedly in the wings the natives took us ashore to the maharajs castle and he was a brick a fine old sport with white whiskers and a belly like a barrel who swore damnation to all mutineers and promised to return us to our own folk as soon as we had recovered and it seemed safe to pass through the country round but that wasnt for several weeks and in the meantime the five of us could only lie and recuperate and contain our impatience as best we might delafosse and thomson were itching to get back into the thick of things murphy and sullivan the two privates kept their counsel and ate like horses while i making an even greater show of impatience than my brotherofficers was secretly well content to rest at ease blinking in the sun and eating mangoes to which im partial in the meantime we later discovered great things were happening in the world beyond when news of cawnpores fall got out it gave the mutiny a tremendous fillip revolt spread all along the ganges valley and in central india the garrisons at mhow and agra and a dozen other places rebelled and most notable of all henry lawrence got beat fighting a dani silly battle at chinhat and had to hole up in lucknow which went under siege on the credit side my old friend the first gravedigger finally got up off his puritan rump and struck through allahabad at cawnpore he fought his way in after a nineday march and recaptured the place a bare three weeks after wed been driven out and i suppose all the world knows what he found when he got there you remember that when we escaped the massacre at the suttee ghat the barges with the women and children were caught by the pandies well nana took them ashore all of them and locked them up in a place called the bibigarh in such filth and heat that thirty of them died within a week he made our women grind corn then when word came that havelock was fighting his way in and slaughtering all opposition nana had all the women and children butchered they say even the pandies wouldnt do it so he sent in hooligans with cleavers from the cawnpore bazaar they chopped them all up even the babies and threw them dead and still living down a well havelocks people found the bibigarh ankledeep in blood with childrens toys and hats and bits of hair still floating in it they had got there two days too late i dont suppose any event in my lifetime not balaclava nor shiloh nor rorkes drift nor anywhere else i can think of has had such a stunning effect on peoples minds as that cawnpore massacre of the innocents i didnt see the full horror of it of course as havelocks folk did but i was there a few weeks after and walked in the bibigarh and saw the bloody floor and walls and near the well i found the skeleton bones of a babys hand like a little white crab in the dust im a pretty cool hand as you know but it made me gag and if you ask me what i think of the vengeance that old general neill wreaked making captured mutineers clean up the bibigarh flogging em and forcing em to lick up the blood with their tongues before they were hanged well i was all for it then and i still am perhaps its because i knew the corpses that went into that well id seen them playing on the cawnpore rampart and being heard their lessons in that awful barrack and laughing at the elephant dunging perhaps that baby hand i found belonged to the infant id seen in the arms of the woman in the torn gown anyway id have snuffed out every life in india and thought naught of it in that moment when i looked at bibigarh and if you think that shocking well maybe im just more like nana sahib than you are anyway what i think dont signify what mattered was the effect that cawnpore had on our people i know it turned our army crazy they were ready to slaughter anything that even sniffed of mutiny from that moment on not that theyd been dealing exactly kindly before havelock and neill had been hanging right left and centre from allahabad north and i daresay had disposed of quite a number of innocents just as the pandies at meerut and delhi had done what beats me is the way people take it to heart what do they expect in war it aint conducted by missionaries or chaps in liberal clubs snug and secure but what amuses me most is the way fashionable views change why for years after cawnpore any vengeance wreaked on an indian mutineer or not was regarded as just vengeance nothing was too bad for em now its tother way round with eminent writers crying shame and saying nothing justified such terrible retribution as neill took and we were far guiltier than the niggers had been why because we were christians and supposed to know better and because england contains this great crowd of noisy knowalls that are forever defending our enemies behaviour and crying out in pious horror against our own why our sins are always so much blacker i cant fathom as to cawnpore it dont seem to me one whit worse to slay in revenge like neill than out of sheer spite and cruelty like nana at least its more understandable the truth is of course that both sides were afraid the pandy whod mutinied and feared punishment decided he might as well be hanged for a sheep and let his natural bloodlust go theyre cruel bastards at bottom and our folk theyd had an almighty scare and cawnpore brought their natural bloodlust to the top in turn just give em a few wellchosen texts about vengeance and wrath of god and they could fall to with a will as ive already observed about rowbothams mosstroopers theres nothing crueller than a justified christian except maybe a nigger running loose so you can see it was a jolly summer in the ganges valley all right as i and my four companions discovered when diribijah singh finally convoyed us out from his fort and back to cawnpore after havelock had retaken it i hadnt seen old bloodandbones since hed stood grumping beside my bed at jallalabad fifteen years before and time hadnt improved him he still looked like abe lincoln dying of diarrhoea with his mournful whiskers and bloodhound eyes when i told him my recent history he just listened in silence and then grabbed me by the wrist with his great bony hand dragged me down on to my knees beside him and began congratulating god on lugging flashy out of the stew again through his infinite mercy the shield of his truth has been before thee flashman cries he has not the hand which plucked thee from the paw of the bear at kabul and the jaws of the lion at balaclava delivered thee also from the philistine at cawnpore absolutely amen says i but when i took him into my confidence about palmerston and why i came to india in the first place and suggested there was no good reason why i shouldnt head for home at once he shook his great coffin head it cannot be says he that mission is over and we need every hand at the plough the fate of this country is in the balance and i can ill spare such a seasoned soldier as yourself there is a work of cleansing and purging before us he went on and you could see by the holy fire in his eyes that he was just sweating to get to grips with it i shall take you on to my staff flashman nay sir never thank me it is i shall be the gainer rather than you i was ready to agree with him there but i knew there was no point in arguing with the likes of havelock anyway before i could think of anything to say he was scribbling orders for hanging a few more pandies and dictating a crusty note to neill and roaring for his adjutant he was a busy old baptist in those days right enough so there i was and it might have been worse id had no real hope of being sent home no high command in their right mind would have dispensed with the famous flash when there was a campaign on hand and since i had to be here id rather be under havelocks wing than anyones he was a good soldier you see and as canny as campbell in his own way thered be no massacres or last stands round the union jack with the gravedigger in charge so i settled in as havelocks intelligence aide a nice safe billet in the circumstances but if you would learn the details of how i fared with him you must consult my official history dawns and departures of a soldiers life however the point is that my present tale isnt truly concerned with the main course of the mutiny henceforth although i bore my full reluctant part in that but still with that mad mission on which pam had sent me out in the first place to jhansi and the bewitching lakshmibai for i wasnt done with her whatever havelock might think and however little i guessed it myself the rest of the mutiny was just the road that led me back to her and to that final terrible adventure of the jhansi flight and the guns of gwalior when but ill come to that presently in the meantime ill tell you as briskly as i can what happened in the few months after i joined havelock at cawnpore at first it was damned bad news all round the mutiny kept spreading nana had sheered off after losing cawnpore and was raising cain farther upcountry delhi was still held by the pandies with our people banging away at it and havelock at cawnpore didnt have the men or means to relieve lucknow only forty miles away where lawrences garrison was hemmed in he tried hard enough but found that the pandy forces while they didnt make best use of their overwhelming numbers fought better defensive actions than anyone had expected and havelock got a couple of black eyes before hed gone ten miles and had to fall back to make matters worse lloyds advance guard got cut up at arah and no one down in calcutta seemed to have any notion of overall strategy that clown canning was sitting like a fart in a trance they tell me and no proper order was taken i wasnt too upset though for one thing i was snug at the cawnpore headquarters making a great bandobast over collecting information from our spies and passing the gist on to havelock and for another i could sense that things were turning our way once the first flood of pandy successes had spent itself there could only be one end and old campbell who was the best general in the business was coming out to take commandinchief in september we moved on lucknow in style with fresh troops under outram a dirtylooking little chap on a waler horse more like a sheeny tailor than a general they tell me it was a hell of a march certainly it rained buckets all the way and there was some stern fighting at mangalwarh and at the alum bagh near lucknow town i know because i got reports of it in my intelligence ghari at the rear of the column where i was properly ensconced writing reports examining prisoners and getting news from friendly natives at least they were friendly by the time my rajput orderlies had basted em a bit from time to time i poked my head out into the rain and called cheery encouragement to the reinforcements or sent messages to havelock i remember one of them was that delhi had fallen at last and that old johnny nicholson had bought a bullet poor devil i drank a quiet brandy to him listening to the downpour and the guns booming and thought god help poor soldiers on a night like this however having got lucknow havelock and outram didnt know what the devil to do with it for the pandies were still thick around as fleas and it soon became evident that far from raising the siege our forces were nothing but reinforcement to the garrison so we were all besieged for another seven weeks and the deuce of a business it must have been with bad rations and the pandies forever trying to tunnel in under our defences and our chaps fighting em in the mines which were like a warren underground i say must have been for i knew nothing about it the night we entered lucknow my bowels began to explode in all directions and before morning i was flat on my back with cholera for the second time in my life for once it was a blessing for it meant i was spared knowledge of a siege that was cawnpore all over again if not quite as bad i gather i raved a good deal of the time and i know i spent weeks lying on a cot in a beastly little cellar as weak as a rat and not quite in my right mind it was only in the last fortnight of the siege that i began to get about again and by that time the garrison was cheery with the news that campbell was on his way i limped about gamely at first looking gaunt and noble and asking is the flag flying still and is there anything i can do sir im much better than i look i assure you i was too but i took care to lean on my stick a good deal and sit down breathing hard in fact there wasnt much to do except wait and listen to the pandies sniping away they didnt hit much in the last week when we knew for certain that campbell was only a few days away with his highlanders and naval guns and all i was careless enough to look like a whole man again it seemed safe enough now for you must know that at lucknow unlike cawnpore we were defending a large area and if one kept away from the outer works which unemployed convalescents like me were entitled to do one could promenade about the residency gardens without peril there were any number of large houses halfruined now but still habitable and we occupied them or camped out in the grounds when i came out of my cellar i was sent to the bungalow where havelock was quartered with his staff people but he packed me off to outrams headquarters in case i should be of some use there havelock himself was pretty done by this time and not taking much part in the command he spent most of his time in gubbinss garden reading some bilge by macaulay and was greatly intrigued to know that id met lord knowall and discussed his lays with the queen i had to tell havelock all about that for the rest i yarned a good deal with vincent eyre whod been in the kabul retreat with me and was now one of the many wounded in the garrison or chaffed with the ladies in the old residency garden twitting them about their fashions for after a sixmonth siege everyone was dressed any old how with scraps and curtains and even towels run up into clothes i was hailed everywhere of course jovial flash the hero on the mend and quizzed about my adventures from meerut to cawnpore i never mind telling a modest tale if the audience is pretty enough so i did and entertained them by imitating makarram khan too which attracted much notice and laughter it was an idiot thing to do as youll see it earned another man the vc and nearly won me a cut throat what happened was this one morning it must have been about november th or loth there was a tremendous commotion over on the southern perimeter where someone in andersons post claimed he had heard campbells pipers in the distance there was huge excitement with fellows and ladies and niggers and even children hastening through the ruined buildings laughing and cheering and then everything went deadly still as we stood to listen and sure enough above the occasional crack of firing far far away there was the faintest whisper on the breeze of a pig in torment and someone sings out the campbells are coming hurrah hurrah and people were embracing and shaking hands and leaping in the air laughing and crying all together and a few dropping to their knees to pray for now the siege was as good as over so there was continued jubilation throughout the garrison and outram sniffed and grunted and chewed his cheroot and called a staff conference he had been smuggling out messages by native spies all through the siege and now that the relief force was so close he wanted to send explicit directions to campbell on the best route to take in fighting his way through the streets and gardens of lucknow to the residency it was a great maze of a place and our folk had had the deuce of a struggle getting in two months earlier being cut up badly in the alleys outram wanted to be sure campbell didnt have the same trouble for he had a bare men against o pandies and if they strayed or were ambushed it might be the end of them and consequently of us i didnt have much part in their deliberations beyond helping outram draft his message in the secret greek code he employed and making a desperate hash of it one of the sappers had the best route all plotted out and while they talked about that i went into the big verandah room adjoining to rest from the noon heat convalescentlike i sprawled on the cot with my boots off and must have dozed off for when i came to it was late afternoon the murmur of many voices from beyond the chick screen had gone and there were only two people talking outram was saying it is a harebrained risk surely a white man proposing to make his way disguised as a native through a city packed with hostiles and if hes caught and the message falls into their hands what then napier true enough says napier but to get a guide out to campbell a guide who can point his way for him is better than a thousand messages of direction and kavanaugh knows the streets like a bazaarwallah no doubt he does mutters outram but hell no more pass for a native than my aunts parrot what hes more than six feet tall flaming red hair blue eyes and talks poor hindi with a donegal accent kananji may not be able to guide campbell but at least we can be sure hell get a message to him kananji swears he wont go if kavanaugh does hes ready to go alone but he says kavanaughs bound to be spotted there you are then i could hear outram muttering and puffing on a fresh cheroot confound it napier hes a brave man and ill own that if he could reach campbell his knowledge of the byways of lucknow would be beyond price but hes harder to disguise than damme than any man in this garrison i listened with some interest to this i knew kavanaugh a great freckled irish bumpkin of a civilian whod spent the siege playing tig with pandy besiegers in the tunnels beneath our defences mad as a hatter and now madder still by the sound of it if he proposed to try to get through the enemy lines to campbell i saw outrams problem kavanaugh was the one man whod be a reliable guide to campbell if only he could get to him but it was tattersalls to a tin can that the pandies would spot him torture his message out of him and be ready and waiting for campbell when he advanced well thank god i wasnt called on to decide if he can disguise himself well enough to pass muster with me he can go says outram at last but i wish to heaven kananji would accompany him i dont blame him for refusing mind but if only there were someone else who could go along some cool hand who can pass as a native without question to do the talking if theyre challenged by the pandies for if they are and if kavanaugh has to open that great paddy mouth of his stop though of course napier the very man why didnt it occur i was off the cot and moving before outram was halfway through his speech i knew before he did himself whose name was going to pop into his mind as the ideal candidate for this latest lunacy i paused only to scoop up my boots and was tiptoeing at speed for the verandah rail a quick vault into the garden and then let them try to find me before sunset if they could but blast it i hadnt gone five steps when the door was flung open and there was outram pointing his cheroot looking like sam grant after the first couple of drinks crying flashman thats our man napier can you think of a better of course napier couldnt who could with the famous flashy on hand ripe to be plucked and hurled into the bloody soup its damnable the way they pick on a fellow and all because of my swollen reputation for derringdo and breakneck gallantry as usual there was nothing i could do except stand blinking innocently in my stockingsoles while outram repeated all that id heard already and pointed out that i was the very man to go along on this hideous escapade to hold the great fenian idiots hand for him i heard him in mounting terror concealed behind a stern and thoughtful aspect and replied that of course i was at his disposal but really gentlemen was it wise not that i cared about the risk but i earnestly doubted whether kavanaugh could pass my convalescent condition of course was a trifling matter even so one wouldnt want to fail through lack of strength not when a native could be certain of getting through there isnt a loyal sepoy in this garrison who can come near you for skill and shrewdness says outram briskly or whod stand half the chance of seeing kavanaugh safe werent you playing your old pathan role the other day for the ladies as to the toll of your illness ive a notion your strength will always match your spirit whatever happens this things your meat and drink flashman and you know it and youve been fairly itching to get into harness again eh ill hazard a guess says napier smiling that hes more concerned for kavanaugh than for himself isnt that so flashman well sir since youve said it i know says outram frowning at his damned cheroot kavanaugh has a wife and family but he has volunteered you see and hes the man for campbell not a doubt of it it only remains to get him there and the brute simply gave me a sturdy look and shook my hand as though that were the thing settled which of course it was what could i do without ruining my reputation although such was my fame by this time that if id thrown myself on the floor weeping with fright theyd probably not have taken me seriously but thought it was just one of my jokes in doubtful taste give a dog a bad name by god it doesnt stick half as hard as a good one so i spent the evening dyeing myself with soot and ghee shuddering with apprehension and cursing my folly and ill luck this at the eleventh hour i thought of having another shot at napier pleading my illness but i didnt dare he had a hard eye and outrams would be even worse if they suspected i was shirking i near as a toucher cried off though when i saw kavanaugh he was got up like sinbad the sailor with nigger minstrel eyes hareem slippers and a great sword and shield i stopped dead in the doorway whispering to napier my god man he wont fool a child well have the bloody pandies running after us shouting penny for guy fawkes but he said reassuringly that it would be pretty dark and outram and the other officers agreed that kavanaugh might just do they were full of admiration for my getup which was my usual one of bazaarruffler and kavanaugh came up to me with absolute tears in his eyes and said i was the stoutest chap alive to stand by him in this i nearly spat in his eye the others were full of sallies about our appearance and then outram banded kavanaugh the message for campbell biting on his cheroot and looking hard at us i need not tell you says he that it must never tall into enemy hands that would be disaster for us all just to rub the point in he asked if we were fully armed and then gave us our directions we were to swim the river beyond the northern rampart recross it by the bridge west of the residency and cut straight south through lucknow city and hope to run into campbells advance picquets on the other side kavanaugh who knew the streets would choose our path but i would lead and do the talking then outram looked us both in the eye and blessed us and everyone shook hands looking noble while i wondered if id time to go to the privy kavanaugh shaking with excitement cleared his throat and says we know what is to be done sorr an well give our lives gladly in the attempt we know the risks ould fellow do we not he added turning to me oh aye says i that bazaarll be full of fleas well be lousy for weeks since there was no escape i might as well give em another flashy bon mot to remember it moved them as only jocular heroism can outrams aide hardinge was absolutely piping his eye and said england would never forget us everyone patted us on the back with restrained emotion and shoved us off in the direction of the rampart i could hear kavanaugh breathing heavily the brute positively panted in irish and whispered to him again to remember to leave any talking to me oi will flashy oi will says he lumbering along and stumbling over his ridiculous sword the thing was a farce from the start by the time we had slipped over the rampart and made our way through the pitch dark down to the bank of the goomtee i had realised that i was in company with an irresponsible lunatic who had no real notion of what he was doing even while we were stripping for our swim he suddenly jerked his head up at the sound of a faint plop out on the water thats trout afther minnow says he and then there was another louder plop an thats otter afther trout says he with satisfaction are ye a fisherman are ye before i could hush his babbling he had suddenly seized my hand and him standing there bollocknaked with his togs piled on his head and said fervently dye know what were goin to do wan o the deeds that saved the impoire so we are an oi dont moind tellin ye somethin else for the first toime in me loife oim scared the first time squeaks i but already he was plunging in with a splash like the launching of the great eastern puffing and striking out in the dark leaving me with the appalling realisation that for once i was in the company of someone as terrified as myself it was desperate i mean on previous enterprises of this kind id been used to relying on some gallant idiot who could keep his head but here i was with this buffoon who was not only mad irish but was plainly drunk with the idea of playing dick champion the saviour of the side and was trembling in his boots at the same time furthermore he was given to daydreaming about trouts and otters at inappropriate moments and had no more idea of moving silently than a bear with a ball and chain but there was nothing for it now i slid into the freezing water and swam the halffurlong to the far bank where he was standing on one leg in the mud hauling his clothes on and making the deuce of a row about it are ye there flash says he in a hoarse whisper you could have heard in delhi well have to be hellish quiet ye know oi think theres pandies up the bank since we could see their picquets round the campfires not fifty yards away it was a reasonable conclusion and we hadnt stolen twenty yards along the riverside when someone hailed us i shouted back and our challenger remarked that it was cold at which the oaf kavanaugh petrified me by suddenly bawling out han bhai bahut nmder like some greenhorn reciting from a hindi primer i hustled him quickly away took him by the neck and hissed will you keep your damned gob shut you great murphy i is apologised in a nervous whisper and muttered something about queen and country his eye was glittering feverishly oill be more discreet flash says he and so we went on with me answering another couple of challenges before we reached the bridge and crossed safely over into lucknow town this was the testing part for here there was lighting in the streets and passersby and kavanaugh might easily he recognised as counterfeit the swim hadnt done his dyed skin any good and apart from that his outlandish rig the european walk the whole cut of the man was an invitation to disaster well thinks i if hes spotted its into the dark for flashy and old ohooligan can take care of himself the worst of it was he seemed incapable of keeping quiet but was forever halting to mutter the mosque ah thats right now and then de little stone bridge where the divil is it dye see it flashy it ought to be right by hereabouts i told him if he must chunter to do it in hindi and he said absentmindedly oi will oi will niver fear oi wish to god we had a compass he seemed to think he was in phoenix park it wasnt too bad at first because we were moving through gardens with few folk about but then we came to the great chauk bazaar thank god it was illlit but there were groups of pandies everywhere folk at the stalls idlers at every corner and even a few palkis swaying through the narrow ways i put on a bold front keeping kavanaugh between me and the wall and just swaggered along spitting no one gave me a second glance but by hellish luck we passed close by a group of pandies with some whores in tow and one of the tarts plucked at kavanaughs sleeve and made an improper suggestion her sepoy stared and growled resentfully and my heart was in my mouth as i hustled kavanaugh along shouting over my shoulder that hed just been married the previous day and was exhausted at which they laughed and let us be at least that kept him shut up for a spell but no sooner were we clear of the bazaar than he was chattering with relief and stopped to pick carrots in a vegetable patch remarking at the top of his voice that they were the swaitest little things hed tasted in months then he lost our way that looks devilish like the kaiser bagh says he and fell into a monsoon ditch i hauled him out and he went striding off into the dark and to my horror stopped a little old fellow and asked where we were the man said jangli ganj and hurried off glancing suspiciously at us kavanaugh stood and scratched himself and said it wasnt possible if this is jangli ganj says he then where the hell is mirza kera will ye tell me that ye know what flashman that ould clown doesnt know where hes at at all at all after that we blundered about in the dark two daring and desperate men on our vital secret mission and then kavanaugh gave a great laugh and said it was all right he knew where we were after all and that must be moulvie jenabs garden so we should go left we did and finished up striking matches along haidars canal at least thats what kavanaugh said it was and he should have known for he was in it twice thrashing about in the water and cursing when he had climbed out he was in a thundering rage swearing the engineers had got the map of lucknow all wrong but we must cross the canal anyway and bear left until we hit the cawnpore road the bloody things over dere somewhere cries he and he seemed sure of that at least i stifled my growing and off we went with kavanaugh tripping over fir and stopping every now and then to peer into the ithuu wondering dye think that garden could have rr the char bagh now no no niver and yet agin it nit right be what dye think flashy what i thought you may guess we must have been wandering for hours and for all we knew we might be heat lillg back towards the residency kavanaughs slippers ltrl given out and when he lost one of them we had to pipe about in a melon patch until he found it his feet were mr deplorable condition and hed lost his shield intl he was still convinced our plight was all the fault tat the ancient he had asked the way from he thought we wright try a cast to our right so we did and found rturselve wandering in iilkoosha park which was full of nuttyutrllery even i knew we were quite out the way and krvattanglr xaid yeti ile had made a mistake but such mtnhalrs were of frequent occurrence we must bear away south so we tried that and i asked a peasant sitting out with his crops if he would guide us to the alam bagh e raim lie was too old and lame and kavanaugh lost trio temper and roared at him at which the fellow ran oll ahrtrking and the dogs began to bark and we had to run irrr it and kavanaugh went headlong into a thorn hurlt i here was no end to the fellows capacity for disaster alirarrntiy given a choice of paths he headed along one whir it brought us full tilt into a pandy patrol and i had to talk our way out of it by saying we were poor men going to i rtrroula to tell a friend the british had shot his brother a r rvitrg in a village he wandered into a hut when i wasnt look mg and blundered about in the dark seized a woman by the thigh fortunately she was too terrified to cry out we got away after that he took to crying out thats jalallabad oim certain sure and thats salehnagar over there yes pause oi think the upshot of that was that we landed in a swamp and spent over an hour ploshing about in the mud and kavanaughs language was shocking to hear we went under half a dozen times before we managed to find dry land and i spotted a house not far off with a light in an upper window and insisted that kavanaugh must rest while i found out where we were he agreed blaspheming because the last of his dye had rubbed off with repeated immersions i went to the house and who should be at the window but the charmingest little brown girl who said we were not far from alam bagh but the british had arrived there and people were running away i thanked her inwardly rejoicing and she peeped at me over the sill and says you are very wet big man why not come in and rest while you dry your clothes only five rupees by george thinks i why not i was tired and sick and it had been the deuce of a long time what with sieges and cholera and daft irishmen falling in bogs this was just the tonic i needed so i scrambled up and there she was all chubby and brown and shiny giggling on her charpoy and shaking her bouncers at me i seized hold nearly crying at this unexpected windfall and in a twinkling was marching her round the room horse artillery fashion while she squeaked and protested that for five rupees i shouldnt be so impatient i was though and it was just as well for id no sooner finished the business than kavanaugh was under the window airing his urdu plaintively in search of me and wanting to know what was the delay i leaned out and cadged five rupees off him explaining it was a bribe for an old sick man who knew the way he passed it up i struggled into my wet fugs kissed my giggling delilah goodnight and scrambled down feeling fit for anything it took us another two hours though for kavanaugh was about done and we had to keep dodging behind trees to avoid parties of peasants who were making for lucknow i was getting a mite alarmed because the moon was up and i knew that dawn couldnt be far off if we were caught by daylight with kavanaugh looking as pale as marleys ghost we were done for i cursed myself for a fool whoring and wasting time when we should have been pushing on what had i been thinking of i you know i suddenly realised that in my exasperation with kavanaugh and all that aimless wandering in wrong directions and watching him fall in tanks and canals id forgotten the seriousness of the whole thing perhaps i was still a trifle lightheaded from my illness but id even forgotten my fears they came back now though in full force as we staggered along i was about as tuckeredis he was my head was swimming and i must have livered the last mile in a walking dream because the next thing i remember is bearded faces barring our way and bluetunicked troopers with white puggarees and thinking these arc th lancers then there was an officer holding me by the shoulders and to my astonishment it was gough to whom id served brandy and smokes on the verandah at meerut he didnt know me but he poured spirits into us and had us borne down into the camp where the bugles were blowing and i he cavalry pickets were falling in and the flag was going up and it all looked so brisk and orderly and safe you would have wept for relief but the cheeriest sight of to me was that crumpled bony figure outside the headquarter tent and the dour wrinkled old face under the battered helmet i hadnt seen campbell close to not since balaclava he was an ugly old devil with a damned caustic tongue and a graveyard sense of humour but i never saw a man yet who made me feel more secure he must have been a rare disappointment to kavanaugh though for at the sight of him my blundering paddy threw off his tiredness and made a tremendous parade of announcing who he was fishing out the message and presenting it like the last gallant survivor stumbling in with the news you never saw suffering nobility like it as he explained how wed come out of lucknow but campbell listening and tugging at his dreary moustache just said aye and sniffed and added after a moment thats surprising kavanaugh who had probably expected stricken admiration looked quite deflated and when campbell told him to away you and lie down he obeyed pretty huffily i knew campbell of course so i wasnt a bit astonished at the way he greeted me when he realised who i was its no you again says he like a free kirk elder to the town drunk dearie me yere not looking a whit better than when i saw ye last i doot yeve nae discretion flashman he sighed and shook his head but just as he was turning away to his tent he looked back and says im glad tae see ye mind i suppose there are those whod say that theres no higher honour than that coming from old slowcoach if thats so i must make the most of it for its all the thanks i ever got for convoying kavanaugh out of lucknow not that im complaining mind for god knows ive had my share of undeserved credit but its a fact that kavanaugh stole all the limelight when the story came out im certain it was sheer lust for glory that had made him undertake the job in the first place for when i joined him in the resttent after wed left campbell he broke off the kneelingandpraying which he was engaged in looked up at me with his great freckled yokel face and says anxiously dyez think theyll give us the victoria cross well in the end they did give him the vc for that nights work while all i got was a shocking case of dysentery he was a civilian of course so they were bound to make a fuss of him and there was so much vchunting going on just then that i suppose they thought recognised heroes like me could be passed over ironic aint it anyway i wasnt recommended at the time for any decoration at all and he was which seemed fairly raw although i dont deny he was brave you understand anyone whos as big a bloody fool as that and goes gallivanting about seeking sorrow must be called i ourageous still if it hadnt been for me finding his basted slipper for him and fishing him out of canals and most important of all getting the right direction from that hide brown banger friend kavanaugh might still have been traipsing along haidars canal asking the way but hulking back perhaps i got the better of the bargain she was a lissome little wriggler and it was kavanaughs five rupees after all if campbell was sparing with his compliments he was equally careful of his soldiers lives especially his precious rd highlanders he took a week to relieve lucknow feeling his way in along the route our message had suggested battering the pandies with his artillery and only turning his kilties and sikhs on them when he had to they butchered everything in sight of course between them but it was a slow business and he was much abused for it afterwards in my opinion he was dead right as he and mansfield his staff chief were when they wouldnt risk lives simply to pursue and punish fleeing mutineers a generals job is to win campaigns with as little loss as may be but of course that dont suit the critics in clubs and newspaper offices theyre at a safe distance and they want blood rot them so they sneer at old slowcoach and call him a stickinthemud soldier in fact his relief of lucknow in the face of odds that were sometimes fifteen to one was a model of sound sense he got in he took the garrison out and he retired in good order scratching his ear and looking glum while ignorant asses like kavanaugh danced with impatience dye know that irish lunatic absolutely ran the gauntlet of pandy fire to get back into lucknow and bring out outram and havelock in person just so that they could greet sir colin as he covered the last few furlongs bloody nonsense but it looked very gallant and has since been commemorated in oils with camels and niggers looking on admiringly and the chiefs all shaking hands poor old gravedigger he didnt last more than a few lays after the dysentery bugs did for him in earnest and we buried him under a palm tree by the alam bagh at the mart of the retreat i guess that suited him and i remember the text running through my head and nicanor lay dead in his harness it was what hed said to me fifteen years earlier when hed told me of sergeant hudson dying at pipers fort aye well none of us lives forever anyway lucknow had to be left in rebel hands and campbell took our army back to cawnpore where tantia tope was raging around the garrison campbell whipped him in quick time and then started clearing up rebel resistance along the ganges while at the same time assembling a new force which would march back to lucknow after christmas clear the pandies out properly and subdue the whole of oudh kingdom it was fairly obvious that although mutineers were still thick as mosquitoes everywhere and had several armies in the field campbells methodical operations would have the whole business settled in a few months if only calcutta let him alone i lent my gallant assistance by supervising intelligence work at unao just across the river from cawnpore where our new army was assembling easy work and nothing more dangerous than occasional brawls and turnups between the pathan horse and the devils own which suited me the only thing that ruffled my surface at all that winter was a rebuke from higher authority when i squired an upperclass halfcaste whore to a band parade at cawnpore which shows you better than anything how things were beginning to quieten down when generals have nothing better to do than worry about the morals of staff colonels you may be sure theres no great work on hand and indeed we were beginning to make things so hot for the pandies along the grand trunk that winter that it seemed the bulk of their power was being forced farther and farther south into the gwalior country where tantia tope had taken his army and the rebel princelings had still to be dealt with that was where jhansi was i used to see its name daily in the intelligence reports with increasing references to lakshmibai the rebel rani and the traitor queen was what they were calling her now for in the past few months shed thrown off the pretence of loyalty which she had maintained after the jhansi massacre and cast in her lot with nana and tantia and the other mutinous princes that had shocked me when i first heard it and yet it wasnt so surprising really not when i recalled her feelings towards us and her grievances and that lovely dark face so grimly set mera jhansi denge nay i wont give up my jhansi shed have to give it up fast enough though presently with our southern armies under general rose already advancing north to gwalior and bandelkand she would be crushed along with the other monarchs and their sepoycumbandit armies and i didnt care to think about that much when my thoughts turned towards her and for some reason they did increasingly in the leisure of that winter i couldnt think of her as belonging in this world of turmoil and blood and burning and massacre when i read about the jhansi jezebel plotting with nana and whipping up revolt i couldnt reconcile it with my memory of that bewitching figure swinging gently to and fro on her silken swing in that mirrored fairy palace i found myself wondering if she was still swinging there or playing with the monkeys and parrots in her sunny garden or riding in the woods by the river who with how many new lovers had she taken since that night in the pavilion that was enough to set the flutters going low down in my innards and farther up in my midriff for it wasnt only lust when i thought of those slanting eyes and the grave little smile and the smooth dusky arm along the rope of her swing i was conscious of a strange empty longing lust for the sight of her and the sound of her voice it was downright irritating for when i reflect on an old love its usually in terms of tits and buttocks pure and simple after all i wasnt a green kid and i didnt care to find myself thinking like one what i needed to cure me i decided was two weeks steady rogering at her to get these mooncalf yearnings out of my mind for good but of course there was no chance of that now or so i thought in my complacent ignorance as the winter wore through and our campaign in the north approached its climax i knew it was as good as over when billy russell of the times showed up to join campbells final march on lucknow its a sure sign of victory when the correspondents gather like vultures we marched with men and strong artillery myself piling up great heaps of useless paper in mansfields intelligence section and keeping out of harms way it was an inexorable pounding business as our gunners blew the pandy defences systematically to bits the highlanders and irish slaughtered the sepoy infantry whenever it stood the engineers demolished shrines and temples to show who was master and everyone laid hands on as much loot as he could carry it was a great bloody carnival with everyone making the most of the war i recall one incident in a lucknow courtyard in which i saw highlanders their gory bayonets laid aside smashing open chests that were simply stuffed with jewels and grinning idiot little goorkhas breaking mirrors for sheer sport and wiping their knives on silks and fabrics worth a fortune they didnt know any better there were sikh infantry dancing with gold chains and necklaces round their necks an infantry subaltern staggering under a great enamelled pot overflowing with coins a naval gunner bleeding to death with a huge shimmering bolt of clothofgold clasped in his arms there were dead and dying men everywhere our own fellows as well as pandies and desperate handtohand fighting going on just over the courtyard wall muskets banging men shrieking two irishmen coming to blows over a white marble statuette smeared with blood and billy russell stamping and damning his luck because he had no rupees on him to buy the treasures which private soldiers were willing to trade away for the price of a bottle of rum gies a hunnerd rupees now one of the micks was shouting as he flourished a gold chain set with rubies they were as big as gulls eggs jist a hunnerd yer honour an deyre yours but but theyre worth fifty times that cries russell torn between greed and honesty ah the divil wid that cries paddy oim sayin a hunnerd an welcome all right says russell but the man must come to his tent for the money that night but at this paddy cries out oh god oi cant sorr how do oi know you or me wont be dead by then ready money yer honour say jist fifty chips an yer spirit flask come now but billy hadnt even fifty rupees so the mick shook his head sorrowfully and swore he couldnt trade except for cash down finally he burst out but oi cant see a gintleman in yer honours position goin emptyhanded here take dis for nuthin an say a prayer for ohalloran private michael and he thrust a diamond brooch into russells hand and ran off whooping to join his mates you may wonder what i was doing there so close to the fighting the answer is i was keeping an eye on my two rajput orderlies who were picking up gold and jewellery for me at bargain prices using intelligence section funds i paid it all back mind out of profits no irregularities and finished with the handsome surplus which built gandamack lodge leicestershire for my declining years o i asked billy later what value he would have put on all the loot that we saw piled up and scrambled for in that one yard and he said curtly millions of pounds blast it id believe it too there were solid gold and silver vessels and ornaments crusted with gems miles of jewelsewn brocade gorgeous pictures and statues that the troops just hacked and smashed beautiful enamel and porcelain trampled underfoot weapons and standards set with rubies and emeralds which were gouged and hammered from their settings all this among the powdersmoke and blood with native soldiers whod never seen above ten rupees in their lives and slumruffians from glasgow and liverpool all staggering about drunk on plunder and killing and destruction one thing im sure of there was twice as much treasure destroyed as carried away and we officers were too busy bagging our share to do anything about it i daresay a philosopher would have made heavy speculation about that scene if hed had time to spare from tilling his pockets i was well satisfied with my winnings and pondered that night on how id employ them when i went home which couldnt be long now i remember thinking this is the end of the war flash old buck or near as dammit and well out of it you are i was very much at ease sitting round the messfire in the dusk of a lucknow garden smoking and swigging port and listening to the distant thump of the night guns while i yarned idly with russell and rake hodson and macdonald the peeler and sam browne and little fred roberts who wasnt much more than a griff but knew enough to hang around us older hands warming himself in the glow of our fame thinking of them it strikes me how many famous men ive run across in the dawn of their careers not that hodson had long to go since he was shot while looting next day with his glory all behind him but roberts has gone to the very top of the tree and i suppose sam brownes name is known today in every army on earth just because he lost an arm and invented a belt too get them to call some useful article of clothing after you and your fames assured as witness sam and raglan and cardigan if i had my time over again id patent the flashman flybutton and go down in history i dont remember much of what we discussed except that billy was full of indignation over how hed seen some sikhs burning a captured pandy alive with white soldiers looking on and laughing he and roberts said such cruelty oughtnt to be allowed but hodson who was as near a wild beast as i ever met even among british irregular cavalry said the viler deaths the rebels died the better theyd be less ready to mutiny again i can see him yet sitting forward glaring into the fire pushing back his fair hair with that nervous gesture he had and steady sam browne squinting at him quizzically drawing on his cigar saying nothing i know we talked too of light cavalry and russell was teasing hodson with the prowess of the black sea cossacks winking at me when destiny in the unlikely shape of general mansfield tapped me on the shoulder and said sir colin wants you directly i didnt think twice about it but pitched my cheroot into the fire and sauntered through the lines to the chiefs tent computing my loot in my mind and drinking in the warm night air with sleepy content even when campbells greeting to me was how well dye know the rani of jhansi i wasnt uncomfortably surprised thered been a dispatch in about the jhansi campaign that very day and campbell already knew about my mission for palmerston it all seemed a long way away now i said i had known her very well we had talked a great deal together and her city her fortress says campbell passably sir i was never in her fort proper our meetings were at the palace and im not overfamiliar with the city itself more familiar than sir hugh rose though ill be bound says he tapping a paper in front of him and thats his own opeenion he mentions ye by name in his latest dispatch i didnt care for that it dont do to have generals talking about you i didnt care for the way campbell was looking at me either tapping a nail against those beautifullykept teeth that shone so odd in his ancient face this rani says he at length whats she like i began to say that she was a capable ruler and nobodys fool but he interrupted with one of his barbarous scotch noises taghawaywiye is she pretty man eh how pretty i admitted that she was strikingly beautiful and he grinned and shook his grizzly head aye aye says he and squinted at me yere a strange man flashman ill confess to ye ive evenon had my doots aboot ye dont ask me what for i dont know im frank wi ye dye see ill say that for him he always was this much im certain of he went on ye always win god kens how and im glad i dont ken mysel for i wish to think well of ye but there sir hugh needs ye at jhansi and im sending ye south i didnt know what to think of this or of his curious opinion of me i just stood and waited anxiously this mutiny mischief is just aboot done its a question of scattering the last armies here in oudh and rohilkand and there in bandelkand and hanging nana and tantia and azeemoolah higher than haman jhansi is one of the last nuts tae be cracked and itll be a hard one like enough this bizzum of a rani has ten thousand men and stout city walls sir hugh will have her under siege by the time ye get there and nae doot hell have to take the place by storm but thats not enough which is why you wi your particular deeplomatic knowledge of the rani and her state are essential to sir hugh ye see flashman lord canning and sir hugh and mysel are agreed on one thing and your experience of this wumman may be the key to it he looked me carefully in the eye whatever else befalls we must contrive tae capture the rani of jhansi alive if shed been ugly as sin or twenty years older and scrawny it would never have happened jhansi would have been taken and if a plain elderly rani had been bayoneted or shot in the process no one would have given a damn but canning our enlightened governorgeneral was a sentimental fool intent on suppressing the mutiny with the least possible bloodshed and already alarmed at the toll of vengeance that people like neill and havelock had taken he guessed that sooner or later the righteous wrath of britons at home would die down and that if we slaughtered too many pandies a revulsion would set in which of course it did my guess is that he also feared the death of a young and beautiful rebel princess might just tip the balance of public conscience he didnt want the liberal press depicting her as some indian joan of arc so however many other niggers died male and female she was to be taken alive mind you i could see cannings point and personally i was all for it there wasnt a life anywhere except elspeths and little havvys that was as precious to me then as lakshmibais and i dont mind admitting it but fairs fair i wanted her saved without any dangerous intervention on my part and the farther i could have kept away from jhansi the better id have liked it it wasnt a lucky place for me so i took as long as i decently could getting there in the hope that it might be all over by the time i arrived i had the excuse that the two hundred miles between lucknow and jhansi was damned dangerous country with pandies and the armies of rebel chiefs all over the place i had a strong escort of pathan horse but even so we went warily and didnt sight that fort of illomen on its frowning rock until the last week in march rose was just getting himself settled in by then battering away at the city defences with his guns his army circling the walls in a gigantic ring with observation posts and cavalry pickets all prettily sited to bottle it up he was a good soldier rose careful as campbell but twice as quick and one glance at the rebel defences told you that he needed to be jhansi lay massive and impregnable under the brazen sun with its walls and outworks and the red rebel banner floating lazily above the fort outside the walls the dusty plain had been swept clear of every scrap of cover and the rebel batteries thundered out in reply to our gunners as though warning the besiegers what would happen if they ventured too close and inside there were ten thousand rebels ready to fight to the finish a tough nut as campbell had said well have them out in a week though no fears about that was roses verdict he was another scotsman brisk and brighteyed and spry i knew him well from the crimea where hed been liaison at the frog headquarters and less objectionable than most diplomatsoldiers he was new to india but youd never have guessed it from his easy confidence and dandy air to tell the truth i have difficulty in memory separating his appearance from george custers for they both had the same gimlet assurance as well as the carefully windblown blond hair and artless moustaches there the resemblance ended if wed had rose at little big horn crazy horse and gall could have whistled for their dinners yes a week at most says he and pointed out how he had sited his left and right attacks opposite the strongest points in the rebel defences which our gunners were pounding with redhot shot keeping the pandy fireparties busy quelling the flames which you could see here and there behind the walls flickering crazily through the heathaze frontal night assault as soon as the breaches are big enough and then he snapped his telescope shut bloody work since the pandies are sure to fight to the last but well do the business the question is in all that carnage how do we preserve her ladyship you must be our oracle on that subject what would she personally surrender dyou suppose i looked about me from the knoll on which we stood with his staff officers just before us were the lines of siegeguns in their earthworks shaking the ground with their explosions the smoke wraithing back towards us as the gunners crawling like ants round their pieces reloaded and fired again either side the pickets of the flying cavalry i amps were strung out as far as the eye could see the red jackets of the light dragoons and the grey khakee of the hyderabad troopers coats dusty with the new currypowder dye two miles behind us near the ruins of the old cantonment were the endless tentlines of the infantry brigades waiting patiently till the guns had done their work on the massive walls of jhansi city behind which the jumble of distant houses stretched in the smoky haze up to the mighty crag of the fortress shed be up there somewhere perhaps in that cool durbar room or on the terrace playing with her pet monkeys perhaps she was with her chiefs and soldiers looking out at the great army that was going to swallow her up and reduce her city and fairy palace to rubble mera jhansi denge nay thinks i surrender says i no i doubt if she will well you know her he gave me that odd leery look that id got used to even in the few hours id been at his headquarters whenever her name was mentioned the popular view was that she was some gorgeous human tigress who prowled halfnaked through sumptuous apartments supervising the torture of discarded legions of lovers oh my pious generation had splendid imaginations i may tell you weve tried proclamation of course says rose but since we cant guarantee immunity to her followers we might as well save our breath on the other hand she may not be eager to see her civilians exposed to continuous bombardment followed by the horrors of assault what i mean being a woman what is she like by the way shes a lady says i extremely lovely uses french scent is kind to animals fences like a hungarian hussar prays for several hours each day recreates herself on a white silk swing in a room full of mirrors gives afternoon teaparties for society ladies and hangs criminals up in the sun by their thumbs useful horsewoman too good god says rose staring and behind him his staff were gaping at me roundeyed licking their lips are you serious what about lovers hey says one of the staff sweating and hornyeyed they say she keeps a hareem of muscular young bucks primed with lovepotions she didnt tell me says i and i didnt ask her even you wouldnt i fancy well says rose glancing at me and then away we must certainly consider whats to be done about her that was how i employed myself for the next three days while the guns and eightinch mortars smashed away in fine style opening a sizeable breach in the south wall and burning up the rebels repair barricades with redhot shot we blew most of their heavy gun posts into rubble and by the th rose was drawing up final orders for his infantry stormers and still we had reached no firm plan for capturing lakshmibai unharmed for the more i thought about it the more certain i became that shed fight it out in person when our infantry fought their way handtohand into her palace it was easy after lucknow to imagine bloody corpses on that quilted chinese carpet and the mirrors shattered by shot and yelling looters smashing and tearing in those priceless apartments sabring and bayoneting everything that stood in their way god knows it was nothing new to me and id lent a hand in my time when it had been safe to do so but these would be her rooms her possessions and i was sentimental enough to be sorry for that because id liked them and been happy there by george id got her into my bloodstream though hadnt i lust when i started worrying about her damned furniture and what would happen to her in that madhouse of blood and steel try as i might i could see nothing for it but to tell off a picked platoon with orders to make straight for the palace and secure her unharmed at any price provided she didnt get in the way of a stray shot there was no reason why they shouldnt bring her out safe by god though that was one detail id have to avoid no my job would be her reception and safekeeping when the slaughter was safely over flashy the stern and sorrowful jailer firm but kindly shielding her from prying eyes and lecherous staffwallopers with dirty minds that was the ticket shed have to be escorted away perhaps even to calcutta where theyd decide what to do with her a nice long journey that and shed be grateful for a friendly face among her enemies especially one for which shed shown such a partiality in the past i thought of that pavilion and that gleaming bronze body undulating towards me quivering voluptuously to the music well have dancing every night thinks i in our private hackery and if im not down to twelve stone by the time we reach calcutta it wont be for want of nocturnal exercise i explained my thoughts to rose the first part about the special platoon not the rest at dinner in his tent and he frowned and shook his head too uncertain says he we need something concerted and executed before the battle has even reached her palace we must have her snug and secure by then well i dont for the life of me see how youre going to do that says i we cant send anyone in ahead of the troops to kidnap her or any such thing they wouldnt get a hundred yards through the streets of jhansi and if they did she has a pathan guard hundreds strong covering every inch of the palace no says he thoughtfully picking at his cheroot force wouldnt serve i agree but diplomacy now what dye think lyster this was young harry lyster roses galloper and the only other person present at our talk id known him any time the past ten years hed been a special constable with me at the chartist farce of when i took up old morrisons truncheon and did his duty for him me and gladstone and louis napoleon holding the plebeian mob at bay i dont think lyster was a smart un though given a silver spoon hed have been a field marshal by now bribery perhaps if we could smuggle a proposal to some of her officers says he too complicated says rose and youd probably just lose your money theyve eaten her salt says i you couldnt buy em i was far from sure of that by the way but i wanted to squash all this talk of intrigue and secret messages id heard it too often before and i know who finishes up sneaking through the dark with his bowels gurgling and his hair standing on end in the enemys lair im afraid it comes down to the special platoon after all sir a good native officer with intelligent jawans counsel of despair flashman rose shook his head decisively no well have to trick her out heres a possibility storm the city as we intend but leave her a bolthole if we draw off our cavalry pickets from the orcha gate theyll spot the weakness and when our rebel lady sees that her citys doomed ill be much surprised if she dont try to make a run for it how well do indian women ride this one like a polish lancer it might work says i if she dont suspicion what were up to but if she smells a rat shell be smelling too much powdersmoke by then to notice anything else says rose confidently shell break for the open to try to join tantia or some other rebel leader and well be waiting for her on the orcha toad what dyou say gentlemen says he smiling well it suited me although i thought he underrated her subtlety but lyster was nodding agreement and nose went on yes i think well try that but only as a long stop its still not enough lord canning attaches the utmost importance to capturing the rani unscathed that being so we must play every card in our hand and we have s trump which it would be folly not to use for everything its worth he turned and snapped a pointing finger at me you flashman i choked on my glass and covered my dismay with a shuddering cough i sir i tried to get my breath back how sir i mean what we cant afford to neglect the opportunity which your knowledge of this woman your familiarity with her gives us i dont suppose theres a white man living who has been on closer terms with her isnt that so well now sir i dont know i still think we can talk her out public offers of surrender are useless we agree but a private offer now secretly conveyed with my word of honour and lord cannings attached to it that might be a different matter especially if it were persuasively argued by a british officer she could trust you follow me all too well i followed him i could see the abyss of ruin and despair opening before my feet once again as the brighteyed lunatic went eagerly on the offer would assure her that her life would be spared if she gave herself up she doesnt have to surrender jhansi even just her own person how can she refuse she could even keep her credit intact with her own people thats it cries he smacking the table if she accepts all she has to do is take advantage of the bolthole were going to leave her through the orcha gate she can pretend to her own folk that shes trying to escape and well snap her up as she emerges no one would ever know it was a putup business except her and ourselves he beamed at us in triumph lyster was frowning will she accept and leave her city and people to their fate he glanced at me oh come come cries rose she aint european royalty you know these black rulers dont care a snuff for their subjects aint that so flashman i seized on this like a drowning man this one does sir says i emphatically she wouldnt betray em never the irony of it was i believed it to be true he stared at me in disappointment i cant credit that says he i cant im positive youre mistaken flashman he shook his head but we have nothing to lose by trying at any rate but if i went in under a flag of truce demanding private audience with her pshaw who said anything about a flag of truce of course that would blow the gaff at once her people would know there was something up he tapped the table grinning at me bursting with his own cleverness didnt i say you were the trump card you not only know her well youre one of the few men who can get inside jhansi and into her presence with no one the wiser as a native he sat back laughing havent you done it a score of times why all the world knows about how you brought kavanaugh out of lucknow what dye think theyre calling you down in bombay these days the pall mall pathan there are times when you know it absolutely aint worth struggling any longer first palmerston then outram and now rose and they were only the most recent in a long line of enthusiastic madmen who at one time or another had declared that i was just the chap they were looking for to undertake some ghastly adventure i made one attempt at a feeble excuse by pointing out that i didnt have a beard any longer rose brushed it aside as of no importance poured me another brandy and began to elaborate his idiot plan in essence it was what ive already described i was to convince lakshmibai of the wisdom of giving herself op and if she accepted i was to explain how she must make an attempt to escape through the unguarded orcha gate at the very height of our attack on jhansi city the timing said rose was of the utmost importance and the further advanced our attack was before she made her bolt the less suspicion her people might feel and if she rejects the offer as i know she will i asked him then on no account must you say anything about the orcha gate says he only when she has accepted the offer must you explain how her capture is to be contrived but if she does refuse well she may still be tempted to use a bolthole in the last resort if we leave her one so we shall nab her anyway he concluded smugly and i if she refuses my guess says he airily puffing at his cheroot is that shell try to keep you as a hostage i hardly think shed do more than that what anyway says he clapping me on the arm i know youve never counted risk yet i saw you at balaclava by george did you know about that i lyster he went on charging with the heavies wasnt enough for this beauty he had to go in with the lights as well and do you know he actually sat laughing at me in admiration it would turn your stomach so there it was again hell in front and no way out i tried to balance the odds in my mind while i kept a straight face and punished the brandy would lakshmibai listen to me probably not she might try to escape when all was lost but shed never give herself up and leave her city to die what would she do with me then i conjured up a picture of that dark face smiling up at me with parted lips when i pinned her and kissed her against the mirrored wall i remembered the pavilion no she wouldnt do me harm if she could help it unless had she set those thugs after me no that had been ignatieff and yet there was the jhansi massacre how deep had she been in that who knew what went on in an indian mind if it came to that was she as cruel and treacherous as all the rest of them i couldnt say but i was going to find out by god whether i liked it or not id know when i came face to face with her and just for an instant i felt a leap of eagerness in my chest at the thought of seeing her once more it was only for an instant and then i was sweating again ill say this for hugh rose along with his fiendish ingenuity for dreaming up dangers for me he had an equally formidable talent of organisation it took him a good thirty seconds to think of a foolproof way of getting me safe inside jhansi i would have the next day to prepare my disguise with skindye and the rest and the following night he would loose a squadron of hyderabad cavalry in a sudden raid on the breach in the city wall they would break through the flimsy barrier which the defenders had thrown up sabre a few sentries create a hell of a row and then withdraw in good order leaving behind among the rubble one native badmash of unsavoury appearance to wit colonel flashman late of the th lancers and general staff id have no difficulty said rose breezily in lying low for half an hour and then emerging as one of the defenders after that all i had to do was tool up through the streets to the palace and knock on the door like barnacle bill speaking from a safe distance i can say it was a sound scheme hearing it propounded at the time i thought it was fit to loosen the bowels of a bronze statue but the hellish thing is whatever a general suggests you can do nothing but grin and agree and i have to admit it worked i dont remember the agonising day i must have spent waiting and attiring myself in a filthy sepoy uniform so that i could pass in my old role of rd cavalry mutineer but ill never forget the last moment of suspense beside the siege guns with the hyderabadi troopers round me in the gloom and rose clasping my hand and then the whispered order and the slow muffled advance through the cold dark with only the snorting of the horses and the creak of leather to mark our passing towards that looming distant wall with the dull crimson glow of the city behind it and the broad gap of the breach where the watchfires twinkled and we could even see figures silhouetted as they moved to and fro away to our left flank the nightbatteries were firing distant tiny jets of flame in the dark pounding away at the flank of the city which faced the old cantonment that was for diversion i could smell the bazaar stink from jhansi and still we hadnt been spotted even through my genuine funk i could feel that strange tremor of excitement that every horsesoldier knows as the squadrons move forward silently in the gloom towards an unsuspecting enemy slowly and ponderously bumpbumpbump at the walk knee to knee one hand on the bridle tother on the hilt of the lampblacked sabre ears straining for the first cry of alarm how often id known it and been terrified by it in afghanistan at cawnpore with rowbotham in the punjab under the walls of fort raim when i rode against the russians with old izzat kutebar and the horde of the blue wolves and that lovely witch ko dalis daughter touching my hand in the dark the crack of a rifle a distant yell and the thunderous roar of the rissaldar ayehee squahdrahn charge the dark mass either side seemed to leap forward and then i was thundering along flat down againstmy ponys flanks like an glala as we tore across the last furlong towards the breach the hyderabadis screamed like fury as they spread out except for the four who remained bunched ahead and either side of me as a protective screen beyond them i could see the smoky glare of the fires in the breach a rubblestrewn gap a hundred yards wide with a crazy barricade thrown across it pinpoints of flame were twinkling in the gloom and shots whistled overhead and then the first riders were at the barrier jumping it or bursting through sabres swinging my frontgallopers swerved in among the jumble of fallen masonry and scorched timbers howling like dervishes i saw one of them sabring down a pandy who thrust up at him with musket and bayonet while another rode slap into a big whitedhotied fellow who was springing at him with a spear his horse stumbled and went down and i scrambled my own beast over a pile of stones and plaster from which a dark figure emerged shrieking and vanished into the gloom there was a fire straight ahead and men running towards me so i jerked my beasts head round and made for the shadows to my right two hyderabadis surged up at my elbow charging into the advancing group and under their cover i managed to reach the lee of a ruined house while the clash of steel the crack of musketry and the yells of the fighters sounded behind me close by the house there was a tangle of bushes one quick glance round showed no immediate enemy making for me and i rolled neatly out of the saddle into what seemed to be a midden crawled frantically under the bushes and lay there panting id dropped my sabre but i had a stout knife in my boot and a revolver in my waist under my shirt i snuggled back as far into cover as i could and kept mum feet went pounding by towards the tumult at the barricade and for two or three minutes the pandemonium of shooting and yelling continued then it died down to be replaced by a babble of insults from the defenders presumably directed at our retreating cavalry a few shots went after them and then comparative peace descended on that small corner of jhansi so far so good but as some clever lad once said we hadnt gone very far i waited perhaps quarter of an hour and then burrowed through the bushes and found myself in a narrow lane there was no one about but round the corner was a watchfire with a few pandies and bazaarwallahs round it i ambled past them exchanging a greeting and they didnt do more than give me an idle glance two minutes later i was in the bazaar buying a chapatti and chili and agreeing with the boothwallah that if the sahiblog couldnt do better than the feeble skirmish there had just been down at the breach then theyd never take jhansi although it was three in the morning the narrow streets were as busy as if it had been noon there were troops on the move everywhere rebels of the th ni regulars of the ranis maharatta army bhil soldiersoffortune and every sort of armed tribesman from the surrounding country with spiked helmets long swords round shields and all kinds of firearm from minies to matchlocks it looked to me as though jhansi knew our main attack was soon coming and they were moving reserves down to the walls there were ten civilian townsfolk about for every soldier and the booths were doing a roaring trade here and there were ruined shops and houses where some of our stray shots had fallen but there was no sign of unease as youd have expected rather a sense of excitement and hustle with everyone wideawake and chattering a party ofcoolies went by dragging a cart piled with sixpounder cartridges and i took the opportunity to remark to the boothwallah there go a thousand english lives eh brother like enough says he scowling and every cannonshot means another anna in markettax lives can be bought too dear even english ones nay the rani will pay it from her treasury says i giving him my shrill sepoy giggle hohoho hear him says he scornfully you should set up a stall soldier and see how fat you get when did the rani ever pay or any other prince what are we for but to pay while the great ones make war just what theyd be saying in the reform club or the star and garter thinks i aloud i said they say she holds a great council in the fort tonight is it true she did not invite me says he sarcastically nor strangely enough did she offer me the use of the palace when she left it that will be three pice soldier i paid him having learned what i wanted to know and took the streets that led up to the fort with my knees getting shakier at every step by god this was a chancy business i had to nerve myself with the thought that whatever her feelings towards my country and army shed never shown anything but friendliness to me and shed hardly show violence to an envoy from the british general even so when i found myself gazing across the little square towards that squat frowning gateway with the torches blazing over it and the red jacketed pathan sentries of her personal guard standing either side i had to fight down the temptation to scuttle back into the lanes and try to hide until it was all over nly the certainty that those lanes would shortly be a bloody battleground sent me reluctantly on i wound my puggaree tightly round head and chin hiding half my face slipped from my pocket the note which rose and i had carefully prepared walked firmly across to the sentry and demanded to see the guard commander he came out yawning and expectorating and who should it be but my old acquaintance who spat on shadows i gave him the note and said this is for the ranis hand and no other take it to her and quickly he glowered from me to it and back what is this and who may you be if she wishes you to know belike shell tell you i growled and squatted down in the archway but be sure if you delay shell have that empty head off your shoulders he stood glaring turning the note in his hands evidently it impressed him with a red seal carrying young lysters family crest it should have done for after an obscene inquiry about my parentage which i ignored he scratched himself and then loafed off bidding the sentries keep an eye on me i waited with my heart hammering for this was the moment when things might go badly astray rose and i had cudgelled our brains for wording that would mean nothing to anyone but her in case the note fell into the wrong hands as an added precaution wed written it in schoolboy french which i knew she understood it said simply ne who brought perfume and a picture is here see him alone trust him rose had been delighted with this he was plainly one who enjoyed intrigue for its own sake and ive no doubt would have liked to sign it with a skull and crossbones squatting in the doorway i couldnt take such a lighthearted view assuming that pathan blockhead took it straight to her shed guess who it was from fast enough but suppose she didnt want to see me suppose she thought the best way of answering the message would be to send me back iii bits to roses headquarters suppose she showed it to someone else or it miscarried or the sound of marching feet came from the gloom beyond the archway and i got to my feet quivering the havildar came out of the dark with two troopers behind him he stopped gave me a long glowering look and then jerked his head i went forward and he motioned me on into the courtyard beyond falling in beside me with the two troopers behind i wanted to ask him if hed given the note to the rani personally but my tongue seemed to have shrivelled up id know soon enough as my eyes became accustomed to the gloom after the glare of the torches by the gate i saw that we were heading across the yard with high black walls on either side and another torch at the far end over a doorway guarded by two more pathans in growls the havildar and i found myself in a small vaulted guardroom i blinked in the sudden glare of oil lamps and then my heart lurched down into my boots for the figure peering intently towards me from the centre of the room was the little fat chamberlain whom i knew so well from lakshmibais durbar the stupid bitch had told him who i was there was no hope of a secret offer now roses fatheaded scheme had sprung a leak and you are the officer who brought gifts from the british queen he squeaked the sirkars envoy colonel flashman he was squinting at me in consternation as well he might for i didnt look much like the dandy staff officer hed known sick and fearful i peeled off my puggaree and pushed my hair back yes said i im colonel flashman you must take me to the rani at once he goggled at me his little eyes wide in that fat face twisting his hands nervously and then something fluttered in the air between us for an instant i thought it was a moth and fell to the floor with a tiny puff of sparks it was a cigarette smoking on the flags a long yellow tube with a mouthpiece all in good time said ignatieffs voice and i believe i actually cried out with shock as i spun round to stare in horrified disbelief at the doorway he was standing there his hand still frozen in the act of flicking away the cigarette ignatieff whom id supposed a thousand miles away by now looking at me with his dreadful cold smile and then inclining his tawny head all in good time he repeated in english as he came forward he ground his heel on the fallen cigarette after we have resumed the discussion which was so unfortunately interrupted at balmoral how ive survived fourscore years without heart seizure i do not know perhaps im inured to the kind of shock i experienced then with my innards surging up into my throat i couldnt move but stood there with my skin crawling as he came to stand in front of me a new ignatieff this in flowered shirt and pyjamy trousers and persian boots and with a little gingery beard adorning his chin but the rattrap mouth was still the same and that unwinking halfblue halfbrown eye boring into me i have been anticipating this meeting says he ever since i learned of your mission to india did you know i heard about it before you did yourself he gave a chilly little smile he could never resist bragging this one the secret deliberations of the astute lord palmerston are not as secret as he supposes and it has been a fools errand has it not but never so foolish as now you should have been thankful to escape me twice but you come blundering back a third time very well the gotch eye seemed to harden with a brilliant light you will not have long to regret it with an effort i got my voice back damned shaky though it was ive nothing to say to you cries i as truculently as i could and turned on the little chamberlain my business is with the rani lakshmibai not with this this renegade i demand to see her at once tell her ignatieffs hand smashed across my mouth sending me staggering but his voice didnt rise by a fraction that will not be necessary says he and the little chamberlain dithered submissively her highness is not to be troubled for a mere spy i shall deal with this jackal myself in a pigs eye you will i blustered im an envoy from sir hugh rose to the rani not to any holeandcorner russian bully youll hinder me at your peril damn you let me loose i roared as the two troopers suddenly grabbed my elbows im a staff officer you cant touch me im staff officer envoy ignatieffs words came out in that raging icy whisper that took me back to the nightmare of that verminous dungeon beneath fort arabat you crawl here in your filthy disguise like the spy you are and claim to be treated as an emissary if that is what you are why did you not come in uniform under a flag in open day his face was frozen in fury and then the brute hit me again i shall tell you because you are a dishonoured liar whose word no one would trust treachery and deceit are your trade or is it assassination this time his hand shot out and whipped the revolver from my waist its a lie i shouted send to sir hugh rose hell tell you i was appealing to the chamberlain you know me man tell the rani i demand it but he just stood gaping waiting for ignatieff whose sudden anger had died as quickly as it came since sir hugh rose has not honoured us with a parley there is no reason why we should address him says he softly we have to deal only with a night prowler he gestured to the troopers take him down youve no authority i roared im not answerable to you you russian swine let me go they were dragging me forward by main strength while i bawled to the chamberlain pleading with him to tell the rani they ran me through a doorway and down a flight of stone steps with ignatieff following the chamberlain twittering in front of him i struggled in panic for it was plain that the brute was going to prevent the rani hearing of my arrival until after hed done i nearly threw up in terror for the troopers were hauling me across the floor to an enormous wheel like a cable drum set perpendicular above ground level there were manacles dangling from it and fetters attached to the stone floor beneath it jesus they had racked murray to death in this very fort ilderim had said and now they flung me against the hellish contraption one grinning trooper pinning me bodily while the other snapped the floorchains round my ankles i yelled and swore the chamberlain sank down fearfully on the bottom step and ignatieff lit another cigarette so much would not be necessary if i only sought information says he in that dreadful metallic whisper with such a coward as you the threat is sufficient but you are going to tell me why you are here what treachery you intended and for what purpose you wished to see her highness and when i am satisfied that you have told me everything he stepped close up to me that awful eye staring into mine and concluded in russian for my benefit alone the racking will continue until you are dead he signed to the troopers and stepped back for christs sake ignatieff i screamed you cant do this im a british officer a white man let me go you bastard please in gods name ill tell you i felt the drum turn behind me as the troopers put their weight on the lever drawing my arms taut above my head no no let me go you foul swine im a gentleman damn you for pitys sake weve had tea with the queen no please there was a clank from the huge wheel and the chains wrenched at my wrists and ankles sending shoots of pain through my arm and thigh muscles i howled at the top f my voice as the wheel turned stretching me to what seemed the limit of endurance and ignatieff stepped closer again why did you come says he let me go you vile bloody dog you behind him i saw that the chamberlain was on his feet white with horror run i yelled run you stupid fat sod get your mistress quickly but he seemed rooted to the spot and then the drum clanked again and an excruciating agony flamed through my biceps and shoulders as though they were being hauled out of my body i tried to scream again but nothing came out and then his devils face was next to mine again and i was babbling dont dont for jesus sake ill tell you ill tell you and even through the red mist of pain i knew that once i did i was a dead man but i couldnt bear it i had to talk and then inspiration came through the agony and i let my head loll sideways with a groan that died away if only i could buy a moments time if only the chamberlain would run for help if only ignatieff would believe id fainted and i could keep up the pretence with my whole body shrieking in pain his palm slapped across my face and i couldnt restrain a cry his hand went up to the troopers and i gasped no ill tell you dont let them turn it again i swear its the truth only dont let them do it again oh god please not again well says he and i knew i couldnt delay any longer i couldnt bear another turn general rose my voice seemed to be a whisper from miles away im on his staff he sent me to see the rani please its the gods truth h make them let me down go on says that dreadful voice what was your message i was to ask her i was staring into his horrible eye seeing it through a blur of tears and then somewhere in the obscured distance behind him there was a movement at the top of the steps and as i blinked my vision was suddenly clear and my voice broke into a shuddering sigh of relief and i let my head fall back for the door at the top of the steps was open with my redcoated guard sergeant that wonderful bearded genius of a pathan who spat on shadows holding it back and a white figure was stepping through stopping abruptly staring down at us i had always thought she was beautiful but at that moment lakshmibai looked like an angel pavilioned in splendour i was in such anguish that it was even an effort to keep my eyes open so i didnt but i heard her cry of astonishment and then the chamberlain babbling and ignatieff swinging round and then believe it or not what she said in a voice shrill with anger was stop that at once stop it do you hear for all the world like a young schoolmistress coming into class and catching little johnny piddling in the inkwell ill swear she stamped as she said it and even at the time halffainting with pain that i was i thought it sounded ridiculous and then suddenly with an agonising jerk that made me cry out the fearful traction on my limbs was relaxed and i was sagging against the wheel trying to top my tortured legs from buckling under me but im proud to say i still had my wits about me you wont get anything out of me i groaned you russian hound ill die first i fluttered an eye open to see how this was received but she was too busy choking back her fury as she confronted ignatieff this is by your order lord it was a lovely voice i o you know who this is ill say this for him he faced her without so much as a blink indeed he even tossed his blasted cigarette aside in deference before giving his little bow to her it is a spy highness who stole into your city in disguise as you can see it is a british officer she was blazing trembling from her white headveil all down her shapely sariwrapped body to her little pearled sandals an envoy of the sirkar who brings a message for me for me and she stamped again where is it ignatieff pulled the note from his girdle and handed it to her without a word she read it and then folded a deliberately and looked him in the face sher khan tells me he had orders to deliver it into my hands alone she was holding in her anger still with an effort but seeing him with it you asked what it might be and the fool gave it you and having read it you dared to question this man without my leave it was a suspicious message highness says ignatieff dead level and this man was obviously a spy you bloody liar croaks i you knew damned well what i was dont listen to him lakshmi highness the swines got it in for me he was trying to murder me out of spite she gave me one look and then fronted ignatieff again spy or not it is i who rule here sometimes i think you forget it count ignatieff she faced him eye to eye for a long moment and then turned away from him she looked at me and then away and we all waited in dead silence finally she said quietly i shall see to this man and decide what is to be done with him she turned to ignatieff you may go count he bowed and said i regret if i have offended your highness if i have done so it was out of zeal for the cause we both serve your highnesss government he paused and my imperial masters i would be failing in my duty to both if i did not remind you that this man is a most dangerous and notorious british agent and that i know very well who and what he is says she quietly and at that the gotcheyed sonofabitch said no more but bowed again and took himself off with the two troopers sidling hastily after him salaaming nervously as they passed her they clattered up the steps behind ignatieff and sher khan closed the door after them and that left the four of us all cosy as ninepence lakshmibai standing like a glimmering white statue the little chamberlain twitching in anxious silence sher khan on the door and h flashman esq doing his celebrated imitation of a protestant martyr damned uncomfortable too but something told me grateful babblement wouldnt be in order so i said as steadily as i could thank you your highness forgive me if i dont make my bow but in the circumstances very gallant you see but the truth was that fiery pains were still shooting through my arms and legs and it was all i could do to keep from gasping and groaning she was standing looking at me quite expressionless so i added hopefully if your havildar would release me but she didnt move a muscle and i felt a sudden thrill of unease under the steady gaze of those dark eyes the whites so clear against her dusky skin what the hell was she up to keeping me strung up on this bloody machine and not so much as a glimmer of a smile or recognition even i palpitated while she stood watching me and thinking and then she came up within a yard of me and spoke in a flat hard voice what did he want to know from you the tone took my breath away but i held my head up he wanted to know my business with your highness her glance went to the chains on my wrists then back to my face and did you tell him f course not i thought a brave smile mightnt be out of place so i tried one i like people to ask me questions politely she turned her head towards the little chamberlain is this true he puffed and flapped his arms all eagerness indeed exalted highness not a word did the colonel sahib say not even under the cruel torture he did not even cry out much oh he is an officer sahib of course and poor little bastard was hoping to butter his bread on the right side of course but i wasnt sure he was backing a winner here she was still looking at me as if i was some carcase on a butchers slab the chilling thought struck me that it probably wasnt the first time shed contemplated some poor devil in my situation god perhaps even murray and then she turned her head and called to sher khan and he came tumbling down the steps double quick while the sweat broke out on me surely she wasnt going to order him to release him says she and i near fainted with relief she watched impassively while he undamped me and i took a few staggering and damned painful steps catching at that hellish wheel for support then bring him says she curtly i shall question him myself and without another word she turned and walked up the steps out of the dungeon and with the little chamberlain bobbing nervously behind her and sher khan spitting and grunting as he assisted me to follow speak well of me to her highness husoor he muttered as he gave me a shoulder if i blundered in giving thy kitab to the ruski sahib did i not make amends i went for her when i saw he meant to illuse thee i had not recognised thee god knows i reassured him he could have had a knighthood and the town hall clock for my part as he conducted me up through the guardroom to a little spiral stair and then along a great stone passage of the fort which gave way to a carpeted corridor where sentries of her guard stood in their steel caps and backsandbreasts i limped along relieved to find that apart from a few painfullypulled muscles and badly skinned wrists and ankles i wasnt much the worse yet and then sher khan was ushering me through a door and i found myself in a smaller version of the durbarroom at the palace a long low richlyfurnished apartment all in white with a quilted carpet and silk hangings on the walls divans and cushions and glowing persian pictures and even a great silver cage in which tiny birds cheeped and fluttered the air was heavy with perfume but i still hadnt got the stink of fear out of my nostrils and the sight of lakshmibai waiting did nothing to cheer me up she was sitting on a low backless couch listening to the little chamberlain who was whispering fifteen to the dozen but at sight of me she stopped him there were two of her ladies with her and the whole group just looked at me the women curiously and lakshmibai with the same damned disinheriting stare shed used in the dungeon set him there says she to sher khan pointing to the middle of the floor and tie his hands behind him lie jumped to it wrenching the knots with no thought for my flayed wrists he will be safe enough so she added to the little chamberlain go all of you and sher khan will remain beyond the door within call dear god was she going to set about me herself i wondered as the ladies swiftly rustled out and the chamberlain hurried by eyeing me apprehensively i heard sher khan withdraw and the door close leaving me standing and her sitting erect staring at me and then to my amazement she sprang from the seat and was flying across the room towards me with her arms out and her lace trembling throwing herself against me clinging to me and sobbing h my darling one my darling my darling you have come back oh i thought i should never see you again and her arms were round my neck and that lovely dark face all wet with tears was upturned to mine and she was kissing me any old how on the cheeks and chin and eyes and mouth sobbing out endearments and shuddering against me im an easygoing chap as you know and can take things pretty well as they come but ill admit that i wondered if i was mad or dreaming not much above two hours ago id been in roses tent in the safety of british lines gulping down a last brandy and trying to read the advertisements in an old copy of the times to take my mind off the ordeal ahead with young lyster humming a popular song and since then id taken part in a cavalry skirmish and skulked through a hostile nigger city in disguise and been scared out of my senses by that fiend ignatieffs appearance and stretched on a rack in fearful physical and even worse mental agony and been rescued at the last minute and dragged and bound in the presence of a female despot and here she was clinging and weeping and slobbering over me as though i were little willie the colliers dying child it was all a shade more than enough for my poor bemused brain and body and i just sank to my knees under the weight of it all and she sank with me crying and kissing h my sweet have they hurt you i thought i should swoon when i saw ah your poor flesh before i knew it she was down at my legs soothing my scraped ankles with one hand while she kept the other behind my head and kissed me long and lingeringly on the mouth my amazement was giving way to the most wonderful mixture of relief and joy and pure ecstatic pleasure in that scented dark skin pressed against my face her open mouth trembling on mine i could feel her breasts hard against me and dammit my hands were tied and i could only strain against her until she freed her lips and looked at me holding my face between her hands h lucky lucky lakshmi i was babbling out of sheer delight h you wonderful beautiful creature i thought you were dead says she cradling my head down against her bosom by george that was the place to be and i struggled my hands desperately to try to free them all these months i have mourned you ever since that dreadful day when they found the dead dacoit near the pavilion and i thought she gave a little sob and pulled up my face to kiss me again and you are safe and back again with me my darling the great eyes were brimming with tears again ah i so love you well id heard it before of course expressed with varying degrees of passion by countless females and its always gratifying but i couldnt recall a moment when it had been more welcome than now if ever i needed a woman to be deeply affected with my manly charms this was the moment and being half in love with her myself it required no effort at all to play up and make the most of it so i put my mouth on hers again and used my weight to bear her down on the cushions damned difficult with my hands bound but she was all for it and lay there drinking me in teasing with her tongue and stroking my face gently with her fingertips until i thought id burst lakshmi chabeli untie my hands i croaked and she disengaged herself glancing towards the door and then smiling at me longingly i cannot not now you see no one must know yet to them you are a prisoner a spy sent by the british soldiers i can explain all that i had to come secretly in disguise to bring you a message from general rose lakshmi dearest youve got to accept it its an offer of life please untie me and let me tell you wait says she come sit here and she helped me up pausing on the way to fondle me again and kiss me before seating me on the edge of a divan it is best for the moment that we leave you bound oh beloved it will not be for long i promise but in case someone comes suddenly see i shall get you a drink you must be parched ah and your poor wrists so cruelly torn the tears welled up again and then such a look of blazing hatred passed across her face that i shrank where i sat that beast of russia says she clenching her tiny fist he will pay for it i will have him drawn apart and make him eat that hideous eye of his and the tsar his master may go straight to hell and look for him excellent sentiments i thought and while she filled a goblet with sherbet i thought id improve the shining hour it was ignatieff who set the thugs on me that night hes been dogging me ever since i came to india spying and trying to stir up rebellion i suddenly stopped there she after all was now one of the leaders of that rebellion and obviously ignatieff was her ally whatever her personal feelings towards him she put the cup to my lips and i drank greedily being put on the racks the way to raise a thirst you know and when id finished she stood up with the cup between her hands looking down at me if i had only listened to you says she if there had only been more time i did not know if only i could make you understand all the years of waiting and trying to right injustice to to me and my son and my jhansi how is the young fella by the way well eh and thriving fine lad that and waiting turns to despair and despair to hatred and i thought you were another cold and unfeeling creature of the sirkar and yet she suddenly knelt down in front of me and caught my hands and there was a look in her great almond eyes that made even my experienced old heart skip a beat and yet i knew that you were not like the others you were gentle and kind and you seemed to understand and then that day when we fenced in the durbar room i felt something inside me that that i had not known before and later in the pavilion says i hoarsely h lakshmi that was the most wonderful moment of my life really capital dont ye know beat everything darling couldnt you untie my hands a second just for an instant there was a strange distant look in her eyes and then she turned her head away and her hands tightened on mine and when you disappeared and i thought you dead there was such an emptiness she was trying not to cry and nothing else seemed to matter not i or jhansi even and then came news of the red wind sweeping through the british garrisons in the north and even here in my own state they killed them all and i was helpless she was biting her lip staring pleadingly at me and if shed been before the house of lords the old goats would have been roaring not guilty on my honour with three times three and what could i do it seemed that the raj and i hated the raj was falling and my own cousin nana was raising the standard of revolt and to stand idle was to lose jhansi to the jackals of rcha or gwalior or even to the sepoys themselves oh but you are british and you cannot understand dearest says i you dont have to excuse yourself to me of all people what else could you do it wasnt an idle question either the only treason is to pick the wrong side which in the long run she had done but it doesnt matter you see thats why im here it can all come right again at least you can be saved and thats what counts she looked at me and said simply i do not care now that you have come back and she leaned forward and kissed me again gently on the lips you must care says i see here ive come from general rose and what he says comes straight from lord canning in calcutta they want to save you my dear if youll let them they want me to surrender says she and stood up she walked away to set the cup down on a table and the sight of the tightwrapped sari stirring over those splendid hips set my fingers working feverishly at the knots behind my back she turned with her bosom going up like balloons and her face was set and sad they want me to give up my jhansi darling its lost anyway any day now theyll storm the walls and thats the end you know it and so must your advisers even ignatieff what the devils he doing here anyhow he has been here and at meerut and delhi everywhere since the beginning promising russian help making rebellion as you say on his masters behalf she made a little helpless gesture i do not know there has been talk of a russian army over the khyber some would welcome it myself i fear it but it does not matter now he remains i suppose as long as he may do your government some harm if jhansi falls he will go to tantia or nana and she added with a shrugged afterthought that somehow prickled my spine unless i have him killed for what he has done to you all in good time thinks i happily and got back to the matter in hand but it isnt jhansi they want its you she opened her eyes at that and i hurried on they cant make terms with rebels why half your garrison must be pandies with nothing to hope for theres no pardon for them you see so theyll storm the city whatever you do but they want to save you alive if you will give yourself up alone then then they wont i couldnt meet her eye though punish you why should they spare me for a minute the fire was back in her eye who else have they spared why should they want to keep me alive when they blow men away from guns and hang them without trial and burn whole cities will they spare nana or tantia or azeemoolah then why the rani of jhansi it wasnt an easy one to answer not truthfully anyway she wouldnt take it too kindly if i said it was just politics to keep the public happy does it matter says i whatever their reasons is it because i am a woman she said it softly and came to stand in front of me and the british do not make war on women she looked steadily at me for several seconds is it because i am beautiful and do they wish to take me to london as the romans did with their captives and show me as a spectacle to the people that aint our style says i pretty sharp f course we dont make war on women and well you see youre well youre different to them to lord canning to general rose they do not know me why should they care why should any of you and then she stopped and dropped to her knees again and her lip was trembling you have you spoken for me you came from lord palmerston have you asked them to save me by george here was an unexpected ball at my foot with a vengeance it hadnt crossed my mind that shed think i was behind roses remarkable offer but when the chance arises i hope i know how to grasp it as well as the next man carefully so i looked at her steady and pretty grim and made myself go red in the face and then looked down at the carpet all dumb and noble and unspoken emotion she put out a hand and lifted my chin and she was absolutely frowning at me did you and have you risked so much to come here for me tell me you know what i think about you says i trying to look romantically stuffed ive loved you since the moment i clapped eyes on you on that swing more than anything else in the world at that moment mind you it wasnt all gammon i did love her pretty well anyway just then not as much as elspeth i dare say although mind you put cm together side by side both stripped down and youd think hard before putting england in to bat anyway id no difficulty in looking sincere not with that flimsy bodice heaving almost under my nose she looked at me in silence with strange grave eyes and then said almost in a whisper tonight i did not think i only knew that you were here with me again when i had thought you lost it did not matter to me whether you loved me truly or not only that you were with me again but now she was looking at me in the strangest way sorrowfully almost and with a kind of perplexity now that you tell me that it was for love of me that you have done this i wondered if she was going to fling herself on me again in tears but after a moment she just kissed me quite gently and then said what do they wish me to do to surrender yourself no more than that but how if the city is to be taken and there is no pardon for the mutineers how can i dont fret about that says i it can all be arranged if i tell you how will you do it if you will stay with me afterwards her eyes were fixed on mine soft but steady i will do whatever they ask persuasively urged rose had said but ill bet hed never envisaged the likes of this by george his randy staff men wouldnt have been able to believe their eyes when the city is stormed says i our fellows will fight their way in to the fortress you must be ready to make an escape through the rcha gate well have drawn off our cavalry picket just there so it can be done in safety you must ride out on the rcha road and then you will be captured it will look as though well it will look all right i see she nodded gravely and the city well itll be taken of course but therell be no looting rose had promised that for what it was worth and of course the people will be all right provided they lie low and dont resist the mutineers well itll all be the same for them anyway and what will they do with me will they imprison me i wasnt sure about this and had to go careful theyd exile her for certain at least to a distant part of india where she could do no harm but there was no point in telling her that no says i theyll treat you very well youll see and then itll all blow over dont you know why i can think of a score of nig native chieftains and kings whove been daggers drawn with us but their wars have got by and then weve been the best of friends and so forth no hard feelings you see we aint vindictive even the liberals i was smiling to reassure her and after a while she began smiling back and gave a great sigh and settled against me seemingly content and i suggested again that it might be a capital notion to unslip my hands just for a moment i was most monstrously horny with her nestling up against me but at this she shook her head and said we had delayed already and must not excite suspicion she kissed me a lingering goodbye and told me to be patient a little longer we must bide our time according to roses plan and since her people must have no inkling of it i would have to be treated as a prisoner but she would send for me when the time was ripe and then we shall go together with only a trusted few she held my face in her hands looking down at me and you will protect me and love me when we come to the sirkar till youre blue in the face you darling houri thinks i but for answer all i did was kiss her hands then she straightened her veil and fussed anxiously with her mirror before seating herself on her divan and it was the charmingest thing to see her give me a last radiant smile and then compose her face in that icy mask while i waited suitably hangdog standing in the middle of the floor at a respectful distance she struck her little gong which brought sher khan in like the village fire brigade with chamberlain and ladies behind him confine this prisoner in the north tower says she as if i were so much dross he is not to be harshly used but keep him close your head on it sher khan i was bustled away forthwith but its my guess that sher khan with that leery pathan nose of his guessed that all was not quite what it seemed for he was a most solicitous jailer in the days that followed he kept me well provisioned bringing all my food and drink himself seeing to it that i was comfortable as my little cell permitted and showing me every sign of respect mind you in view of my afghan reputation that might have been natural enough it took me a few hours to settle down after what i had been through but when i came to cast up the score it looked none so bad bar my aching joints and skinned limbs i was well enough and damned thankful for it as to the future well id thought roses plan was just moonshine but then id never dreamed that lakshmibai was infatuated with me attracted well enough its an odd woman that aint but the force of her passion had been bewildering and yet why not id known it happen before after all and often as not with the same kind of women the highborn pampered kind who go through their young lives surrounded by men who are forever deferring and toadying so that when a real plunger like myself comes along and treats em easy like women and not as queens theyre taken all aback its something new to them to have a big likely chap who aint abashed by their grandeur but looks em over with a warm eye perfectly respectful but daring them just the same they resent it and like it too and if you can just tempt them into bed and show them what theyve been missing why the next thing you know theyre head over heels in love with you thats how it had been with duchess irma and that wild black bitch ranavalona in madagascar so why not the rani of jhansi after all her only husband had been as fishy as dicks hatband by all accounts and however many young stalwarts shed whistled up since then they wouldnt have my style well it was a damned handy stroke of luck as well as being most flattering as to the surrender well she wasnt a fool here was a way out for her with more credit and safety than she could have expected under the wing of the adored flashy who she imagined would protect and cherish her happy ever after i was all for that for a few months anyway which was more than most females could expect from me mark you i was famously taken with her but i guessed id cool after a spell couldnt take her home anyway shed just have to reconcile herself to waving me goodbye when the time came like all the others in the meantime i could only wait in some excitement for rose to mount his assault when a tremendous cannonading in the city broke out on the following day with native pipes and drums squealing and thundering i thought the attack had begun but it was a false alarm as sher khan informed me later it seemed that tantia tope had suddenly hove in sight with a rebel army twenty thousand strong to try to relieve jhansi rose cool as a trout as usual had left his heavy artillery and cavalry to continue the siege and had turned with the rest of his force and thrashed tantia handsomely on the betwa river a few miles away at the same time hed ordered a diversionary attack on jhansi to keep the defenders from sallying out to help tantia that had been the noise id heard so much for our stouthearted mutineers in jhansi sneers sher khan if they had sallied out your army might have been caught like a nut between two stones but they contented themselves with howling and burning powder he spat let the sirkar eat them and welcome i reminded him he was on the rebel side and that it would be short shrift for mutineers when jhansi fell i am no mutineer says he but a paid soldier of the rani i have eaten her salt and fight for her like the yusufzai i am even as i fought for the sirkar in the guides the sahibs know the difference between a rebel and a soldier who keeps faith they will treat me with honour if i live he added carelessly he was another ilderim in his way shorter and uglier with a smashed nose and pocked face but a slapup pathan khyberie every inch with any luck they will have hanged thy ruski friend by now he went on grinning he rode out to join tantia in the night and has not returned is that good news iflassman husoor wasnt it just though f course ignatieff would have been daft to stay in jhansi wed have hanged him high enough for the foreign spy he was hed be off to assist the leading rebels in the field i felt all the better for knowing he was out of distance but i doubted if hed allow himself to be killed or taken he was too downy a bird for that with tantia whipped it seemed to me rose would lose no further time assaulting jhansi but another day and night passed in which i waited and fretted and still there was nothing but the distant thump of cannonfire to disturb my cell it wasnt till the third night that the deuce of a bombardment broke out in the small hours and lasted until almost dawn and then i heard what id been waiting for the crash of volleyfiring that signified british infantry and the sound of explosions within the town itself and even distant bugle calls they are in the city says sher khan when he brought my breakfast the mutineers are fighting better than i thought and it is hot work in the streets they say he grinned cheerfully and tapped the hilt of his khyber knife will her highness order me to cut thy throat when the last attack goes home think ye eat well husoor and the brute swaggered out chuckling plainly she hadnt confided her intentions to him i guessed shed wait for nightfall and then make her run by that time our fellows would be thumping at the gates of the fort itself so i contained myself listened to the crackle of firing and explosion drawing always nearer until by nightfall it seemed to be only a few hundred yards off i was chewing my nails by then i may tell you but the dark came and still the sound of battle went on and i could even hear what i thought were english voices shouting in the distance among the yells and shrieks through the one high window of my cell the nightsky was glaring red jhansi was dying hard by the look of it i dont know what time it was when i heard the sudden rattle of the bolt in my celldoor and sher khan and two of guardsmen came in carrying torches they didnt stand ceremony but hustled me out and down narrow stone stairs and passages to a little courtyard the moon wasnt up yet but it was light enough with the red glare above the walls and the air was heavy with powdersmoke and the drift of burning the crashing of musketry was close outside the fort now the yard seemed to be full of redcoated troopers of the ranis guard and over by a narrow gateway i saw a slim figure mounted on a white horse which i recognised at once as lakshmibai there were mounted guardsmen with her and a couple of her ladies also mounted and heavily veiled one of the mounted men had a child perched on his saddlebow damodar her stepson i was about to call out but to my astonishment sher kahn suddenly stooped beside me there was a metallic snap and he had a fetter clasped round my left leg before i could even protest he was thrusting me towards a horse snarling up husoor and i was no sooner in the saddle than he had passed a short ha in from my fetter under the beasts belly and secured my other ankle so that i was effectively shackled to the pony what the hells this i cried and he chuckled as he swung aboard a horse beside me heavy spurs husoor says he peace it is by her order and doubtless for your own safety follow and he shook my bridle urging me across the square the little party by the gate were already passing out of sight and a moment later we were riding single file down a steep alleyway with towering walls either side sher khan just ahead of me and another pathan immediately behind i couldnt think what to make of this until it dawned on me that she wouldnt have let her entourage into the whole secret they would know she was escaping but not that she intended to give herself up to the british so for forms sake i must appear to be a prisoner still i wished shed given me the chance of a secret word beforehand though and let me ride with her i didnt want us blundering into the besieging cavalry in the dark and perhaps being mistaken however there was nothing for it now but to carry on ur little cavalcade clattered down the alleyways twisting and turning and then into a broader street where a house was burning but there wasnt a soul to be seen and the sound of firing was receding behind us nce wed passed the fire it was damned dark among the rickety buildings until there were torches and a high gateway and more of her guardsmen in the entryway i saw her white horse stop as she leaned from the saddle to consult with the guardcommander and waited with my heart in my mouth until he stepped back saluting and barked an order two of his men threw open a wicket in the main gate and a moment later we were filing through and i knew we were coming out on to the rcha road it was blacker than hell in november under the lee of the great gateway but half a mile ahead there was the twinkling line of our picketfires and flashes of gunfire as the artillery pieces joined in the bombardment of the city sher khan had my bridle in his fist as we moved forward at a walk and then at a slow trot it was easy going on the broad road surface at first but then the dim figures of the riders ahead seemed to be veering away to the right and as we followed my horse stumbled on rough ground we were leaving the road for the flat maidan and i felt the first prickle of doubt in my mind why were we turning aside the path to safety lay straight along the road where roses pickets would be waiting she knew that even if her riders didnt didnt she realise we were going astray that on this tack we would probably blunder into pickets that werent expecting us the time for pretence was past anyhow it was high time i was up with her taking a hand or god knew where we would land but even as i stiffened in my saddle to shove my heels in and forge ahead sher khans hand leaped from my wrist to my bridle there was a zeep of steel and the khyber knife was pricking my ribs with his voice hissing out of the dark ne word bloody lance one word and youll say the next one to shaitan the shock of it knocked my wits endways but only for a moment theres nothing like eighteen inches of razoredged steel for turning a growing doubt into a stoneginger certainty and before wed gone another five paces i had sprung to the most terrifying conclusion she was escaping right enough but not the way rose and i had planned it she was using the information id given her but in her own way it rushed in on me in a mad whirl of thoughts all her protestations her slobbering over me those tearfilled eyes the lips on mine the passionate endearments all false they couldnt be in gods name why shed been all over me like a crazy schoolgirl but now we were pacing still faster in the wrong direction the knife was scoring my side and suddenly there was shouted challenge ahead and a cry the riders were spurring forward a musket cracked and sher khan roared in my ear ride feringhee and ride straight or ill split your backbone he slashed his reins at my pony it bounded forward and in a second i was flying along in the dark willynilly with him at my elbow and the thundering shadows surging ahead there was a fusillade of shots off to the left and a hall whined overhead as i loosed the reins trusting to my ponys feet i saw the picketfires only a few hundred yards off we were racing towards a gap between one fire and the next perhaps two furlongs across all i could do was career ahead with sher khan and a pathan either side of me i couldnt roll from the saddle even if id dared with that infernal chain beneath my horses belly i darent swerve or his knife would be in my back i could only gallop cursing in sick bewilderment praying to god i wouldnt stop a blade or a bullet where the hell were we going was it some ghastly error after all no it was treachery and i knew it and now the picketfires were on our flanks there were more shots a horse screamed ahead of us and my pony swerved past the dim struggling mass on the ground with sher khan still knee to knee with me as we sped on a trumpet was sounding behind and faint voices yelling ahead was the drumming of hooves and the dim shapes of the ranis riders scattered now as they galloped for their lives we were clear through and every stride was taking us farther from jhansi and roses army and safety how long we kept up that breakneck pace i dont know or what direction we took id been through too much my mind was just a welter of fear and bewilderment and rage and stark disbelief i didnt know what to think she couldnt have sold me so cruelly surely not after what shed said and the way shed held my face and looked at me but i knew she had my disbelief was just sheer hurt vanity god did i think i was the only sincere liar in the world and here i was humbugged to hell and beyond being kidnapped in the train of this deceitful rebel bitch or was i wrong was there some explanation after all thats what i still wanted to believe of course theres nothing like infatuation for stoking false hope however theres no point in recounting all the idiot arguments i had with myself on that wild ride through the night with the miles flying by unseen until the gloom began to lighten the scrubdotted plain came into misty view and sher khan still clung like a bearded ghost at my elbow his teeth bared as he crouched over his ponys mane the riders ahead were still driving their tired beasts on at full stretch about a hundred yards in front i could see lakshmibais slim figure on her white mare with the pathans flanking her it was like a drunken nightmare on and on exhausting over that endless plain there was a yell from the flank and one of the pathans up in his stirrups pointing a shot cracked i saw a sudden flash of scarlet to our left and there was a little cloud of horsemen bursting out of a nullah only half our numbers but company cavalry by god they were careering in to take our leaders in the flank pukka light cavalry style and i tried to yell but sher khan had my bridle again wrenching me away to the right while the pathan guardsmen drew their sabres and wheeled to face the attackers head on i watched them meet with a chorus of yells and a clash of steel the dust swirled up round them as sher khan and his mate herded me away but halfslewed round in my saddle i saw the sabres swinging and the beasts serving and plunging as the company men tried to ride through a pathan broke from the press shepherding away a second rider and i saw it was one of the ranis ladies and then more figures were wheeling out of the dust and one of them was lakshmibai with a mounted man bearing down on her his sabre swung aloft i heard sher kahns anguished yell a her white mare seemed to stumble but she reined it up somehow whirling in her tracks there was the glitter of steel in her hand and as the company man wept down on her she lunged over her beasts head the sabres clashed and rang and he was past her wheeling away clutching at his arm as he halfslipped from his saddle that was all i saw before sher khan and the other herded me down a little nullah where we halted and waited while the noise of the skirmish gradually died away i knew what was happening as well as if i was seeing it the company riders outsabred would be drawing off and sure enough presently the pathans came down the nullah in good order clustered round damodar and the ranis women among the last to come was lakshmibai it was the first clear look at her that id had in all that fearful escape she was wearing a mail jacket under her long cloak with a mail cap over her turban and her sabre was still in her hand blood on its blade she stopped a moment by the rider who carried damodar and spoke to the child then she laughed and said something to one of the pathans and handed him her sabre while she wiped her face with a handkerchief then she looked towards me and the others looked with her in silence as you know im a fairly useful hand on social occasions ready with the polite phrase or gesture but ill confess that in that moment i couldnt think of anything appropriate to say when youve just been betrayed by an indian queen who has previously professed undying love for you and she confronts you having just sabred one of your countrymen possibly to death and you are in the grip of her minions with your feet chained under your horse well the etiquette probably takes some thinking about i suppose id have come out with something in a minute or two an oath or a squeal for mercy or a polite inquiry perhaps but before i had the chance she was addressing sher khan you will take him to gwalior her voice was quiet and perfectly composed hold him there until i send for you at the last he will be my bargain you may say it served me right and i cant disagree if i werent such a susceptible trusting chap where pretty women are concerned i daresay id have smelled a rat on the night when lakshmibai rescued me from ignatieffs rack and then flung herself all over me in her perfumed lair a less warmblooded fellow might have thought the lady was protesting rather too much and been on his guard when she slobbered fondly over him vowing undying love and accepting his proposal for her escape he might or again he mightnt for myself i can only say i had no earthly reason to suppose her false after all our last previous meeting had been that monumental roll in her pavilion which had left me with the impression that she wasnt entirely indifferent to me secondly her acceptance of roses proposal seemed natural and sensible thirdly ill admit to being enthralled by her and fourthly having just finished a spell on the rack i was perhaps thinking less clearly than usual finally mlud if youd been confronted by lakshmibai with that beautiful dusky face looking pleadingly up at you and those tits quivering under your nose i submit that you might have been taken in yourself and glad of it in any event it didnt make a haporth of difference even if id suspected her then i was in her power and she could have wrung all the details of roses scheme out of me and made her escape anyway id have been dragged along at her tail and finished up in the gwalior dungeons just the same and mind you im still not certain how far she was humbugging me all i know is that if she was playacting she seemed to be enjoying her work more than i enjoyed gwalior at any rate thats a fearful place a huge rocky fortress of a city bigger than jhansi and said to be the most powerful hold in india i can speak with authority only about its dungeons which were a shade worse than a mexican jail if you can imagine that i spent the better part of two months in them cooped in a bottleshaped cell with my own filth and only rats fleas and cockroaches for company except when sher khan came to have a look at me about once a week to make sure i hadnt up and died on him he and his fellowpathan took me there on lakshmibais orders and it was one of the most punishing rides ive ever endured i was almost unconscious in the saddle by the time we reached it for the brutes never took my chain off once in the hundred miles we covered i think too that my spirit had endured more than i could stand for after all id gone through there were moments now when i no longer cared whether i lived or died and i have to be pretty far down before that happens when they brought me to gwalior by night and halfcarried me into the fortress and dropped me into that stinking illlit cell i just lay and sobbed like an infant babbling aloud about meerut and cawnpore and lucknow and thugs and crocodiles and evil bitches and now this would you believe it the worst was yet to come i dont care to dwell on it so ill hurry along while i was in that dungeon at gwalior waiting for i didnt know what and halfbelieving that id rot there forever or go mad first the final innings of the mutiny was being played out campbell was settling things north of the jumnah and rose having captured jhansi was pushing north after tantia tope and my ministering angel lakshmibai whod taken the field with him he beat them at calpee and kanch driving them towards gwalior where i was enjoying the local hospitality the odd thing was that at the time i was incarcerated there gwaliors ruler maharaja scindia had remained neutral in the rebellion and had no business to be allowing his prison to be used for the accommodation of captured british officers in fact of course he were sympathetic to the rebels all along as was proved in the end for after their defeat at calpee tantia and lakshmibai turned to gwalior and the maharajas army went over to them almost without firing a shot so there they were the last great rebel force in india in possession of indias greatest stronghold and with rose closing inexorably in on them i knew nothing of all this of course mouldering in my cell with my beard sprouting and my hair matting and my pandy uniform foul and stinking i might as well have been at the north pole day followed day and week followed week without a cheep from the outside world for sher khan hardly said a word to me although i raved and pleaded with him whenever he poked his face through the trap into my cell thats the worst of that kind of imprisonment not knowing and losing count of the days and wondering whether youve been there a month to a year and whether there is really a world outside at all and doubting if you ever did more than dream that you were once a boy playing in the fields at rugby or a man whod walked in the park or ridden by albert gate saluting the ladies or played billiards or followed hounds or gone up the mississippi in a sidewheeler or watched the moon rise over kuching river or you can wonder ii any of it ever existed or if these greasy black walls are perhaps the only world that ever was or will be thats when you start to go mad unless you can find something to think about that you know is real ive heard of chaps who kept themselves sane in solitary confinement by singing all the hymns they knew or proving the propositions of euclid or reciting poetry each to his taste im no hand at religion or geometry and the only repeatable poem i can remember is an ode of horace which arnold made me learn as a punishment for farting at prayers so instead i compiled a mental list of all the women id had in my life from that sweaty kitchenmaid in leicestershire when i was fifteen up to the halfcaste piece id been reprimanded for at cawnpore and to my astonishment there were four hundred and seventyeight of them which seemed rather a lot especially since i wasnt counting return engagements its astonishing really when you think how much time it must have taken up perhaps because id been listing them i had a frightful dream one night in which i had to dance with all of them at a ball on the slavedeck of the balliol college with the demoniac captain spring conducting the music in a cocked hat and white gloves they were all there lola montez and josette and judy and the silk one and susie from new orleans and fat baroness pechmann and nareeman the nautch and all the others and each one left her slavefetters with me so that i must dance on loaded and clanking crying out with exhaustion but when i pleaded for rest spring just rolled his eyes and made the music go faster with the big drum booming elspeth and palmerston waltzed by and pam gave me his false teeth and cried youll need em for eating chapattis with your next partner you know and it was lakshmibai naked and glittereyed over her veil and she seized me and whirled me round the floor almost dead with fatigue and the cruel weight of the chains while the drum went boomboomboom faster and faster and i was awake gasping and clutching at my filthy straw with the sound of distant gunfire in my ears it went on all that day and the next but of course i couldnt tell what it meant or who was firing and i was too done to care all through the morning of the third day it continued and then suddenly my trap was thrown open and i was being dragged out by sher khan and another fellow and i hardly knew where i was when youre hauled out of a dead captivity like that everything seems frighteningly loud and fast i know there was a courtyard full of nigger soldiers running about and shouting and their pipes blaring and the gunfire crashing louder than ever but the shock of release was too much for me to make sense of it i was halfblinded just by the light of the sky although it was heavy with red and black monsoon clouds and i remember thinking itll be capital growing weather soon it wasnt till they thrust me on a pony that i came to myself instinct i suppose but when i felt the saddle under me and the beast stirring and the smell of horse in my nostrils and my feet in stirrups i was awake again i knew this was gwalior fortress with the massive gate towering in front of me and a great gun being dragged through it by a squealing elephant with a troop of redcoated niggerprinces cavalry waiting to ride out and a bedlam of men shouting orders the din was still deafening but as sher khan mounted his pony beside me i yelled whats happening where are we going she wants you cries he and grinned as he tapped his hilt so she shall have you come he thrust a way for us through the crowd milling in the gateway and i followed still trying to drink in the sights and sounds of this madhouse that i had all but forgotten men and carts and bullocks and dust and the clatter of arms a bhisti running with his waterskin a file of pandy infantry squatting by the roadside with their muskets between their knees a child scrambling under a bullocks belly a greatchested fellow in a spiked cap with a green banner on a pole over his shoulder a spindlylegged old nigger shuffling along regardless of them all the smell of cooking ghee and through it all that muffled crash of cannon in the distance i stared ahead as we emerged from the gate trying to understand what was happening gunfire that meant that british troops were somewhere near and the sight that met my eyes confirmed it before me there was miles of open plain stretching to distant hills and the plain was alive with men and animals and all the tackle of war perhaps a mile ahead in the haze there were tents and the unmistakable ranks of infantry and gun emplacements and squadrons of horse on the move a whole army stretched across a front of perhaps two miles i steadied myself as sher khan urged me forward trying to take it in it was a rebel army no error for there were pandy formations moving back towards us and native state infantry and riders in uniforms i didnt know men in crimson robes with little shields and curved tulwars and gunteams with artillery pieces fantastically carved in the native fashion that was the first fact the second was that they were retreating and on the edge of rout for the formations were moving towards us and the road itself was choked with men and beasts and vehicles heading for gwalior a horseartillery team was careering in the gunners clinging to the limbers and their officer lashing at the beasts a platoon of pandies was coming at the doublequick their ranks ragged their faces streaked with dust and sweat and all along the road men were running or hobbling back singly and in little groups id seen the signs often enough the gaping mouths the wide eyes the bloody bandages the highpitched voices the halfordered haste slipping into utter confusion the abandoned muskets at the roadside the exhausted men sitting or lying or crying out to those who passed by this was the first rush of a defeat by gum and sher khan was dragging me into it what the blazes is happening i asked him again but all i got was a snarl as he whipped my pony to a gallop and we clattered down the roadside he keeping just to rear of me past the mob of men and beasts streaming back to gwalior the formations were closer now and not all of them were retreating we passed artillery teams who were unlimbering and siting their guns and regiments of infantry waiting in the humid heat their faces turned towards the distant hills their mks stretched out in good order across the plain not far in front artillery was thundering away with smoke wreathing up in the still air and bodies of cavalry pandy and irregular were waiting i remember a squadron of lancers in green coats with lobstertail helmets and long ribbons trailing from their lanceheads and a band native musicians squealing and droning fit to drown gunfire but less than half a mile ahead where the atclouds were churning up and the flashes of cannon shone dully through the haze i knew what was happening c armys vanguard was slowly breaking falling back on main body with the weaker vessels absolutely flying down the road we crossed a deep nullah and sher khan wheeled me all along its far lip towards a grove of palm and thorn where tents were pitched a line of guns to my left was selling away towards the unseen enemy on the hills my by god that was my army and round the nis of tents and trees there was a screen of horsemen with a shock i recognised the long red coats of the jhansi royal guard but for the rest they were only the ragged ghosts of the burly pathans i remembered their uniforms torn and filthy their mounts lean and ungroomed we passed through them in among the tents to where a carpet was spread before the biggest pavilion of all there re guardsmen there and a motley mob of niggersmilitary and civilian and then sher khan was pulling me from the saddle thrusting me forward and crying out he is here highness as you ordered she was in the doorway of the tent alone or perhaps i just dont remember any others she was sipping a glass of sherbet as she turned to look at me and believe it or not i was suddenly conscious of the dreadful scarecrow figure i cut in my rags and unkempt hair she was in her white jodhpurs with a mail jacket over her blouse and a white cloak her head was covered by a cap of polished steel like a roman soldiers with a white scarf wound round it and under her chin she looked damned elegant i know and even when you noticed the shadows on that perfect coffeecoloured face beneath the great eyes she was still a vision to take your breath away she frowned at sight of me and snapped at sher khan what have you done to him he mumbled something but she shook her head impatiently and said it didnt matter then she looked at me again thoughtfully while i waited wondering what the devil was coming dimly aware that the volume of gunfire was increasing finally she said simply your friends are over yonder and indicated the hills you may go to them if you wish that was all and for the life of me i couldnt think of anything to say i suppose i was still bemused and in a shocked condition otherwise i might have pointed out that there was a battle apparently raging between me and those friends of mine but it all seemed unreal and the word which i finally managed to croak out was why she frowned again at that and then put her chin up and snapped her cloak with one hand and said quickly because it is finished and it is the last thing i can do for you colonel i couldnt think when shed last called me that is that not enough your army will be in gwalior by tomorrow that is all it was at this moment that i heard shouting behind us but i paid it no heed not evenwhen some fellow came running and calling to her and she called something to him i was wrestling with my memory and it will give you some notion of how foundered i was when i tell you that i absolutely burst out but you said i would be your bargain didnt you she looked puzzled and then she smiled and said to sher khan give the colonel sahib a horse and was turning away when i found my tongue but but you lakshmibai i dont understand what are you going to do she didnt answer and i heard my own voice hoarse and harsh theres still time i mean if you if you think its finished well dammit they aint going to hang you you know i mean lord canning has promised andand general rose sher khan was growling at my elbow but i shook him off look here if im with you its sure to be all right ill tell em god knows what else i said i think i was out of my wits just then well when the shots flying i dont as a rule think of much but my own hide and here i was absolutely arguing with the woman maybe the dungeon had turned my brain a trifle for i babbled on about surrender and honourable terms while she just stood looking at me and then she broke in no you do not understand you did not understand when you came back to me at jhansi but it was for me you came for my sake and so i pay my debt at the end debt i shouted youre havering woman you said you loved me oh i know now you were tricking me too but but dont it count for anything then before she could answer there was a flurry of hooves and some damned interfering scoundrel in an embroidered coat flung himself off his horse and started shouting at her behind me there was a crackle of musketry and shrieks and orders and a faint trumpet note whispering beyond the cannon she cried an order and a groom hurried forward pulling her little mare i was roaring above the noise at her swearing i loved her and that she could still save herself and she shot me a quick look as she took the mares bridle it was just for an instant but its stayed with me fifty years and you may think me an old fool and fanciful but ill swear there were tears in her eyes and then she was in the saddle shouting and the little mare reared and shot away and i was left standing on the carpet sher khan had disappeared i was staring and yelling after her as her riders closed round her for beyond them the gunners were racing towards us with pandy riflemen in amongst them turning and firing and running again there were horsemen at the guns and sabres flashing and above the hellish din the trumpet was blaring clear in the charge and over the limbers came blue tunics and white helmets and i couldnt believe my eyes for they were riders of the light brigade irish hussars with an officer up in his stirrups yelling and the troopers swarming behind him they came over the battery like a wave and the scarletclad pathan horsemen were breaking before them and ill tell you what i saw next as plain as i can lakshmibai was in among the pathans and she had a sabre in her hand she seemed to be shouting to them and then she took a cut at a hussar and missed him as he swept by and for a moment i lost her in the melee there were sabres and pistols going like bedamned and suddenly the white mare was there rearing up and she was in the saddle but i saw her flinch and lose the reins for a moment i thought she was gone but she kept her seat as the mare turned and raced out of the fight and my heart stopped as i saw that she was clutching her hands to her stomach and her head was down a trooper drove his horse straight into the mare and as it staggered he sabred at lakshmibai backhanded i shrieked aloud and shut my eyes and when i looked again she was in the dust and even at that distance i could see the crimson stain on her jodhpurs i ran towards her and there must have been riders charging past me as i ran but i dont remember them and then i stumbled and fell as i scrambled up i saw she was writhing in the dust her scarf and helmet were gone she was kicking and clawing at her body and her face was twisted and working in agony with her hair half across it it was hideous and i could only crouch there gazing horrified oh if it were a novel i could tell you that i ran to her and cradled her head against me and kissed her while she looked up at me with a serene smile and murmured something before she closed her eyes as lovely in death as shed been in life but that aint how people die not even the rani of jhansi she arched up once still tearing at herself and then she flopped over face down and i knew she was a goner it was only then i believe that i began to think straight again there was one hell of a skirmish in progress barely twenty yards away and i was unarmed and helpless on all fours in the dirt above all other considerations im glad to say one seemed paramount to get to hell out of this before i got hurt i was on my feet and running before the thought had consciously formed running in no particular direction but keeping a weather eye open for a quiet spot or a riderless horse i dived into the nullah barged into someone stumbled up and raced along it past a group of pandies in pillbox hats who were scrambling into position at the nullahs edge to open fire leaped over a wrecked cart and then wondrous sight there was a horse with a wounded nigger on his knees holding the bridle one kick and he was sprawling i was aboard and away i put my head down and fairly flew a fountain of dirt rose up just ahead of me as a cannonshot from somewhere ploughed into the nullah hank and the last thing i remember is the horse rearing up and something smashing into my left arm with a blinding pain a great weight seemed to be pressing down on my head and a red smoke was drifting above me and then i lost consciousness i told you the worst was still to come didnt i well youve read my chronicle of the great mutiny and if youve any humanity youre bound to admit that id had my share of sorrow already and more even campbell later said that id seen hard service so there but rose himself declared that if he hadnt been told the circumstance of my awakening at gwalior by an eyewitness he wouldnt have believed it it was the most terrible thing he said that he had ever heard of in all his experience of war or anybody elses either he wondered that i hadnt lost my reason i agreed then and i still do this is what happened i came back to life as is often the case with my last waking moment clear in my mind i had been on horseback riding hard seeing a shot strike home in a sandy nullah so why i wondered irritably was i now standing up leaning against something hard with what seemed to be a polished table top in front of me there was a shocking pain in my head and a blinding glare of light burning my eyes so i shut them quickly i tried to move but couldnt because something was holding me my ears were ringing and there was a jumble of voices close by but i couldnt make them out why the hell didnt they shut up i wondered and i tried to tell them to be quiet but my voice wouldnt work i wanted to move to get away from the thing that was pressing against my chest so i tugged and an unspeakable pain shot through my left arm and into my chest a stabbing searing pain so exquisite that i screamed aloud and again and again at which a voice cried in english apparently right in my ear eres another as cant old is bleedin row stick a gag in this bastard an all andy someone grabbed my hair and pulled my head back and i shrieked again opening my eyes wide with the pain to see a blinding light sky and a red sweating face within a few inches of mine before i could make another sound a foul wet rag was stuffed brutally into my mouth choking me and a cloth was whipped across it and knotted tight behind my head i couldnt utter a sound and when i tried to reach up to haul the filthy thing away i realised why i hadnt been able to move my hands were lashed to the object that was pressing into my body stupefied blinking against the glare in agony with my arm and head and the gag that was suffocating me i tried to focus my eyes for a few seconds there was just a whirl of colours and shapes and then i saw i was tied across the muzzle of a cannon the iron rim biting into my body with my arms securely lashed either side of the polished brown barrel i was staring along the top of that barrel between the high wheels to where two british soldiers were standing by the breech poking at the touchhole and one was saying to the other no by cripes none o yer woolwich models no lanyards jim my boy well ave to stick a fuse in an stand well clear shes liable to blow er flamin wheels off though aint she says the other theres a fourpahnd cartridge in there wiv a stone shot spose itll splinter eh ask im arterwards says the first gesturing at me and they both laughed uproariously youll tell us wont yer sambo for a moment i couldnt make it out what the devil were they talking about and how dared the insolent dogs address a colonel as sambo and one of em with a pipe stuck between his grinning teeth fury surged up in me as i stared into those red yokel faces leering at me and i shouted damn your eyes you mutinous bastards how dare you dye know who i am you swine ill flog the ribs out of you but it didnt come out as a shout only as a soundless gasp deep in my throat behind that stifling gag then ever so slowly it dawned on me where i was and what was happening and my brain seemed to explode with the unutterable horror of it as rose said afterwards i ought to have gone mad for an instant i believe i did i dont have to elaborate my sensations anyway i couldnt i can only say that i was sane enough after that first spasm of dreadful realisation because behind the fog of panic i saw in a second what had happened saw it with blinding certainty i had been knocked on the head presumably by a splinter of flying debris and picked up senseless by our gallant troops of course theyd taken me for a pandy with my matted hair and beard and filthy and ragged sepoy uniform theyd seen i wasnt dead and decided to execute me in style along with other prisoners for as i flung my head round in an ecstasy of such fear as even i had never known before i saw that mine was only one in a line of guns six or seven of them and across the muzzle of each was strapped a human figure some were ragged pandies like me others were just niggers one or two were gagged as i was the rest were not some had been tied face to the gun but most had the muzzles in their backs and shortly these brutes who loafed about the guns at their ease spitting and smoking and chaffing to each other would touch off the charges and a mass of splintering stone would tear through my vitals and there was nothing i could do to stop them if i hadnt screamed when i regained consciousness i wouldnt have been gagged and three words would have been enough to show them their ghastly error but now i couldnt utter a sound but only watch with bulging eyes as one of the troopers in leisurely fashion pushed a length of fuse into the touchhole winked at me and then sauntered back to rejoin his mates who were standing or squatting in the sunlight obviously waiting for the word to start the carnage come on come on where the ells the captain says one still at mess ill lay christ its ot i want ter get on my charpoy i do an bang me bleedin earole e couldnt blow the bloody pandies away arter supper could e oh no not im wot we blowin em up for says one pale young trooper couldnt they ang the pore sods or shoot em it ud be cheaper pore sods my

blowin aways too good for em not as cruel as angin neither says a third they dont feel nothin he strolled past my gun and to my horror he patted me on the head so cheer up sambo youll soon be dead ere wots the matter wiv im bert dye reckon i was writhing frenziedly in my bonds almost fainting with the agony of my wounded arm which was gashed and bleeding flinging my head from side to side as i tried to spit out that horrible gag almost bursting internally in my effort to make some sound any sound that would make him understand the ghastly mistake theyd made he stood grinning stupidly and bert sauntered up knocking his pipe out on the gun matter wot the ell dyer thinks the matter you duffer e dont want is guts blew all the way to calcutta thats wots the matter gawd ell kill isself wiv appleplexy by the look of im funny though aint it says the first an look at the rest of em jes waitin there an not even a squeak from em as if they didnt care pathetic aint it thats their religion pronounced bert they fink theyre goin to eaven they fink theyre goin to get arfadozen rum bints apiece an bull em till judgement i ay fact go on they dont look all that bleedin pleased then do they they turned away and i flopped over the gun near to suffocation and with my heart ready to burst for misery and fear only one word that was all i needed christ if i could only get a hand free a finger even blood from my wounded arm had run on to the gun drying almost at once on the burning metal if i could even scrawl a message on it or just a letter they might see it and understand i must be able to do something think think think i screamed inside my head fighting back the madness straining with all my power to tear my right wrist free almost dislocating my neck in a futile effort to work the gagbinding loose my mouth was full of its filthy taste it seemed to be slipping farther into my gullet choking me god if they thought i was choking would they pull it out even for a second that was all i needed oh god please please let them i couldnt die like this like a stinking nigger pandy after all id suffered not by such cruel ghastly illluck aht pipes straighten up orficer comin cries one of the troopers and they scrambled up hastily adjusting their kepis doing up their shirtbuttons as two officers came strolling across from the tents a couple of hundred yards away i gazed towards them like a man demented as though by staring i could attract their attention my right wrist was raw and bleeding with my dragging at it but the rope was like a band of steel round it and i couldnt do more than scrabble with my fingers at the hot metal i was crying uncontrollably my head was swimming but no no i mustnt faint anything but that think think dont faint dont go mad theyve never got you yet youve always slid out somehow all ready sergeant the leading officer was glancing along the line of guns and my eyes nearly started from my head as i saw it was clem hennidge dandy clem of the th hussars whom id ridden with at balaclava he was within five yards of me nodding to the sergeant glancing briefly round while beside him a fair young lieutenant was staring with popeyes at us trussed victims going pale and looking ready to puke by heaven he wasnt the only one shuddered and i heard him mutter to hennidge christ i shant be writing to mother about this though beastly business says hennidge slapping his crop on his palm orders though what very good sergeant well touch em off all together if you please all properly hotted and primed very good then yessir beg pardon sir usual orders is to touch em t one arter the other sir leastways thats ow we done it at calpee sir good god says hennidge and contained himself ill be obliged if youll fire all together sergeant on this occasion he muttered something to the lieutenant shaking his head as in despair two men ran forward to my gun one of them pulling matches from his pocket he glanced nervously back and called sarnt sir this un aint got no lock nor lanyard please see sir its one o them nigger guns cant fire it cept with a fuse sir whats that cries hennidge coming forward oh i see very well then light the fuse at the signal then and good god is this fellow having a fit i had made one last desperate effort to pull free hauling like a mad thing flinging myself as far as my lashing would allow tossing my head jerking to and fro my head swimming with the pain of my arm hennidge and the boy were staring at me the boys face was green es been carryin on like that since we triced im up sir says one of the gunners screamin e was we ad to gag him sir hennidge swallowed and then nodded curtly and turned away but the lieutenant seemed to be rooted with horrified fascination as though he couldnt tear his eyes away from me ready bawls the sergeant and light the fuse now bert says the man at my gun through a red haze i saw the match splutter and go out bert cursed struck a second and touched it to the fuse a moment and it fizzed and the gunners retreated best stand back sir cries bert gawd knows whatll happen when she goes off might blow wide open the lieutenant shuddered and seemed to collect himself and then the strangest thing happened for i absolutely heard a voice and it seemed to be very close in my ear and the oddest thing was it was rudi starnberg my old enemy from jotunberg and as clear as a bell across the years i heard him laughing the comedys not finished yet come on playactor no doubt it was the product of a disordered mind as i stared at death in the spluttering fuse but just for a second i realised that if there was the ghost of a chance left it depended on keeping icecold as rudi would have done of course the lieutenants eyes were just on mine for an instant before he turned away and in that instant i raised my brows and lowered them twice quickly it stopped him and very carefully as he stared i closed one eye in an enormous wink it must have been a grotesque sight his mouth dropped open and then i opened my eye turned my head deliberately and stared fixedly at my right hand he must look he must my wrist was as fast as ever but i could just turn my hand palm upwards fold the thumb and last three fingers slowly into my palm and beckon with my forefinger once twice thrice and still beckoning i stared at him again for a moment he just gaped and closed his eyes and gaped again and i thought oh christ the young idiots going to stand there until the bloody fuse has burned down he stared at me licking his lips obviously flabbergasted turned to glance at hennidge looked back at me and then as i tried to bore into his brain and crooked my finger again and again he suddenly yelled wait sergeant dont fire and striding forward he yanked the burning fuse from the touchhole clever boys they had in the light brigade in those days what the devil john what on earth are you doing cries hennidge sergeant hold on there he came striding up demanding to know what was up and the lieutenant pale and sweating stood by the breech pointing at me i dont know that chap he beckoned i tell you and he winked look my god hes doing it again hes hes trying to say something hey what hennidge was peering across at me and i wobbled my eyebrows as ludicrously as i could and tried to munch my lips at the same time what the deuce i believe youre right you there get that gag out of his mouth sharp now arise sir harry was one of the sweetest sounds i ever heard so was abe lincolns voice in that house at portsmouth ohio asking what do you want with me when the slavecatchers were on my tail i can think of many others but so help me god none of them rang such peals of hope and joy in my ears as those words of hennidges beside the guns at gwalior even as the cloth was wrenched loose though and the gag was torn out of my mouth and i was gasping in air i was thinking frantically what i must say to prevent the appalling chance of their disbelieving me something to convince them instantly beyond any doubt and what i croaked out when my breath came was im flashman flashman dye hear youre clem hennidge the curfew tolls the knell of parting day god save the queen im english english im in disguise ask general rose im flashman harry flashman cut me loose you bastards im flashman you never saw such consternation in your life for a moment they just made popeyed noises and then hennidge cries out flashman harry flashman but but its impossible you cant be somehow i didnt start to rave or swear or blubber instead i just leered up at him and croaked you give me the lie hennidge and ill call you out dyou know i called a man out in remember he was a cavalry captain too so would you mind just cutting these damned ropes and mind my arm cos i think its broken my god you are flashman cries he as if he was looking at a ghost then he just stuttered and gaped and signed to the gunners to cut me loose which they did lowering me gently to the ground horror and dismay all over their faces i was glad to see but ill never forget what hennidge said next as the lieutenant called for a waterbottle and pressed it to my lips hennidge stood staring down at me appalled and then he said ever so apologetically i say flashman im most frightfully sorry mark you what else was there to say oh aye there was something i hadnt reasoned it as you can imagine but it leaped into my mind as i sat there almost swooning with relief not minding the pains in my head and arms and happened to glance along the guns i was suddenly shuddering horribly and bowing my head in my sound hand trying to hold back the sobs and then i says as best i could those niggers tied to the guns i want them cut loose all of em directly whats that says he but theyve been condem cut em loose damn you my voice was shaking and faint every mothers sonofabitch dyou hear i glared up at him as i sat there in the dust in my rags with my back to the gunwheel i must have been a rare sight cut em loose and tell em to run away away as far as they know how away from us and never to get caught again blast you dont stand there gawping do as i say youre not well says he youre distraught and im also a bloody colonel i hollered and youre a bloody captain im in my right mind too and ill break you by god if you dont attend to me this minute soset them loose be a good chap clem very well so he gave the orders and they turned them free and the young lieutenant knelt beside me with the waterbottle very respectful and moisteyed that was merciful says he merciful be damned says i the way things are hereabouts one of ems probably lord canning there isnt much more to tell the great mutiny ended there under the walls of gwalior where rose broke the last rebel army and tantia tope fled away they caught him and hanged him in the end but they never found nana sahib and for the rest a few bands of pandies roamed about like bandits for a month or two but were gradually dispersed i was back in the pavilion then with my pads off recovering from a broken arm and a battered head to say nothing of a badly disarranged nervous system i was exhausted in body and mind but its surprising how you pick up when you realise that its all over and theres nothing to do but lie back and put on weight and you can sleep sound at nights in the weeks of my convalescence at gwalior i wrote my reports for rose and campbell and composed another at great length for palmerston in which i detailed all my doings at jhansi and elsewhere so far as they concerned the mission hed given me i told him what had happened with the rani and how i had been there at the end i also warned him that ignatieff had not been heard of again and might still be abroad doing mischief though i doubted it it was autumn before i was up and about again at gwalior and had received word from campbell that i was released from my duties and might go home i was ready for it too but before i left i found myself riding out on the road to kotakiserai to have a look at the spot where her people had made a little shrine to lakshmibai near the nullah they thought no end of her you know and still do well i could understand that i hadnt been indifferent myself although it all seemed far past now somehow they had cremated her in the hindoo fashion but there was this little painted model temple which i took to be her memorial and withered flowers and wreaths and little pots round it and i mooched about scuffing the dust with my boots while a few old niggers squatted under the thorns watching me curiously and the bullockcarts went by there wasnt much sign of the skirmish where shed died a few trifles of broken gear a rusty stirrup that sort of thing i wondered why shed done it all and in spite of what she said to me at the last i believe i did understand as id said in my report to pam she didnt give up her jhansi that was what had mattered to her more than life as to what she may have thought or felt about me truly and for that matter what id really felt about her i couldnt make up my mind it didnt matter now anyway but i could always make the best of it and remember those eyes above the veil and the soft lips brushing my cheek aye well damned goodlooking girl i went up the agra trunk on my way home and down to cawnpore where there were letters waiting for me including one from billy russell congratulating me on my escape and recovery which he said had been the talk of simla where he had been taking things easy with a game leg he was down at allahabad now following the seat of government on its peregrinations as he put it and i must stop off and celebrate with him i didnt mind that a bit i was ready to start enjoying life again after all the nonsense id been through and to put me in the best fettle there were several letters from elspeth in her usual rattlepated style full of loving slush about her dear darling champion whom she was yearning to clasp again to her loving bosom when he returned with his laurels fresh upon his brow she absolutely did write like this came from reading novels i suspect the town is full of talk of you and your gallant comrades especially sir hugh rose and dear sir colin or lord clyde as we must now call him i own i felt a flush of pride when i thought that my distinguished countryman had chosen for his title the name of the beauteous stream beside which i humble little me was born and where i spent such blissful hours with my own true love yourself dear dear harry do you remember i did and the thought of that first splendid gallop wed had together in the bushes brought sentimental tears to my eyes and set me bursting to be at her again back in green england away from this bloody beastly country and its stench of death and war and dust elspeth with her golden hair and blue eyes and adoring idiot smile and resplendent oh that was certainty and happiness and jollity and bedamned and even lord cardigan is civil altho he thinks sir colin was tardy and can have made but poor use of his light cavalry i think it was in punishing the rascally sepoys and lord cardigan was very full in his attentions to me when we met in the row but i gave him the right about for i was certain you would wish it and he went off not too pleased i thought but perhaps he is disposed to toady for he sent me a new book as a gift for you saying he was sure it must interest you most particularly but i have glanced at it and dont care for it much since it seems to be about rustics and quite without that tender passion which i admire in writing and which fills my thoughts whenever they turn to my dearest of husbands and lovers as they do every minute and my legs go quite weak still i send it to you with his lordships compliments now then there is the finest scandal about daisy marchmonts footman i didnt care to hear about cardigan the mention of the name was enough to set my jealous bile working for it reminded me that my darling elspeth wasnt always the dutiful and loving wife she pretended to be and heaven knew how many randified admirers had been beating our doorknocker in my absence shed have no time or opportunity for dalliance when flashy roared back into residence though i chuckled at the thought threw cardigans present into my valise without looking at it and caught the train to allahabad where billy russell was at the station with a ghari to meet me he was all beams and whiskers as usual full of fun and demanding my news of the jhansi and gwalior affairs which he knew already of course in their essentials but its the spice and colour im after old fellow and devil a bit of those dye get in despatches this business of your stealing into the jezebel of jhansis fortress in disguise now and being carried away prisoner in the night eh i parried his questions grinning as we bowled away towards the fort and then he says ive got your winnings from lucknow safe by the by and your prizemoney its about all youve had out o this campaign aint it bar a few wounds an grey hairs i knew what he meant blast him while orders and ribbons and medals and titles had been flying about like hail among the indian heroes devil a nod had come my way nor would it you see the irony was that while id seen more than my share of hell and horror in the mutiny i knew that in official eyes my service must have been a pretty fair frost id failed entirely in the original mission pam had given me and rose had been damned stuffy that the plan to save lakshmibai had come adrift lord canning hed said would be profoundly disappointed as though it was my fault the ungrateful bastard but these are the things that matter when they come to passing out the spoils and i knew that while the likes of rose and campbell were having honours showered on them and the prowess of outram and sam browne and the snirp roberts were being trumpeted round the world poor old flash would be lucky to get an address of welcome and a knifeandfork supper at ashby town hall theres others have been well rewarded says billy slowcoach is a lord but ye know that there must be about fifty crosses flying about and god knows how many titles they might ha done something for you i wonder says he as we got out at the fort and went along the verandah if a leaderette in the old thunderer might stir em up what we cant have horse guards neglectin our best men i liked the sound of that rather but as he conducted me across the hall where sikh sentries stood and the punkahs hissed i thought it best to say i didnt mind really and then i found he was grinning all over his whiskers as he ushered me through a doorway and i stopped dead in amazement it was a big airy room half office and half drawingroom with a score of people standing at the far end beyond the fine afghan carpet all looking in my direction and it was sight of them that had checked me for there was campbell with his grizzled head and wrinkled scotch face and mansfield smiling very erect toying with his dark whiskers and macdonald grinning openly and hope grant stern and straight in the middle was a slim elegant civilian in a white morning coat with a handsome woman smiling beside him it took me a moment to realise that they were lord and lady canning then russell was pushing me forward and canning was smiling and shaking hands and i was bowing to lady canning wondering what the devil this was all about and then there was silence and canning was clearing his throat and addressing me i wish i could remember all of it but i was quite taken aback to find myself thrust into this company so unexpected what was this distinguished conduct on many numerous occasions familiar to allafghanistan crimea balaclava central asia lately and most exemplary service in the insurrection of the bengal army most gallant conduct in the defence and evacuation of cawnpore and most signally at the direction of sir hugh rose in undertaking service of the most dangerous and difficult nature in the gwalior campaign warmest approval of her majesty and of her ministers and principal advisers recognition of conduct far beyond the call of duty i listened to all this in a daze and then canning was passing something to campbell and he was coming up to me glowering under his brows and harrumphing it is at my perrsonal request growls he that i have been purrmeeted tae bestow a disteenction that should rightly have come from her majestys ain own gracious hands he reached up and i felt a sudden keen pain in my left tit as he stuck a pin in it i gasped and looked down and there it was on its ribbon the shabbylooking little bronze cross against my jacket at first i didnt even recognise it and then lady canning was leading the clapping and campbell was pumping my right hand and staring at me with his brows down the order o the victoria cross says he and then he added flashman but there he stopped and shook his head aye says he and grinned at me and god knows he didnt often grin that one and went on shaking his head and my hand and the clapping and laughter rang in my ears i couldnt speak i was red in the face i knew and almost in tears as they clustered round me mansfield and macdonald and the rest of them and billy slapping me on the back and i was trembling and wanted ever so much to sit down but what i was thinking was by god you dont deserve it you know you shifty old bastard of a flashy not if its courage theyre after but if they hand out medals for luck and survival through sheer funk and suffering ignobly borne well grab em with both hands my boy and then in the august presence of the governorgeneral and the commanderinchief someone started to sing for hes a jolly good fellow and there were happy faces all round me singing until canning led me out on to the verandah and in the garden there seemed to be crowds of soldiers and civilians bearded sikhs and ugly little goorkhas devils own and highlanders artillerymen and sappers chaps in white coats and sunhelmets ladies in gardenparty dresses and as canning waved to them someone shouted hiphiphip and the crashing hurrah sounded three times and a tiger and i looked out at them through a mist of tears and beyond them to the gwalior guns and the cawnpore barricade and the burning lines of meerut and the battery reek of balaclava and the bloody snow of gandamack and i thought by god how little you know or you wouldnt be cheering me youd be howling for my blood you honest sturdy asses and then again maybe you wouldnt for if you knew the truth about me you wouldnt believe it what a gratifying experience to relate to your children colonel says canning and on the other side lady canning smiled at me and says and to lady flashman i mumbled yes indeed so it would be then i noticed that she was looking at me a trifle arch and cudgelled my wits to think why she couldnt be wanting to get off with me not with canning there and then her last words sank in my legs went weak and i believe i absolutely said hey they both laughed politely at my bewilderment canning looking fond reproval at her that must be under the rose my dear you know says he but of course we should have informed you colonel privately he beamed at me in addition to the highest decoration for valour which has been justly bestowed on many gallant officers in the late campaigns her majesty wished to distinguish your service by some additional mark of favour she has therefore been graciously pleased to create you a knight of the bath i suppose i was already numb with shock for i didnt taint or cry whoops or even stand gaping at the man in disbelief in fact i blew my nose and what i was thinking as i mopped away my emotion was by god shes got no taste that woman i mean who but little vicky would have thought to pile a knighthood on top of the vc all at one go it didnt seem scarcely decent but by god wasnt it bloody famous for over everything the words were revolving in my mind in a golden haze sir harry flashman vc it wasnt believable sir harry sir harry and lady flashman flashman vc my stars it had come to this and when least expected oh that astonishing little woman i remembered how shed blushed and looked bashful when shed hung the queens medal on me years before and id thought aye cavalry whiskers catch em every time and still did apparently whod have thought it well god save the queen says i reverently there was no taking it in properly at the time of course or indeed in the hours that followed they remain just a walking dream with sir harry flashman vc blazing in front of my eyes through all the grinning faces and backslapping and cheering and adulation all for the vc of course for tother thing was to remain a secret canning said until i got home there was a great dinner that evening at the fort with booze galore and speeches and cheering and chaps rolling under the table and they poured me on to the calcutta train that night in a shocking condition i didnt wake up till noon the following day with a fearful head it took me another night to get right again but on the next morning i had recovered and ate a hearty breakfast and felt in capital shape sir harry flashman vc i could still hardly credit it theyd be all over me at home and elspeth would go into the wildest ecstasies at being my lady and be insufferable to her friends and tradesmen and adoringly grateful to me she might even stay faithful permanently you never knew i fairly basked in my thoughts grinning happily out at the disgusting indian countryside in the sunrise reflecting that with luck id never see or hear or smell it again after this and then to beguile the time i fished in my valise for something to read and came on the book cardigan had sent to elspeth what could have possessed jim the bear who detested me to send me a present i opened it at random idly turning the pages and then my eye lit on a paragraph and it was as though a bucket of icy water had been dashed over me as i read the words but that blackguard flashman who never speaks to one without a kick or an oath the cowardly brute broke in east how i hate him and he knows it too he knows that you and i think him a coward i stared at the page dumbfounded flashman east what the blind blue blazes was this i turned the book over to look at the title tom browns school days it said by an old boy who the hell was tom brown i whipped quickly through the pages rubbish about some yokels at a village fair as elspeth had said farmer ives benjy what the deuce tom trying his skill at dropkicks rugby and football hollo here we were again though and the hairs rose on my neck as i read gone to ground eh roared flashman push them out then boys look under the beds whooop he roared pulling away at the leg of a small boy young howling brute hold your tongue sir or ill kill you by god it was me i mean it wasnt only my style to a t i even remembered doing it years ago at rugby when we flushed the fags out and tossed them in blankets for a lark yes here it was once twice thrice and away what a cursed bully you are flashy i sped through the passage in which the horrible ogre flashman swearing foully suggested they be tossed two at a time so that theyd struggle and fall out and get hurt its true enough thats the way to get the mealy little bastards pitched out on to the floor but who on earth could have written this who had dared i tore the pages over scanning each one for the dread name and by god wasnt it there though in plenty my eyes goggled as i read flashman with an oath and a kick released his prey the tyranny of flashman flashman was on the lookout and sent an empty pickle jar whizzing after them which narrowly missed toms head he wouldnt mind killing one if he wasnt caught said east was flashman here then yes and a dirty little snivelling sneaking fellow he was too used to toady the bullies by offering to fag for them and peaching against the rest of us i was red and roaring with rage by this time barely able to see the pages by god here was infamy page after foul page traducing me in the most odious terms for there wasnt a doubt i was the villain referred to the whole thing stank of rugby in my time and there was the doctor and east and brooke and crab jones and me absolutely by name for all the world to read about and detest there was even a description of me as big and strong for my age and i played well at all games where pluck wasnt much wanted if you please and had a bluff offhand manner which passed for heartiness and considerable powers of being pleasant well that settled it and my reputation too for not a page went by but i was twisting arms or thrashing weaklings or swearing or funking or getting pissy drunk or roasting small boys over fires oh aye that brought back master brown to memory sharp enough he was the mealy freckled little villain who tried to steal my sweepstake ticket damn him a pious crawling little toadeater who prayed like clockwork and was forever sucking up to arnold and brooke yes sir please sir im a bloody christian sir along with his pal east and now east was dead in the boat by cawnpore someone was alive though alive and libelling me most damnably not that it wasnt true every vile word of it oh it was all too true that was the trouble but the devil with that it was a foul malicious blot on my good name dear christ here was more flashmans brutality had disgusted most even of his intimate friends no by god there was one downright shameful lie the kind of friends i had at rugby you couldnt have disgusted not speedicut and rattle and that lot what next coward as he was flashman couldnt swallow such an insult and then followed a description of a fight in which i was soundly thrashed by a couple of fags and skulked off whining you shall pay for this i believe i foamed at the mouth at this point and yet again at the description of my drunken expulsion from rugby but what was even worse was the scene in which the unctuous little swabs brown and east were described as praying for poor flashman i hurled the book across the carriage and set about thrashing my bearer and only when id driven him howling on to the carriageroof did i settle down and realise the full bitterness of what this vindictive biographer had done hed ruined me half england must have read the beastly thing by now oh it was plain enough why cardigan had sent it to me the spiteful swine how could i ever hold up my head again after this poisonous attack my god just in my moment of supreme glory too what would my cross and my knighthood be worth now with this venom spewed on me by an old boy whoever the brute was probably some greasy little sneak whom id disciplined for his own good or knocked about in boyish fun well by heaven hed pay for it id sue the wicked scribbling sonofabitch through every court in england appendix i the indian mutiny as far as it goes and leaving aside those more personal experiences and observations which there is no confirming or denying flashmans account of his service in the mutiny seems both generally accurate and fair his descriptions of meerut before and during the outbreak of cawnpore and lucknow and jhansi and gwalior are consistent with other eyewitness accounts at worst he differs no more from them than they do from each other as to causes and attitudes he seems to give a sound reflection of what was being said and thought in india at the time it is still difficult to discuss certain aspects of the mutiny without emotion creeping in it was an atrociously bloody business and it is not easy to appreciate entirely the immense intensity of feeling on both sides how to explain the conduct of nana sahib at cawnpore on the me hand or on the other the attitude of the christian and personally kindly john nicholson who wanted legislation passed for the flaying impaling and burning of mutineers flashmans observations are not without interest but it is really superfluous to comment on them there should not he for intelligent people any question of trying to cast up the atrocious accounts or attempting to discover a greater weight of blame on one side or the other fashions in these things change as flashman remarks and one should beware of fashionable judgements sufficient to say that fear shock ignorance and racial and religious intolerance on both sides combined to produce a hatred akin to madness in some individuals and groups british hindoo and muslim but by no means among all at the same time it is worth remembering that the struggle which produced so much cruelty and shame was appendix ii the rani of jhansi lakshmibai maharani of jhansi was one of the outstanding leaders of the mutiny and a heroine of indian history she has been compared not unjustly to joan of arc on the other hand while the evil reputation which propaganda gave her in her lifetime has now been largely discounted there remain some shadows over her memory the general facts about her career as flashman learned diem from palmerston and skene and as he himself describes them are accurate her upbringing marriage political attitudes part in the mutiny escape campaigning and death what is less clear is when and why she became actively involved in the mutiny for even after the jhansi massacre she professed friendship for the sirkar it may even be that despite her bitterness towards the british she would have stayed clear of rebellion if she could what is certain is that once committed she led her troops with great resolution and personal bravery she was in fact a fine swordswoman and rider and a good shot as a result of her upbringing among boys at the peshawas court on a more everyday level flashmans impressions of lakshmibai and her court are borne out by contemporary accounts he seems to have given a fair picture of her conduct of affairs and public behaviour as well as of such details as her daily routine her apartments private zoo recreations and teaparties and even clothing and jewellery other britons who met her shared at least some of his enthusiasm for her looks the most apparently authentic surviving portrait shows her much as flashman first describes her her personality seems to have been pleasant enough if forceful but her true character remains a mystery whether she is regarded as a purehearted patriot or as a devious and cruel opportunist is a matter of choice she may have been something of each her epitaph was given by her most persistent enemy sir hugh rose speaking of the rebel leaders he called lakshmibai the best and bravest notes i lord cardigan who led the charge of the light brigade was a popular hero after balaclava but a reaction set in against him in with rumours that he had shirked his duty and even that he had not reached the russian guns at all the lawsuit did not take place until when cardigan sued colonel calthorpe for libel on the subject it was established that he had been at the guns and also that he had left his brigade during the action which although it did not reflect on his personal courage left a large questionmark over his fitness for command i punch also noted that at this dinner champagne was served at the rate of only one bottle per three guests for once flashman is exact with a date it was on the st that florence nightingale had a twohour meeting with the queen at balmoral in fact his recollections of balmoral are so exact even down to topics of conversation and the state of the weather on particular days that one suspects he is indebted to the detailed diary which his wife elspeth kept during their married life and which forms part of the flashman papers life of the prince consort vols by sir t martin twenty years at court by eleanor stanley and a diary of royal movements in the life of queen victoria no record can be found of a visit by lord palmerston to balmoral in late september obviously it must have been kept secret along with the disturbing news that chapattis had appeared in an indian regiment most histories of the mutiny do not mention chapattis as appearing until early in for the rest flashman gives a fair picture of pam as his contemporaries saw him a popular warmhearted impulsive and deplorable figure whom disraeli described as a painted old pantaloon lord ellenborough was a former governorgeneral of india and sir charles wood although at the admiralty when flashman met him had been president of the board of control for india from and was to return to the india office from the missionaries were greatly displeased at a government decision in that education in indian schools should be secular the fear of christianisation was certainly present among indians at this time and is considered to have been a main cause of the mutiny preaching army officers were regarded as especially dangerous governorgeneral canning who was was unjustly suspected of being an ardent proselytiser actually said of one religiouslyminded colonel that he was unfit to be trusted with his native regiment and lord ellenborough delivered a strong warning in the house of lords on june against colonels connected with missionary operations you will see the most bloody revolution which has at any time occurred in india the english will be expelled this contrasts with the statement of mr mangles chairman of the east india company providence has entrusted the empire of hindoostan to england in order that the banner of christ should wave triumphant from one end of india to the other john nicholson was one of the legendary figures of british india and an outstanding example of the type of soldieradministrator who became known as the desert english possibly because many of them were scots or irish their gift and it was rare was of winning absolute trust and devotion from the people among whom they worked in the east nicholson had it to an unusual degree and when he was only twentyseven the religious sect of nikkulseynites was formed worshipping him with a fervour which caused him much annoyance as a soldier and administrator he was brilliant as a victorian casestudy fascinating since he served in the first afghan war he would certainly have known flashman but it is interesting that they met as described here since in late nicholson should have been far away on the frontier however as he was about to enter on new duties at peshawar about this time it is conceivable that he came south first and that they met on the agra trunk road the guides was perhaps the most famous fighting unit in the history of british india raised by henry lawrence in and commanded by harry lumsden it became legendary along the frontier as an intelligence and combat force of both infantry and cavalry it is interesting that flashman recognised sher khan as an exguide by his coat since the regiment normally wore nondescript khaki rather than a military colour flashmans assumption that the rani would be much older was not unnatural he had heard palmerston describe her as old when she married which by indian standards she was being well into her teens the general service enlistment act required recruits to serve overseas if necessary this was one of the most important grievances of the sepoys who held that crossing the sea would break their caste irregular cavalry units of the british indian armies occasionally dressed in a highly informal style so the afghan rissaldar might conceivably have been wearing an old uniform coat of skinners horse but it is unlikely that he had ever served in that unit the guides would have been more his mark i the society of thugs were worshippers of the goddess kali and practised murder as a religious devotion which would ensure them a place in paradise they preyed especially on travellers whom they would join on the road with every profession of friendship before suddenly falling on them at a prearranged signal the favourite method of killing was strangulation with a scarf the cult numbered thousands before sir william sleeman stamped them out in the s but since many continued at large and the jhansi region was traditionally a hotbed of thugee it is perfectly possible that exthugs were active as flashman says in some cases it was possible to identify a former thug by a tattoo on his eyelid or a brand on his back pass him some of his own tobacco a grim joke by ilderims companion pass the tobacco was the traditional verbal signal of the thugs to start killing there was indeed a makarram khan who served in the peshawar police and later became a notable frontier raider at the head of a band of mounted tribesmen fighting against the guides cavalry the offering and touching of a sword hilt in token of mutual respect was traditional in the indian cavalry it is curious that flashman makes no reference to dyeing his skin and indeed seems to imply that he found it unnecessary but dark as he was and lightskinned as many frontiersmen are he must surely have stained his body or he could hardly have passed for long in a sepoy barrackroom of the sepoys whom flashman mentions by name only two can be definitely identified as serving in the rd nc skirmishers at this time pir ali and kudrat ali who were both corporals although flashman refers to pir ali as though he were an ordinary sepoy addiscombe tripe refers to the officers not the jemadars and ncos addiscombe was the military seminary which trained east india company cadets from to flashmans prejudice may be explained by the fact that lord roberts among other famous soldiers went there the fears and grievances which flashman recounts probably give a fair reflection of the state of mind of many sepoys in early rumours of polluted flour and greased cartridges and stories like that of the dumdum sweeper reinforced the suspicion that the british were intent on interfering with their religion breaking their caste altering terms of enlistment and generally changing the established order to these were added the oude sepoys discontent at the recent annexation of their state which cost them certain privileges and resentment at the changed attitude towards them of a new generation of british officers and troops who seemed more ignorant and contemptuous than their predecessors this unfortunately coincided with the arrival in the bengal army of a better class of sepoys possibly quicker to take offence or according to some writers more spoiled all these things combined to undermine confidence and cause unrest and there was no lack of agitators ready to play on the sepoys fears the belief that the british intended to christianise india was widespread and reinforced by such reforms as the suppression of thugee and suttee the resentment which reform had created among indian princes has been referred to in addition educational innovations created disquiet so even did the development of the railway and telegraph with all these underlying factors it will be seen that the greased cartridge was eventually only the spark to the tinder g w forrests history of the indian mutiny and the same authors selections from the letters despatches and csp government of india mrs captain macdowalls advice on the running of an indian household might serve as a model for its time the th ni who had rioted in february were disbanded at the end of march having refused the new cartridge the paper which mangal showed to flashman was undoubtedly the march issue of ashrufalakbar of lucknow which predicted a great holy war throughout india and the middle east however it gave a warning against relying on russian assistance describing them as enemies of the faith sepoy mangal pandy of the th native infantry ran amok on the parade ground at barrackpore on march apparently drugged with bhang trying to rouse a religious revolt and claiming that british troops were coming against the sepoys he attacked one of his officers and then tried to kill himself pandy was subsequently hanged along with a native officer whose offence apparently was that he did not try to stop the attack however this first of the indian sepoy rebels gained an appropriate immortality the british word for any native mutineer thereafter was pandy for the loading drill see forests selections and j a b palmers the mutiny outbreak in meerut in referring to the platoon exercise manual while there is general agreement among historians on what happened at the firing parade some differ over precise technical details flashmans account is sound on the whole he states that the cartridges were not greased but waxed and since he does not refer to them as ball cartridges this would seem to confirm that they were ungreased blanks however this would not allay the fears of the sepoys who were apparently suspicious of any cartridge with a shiny appearance nor do they seem to have been impressed by the repeated assurances that it was unnecessary to bite the cartridge as early as january when it was announced that the sepoys could grease their own loads with nonpolluting substances it was also stated that they could tear the cartridges with their fingers the response of some sepoys to this was that they might forget and bite the british were in fact more considerate and humane towards their native troops than they were to their white ones flogging continued in the british army long after it had been abolished for indian troops whose discipline appears to have been much more lax possibly in consequence a point significantly noted by subedar sita ram when he discusses in his memoirs the causes of the mutiny lieutenant gough was warned by one of the native officers of his troop on may that the sepoys would rise to rescue their comrades from the jail carmichaelsmith and archdale wilson both rejected the warning one of the first casualties of the meerut mutiny was in fact a british soldier murdered in a bazaar lemonade shop hewitt and archdale wilson were extraordinarily slow in getting the british regiments on the move after the outbreak they did not reach the sepoy lines until after the mutineers had set off for delhi altogether thirtyone europeans are known to have been murdered in the meerut massacre including the dawson family and mrs courtney and her three children the full list is given in the records of the intelligence department of the nw provinces vol ii appendix the circumstances of their deaths are horrifying enough surgeon dawson was shot on his verandah while mrs dawson was burned by thrown torches and at least one pregnant woman mrs captain chambers was murdered but even so greatly overstated reports of meerut atrocities were circulated including tales of sexual violation it is worth quoting the statement of sir william muir then head of the nw intelligence department in a letter to lord canning that several british witnesses at meerut were confident that no rapes took place and they believed that the atrocities appalling as they were had been exaggerated it was alleged for example that ridingmaster langdales little daughter was tortured to death she had in fact been killed by a tulwar blow while sleeping on her charpoy this tendency of many british observers to be strictly fair and impartial even in the highly emotional atmosphere of the mutiny and its immediate aftermath should not be seen as playing down the atrocities they were merely concerned to correct the wilder stories and give an honest account the mutiny and massacre at jhansi took place exactly as ilderim khan described it the mass murder of the britons was carried out in the jokan bagh on june t the only details which ilderims narrative adds to historical record are the quoted remarks of the victims and their killers it was the second largest massacre in the entire mutiny and in some ways the most cruel although it has been overshadowed in popular infamy by cawnpore what is by no means certain is how far rani lakshmibai was responsible if at all she protested her innocence afterwards and there is considerable doubt what her attitude was to skenes three envoys before the town fort surrendered it is possible that lakshmibai was powerless to prevent either the mutiny or the massacre on the other hand there is no evidence that she tried to and there is no doubt that soon afterwards she was most effectively in control of jhansi and capable of dealing with any threat to her sovereignty the quotation given by flashman is the substance of the last letter which wheeler sent out of cawnpore after one of the most heroic defences in the history of war later events were to overshadow it but it remains an epic of the mutiny for the conditions within the entrenchment the figures of casualties and even small details of the siege were as flashman describes them for example bella blair did die john mckillop of the civil service did draw water under constant fire for a week before he was killed and the reference to shooting horses for food rather than riders is authentic azeemoolah khan had been sent to london in by nana sahib the adopted son of the maharatta peshawa to petition against the disallowance of nanas pension and title after his fathers death the petition failed but azeemoolah by his own account had immense success in his pursuit of london society women a boast which did not endear him to w h russell of the times when the two met at missiries hotel constantinople in and subsequently in the crimea apart from being a nobleman azeemoolah is also believed to have worked as a teacher and as a waiter nana sahib who had joined the rebellion on the outbreak at cawnpore was to become the most famous of the mutiny leaders but tantia tope whom flashman barely noticed was to be a far greater menace in the field while flashmans account of the council of war is new it supports the known facts wheeler wanted to fight on and his younger officers supported him the older men wished to surrender for the sake of the women and children and wheeler finally agreed although he was deeply suspicious of the rebels good faith nana sahibs offer of terms in the words which flashman gives was brought to the entrenchment by mrs jacobs described by one contemporary as an aged lady details of the massacre at suttee ghat are necessarily confused but the broad facts are as narrated and again many of flashmans incidental memories are confirmed by other accounts for example ewart was killed on the way to the ghat in a palankeen vibarts kit was carried and his wife escorted by rebels of his regiment five loyal sepoys were murdered moore was killed in the water shoving off some versions say that the thatch in the barges was fired before the shooting began and one of wheelers servants a nurse said the general was killed on the shore his head being cut off as he leaned from his stretcher however the probability is that he died in one of the boats what appears to be in no doubt is the premeditated treachery of the attack only one boat escaped the reptiles which attacked the swimmers can hardly have been gavials which feed exclusively on fish true crocodiles have an overlapping fourth tooth the account of the escape downriver is true this is independently confirmed by the narrative of lieutenant thomson which describes the firearrows the boats grounding the temple siege escape to the shore the boats disappearance crocodiles etc apart from flashman there were four survivors thomson delafosse sullivan and murphy who were eventually rescued by diribijah singh the massacre of women and children at cawnpore was the most notorious atrocity of the mutiny and provoked the most notorious reprisal by general neill it has been suggested that nana was not himself responsible and that the massacre may have been in retaliation for the indiscriminate punishment which neills troops had visited earlier on allahabad and on villages during their march to cawnpore without in any way condoning neills behaviour which has been justly condemned by historians it is only fair to point out that there had been no element of retaliation in previous massacres by indians at meerut jhansi and delhi what is not in dispute is the effect which cawnpore had on british opinion or the fury it caused in the army a curious echo of this even lingered on into the second world war when tattooists in hogg market calcutta were still offering to imprint the arms of british recruits with the legend cawnpore well flashman does t henry kavanaugh considerably less than justice the big irishman was undeniably eccentric one mutiny historian rice holmes has called him vain and selfimportant to the point of insanity but his night journey to campbell in his ludicrous disguise was an act of the most calculated courage possibly flashman was nettled by the fact that other accounts of the exploit describe kavanaughs companion as an indian he may also have been unfavourably impressed by the somewhat immodest title of the book in which kavanaugh described his adventure how i won the v c it tallies fairly closely in general facts if not in spirit and interpretation with flashmans version an excellent map of the scene of the journey is in forrest vol ii campbell has been much criticised by some military theoreticians for his caution and for his reluctance to shed lives british and mutineer fortescue thinks this policy may even have helped to lengthen the mutiny it is not a view which flashman could be expected to share the painting to which flashman refers of havelock and outram greeting campbell at lucknow is by a celebrated victorian painter of military scenes t j barker the mounted figure shown raising a hand in acclamation may indeed be intended to be flashman it bears some resemblance to the only other identifiable picture of him as a comparatively young man in a group of union staff officers with president lincoln during the us civil war flashmans old friend william howard russell the times correspondent makes an obvious reference to this incident in my diary in india flashmans description of the looting is borne out by russell who described his attempt to buy the jewelled chain from an irish soldier in his diary their accounts are almost word for word and russell even confirms that the chain subsequently fetched ј as flashman says griff or griffin a greenhorn a young officer hardly a fair description of roberts who although still young was to win his victoria cross only a few weeks later but flashman plainly had little liking for the legendary bobs who was to become fieldmarshal lord roberts of kandahar no doubt he was jealous of him roberts apart it seems to have been a distinguished gathering round the fire that night william stephen raikes hodson was already renowned as an irregular cavalry leader and the founder of hodsons horse he was a year older than flashman and since they were at rugby together it seems quite feasible that flashman had been his fag hodson has left a mixed reputation a brilliant soldier he was capable of coldblooded cruelty as when he murdered the delhi princes while they were his prisoners he was shot at lucknow on march th and there was a rumour that he was in the act of looting at the time roberts firmly denied this with convincing evidence sam browne inventor of the belt which bears his name was another celebrated cavalry leader who became a general and won the vc he lost his left arm in a skirmish some months after lucknow macdonald the peeler was probably macdonald who had been provostmarshal in the crimea as one of the jhansi besiegers later put it the ranee young unwedded jealous of power sat watching the puny figures below we watched and wondered what she said and did to those bestfavoured among a band of chieftains and imagination ran wild in the fervid heat until the discovery of the flashman papers lyster was the only authority for the plan to capture the rani of jhansi alive no other contemporary writer on the mutiny mentions the scheme and it was not until when the rev h h lyster denny published a littleknown work memorials of an ancient house containing some of general lysters recollections that the story came out according to lyster rose confided the plan to him in strict confidence and lyster himself did not reveal it until many years after roses death the plan was substantially as flashman recounts it and involved luring the rani into attempting an escape by withdrawing a british picket from its position covering one of the jhansi gates the battle on the betwa is one of the forgotten actions but it is a striking illustration of roses coolness and tactical brilliance caught at an apparent disadvantage he turned from jhansi and attacked the new rebel force which outnumbered him ten to one rose led the cavalry charge in person and tantias army was routed with the loss of dead and guns captured this incident took place about twenty miles from jhansi following the ranis escape when a party of british cavalry under lieutenant dowker caught up with her according to popular tradition the rebel horseman who wounded dowker was the rani herself incidentally flashman is probably in error when he says the rani left jhansi through the orcha gate other authorities specify the bandhari gate and say that the rani herself had the child damodar on her saddle there are differing accounts of lakshmibais death but flashmans accords with the generally accepted version this is that she was killed in the action of kotakiserai before gwalior when the th hussars charged the rebel camp at phool bagh she was seen in the melee with her horses reins in her mouth and was struck in the body probably by a carbine bullet she swayed in the saddle crossed swords with a trooper and was cut down according to tradition she was wearing the priceless necklace of scindia which she gave away to an attendant as she lay dying her tent on the battlefield was later found to contain a fulllength mirror books pictures and her swing captain clement heneage took part in the charge of the light brigade at balaclava and also charged with the th hussars in the action of june in which the rani of jhansi was killed flashmans misspelling may have arisen through his never having seen the name written deplorable though flashmans attitude to women was there were obviously some for whom he felt a genuine attachment and even respect lola montez and the rani of jhansi among them lakshmibai obviously captivated him but how far she returned his affection is debatable he would turn in his grave at the suggestion but it seems highly questionable that she spent the night with him in the jhansi pavilion it may be significant that he never saw her face clearly on that occasion and his description of the encounter might seem to suggest that the lady who entertained him was a professional nautchdancer or courtesan rather than the rani it is unfortunately true that in the climate created by the mutiny lakshmibai was credited with every vice but there is no evidence that her private life and behaviour were not entirely respectable that is not to say that she would not use her feminine power for political ends in this may be found a logical explanation of the pavilion incident it is possible on the basis of flashmans account that at that time the rani was already deep in mutinous conspiracy perhaps with agitators like ignatieff and either at their prompting or on her own initiative decided to destroy flashman a potentially dangerous british agent to lead him on to lure him to the pavilion and to arrange for an attack on him by professional assassins was simple that something of the sort actually happened is indicated by the confession which ilderim khan extracted from the captured thug as to the ranis display of affection for flashman on his last visit to jhansi it may well have been entirely prompted by her need to extract every scrap of information from him or perhaps she was not entirely indifferent to him after all he seemed to think so and he was not inexperienced
