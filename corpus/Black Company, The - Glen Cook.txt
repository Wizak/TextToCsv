 chapter one legate there were prodigies and portents enough oneeye says we must blame ourselves for misinterpreting them oneeyes handicap in no way impairs his marvelous hindsight lightning from a clear sky smote the necropolitan hill one bolt struck the bronze plaque sealing the tomb of the forvalaka obliterating half the spell of confinement it rained stones statues bled priests at several temples reported sacrificial victims without hearts or livers one victim escaped after its bowels were opened and was not recaptured at the fork barracks where the urban cohorts were billeted the image of teux turned completely around for nine evenings running ten black vultures circled the bastion then one evicted the eagle which lived atop the paper tower astrologers refused readings fearing for their lives a mad soothsayer wandered the streets proclaiming the imminent end of the world at the bastion the eagle not only departed the ivy on the outer ramparts withered and gave way to a creeper which appeared black in all but the most intense sunlight but that happens every year fools can make an omen of anything in retrospect we should have been better prepared we did have four modestly accomplished wizards to stand sentinel against predatory tomorrowsthough never by any means as sophisticated as divining through sheeps entrails still the best augurs are those who divine from the portents of the past they compile phenomenal records beryl totters perpetually ready to stumble over a precipice into chaos the queen of the jewel cities was old and decadent and mad filled with the stench of degeneracy and moral dryrot only a fool would be surprised by anything found creeping its night streets i had every shutter thrown wide praying for a breath off the harbor rotting fish and all there wasnt enough breeze to stir a cobweb i mopped my face and grimaced at my first patient crabs again curly he grinned feebly his face was pale its my stomach croaker his pate looks like a polished ostrich egg thus the name i checked the watch schedule and duty roster nothing there he would want to avoid its bad croaker really uhm i assumed my professional demeanor sure what it was his skin was clammy despite the heat eaten outside the commissary lately curly a fly landed on his head strutted like a conqueror he didnt notice yeah three four times uhm i mixed a nasty milky concoction drink this all of it his whole face puckered at the first taste look croaker i the smell of the stuff revolted me drink friend two men died before i came up with that then pokey took it and lived word was out about that he drank you mean its poison the damned blues slipped me something take it easy youll be okay yeah it looks that way id had to open up walleye and wild bruce to learn the truth it was a subtle poison get over there on the cot where the breeze will hit youif the son of a bitch ever comes up and lie still let the stuff work i settled him down tell me what you ate outside i collected a pen and a chart tacked onto a board i had done the same with pokey and with wild bruce before he died and had had walleyes platoon sergeant backtrack his movements i was sure the poison had come from one of several nearby dives frequented by the bastion garrison curly produced one acrosstheboard match bingo weve got the bastards now who he was ready to go settle up himself you rest ill see the captain i patted his shoulder checked the next room curly was it for morning sick call i took the long route along trejans wall which overlooks beryls harbor halfway oven i paused stared north past the mole and lighthouse and fortress island at the sea of torments particolored sails speckled the dingy greybrown water as coastal dhows scooted out along the spiderweb of routes linking the jewel cities the upper air was still and heavy and hazy the horizon could not be discerned but down on the water the air was in motion there was always a breeze out around the island though it avoided the shore as if fearing leprosy closer at hand the wheeling gulls were as surly and lackadaisical as the day promised to make most men another summer in service to the syndic of beryl sweating and grimy thanklessly shielding him from political rivals and his undisciplined native troops another summer busting our butts for curlys reward the pay was good but not in coin of the soul our forebrethren would be embarrassed to see us so diminished beryl is misery curdled but also ancient and intriguing its history is a bottomless well filled with murky water i amuse myself plumbing its shadowy depths trying to isolate fact from fiction legend and myth no easy task for the citys earlier historians wrote with an eye to pleasing the powers of their day the most interesting period for me is the ancient kingdom which is the least satisfactorily chronicled it was then in the reign of niam that the forvalaka came were overcome after a decade of terror and were confined in their dark tomb atop the necropolitan hill echoes of that terror persist in folklore and matronly admonitions to unruly children no one recalls what the forvalaka were now i resumed walking despairing of beating the heat the sentries in their shaded kiosks wore towels draped around their necks a breeze startled me i faced the harbor a ship was founding the island a great lumbering beast that dwarfed the dhows and feluccas a silver skull bulged in the center of its fullbellied black sail that skulls red eyes glowed fires flickered behind its broken teeth a glittering silver band encircled the skull what the hell is that a sentry asked i dont know whitey the ships size impressed me more than did its flashy sail the four minor wizards we had with the company could match that showmanship but id never seen a galley sporting five banks of oars i recalled my mission i knocked on the captains door he did not respond i invited myself inside found him snoring in his big wooden chair yo i hollered fire riots in the groan dancing at the gate of dawn dancing was an old time general who nearly destroyed beryl people still shudder at his name the captain was cool he didnt crack an eyelid or smile youre presumptuous croaker when are you going to learn to go through channels channels meant bug the lieutenant first dont interrupt his nap unless the blues were storming the bastion i explained about curly and my chart he swung his feet off the desk sounds like work for mercy his voice had a hard edge the black company does not suffer malicious attacks upon its men mercy was our nastiest platoon leader he thought a dozen men would suffice but lei silent and me lag along i could patch the wounded silent would be useful if the blues played rough silent held us up half a day while he made a quick trip to the woods what the hell you up to i asked when he got back lugging a rattylooking sack he just grinned silent he is and silent he stays the place was called mole tavern it was a comfortable hangout i had passed many an evening there mercy assigned three men to the back door and a pair each to the two windows he sent another two to the roof every building in beryl has a roof hatch people sleep up top during the summer he led the rest of us through the moles front door mercy was a smallish cocky fellow fond of the dramatic gesture his entry should have been preceded by fanfares the crowd froze stared at our shields and bared blades at snatches of grim faces barely visible through gaps in our face guards verus mercy shouted get your butt out here the grandfather of the managing family appeared he sidled toward us like a mutt expecting a kick the customers began buzzing silence mercy thundered he could get a big roar out of his small body how may we help you honored sirs the old man asked you can get your sons and grandsons out here blue chairs squeaked a soldier slammed his blade into a tabletop sit still mercy said youre just having lunch fine youll be loose in an hour the old man began shaking i dont understand sir what have we done mercy grinned evilly he plays the innocent well its murder verus two charges of murder by poisoning two of attempted murder by poisoning the magistrates decreed the punishment of slaves he was having fun mercy wasnt one of my favorite people he never slopped being the boy who pulled wings off flies the punishment of slaves meant being left up for scavenger birds after public crucifixion in beryl only criminals are buried uncremated or not buried al all an uproar rose in the kitchen somebody was trying to get out the back door our men were objecting the public room exploded a wave of daggerbrandishing humanity hit us they forced us back to the door those who were not guilty obviously feared they would be condemned with those who were beryls justice is fast crude and harsh and seldom gives a defendant opportunity to clear himself a dagger slipped past a shield one of our men went down i am not much as a fighter but i stepped into his place mercy said something snide that i did not catch thats your chance at heaven wasted i countered youre out of the annals forever crap you dont leave out anything a dozen citizens went down blood pooled in low places on the floor spectators gathered outside soon some adventurer would hit us from behind a dagger nicked mercy he lost patience silent silent was on the job already but he was silent that meant no sound and very little flash or fury mole patrons began slapping their faces and pawing the air forsaking us they hopped and danced grabbed their backs and behinds squealed and howled piteously several collapsed what the hell did you do i asked silent grinned exposing sharp teeth he passed a dusky paw across my eyes i saw the mole tram a slightly altered perspective the bag he had lugged in from out of town proved to be one of those hornets nests you can if youre unlucky run into in the woods south of beryl its tenants were the bumblebeelooking monsters peasants call baldfaced hornets they have a foul temper unrivalled anywhere in nature they cowed the mole crowd fast without bothering our lads fine work silent mercy said after having vented his fury on several hapless patrons he herded the survivors into the street i examined our injured brother while the unharmed soldier finished the wounded saving the syndic the cost of a trial and a hangman mercy called that silent looked on still grinning hes not nice either though he seldom participates directly we took more prisoners than expected was a bunch of them mercys eyes twinkled thanks silent the line stretched a block fate is a fickle bitch shed led us to mole tavern at a critical moment poking around our witch man had unearthed a prize a crowd concealed in a hideout beneath the wine cellar among them were some of the best known blues mercy chattered wondering aloud how large a reward our informant deserved no such informant existed the yammer was meant to save our tame wizards from becoming prime targets our enemies would scurry around looking for phantom spies move them out mercy ordered still grinning he eyed the sullen crowd think theyll try something they did not his supreme confidence cowed anyone who had ideas we wound through mazelike streets half as old as the world our prisoners shuffling listlessly i gawked my comrades are indifferent to the past but i cannot help being awedand occasionally intimidatedby how timedeep beryls history runs mercy called an unexpected halt we had come to the avenue of the syndics which winds from the customs house uptown to the bastions main gate there was a procession on the avenue though we reached the intersection first mercy yielded the rightofway the procession consisted of a hundred armed men they looked tougher than anyone in beryl but us at their head rode a dark figure on the biggest black stallion ive ever seen the rider was small effeminately slim and clad in worn black leather he wore a black morion which concealed his head entirely black gloves concealed his hands he seemed to be unarmed damn me mercy whispered i was disturbed that rider chilled me something primitive deep inside me wanted to run but curiosity plagued me more who was he had he come off that strange ship in the harbor why was he here the eyeless gaze of the rider swept across us indifferently as though passing over a flock of sheep then it jerked back fixing on silent silent met stare for stare and showed no fear and still he seemed somehow diminished the column passed on hardened disciplined shaken mercy got our mob moving again we entered the bastion only yards behind the strangers we had arrested most of the more conservative blue leadership when word of the raid spread the volatile types decided to flex their muscles they sparked something monstrous the perpetually abrasive weather does things to mens reason the beryl mob is savage riots occur almost without provocation when things go bad the dead number in the thousands this was one of the worst times the army is half the problem a parade of weak shortterm syndics let discipline lapse the troops are beyond control now generally though they will act against rioters they see riot suppression as license to loot the worst happened several cohorts from the fork barracks demanded a special donative before they would respond to a directive to restore order the syndic refused to pay the cohorts mutinied mercys platoon hastily established a strongpoint near the rubbish gate and held off all three cohorts most of our men were killed but none ran mercy himself lost an eye a finger was wounded in shoulder and hip and had more than a hundred holes in his shield when help arrived he came to me more dead than alive in the end the mutineers scattered rather than face the rest of the black company the riots were the worst in memory we lost almost a hundred brethren trying to suppress them we could ill afford the loss of one in the groan the streets were carpet led with corpses the rats grew fat clouds of vultures and ravens migrated from the countryside the captain ordered the company into the bastion let it run its course he said weve done enough his disposition had gone beyond sour disgusted our commission doesnt require us to commit suicide somebody made a crack about us falling on our swords seems to be what the syndic expects beryl had ground our spirits down but had left none so disillusioned as the captain he blamed himself for our losses he did in fact try to resign the mob had fallen into a sullen grudging desultory effort to sustain chaos interfering with any attempt to fight fires or prevent looting but otherwise just roamed the mutinous cohorts fattened by deserters from other units were systematizing the murder and plunder the third night i stood a watch on trejans wall beneath the carping stars a fool of a volunteer sentinel the city was strangely quiet i might have been more anxious had i not been so tired it was all i could do to stay awake tomtom came by what are you doing out here croaker filling in you look like death on a stick get some rest you dont look good yourself runt he shrugged hows mercy not out of the woods yet i had little hope for him really i pointed you know anything about that out there an isolated scream echoed in the distance it had a quality which set it aside from other recent screams those had been filled with pain rage and fear this one was redolent of something darker he hemmed and hawed in that way he and his brother oneeye have if you dont know they figure its a secret worth keeping wizards theres a rumor that the mutineers broke the seals on the tomb of the forvalaka while they were plundering the necropolitan hill uh those things are loose the syndic thinks so the captain dont take it seriously i didnt either though tomtom looked concerned they looked tough the ones who were here the other day ought to have recruited them he said with an undertone of sadness he and oneeye have been with the company a long time they have seen much of its decline why were they here he shrugged get some rest croaker dont kill yourself wont make a bit of difference in the end he ambled away lost in the wilderness of his thoughts i lifted an eyebrow he was way down i turned back to the fires and lights and disturbing absence of racket my eyes kept crossing my vision clouding tomtom was right i needed sleep from the darkness came another of those strange hopeless cries this one was closer up croaker the lieutenant was not gentle captain wants you in the officers mess i groaned i cursed i threatened mayhem in the first degree he grinned pinched the nerve in my elbow rolled me onto the floor im up already i grumbled feeling around for my boots whats it about he was gone will mercy pull through croaker the captain asked i dont think so but ive seen bigger miracles the officers and sergeants were all there you want to know whats happening the captain said the visitor the other day was an envoy from overseas he offered an alliance the norths military resources in exchange for the support of beryls fleets sounded reasonable to me but the syndic is being stubborn hes still upset about the conquest of opal i suggested he be more flexible if these northerners are villains then the alliance option could be the least of several evils better an ally than a tributary our problem is where do we stand if the legate presses candy said we should refuse if he tells us to fight these northerners maybe fighting a sorcerer could mean our destruction wham the mess door slammed open a small dusky wiry man preceded by a great humped beak of a nose blew inside the captain bounced up and clicked his heels syndic our visitor slammed both fists down on the tabletop you ordered your men withdrawn into the bastion im not paying you to hide like whipped dogs youre not paying us to become martyrs either the captain replied in his reasoningwithfools voice were a bodyguard not police maintaining order is the task of the urban cohorts the syndic was tired distraught frightened on his last emotional legs like everyone else be reasonable the captain suggested beryl has passed a point of no return chaos rules the streets any attempt to restore order is doomed the cure now is the disease i liked that i had begun to hate beryl the syndic shrank into himself theres still the forvalaka and that vulture from the north waiting off the island tomtom started out of a halfsleep off the island you say waiting for me to beg interesting the little wizard lapsed into semislumber the captain and syndic bickered about he terms of our commission i produced our copy of the agreement the syndic tried to stretch clauses with yeah but clearly he wanted to fight if the legate started throwing his weight around elmo started snoring the captain dismissed us resumed arguing with our employer i suppose seven hours passes as a nights sleep i didnt strangle tomtom when he wakened me but i did grouse and crab till he threatened to turn me into a jackass braying at the gate of dawn only then after i had dressed and we had joined a dozen others did i realize that i didnt have a notion what was happening were going to look at a tomb tomtom said huh i am none too bright some mornings were going to the necropolitan hill to eyeball that forvalaka tomb now wait a minute chicken i always thought you were croaker whatre you talking about dont worry youll have three top wizards along with nothing to do but babysit your ass oneeye would go too but the captain wants him to hang around why is what i want to know to find out if vampires are real they could be a putup from yon spook ship neat trick maybe we should have thought of it the forvalaka threat had done what no force of arms could stilled the riots tomtom nodded he dragged fingers across the little drum that gave him his name i filed the thought hes worse than his brother when it comes to admitting shortcomings the city was as still as an old battlefield like a battlefield it was filled with stench flies scavengers and the dead the only sound was the tread of our boots and once the mournful cry of a sad dog standing sentinel over its fallen master the price of order i muttered i tried to run the dog off it wouldnt budge the cost of chaos tomtom countered thump on his drum not quite the same thing croaker the necropolitan hill is taller than the heighth on which the bastion stands from the upper enclosure where the mausoleums of the wealthy stand i could see the northern ship just lying out there waiting tomtom said like the syndic said why dont they just move in who could stop them tomtom shrugged nobody else offered an opinion we reached the storied tomb it looked the part it played in rumor and legend it was very very old definitely lightningblasted and scarred with tool marks one thick oak door had burst asunder toothpicks and fragments lay scattered for a dozen yards around goblin tomtom and silent put their heads together somebody made a crack about that way they might have a brain between them goblin and silent then took stations flanking the door a few steps back tomtom faced it head on he shuffled around like a bull about to charge found his spot dropped into a crouch with his arms flung up oddly like a parody of a martial arts master how about you fools open the door he growled idiots i had to bring idiots whamwham on the drum stand around with their fingers in their noses a couple of us grabbed the ruined door and heaved it was too warped to give much tomtom rapped his drum let out a villainous scream and jumped inside goblin bounced to the portal behind him silent moved up in a fast glide inside tomtom let out a rat squeak and started sneezing he stumbled out eyes watering grinding his nose with the heels of his hands he sounded like he had a bad cold when he said wasnt a trick his ebony skin had gone grey what do you mean i demanded he jerked a thumb toward the tomb goblin and silent were inside now they started sneezing i sidled to the doorway peeked i couldnt see squat just dust thick in the sunlight close to me then i stepped inside my eyes adjusted there were bones everywhere bones in heaps bones in stacks bones sorted neatly by something insane strange bones they were similar to those of men but of weird proportion to my physicians eye there must have been fifty bodies originally theyd really packed them in back when forvalaka for sure then because beryl buries its villains uncremated there were fresh corpses too i counted seven dead soldiers before the sneezing started they wore the colors of a mutinous cohort i dragged a body outside let go stumbled a few steps was noisily sick when i regained control j turned back to examine my booty the others stood around looking green no phantom did that goblin said tomtom bobbed his head he was more shaken than anyone more shaken than the sight demanded i thought silent got on with business somehow conjuring a brisk small maid of a breeze that scurried in through the mausoleum door and bustled out again skirts laden with dust and the smell of death you all right i asked tomtom he eyed my medical kit and waved me off ill be okay i was just remembering i gave him a minute then prodded remembering we were boys oneeye and me theyd just sold us to ngamo to become his apprentices a messenger came from a village back in the hills he knelt beside the dead soldier the wounds are identical i was rattled nothing human killed that way yet the damage seemed deliberate calculated the work of a malign intelligence that made it more horrible i swallowed knelt began my examination silent and goblin eased into the tomb goblin had a little amber ball of light rolling around his cupped hands no bleeding i observed it takes the blood tomtom said silent dragged another corpse out and the organs when it has time the second body had been split from groin to gullet heart and liver were missing silent went back inside goblin came out he settled on a broken grave marker and shook his head well tomtom demanded definitely the real thing no prank by our friend he pointed the northerner continued its patrol amidst a swarm of fishermen and coasters there were fiftyfour of them sealed up here they ate each other this was the last one left tomtom jumped as if slapped whats the matter i asked that means the thing was the nastiest cunningest cruelest and craziest of the lot vampires i muttered in this day tomtom said not strictly a vampire this is the wereleopard the manleopard who walks on two legs by day and on four by night id heard of werewolves and werebears the peasants around my home city tell such tales id never heard of a wereleopard i told tomtom as much the manleopard is from the far south the jungle he stared out to sea they have to be buried alive silent deposited another corpse blooddrinking livereating wereleopards ancient darknesswise filled with a millenium of hatred and hunger the stuff of nightmare all right can you handle it ngamo couldnt ill never be his match and he lost an arm and a foot trying to destroy a young male what we have here is an old female bitter cruel and clever the four of us might hold her off conquer her no but if you and oneeye know this thing no he had the shakes he gripped his drum so tight it creaked we cant chaos died beryls streets remained as starkly silent as those of a city overthrown even the mutineers concealed themselves till hunger drove them to the city granaries the syndic tried to tighten the screws on the captain the captain ignored him silent goblin and oneeye tracked the monster the thing functioned on a purely animal level feeding the hunger of an age the factions besieged the syndic with demands for protection the lieutenant again summoned us to the officers mess the captain wasted no time men our situation is grim he paced beryl is demanding a new syndic every faction has asked the black company to stand aside the moral dilemma escalated with the stakes we arent heroes the captain continued were tough were stubborn we try to honor our commitments but we dont die for lost causes i protested the voice of tradition questioning his unspoken proposition the question on the table is the survival of the company croaker we have taken the gold captain honor is the question on the table for four centuries the black company has met the letter of its commissions consider the book of set recorded by annalist coral while the company was in service to the archon of bone during the revolt of the chiliarchs you consider it croaker i was irritated i stand on my right as a free soldier he has the right to speak the lieutenant agreed he is more a traditionalist than i okay let him talk we dont have to listen i reiterated that darkest hour in the companys history till i realized i was arguing with myself half of me wanted to sell out croaker are you finished i swallowed find a legitimate loophole and ill go along tomtom gave me a mocking drumroll oneeye chuckled thats a job for goblin croaker he was a lawyer before he worked his way up to pimping goblin took the bait i was a lawyer your mother was a lawyers enough the captain slapped the tabletop weve got croakers okay go with it find an out the others looked relieved even the lieutenant my opinion as annalist carried more weight than i liked the obvious out is the termination of the man holding our bond i observed that hung in the air like an old foul smell like the stench in the tomb of the forvalaka in our battered state who could blame us if an assassin slipped past you have a disgusting turn of mind croaker tomtom said he gave me another drumroll pots calling kettles wed retain the appearance of honor we do fail as often as not i like it the captain said lets break this up before the syndic comes asking whats up you stay tomtom ive got a job for you it was a night for screamers a broiling sticky night of the sort that abrades that last thin barrier between the civilized man and the monster crouched in his soul the screams came from homes where fear heat and overcrowding had put too much strain on the monsters chains a cool wind roared in off the gulf pursued by massive storm clouds with lightning prancing in their hair the wind swept away the stench of beryl the downpour scoured its streets by mornings light beryl seemed a different city still and cool and clean the streets were speckled with puddles as we walked to the waterfront runoff still chuckled in the gutters by noon the air would be leaden again and more humid than ever tomtom awaited us on a boat he had hired i said how much did you pocket on this deal this scow looks like itd sink before it cleared the island not a copper croaker he sounded disappointed he and his brother are great pilferers and blackmarketeers not a copper this here is a slicker job than it looks her master is a smuggler ill take your word youd probably know nevertheless i stepped gingerly as i boarded he scowled we were supposed to pretend that the avarice of tomtom and oneeye did not exist we were off to sea to make an arrangement tomtom had the captains carte blanche the lieutenant and i were along to give him a swift kick if he got carried away silent and a half dozen soldiers accompanied us for show a customs launch hailed us off the island we were gone before she could get underway i squatted peered under the boom the black ship loomed bigger and bigger that damned thing is a floating island too big the lieutenant growled ship that size couldnt hold together in a heavy sea why not how do you know even boggled i remained curious about my brethren sailed as a cabin boy when i was young i learned ships his tone discouraged further interrogation most of the men want their antecedents kept private as you might expect in a company of villains held together by its now and its us againsttheworld gone befores not too big if you have the thaumaturgic craft to bind it tomtom countered he was shaky tapping his drum in random nervous rhythms he and oneeye both hated water so a mysterious northern enchanter a ship as black as the floors of hell my nerves began to fray her crew dropped an accomodation ladder the lieutenant scampered up he seemed impressed im no sailor but the ship did look squared away and disciplined a junior officer sorted out tomtom silent and myself and asked us to accompany him he led us down stairs and through passageways aft without speaking the northern emissary sat crosslegs amidst rich cushions backed by the ships open sternlights in a cabin worthy of an eastern potentate i gaped tomtom smouldered with avarice the emissary laughed the laughter was a shock a highpitched near giggle more appropriate to some fifteen year old madonna of the tavern night than to a man more powerful than any king excuse me he said placing a hand daintily where his mouth would have been had he not been wearing that black morion then be seated my eyes widened against my will each remark came in a distinctly different voice was there a committee inside that helmet tomtom gulped air silent being silent simply sat i followed his example and tried not to become too offensive with my frightened curious stare tomtom wasnt the best diplomat that day he blurted the syndic wont last much longer we want to make an arrangement silent dug a toe into his thigh i muttered this is our daring prince of thieves our man of iron nerve the legate chuckled youre the physician croaker pardon him he knows me a cold cold tear enfolded me in its dark wings sweat moistened my temples it had nothing to do with heat a cool sea breeze flowed through the sternlights a breeze for which men in beryl would kill there is no cause to fear me i was sent to offer an alliance meant to benefit beryl as much as my people i remain convinced that agreement can be forgedthough not with the current autocrat you face a problem requiring the same solution as mine but your commission puts you in a narrow place he knows it all no point talking tomtom croaked he thumped his drum but his fetish did him no good he was choking up the legate observed the syndic is not invulnerable even guarded by you a great big cat had tomtoms tongue the envoy looked at me i shrugged suppose the syndic expired while your company was defending the bastion against the mob ideal i said but it ignores the question of our subsequent safety you drive the mob off then discover the death youre no longer employed so you leave beryl and go where and outrun our enemies how the urban cohorts would pursue us tell your captain that on discovery of the syndics demise if i receive a written request to mediate the succession my forces will relieve you at the bait ion you should leave beryl and camp on the pillar of anguish the pillar of anguish is an arrowhead of a chalk headland wormholed with countless little caverns it thrusts out to sea a days march east of beryl a lighthouse watchtower stands there the name comes from the moaning the wind makes passing through the caverns thats a goddamned deathtrap those buggermasters would just besiege us and giggle till we ate each other a simple matter to slip boats in and take you off dingding an alarm bell banged away four inches behind my eyes this sumbitch was running a game on us why the hell would you do that your company would be unemployed i would be willing to assume the commission there is a need for good soldiers in the north dingding that old belt kept singing he wanted to take us on what for something told me that was not the moment to ask i shifted my ground what about the forvalaka zig when they expect you to zag the thing out of the crypt the envoys voice was that of the woman of your dreams purring come on i may have work for it too youll get it under control once it serves its purpose i thought of the lightning bolt that had obliterated a spell of confinement on a plaque that had resisted tampering for a millenium i kept my suspicions off my face im sure but the emissary chuckled maybe physician maybe not an interesting puzzle no go back to your captain make up your minds quickly your enemies are ready to move he made a gesture that dismissed us just deliver the case the captain snarled at candy then get your butt back here candy took the courier case and went anybody else want to argue you bastards had your chance to get rid of me you blew it tempers were hot the captain had made the legate a counterproposal been offered his patronage should the syndic perish candy was running the captains reply to the envoy tomtom muttered you dont know what youre doing you dont know who youre signing with illuminate me no croaker whats it like out there i had been sent to scout the city its plague all right not like any ive seen before though the forvalaka must be the vector the captain gave me the squinty eye doctor talk a vector is a carrier the plague comes in pockets around its kills the captain growled tomtom you know this beast never heard of one spreading disease and all of us who went into the tomb are still healthy i chimed in the carrier doesnt matter the plague does itll get worse if people dont start burning bodies it hasnt penetrated the bastion the captain observed and its had a positive effect the regular garrison have stopped deserting i encountered a lot of antagonism in the groan theyre on the edge of another explosion how soon two days three at the outside the captain chewed his lip the tight place was getting tighter weve go to a tribune of the garrison shoved through the door theres a mob at the gate they have a ram lets go the captain said it took only minutes to disperse them a few missiles and a few pots of hot water they fled pelting us with curses and insults night fell i stayed on the wall watching distant torches roam the city the mob was evolving developing a nervous system if it developed a brain we would find ourselves caught in a revolution the movement of torches eventually diminished the explosion would not come tonight maybe tomorrow if the heat and humidity became too oppressive later i heard scratching to my right then clackings scrapings softly softly but there approaching terror filled me i became as motionless as the gargoyles perched over the gate the breeze became an arctic wind something came over the battlements red eyes four legs dark as the night black leopard it moved as fluidly as water running downhill it padded down the stair into the courtyard vanished the monkey in my backbrain wanted to scamper up a tail tree screeching to hurl excrement and rotted fruit i fled toward the nearest door took a protected route to the captains quarters lei myself in without knocking i found him on his cot hands behind his head staring at the ceiling his room was illuminated by a single feeble candle the forvalaka is in the bastion i saw it come over the wall my voice squeaked like goblins he grunted you hear me i heard croaker go away leave me alone yes sir so it was eating him up i backed toward the door the scream was loud and long and hopeless and ended abruptly it came from the syndics quarters i drew my sword charged through the doorsmack into candy candy went down i stood over him numbly wondering why he was back so soon get in here croaker the captain ordered want to get yourself killed there were more cries from the syndics quarters death was not being selective i yanked candy inside we bolted and barred the door i stood with my back against it eyes closed panting chances are it was imagination but i thought i heard something growl as it padded past now what candy asked his face was colorless his hands were shaking the captain finished scribbling a letter he handed it over now you go back someone hammered on the door what the captain snapped a voice muted by thick wood responded i said its oneeye open up i opened oneeye tomtom goblin silent and a dozen others pushed inside the room got hot and tight tomtom said the manleopard is in the bastion captain he forgot to punctuate with his drum it seemed to droop at his hip another scream from the syndics quarters my imagination had tricked me whatre we going to do oneeye asked he was a wrinkled little black man no bigger than his brother usually possessed by a bizarre sense of humor he was a year older than tomtom but at their age no one was counting both were over a hundred if the annals could be believed he was terrified tomtom was on the edge of hysteria goblin and silent too were rocky it can take us off one by one can it be killed theyre almost invincible captain can they be killed the captain put a hard edge on his voice he was frightened too yes oneeye confessed he seemed a whisker less scared than tomtom nothing is invulnerable not even that thing on the black ship but this is strong fast and smart weapons are of little avail sorcery is better but even that isnt much use never before had i heard him admit limitations weve talked enough the captain growled now we act he was difficult to know our commander but was transparent now rage and frustration at an impossible situation had fixed on the forvalaka tomtom and oneeye protested vehemently youve been thinking about this since you found out that thing was loose the captain said you decided what youd do if you had to lets do it another scream the paper tower must be an abattoir i muttered the thing is hunting down everybody up there for a moment i thought even silent would protest the captain strapped on his weapons match assemble the men seal all the entrances to the paper tower elmo pick some good halberdiers and crossbowmen quarrels to be poisoned twenty minutes fled i lost count of the cries i lost track of everything but a growing trepidation and the question why had the forvalaka invaded the bastion why did it persist in its hunt more than hunger drove it that legate had hinted at having a use for it what this what were we doing working with someone who could do that all four wizards collaborated on the spell that preceded us crackling the air itself threw blue sparks halberdiers followed crossbowmen backed them behind them another dozen of us entered the syndics quarters anticlimax the antechamber to the paper tower looked perfectly normal its upstairs oneeye told us the captain faced the passageway behind us match bring your men inside he planned to advance room by room sealing all exits but one for retreat oneeye and tomtom did not approve they said the thing would be more dangerous cornered ominous silence surrounded us there had been no cries for several minutes we found the first victim at the base of the stair leading into the tower proper one of ours i grumbled the syndic always surrounded himself with a squad from the company sleeping quarters upstairs id never been inside the paper tower the captain nodded kitchen level stores level servants quarters on two levels then family then the syndic himself library and offices at the top wants to make it hard to get to him i examined the body not quite like the ones at the tomb tomtom it didnt take the blood or organs how come he had no answer neither did oneeye the captain peered into the shadows above now it gets tricky halberdiers one step at a time keep your points low crossbows stay four or five steps behind shoot anything that moves swords out everybody oneeye run your spell ahead crackle step step quietly stench of fear quang a man discharged his crossbow accidentally the captain spit and grumbled like a volcano in bad temper there wasnt a damned thing to see servants quarters blood splashed the walls bodies and pieces of bodies lay everywhere amidst furniture invariably shredded and wrecked there are hard men in the company but even the hardest was moved even i who as physician see the worst the battlefield offers the lieutenant said captain im getting the rest of the company this thing isnt getting away his tone brooked no contradiction the captain merely nodded the carnage had that effect fear faded somewhat most of us decided the thing had to be destroyed a scream sounded above it was like a taunt hurled our way daring us to come on hardeyed men started up the stair the air crackled as the spell preceded them tomtom and oneeye bore down on their terror the death hunt began in earnest a vulture had evicted the eagle nesting atop the paper tower a fell omen indeed i had no hope for our employer we climbed past five levels it was gorily obvious the forvalaka had visited each tomtorn whipped up a hand pointed the forvalaka was nearby the halberdiers knelt behind their weapons the crossbowmen aimed at shadows tomtom waited half a minute he oneeye silent and goblin posed intently listening to something the rest of the world could only imagine then its waiting be careful dont give it an opening i asked a dumb question altogether too late for its answer to have bearing shouldnt we use silver weapons quarrel heads and blades tomtom looked baffled where i come from the peasants say you have to kill werewolves with silver crap you kill them same as you kill anything else only you move faster and hit harder cause you only get one shot the more he revealed the less terrible the creature seemed this was like hunting a rogue lion why all the fuss i recalled the servants quarters everybody just stand still tomtom said and be quiet well try a sending he and his cohorts put their heads together after a while he indicated we should resume our advance we eased onto a landing packed tightly a human hedgehog with quills of steel the wizards sped their enchantment an angry roar came from the shadows ahead followed by the scrape of claws something moved crossbows twanged another roar almost mocking the wizards put their heads together again downstairs the lieutenant was ordering men into positions the forvalaka would have to pass to escape we eased into the darkness tension mounting bodies and blood made the footing treacherous men hastened to seal doors slowly we penetrated a suite of offices twice movement drew fire from the crossbows the forvalaka yowled not twenty feet away tomtom released a sigh that was half groan caught it he said meaning they had reached it with their spell twenty feet away right there with us i could see nothing something moved quarrels flew a man cried out damn the captain swore somebody was still alive up here something as black as the heart of night as quick as unexpected death arced over the halberds i had one thought fast before it was among us men flew around yelled got into one anothers way the monster roared and growled threw claws and fangs too fast for the eye to follow once i thought i slashed a flank of darkness before a blow hurled me a dozen feet i scrambled up got my back to a pillar i was sure i was going to die sure the thing would kill us all pure hubris us thinking we could handle it only seconds had passed half a dozen men were dead more were injured the forvalaka didnt seem slowed let alone harmed neither weapons nor spells hampered it our wizards stood in a little knot trying to produce another enchantment the captain cored a second clumpthe rest of the men were scattered the monster flashed around picking them off grey fire ripped through the room for an instant exposing its entirety branding the carnage on the backs of my eyeballs the forvalaka screamed this time with genuine pain point for the wizards it streaked toward me i hacked in panic as it whipped past i missed it whirled took a running start leapt at the wizards they met it with another flashy spell the forvalaka howled a man shrieked the beast thrashed on the floor like a dying snake men stabbed it with pikes and swords it regained its feet and streaked out the exit we had kept open for ourselves its coming the captain bellowed to the lieutenant i sagged knowing nothing but relief it was gone before my butt hit the floor oneeye was dragging me up come on croaker it hit tomtom you got to help i staggered over suddenly aware of a shallow gash down one leg better clean it good i muttered those claws are bound to be filthy tomtom was a twist of human wreckage his throat had been torn out his belly opened his arms and chest had been ripped to the bone amazingly he was still alive but there was nothing i could do nothing any physician could have done not even a master sorcerer specializing in healing could have salvaged the little black man but oneeye insisted i try and try i did till the captain dragged me off to attend men less certain of dying oneeye was bellowing at him as i left get some lights in here i ordered at the same time the captain began assembling the uninjured at the open doorway telling them to hold it as the light grew stronger the extent of the debacle became more evident we had been decimated moreover a dozen brothers who had not been with us lay scattered around the chamber they had been on duty among them were as many more of the syndics secretaries and advisers anybody see the syndic the captain demanded he must have been here he and match and elmo started searching i did not have much chance to follow that i patched and sewed like a madman commandeering all the help i could the forvalaka left deep claw wounds which required careful and skillful suturing somehow goblin and silent managed to calm oneeye enough so he could help maybe they did something to him he worked in a daze barely this side of unconsciousness i took another look at tomtom when i got a chance he was still alive clutching his little drum damn that much stubbornness deserved reward but how my expertise simply was not adequate yo match shouted captain i glanced over he was tapping a chest with his sword the chest was of stone it was a strongbox of a type favored by beryls wealthy i guess this one weighed five hundred pounds its exterior had been fancifully carved most of the decoration had been demolished by the tearing of claws elmo smashed the lock and pried the lid open i glimpsed a man lying atop gold and jewels arms around his head shaking elmo and the captain exchanged grim looks i was distracted by the lieutenants arrival he had held on downstairs till he got worried about nothing having happened the forvalaka had not gone down search the tower the captain told him maybe it went up there were a couple levels above us when next i glanced at the chest it was closed again our employer was nowhere in evidence match was seated atop it cleaning his nails with a dagger i eyed the captain and elmo there was something the slightest bit odd about them they would not have finished the forvalakas task for her would they no the captain couldnt betray company ideals that way could he i did not ask the search of the tower revealed nothing but a trail of blood leading to the tower top where the forvalaka had lain gathering strength it had been badly hurt but it had escaped by descending the outer face of the tower someone suggested we track it to that the captain replied were leaving beryl were no longer employed we have to get out before the city turns on us he sent match and elmo to keep an eye on the native garrison the rest evacuated the wounded from the paper tower for several minutes i remained unchaperoned i eyed the big stone chest temptation arose but i resisted i did not want to know candy got back after all the excitement he told us the legate was at the pier offloading his troops the men were packing and loading some muttering about events in the paper tower others bitching about having to leave you stop moving and immediately put down roots you accumulate things you find a woman then the inevitable happens and you have to leave it all there was a lot of pain floating around our barracks i was at the gate when the northerners came i helped turn the capstan that raised the portcullis i felt none too proud without my approval the syndic might never have been betrayed the legate occupied the bastion the company began its evacuation it was then about the third hour after midnight and the streets were deserted twothirds of the way to the gate of dawn the captain ordered a halt the sergeants assembled everyone able to fight the rest continued with the wagons the captain took us north on the avenue of the older empire where beryls emperors had memorialized themselves and their triumphs many of the monuments are bizarre and celebrate such minutia as favorite horses gladiators or lovers of either sex i had a bad feeling even before we reached the rubbish gate uneasiness grew into suspicion and suspicion blossomed into grim certainty as we entered the martial fields there is nothing near the rubbish gate but the fork barracks the captain made no specific declaration when we reached the fork compound every man knew what was afoot the urban cohorts were as sloppy as ever the com pound gate was open and the lone watchman was asleep we trooped inside unresisted the captain began assigning tasks between five and six thousand men remained there their officers had restored some discipline having entice them into restoring their weapons to the armories traditionally beryls captains trust their men with weapons only the eve of battle three platoons moved directly into the barracks killing men in their beds the remaining platoon established a blocking position at the far end of the compound the sun was up before the captain was satisfied we withdrew and hurried after our baggage train there wasnt a man among us who hadnt had his fill we were not pursued of course no one came besieging the camp we established on the pillar of anguish which was what it was all about that and the release of several years of pentup anger elmo and i stood at the tip of the headland watching the afternoon sun play around the edges of a storm far out to sea it had danced in and swamped our encampment with its cool deluge then had rolled off across the water again it was beautiful though not especially colorful elmo had not had much to say recently something eating you elmo the storm moved in front of the light giving the sea the look of rusted iron i wondered if the cool had reached beryl reckon you can guess croaker reckon i can the paper tower the fork barracks our ignoble treatment of our commission what do you think it will be like north of the sea think the black witch will come eh hell come elmo hes just having trouble getting his puppets to jig to his tune as who did not trying to tame that insane city uhm and look there a pod of whales plunged past rocks lying off the headland i tried to appear unimpressed and failed the beasts were magnificent dancing in the iron sea we sat down with our backs toward the lighthouse it seemed we looked at a world never defiled by man sometimes i suspect it would be better for our absence ship out there elmo said i didnt see it till its sail caught the fire of the afternoon sun becoming an orange triangle edged with gold rocking and bobbing with the rise and fall of the sea coaster maybe a twenty tonner that big for a coaster deep water ships sometimes run eighty tons time pranced along fickle and faggoty we watched ship and whales i began to daydream for the hundredth time i tried to imagine the new land building upon traders tales heard secondhand we would likely cross to opal opal was a reflection of beryl they said though a younger city that fool is going to pile onto the rocks i woke up the coaster was perilously near said danger she shifted course a point and eluded disaster by a hundred yards resumed her original course that put some excitement into our day i observed one of these first days youre going to say something without getting sarcastic and ill curl up and die croaker keeps me sane friend thats debatable croaker debatable i went back to staring tomorrow in the face better than looking backward but tomorrow refused to shed its mask shes coming around elmo said what oh the coaster wallowed in the swell barely making way while her bows swung toward the strand below our camp want to tell the captain i expect he knows the men in the lighthouse yeah keep an eye out in case anything else turns up the storm was sliding to the west now obscuring that horizon and blanketing the sea with its shadow the cold grey sea suddenly i was terrified of the crossing that coaster brought news from smuggler friends of tomtom and oneeye oneeye became even more dour and surly after he received them and he had reached all time lows already he even eschewed squabbling with goblin which he made a second career tomtoms death had hit him hard and would not turn loose he would not tell us what his friends had to say the captain was little better his temper was an abomination i think he both longed for and dreaded the new land the commission meant potential rebirth for the company with our sins left behind yet he had an intimation of the service we were entering he suspected the syndic had been right about the northern empire the day following the smugglers visit brought cool northern breezes fog nuzzled the skirts of the headland early in the evening shortly after nightfall coming out of that fog a boat grounded on the beach the legate had come we gathered our things and began taking leave of camp followers who had trickled out from the city our animals and equipment would be their reward for faith and friendship i spent a sad gentle hour with a woman to whom i meant more than i suspected we shed no tears and told one another no lies i left her with memories and most of my pathetic fortune she left me with a lump in my throat and a sense of loss not wholly fathomable come on croaker i muttered as i clambered down to the beach youve been through this before youll forget her before you get to opal a half dozen boats were drawn up on the strand as each filled northern sailors shoved it into the surf oarsmen drove it into the waves and in seconds it vanished into the fog empty boats came bobbing in every other boat carried equipment and possessions a sailor who spoke the language of beryl told me there was plenty of room aboard the black ship the legate had left his troops in beryl as guards for the new puppet syndic who was another red distantly related to the man we had served hope they have less trouble than we did i said and went away to brood the legate was trading his men for us i suspected we were going to be used that we were headed into something grimmer than we could imagine several times during the wait i heard a distant howl at first i thought it the song of the pillar but the air was not moving when it came again i lost all doubt my skin crawled the quartermaster the captain the lieutenant silent goblin oneeye and i waited till the last boat im not going oneeye announced as a boatswain beckoned us to board gel in the captain told him his voice was gentle that is when he is dangerous im resigning going to head south been gone long enough they shouldve forgotten me the captain jabbed a finger at the lieutenant silent goblin and me jerked his thumb at the boat oneeye bellowed ill turn the lot of you into ostriches silents hand sealed his mouth we ran him to the boat he wriggled like a snake in a firepit you stay with the family the captain said softly on three goblin squealed merrily then quickcounted the little black man arced into the boat twisting in flight he bobbed over the gunwale cursing spraying us with saliva we laughed to see him showing some spirit goblin led the charge that nailed him to a thwart sailors pushed us off the moment the oars bit water oneeye subsided he had the look of a man headed for the gallows the galley took form a looming indeterminate shape slightly darker than the surrounding darkness i heard the foghollowed voices of seamen timbers creaking tackle working long before i was sure of my eyes our boat nosed in to the fool of an accommodation ladder the howl came again oneeye tried to dive overboard we restrained him the captain applied a bootheel to his butt you had your chance to talk us out of this you wouldnt live with it oneeye slouched as he followed the lieutenant up the ladder a man without hope a man who had left a brother dead and now was being forced to approach that brothers killer upon which he was powerless to take revenge we found the company on the maindeck snuggled amongst mounds of gear the sergeants threaded the mess toward us the legate appeared i stared this was the first i had seen him afoot standing he was short for a moment i wondered if he were male at all his voices were often otherwise he surveyed us with an intensity that suggested he was reading our souls one of his officers asked the captain to fall the men in the best he could on the crowded deck the ships crew were taking up the center flats decking over the open well that ran from the bow almost to the stern and from deck level down to the lower oar bank below there was muttering clanking rattling as the oarsmen wakened the legate reviewed us he paused before each soldier pinned a reproduction of the device on his sail over each heart it was slow going we were under way before he finished the nearer the envoy approached the more oneeye shook he almost fainted when the legate pinned him i was baffled why so much emotion i was nervous when my turn came but not frightened i glanced at the badge as delicate gloved fingers attached it to my jerkin skull and circle in silver on jet elegantly crafted a valuable if grim piece of jewelry had he not been so rattled i would have thought oneeye to be considering how best to pawn it the device now seemed vaguely familiar outside the context of the sail which i had taken as showmanship and ignored hadnt i read or heard about a similar seal somewhere the legate said welcome to the service of the lady physician his voice was distracting it did not fit expectations ever this time it was musical lilting the voice of a young woman putting something over on wiser heads the lady where had i encountered that word used that way emphasized as though it was the title of a goddess a dark legend out of olden times a howl of outrage pain and despair filled the ship startled i broke ranks and went to the lip of the air well the forvalaka was in a big iron cage at the foot of the mast in the shadows it seemed to change subtly as it prowled testing every bar one moment it was an athletic woman of about thirty but seconds later it had assumed the aspect of a black leopard on its hind legs clawing the imprisoning iron i recalled the legate saying he might have a use for the monster i faced him and the memory came a devils hammer drove spikes of ice into the belly of my soul i knew why oneeye did not want to cross the sea the ancient evil of the north i thought you people died three hundred years ago the legate laughed you dont know your history well enough we werent destroyed just chained and buried alive his laughter had an hysterical edge chained buried and eventually liberated by a fool named bomanz croaker i dropped to my haunches beside oneeye who buried his face in his hands the legate the terror called soulcatcher in old tales a devil worse than any dozen forvalaka laughed madly his crewmen cringed a great joke enlisting the black company in the service of evil a great city taken and tittle villains suborned a truly cosmic jest the captain settled beside me tell me croaker so i told him about the domination and the dominator and his lady their rule had spanned an empire of evil unrivalled in hell i told him about the ten who were taken ten great wizards neardemigods in their power who had been overcome by the dominator and compelled into his service i told him about the white rose the lady general who had brought the domination down but whose power had been insufficient to destroy the dominator his lady and the ten she had interred the lot in a charmbound barrow somewhere north of the sea and now theyre restored to life it seems i said they rule the northern empire tomtom and oneeye must have suspected weve enlisted in their service taken he murmured rather like the forvalaka the beast screamed and hurled itself against the bars of its cage soulcatchers laughter drifted across the foggy deck taken by the taken i agreed the parallel is uncomfortable i had begun to shake as more and more old tales surfaced in my mind the captain sighed and stared into the fog toward the new land oneeye stared at the thing in the cage hating i tried to ease him away he shook me off not yet croaker i have to figure this what this isnt the one that killed tomtom it doesnt have the scars we put on it i turned slowly studied the legate he laughed again looking our way oneeye never figured it out and i never told him we have troubles enough chapter two raven the crossing from beryl proves my point oneeye growled over a pewter tankard the black company doesnt belong on water wench more ale he waved his tankard the girl could not understand him otherwise he refused to learn the languages of the north youre drunk i observed how perceptive will you take note gentlemen the croaker our esteemed master of the arts cleric and medical has had the perspicacity to discover that i am drunk he punctuated his speech with belches and mispronunciations he surveyed his audience with that look of sublime solemnity only a drunk can muster the girl brought another pitcher and a bottle for silent he too was ready for more of his particular poison he was drinking a sour beryl wine perfectly suited to his personality money changed hands there were seven of us altogether we were keeping our heads down the place was full of sailors we were outsiders outlanders the sort picked for pounding when the brawling started with the exception of oneeye we prefer saving our fight for when we are getting paid pawnbroker stuck his ugly face in through the street doorway his beady little eyes tightened into a squint he spotted us pawnbroker he got that name because he loansharks the company he doesnt like it but says anything is better than the moniker hung on him by his peasant parents sugar beet hey its the sweet beet oneeye roared come on over sugar baby drinks on oneeye hes too drunk to know any better he was sober oneeye is tighter than a collar of dayold rawhide pawnbroker winced looked around furtively he has that manner the captain wants you guys we exchanged glances oneeye settled down we had not seen much of the captain lately he was all the time hanging around with bigwigs from the imperial army elmo and the lieutenant got up i did too and started toward pawnbroker the barkeeper bellowed a serving wench darted to the doorway blocked it a huge dull bull of a man lumbered out of a back room he carried a prodigious gnarly club in each hogshead hand he looked confused oneeye snarled the rest of our crowd rose ready for anything the sailors smelling a riot started choosing sides mostly against us what the hell is going on i shouted please sir said the girl at the door your friends havent paid for their last round she sped the barkeeper a vicious look the hell they didnt house policy was payment on delivery i looked at the lieutenant he agreed i glanced at the barkeep sensed his greed he thought we were drunk enough to pay twice elmo said oneeye you picked this thieves den you straighten them out no sooner said than done oneeye squealed like a hog meeting the butcher a chimpsized fourarmed bundle of ugly exploded from beneath our table it charged the girl at the door left fangmarks on her thigh then it climbed all over the clubwielding mountain of muscle the man was bleeding in a dozen places before he knew what was happening a fruit bowl on a table at the rooms center vanished in a black fog it reappeared a second laterwith venomous snakes boiling over its rim the barkeeps jaw dropped and scarab beetles poured out of his mouth we made our exit during the excitement oneeye howled and giggled for blocks the captain stared at us we leaned on one another before his table oneeye still suffered the occasional spate of giggles even the lieutenant could not keep a straight face theyre drunk the captain told him were drunk oneeye agreed were palpably plausibly pukingly drunk the lieutenant jabbed him in the kidney sit down men try to behave while youre here here was a posh garden establishment socially miles above our last port of call here even the whores had titles plantings and tricks of landscaping broke the gardens into areas of semiseclusion there were ponds gazebos stone walkways and an overwhelming perfume of flowers in the air a little rich for us i remarked whats the occasion the lieutenant asked the rest of us jockeyed for seats the captain had staked out a huge stone table twenty people could have sat around it were guests act like it he toyed with the badge over his heart identifying him as receiving the protection of soulcatcher we each possessed one but seldom wore them the captains gesture suggested we correct that deficiency were guests of the taken i asked i fought the effects of the ale this should go into the annals no the badges are for the benefit of the house he gestured everyone visible wore a badge declaring an alignment with one or another of the taken i recognized a few the howler nightcrawler stormbringer the limper our host wants to enlist in the company he wants to join the black company oneeye asked whats wrong with the fool it had been years since we had taken a new recruit the captain shrugged smiled once upon a time a witchdoctor did oneeye grumbled hes been sorry ever since why is he still here i asked oneeye did not answer nobody leaves the company except feet first the outfit is home whats he like the lieutenant asked the captain closed his eyes unusual he could be an asset i like him but judge for yourselves hes here he flicked a finger at a man surveying the gardens his clothing was grey tattered and patched he was of modest height lean dusky darkly handsome i guessed him to be in his late twenties unprepossessing not really on second glance you noted something striking an intensity a lack of expression something in his stance he was not intimidated by the gardens people looked and wrinkled their noses they did not see the man they saw rags you could feel their revulsion bad enough that we had been allowed inside now it was ragpickers a grandly accoutered attendant went to show him an entrance hed obviously entered in error the man came toward us passing the attendant as if he did not exist there was a jerkiness a stiffness to his movements which suggested he was recovering from recent wounds captain good afternoon have a seat a ponderous staff general detached himself from a clutch of senior officers and svelte young women he took a few steps our way paused he was tempted to make his prejudices known i recognized him lord jalena as high as you could get without being one of the ten who were taken his face was puffed and red if the captain noticed him he pretended otherwise gentlemen this is raven he wants to join us raven isnt his birthname doesnt matter the rest of you lied too introduce yourselves and ask questions there was something odd about this raven we were his guests apparently his manner was not that of a street beggar yet he looked like a lot of bad road lord jalena arrived his breath came in wheezes pigs like him i would love to put through half what they inflict on their troops he scowled at the captain sir he said between puffs your connections are such that we cant deny you but the gardens are for persons of refinement they have been for two hundred years we dont admit the captain donned a quizzical smile mildly he replied im a guest milord if you dont like my company complain to my host he indicated raven jalena made a halfright turn sir his eyes and mouth went round you raven stared at jalena not one muscle twitched not an eyelash flickered the color fled the fat mans cheeks he glanced at his own party almost in supplication looked at raven again turned to the captain his mouth worked but no words came out the captain reached toward raven raven accepted soulcatchers badge he pinned it over his heart jalena went paler still he backed away seems to know you the captain observed he thought i was dead jalena rejoined his party he gabbled and pointed palefaced men looked our way they argued briefly then the whole lot fled the garden raven did not explain instead he said shall we get to business care to illuminate what just happened the captains voice had a dangerous softness no better reconsider your presence could endanger the whole company it wont its a personal matter i wont bring it with me the captain thought about it he is not one to intrude on a mans past not without cause he decided he had cause how can you avoid bringing it obviously you mean something to lord jalena not to jalena to friends of his its old history ill settle it before i join you five people have to die to close the book this sounded interesting ah the smell of mystery and dark doings of skullduggery and revenge the meat of a good tale im croaker any special reason for not sharing the story raven faced me obviously under rigid selfcontrol its private its old and its shameful i dont want to talk about it oneeye said in that case i cant vote for acceptance two men and a woman came down a flagstone pathway paused overlooking the place where lord jalenas party had been latecomers they were surprised i watched them talk it over elmo voted with oneeye so did the lieutenant croaker the captain asked i voted aye i smelled a mystery and did not want it to get away the captain told raven i know part of it thats why im voting with oneeye for the companys sake id like to have you but settle it before we leave the latecomers headed our way noses in the air but determined to learn what had become of their party when are you leaving raven asked how long do i have tomorrow sunrise what i demanded hold on oneeye said how come already even the lieutenant who never questions anything said we were supposed to get a couple weeks he had found a lady friend his first since i had known him the captain shrugged they need us up north the limper lost the fortress at deal to a rebel named raker the latecomers arrived one of the men demanded what became of the party in the camellia grotto his voice had a whiny nasal quality my hackles rose it reeked of arrogance and contempt i hadnt heard its like since i joined the black company people in beryl hadnt used that tone they dont know the black company in opal i told myself not yet they dont the voice hit raven like a sledge whack on the back of the head he stiffened for a moment his eyes were pure ice then a smite crinkled their cornersas evil a smite as i have ever seen the captain whispered i know why jalena suffered his attack of indigestion we sat motionless frozen by deadly imminence raven turned slowly rising those three saw his face whinyvoice choked his male companion began shaking the woman opened her mouth nothing came out where raven got the knife i do not know it went almost too fast to follow whinyvoice bled from a cut throat his friend had steel in his heart and raven had the womans throat in his left hand no please she whispered without force she expected no mercy raven squeezed forced her to her knees her face purpled bloated her tongue rolled out she seized his wrist shuddered he lifted her stared into her eyes till they rolled up and she sagged she shuddered again died raven jerked his hand away he stared at that rigid shaking claw his face was ghastly he surrendered to the allover shakes croaker the captain snapped dont you claim to be a physician yeah people were reacting the whole garden was watching i checked whinyvoice dead as a stone so was his sidekick i turned to the woman raven knelt he held her left hand there were tears in his eyes he removed a gold wedding band pocketed it that was all he took though she sported a fortune in jewelry i met his gaze over the body the ice was in his eyes again it dared me to voice my guess i dont want to sound hysterical oneeye growled but why dont we get the hell out of here good thinking elmo said and started heeling and toeing it get moving the captain snapped at me he took ravens arm i trailed raven said ill have my affairs settled by dawn the captain glanced back yeah was all he said i thought so too but we would leave opal without him the captain received several nasty messages that night his only comment was those three must have been part of the incrowd they wore the limpers badges i said whats the story on raven anyway who is he somebody who didnt get along with the limper who was done dirty and left for dead was the woman something he didnt tell you the captain shrugged i took that as an affirmative bet she was his wife maybe she betrayed him that kind of thing is common here conspiracies and assassinations and naked powergrabs all the fun of decadence the lady does not discourage anything maybe the games amuse her as we traveled north we moved ever nearer the heart of the empire each day took us into emotionally bleaker country the locals became ever more dour grim and sullen these were not happy lands despite the season the day came when we had to skirt the very soul of the empire the tower at charm built by the lady after her resurrection hardeyed cavalrymen escorted us we got no closer than three miles even so the towers silhouette loomed over the horizon it is a massive cube of dark stone it stands at least five hundred feet high i studied it all day what was our mistress like would i ever meet her she intrigued me that night i wrote an exercise in which i tried to characterize her it degenerated into a romantic fantasy next afternoon we encountered a palefaced rider galloping south in search of our company his badges proclaimed him a follower of the limper our outriders brought him to the lieutenant you people are taking your damned sweet time arent you youre wanted in forsberg quit shitting around the lieutenant is a quiet man accustomed to the respect due his rank he was so startled he said nothing the courier became more offensive then the lieutenant demanded whats your rank corpora courier to the limper buddy youd better get hauling he dont put up with no shit the lieutenant is the company disciplinarian it is a load he takes off the captain he is a reasonable just sort of guy sergeant he snapped at elmo i want you he was angry usually only the captain calls elmo sergeant elmo was riding with the captain at the time he trotted up the column the captain tagged along sir elmo asked the lieutenant halted the company flog some respect into this peasant yes sir otto crispin turn a hand here twenty strokes should do it twenty strokes it is sir what the hell do you think youre pulling no stinking hiresword is going to the captain said lieutenant i think that calls for another ten lashes yes sir elmo thirty it is sir he struck out the courier flopped out of his saddle otto and crispin picked him up and ran him to a rail fence draped him over it crispin slit the back of his shirt elmo plied the strokes with the lieutenants riding crop he did not lean into it there was no rancor in this just a message to those who thought the black company secondclass i was there with my kit when elmo finished try to relax lad im a physician ill clean your back and bandage you i patted his cheek you took it pretty good for a northerner elmo gave him a new shirt when i finished i offered some unsolicited advice on treatment then suggested report to the captain as if this hadnt happened i pointed toward the captain well friend raven had rejoined us he watched from the back of a sweaty dusty roan the messenger took my advice the captain said tell the limper im traveling as fast as i can i wont push so hard ill be in no shape to fight when i get there yes sir ill tell him sir gingerly the courier mounted his horse he concealed his feelings well raven observed the limper will cut your heart out for that the limpers displeasure doesnt concern me i thought you were going to join us before we left opal i was slow closing accounts one wasnt in the city at all lord jalena warned the other it took me three days to find him the one out of town i decided to join you instead that was not a satisfactory answer but the captain slid around it i cant let you join us while you have outside interests i let it go i repaid the most important debt he meant the woman i could taste it the captain eyed him sourly all right ride with elmos platoon thank you sir that sounded strange he was not a man accustomed to sirring anyone our northward journey continued past elm into the salient past roses and northward still into forsberg that onetime kingdom had become a bloody killingground the city oar lies in northernmost forsberg and in the forests above lies the barrowland where the lady and her lover the dominator were interred four centuries ago the stubborn necromantic investigations of wizards from oar had resurrected the lady and ten who were taken from their dark abiding dreams now their guiltridden descendants battled the lady southern forsberg remained deceptively peaceful the peasantry greeted us without enthusiasm but willingly took our money thats because seeing the ladys soldiers pay is such a novelty raven claimed the taken just grab whatever strikes their fancy the captain grunted we would have done so ourselves had we not had instructions to the contrary soulcatcher had directed us to be gentlemen he had given the captain a plump war chest the captain was willing no point making enemies needlessly we had been travelling two months a thousand miles lay behind us we were exhausted the captain decided to rest us at the edge of the war zone maybe he was having second thoughts about serving the lady anyway there is no point hunting trouble not when not fighting pays the same the captain directed us into a forest while we pitched camp he talked with raven i watched curious there was a bond developing there i could not understand it because i did not know enough about either man raven was a new enigma the captain an old one in all the years i have known the captain i have learned almost nothing about him just a hint here and there fleshed out by speculation he was born in one of the jewel cities he was a professional soldier something overturned his personal life possibly a woman he abandoned commission and titles and became a wanderer eventually he hooked up with our band of spiritual exiles we all have our pasts i suspect we keep them nebulous not because we are hiding from our yesterdays but because we think we will cut more romantic figures if we roll our eyes and dispense delicate hints about beautiful women forever beyond our reaches those men whose stories i have uprooted are running from the law not a tragic love affair the captain and raven though obviously found one another kindred souls the camp was set the pickets were out we settled in to rest though that was busy country neither contending force noticed us immediately silent was using his skills to augment the watchfulness of our sentries he detected spies hidden inside our outer picket line and warned oneeye oneeye reported to the captain the captain spread a map atop a stump we had turned into a card table after evicting me oneeye goblin and several others where are they two here two more over there one here somebody go tell the pickets to disappear well sneak out goblin wheres goblin tell goblin to get with the illusions the captain had decided not to start anything a laudable decision i thought a few minutes later he asked wheres raven i said i think he went after the spies what is he an idiot his face darkened what the hell do you want goblin squeaked like a stomped rat he squeaks at the best of times the captains outburst had him sounding like a baby bird you called for me the captain stamped in a circle growling and scowling had he the talent of a goblin or a oneeye smoke would have poured from his ears i winked at goblin who grinned like a big toad this shambling little war dance was just a warning not to trifle with him he shuffled maps he cast dark looks he wheeled on me i dont like it did you put him up to it hell no i do not try to create company history i just record it then raven showed up he dumped a body at the captains feet proffered a string of grisly trophies what the hell thumbs they count coup in these parts the captain turned green around the gills whats the body for stick his feet in the fire leave him they wont waste time wondering how we knew they were out there oneeye goblin and silent cast a glamour over the company we slipped away slick as a fish through the fingers of a clumsy fisherman an enemy battalion which had been sneaking up never caught a whiff of us we headed straight north the captain planned to find the limper late that afternoon oneeye broke into a marching song goblin squawked in protest oneeye grinned and sang all the louder hes changing the words goblin squealed men grinned anticipating oneeye and goblin have been feuding for ages oneeye always starts the scraps goblin can be as touchy as a fresh burn their spats are entertaining this time goblin did not reciprocate he ignored oneeye the little black man got his feelings hurt he got louder we expected fireworks what we got is bored oneeye could not get a rise he started sulking a bit later goblin told me keep your eyes peeled croaker were in strange country anything could happen he giggled a horsefly landed on the haunch of oneeyes mount the animal screamed reared sleepy oneeye tumbled over its tail everybody guffawed the wizened little wizard came up out of the dust cursing and swatting with his battered old hat he punched his horse with his free hand connecting with the beasts forehead then he danced around moaning and blowing on his knuckles his reward was a shower of catcalls goblin smirked soon oneeye was dozing again its a trick you learn after enough weary miles on horseback a bird settled on his shoulder he snorted swatted the bird left a huge fetid purple deposit oneeye howled he threw things he shredded his jerkin getting it off again we laughed and goblin looked as innocent as a virgin oneeye scowled and growled but did not catch on he got a glimmer when we crested a hill and beheld a band of monkeysized pygmies busily kissing an idol reminiscent of a horses behind every pygmy was a miniature oneeye the little wizard turned a hideous look on goblin goblin responded with an innocent dont look at me shrug point to goblin i judged better watch yourself croaker oneeye growled or youll be doing the kissing right here he patted his fanny when pigs fly he is a more skilled wizard than goblin or silent but not half what he would have us believe if he could execute half his threats he would be a peril to the taken silent is more consistent goblin more inventive oneeye would lie awake nights thinking of ways to get even for goblins having gotten even a strange pair i do not know why they have not killed one another finding the limper was easier said than done we trailed him into a forest where we found abandoned earthworks and a lot of rebel bodies our path tilted downward into a valley of broad meadows parted by a sparkling stream what the hell i asked goblin thats strange wide low black humps pimpled the meadows there were bodies everywhere thats one reason the taken are feared killing spells their heat sucked the ground up i stopped to study a hump the blackness could have been drawn with a compass the boundary was as sharp as a penstroke charred skeletons lay within the black swordblades and spearheads looked like wax imitations left too long in the sun i caught oneeye staring when you can do this trick youll scare me if i could do that id scare myself i checked another circle it was a twin of the first raven reined in beside me the limpers work ive seen it before i sniffed the wind maybe i had him in the right mood when was that he ignored me he would not come out of his shell would not say hello half the time let alone talk about who or what he was he is a cold one the horrors of that valley did not touch him the limper lost this one the captain decided hes on the run do we keep after him the lieutenant asked this is strange country were in more danger operating alone we followed a spoor of violence a swath of destruction ruined fields fell behind us burned villages slaughtered people and butchered livestock poisoned wells the limper left nothing but death and desolation our brief was to help hold forsberg joining the limper was not mandatory i wanted no part of him i did not want to be in the same province as the devastation grew more recent raven showed elation dismay introspection easing into determination and ever more of that rigid selfcontrol he so often hid behind when i reflect on my companions inner natures i usually wish i controlled one small talent i wish i could look inside them and unmask the darks and brights that move them then i take a quick look into the jungle of my own soul and thank heaven that i cannot any man who barely sustains an armistice with himself has no business poking around in an alien soul i decided to keep closer watch on our newest brother we did not need doughbelly coming in from the point to tell us we were close all the forward horizon sprouted tall leaning trees of smoke this part of forsberg was flat and open and marvelously green and against the turquoise sky those oily pillars were an abomination there was not much breeze the afternoon promised to be scorching doughbelly swung in beside the lieutenant elmo and i stopped swapping tired old lies and listened doughbelly indicated a smoke spire still some of the limpers men in that village sir talk to them no sir longhead didnt think youd want us to hes waiting outside town how many of them twenty twentyfive drunk and mean the officer was worse than the men the lieutenant glanced over his shoulder ah elmo its your lucky day take ten men and go with doughbelly scout around shit elmo muttered he is a good man but muggy spring days make him lazy okay otto silent peewee whitey billygoat raven i coughed discreetly youre out of your head croaker all right he did a quick count on his fingers called three more names we formed outside the column elmo gave us the onceover to make sure we hadnt forgotten our heads lets go we hurried forward doughbelly directed us into a woodlot overlooking the stricken town longhead and a man called jolly waited there elmo asked any developments jolly who is professionally sarcastic replied the fires are burning down we looked at the village i saw nothing that did not turn my stomach slaughtered livestock slaughtered cats and dogs the small broken forms of dead children not the kids too i said without realizing i was speaking not the babies again elmo looked at me oddly not because he was unmoved himself but because i was uncharacteristically sympathetic i have seen a lot of dead men i did not enlighten him for me there is a big difference between adults and kids elmo i have to go in there dont be stupid croaker what can you do if i can save one kid raven said ill go with him a knife appeared in his hand he must have learned that trick from a conjurer he does it when he is nervous or angry think you can bluff twentyfive men raven shrugged croaker is right elmo its got to be done some things you dont tolerate elmo surrendered well all go pray they arent so drunk they cant tell friend from foe raven started riding the village was goodsized there had been more than two hundred homes before the limpers advent half were burned or burning bodies littered the streets flies clustered round their sightless eyes nobody of military age i noted i dismounted and knelt beside a boy of four or five his skull had been smashed but he was breathing raven dropped beside me nothing i can do i said you can end his ordeal there were tears in ravens eyes tears and anger theres no excuse for this he moved to a corpse lying in shadow this one was about seventeen he wore the jacket of a rebel mainforcer he had died fighting raven said he must have been on leave one boy to protect them he pried a bow from lifeless fingers bent it good wood a few thousand of these could rout the limper he slung the bow and appropriated the boys arrows i examined another two children they were beyond help inside a burned hut i found a grandmother who had died trying to shield an infant in vain raven exuded disgust creatures like the limper create two enemies for every one they destroy i became aware of muted weeping and of cursing and laughter somewhere ahead lets see what that is beside the hut we found four dead soldiers the lad had left his mark good shooting raven observed poor fool fool he shouldve had the sense to run mightve gone easier on everyone his intensity startled me what did he care about a boy from the other side dead heroes dont get a second chance aha he was drawing a parallel with an event in his own mysterious past the cursing and weeping resolved into a scene fit to disgust anyone tainted with humanity there were a dozen soldiers in the circle laughing at their own crude jokes i remembered a bitch dog surrounded by males who contrary to custom were not fighting for mounting rights but were taking turns they might have killed her had i not intervened raven and i mounted up the better to see the victim was a child of nine welts covered her she was terrified yet making no sound in a moment i understood she was a mute war is a cruel business prosecuted by cruel men the gods know the black company are no cherubim but there are limits they were making an old man watch he was the source of both curses and weeping raven put an arrow into a man about to assault the girl dammit elmo yelled raven the soldiers turned on us weapons appeared raven loosed another arrow it dropped the trooper holding the old man the limpers men lost any inclination to fight elmo whispered whitey go tell the old man to haul ass over here one of the limpers men took a like notion he scampered off raven let him run the captain would have his behind on a platter he did not seem concerned old timer come here bring the child and get some clothes on her part of me could not help but applaud but another part called raven a fool elmo did not have to tell us to watch our backs we were painfully aware that we were in big trouble hurry whitey i thought their messenger reached their commander first he came tottering up the street doughbelly was right he was worse than his men the old timer and girl clung to ravens stirrup the old man scowled at our badges elmo nudged his mount forward pointed at raven i nodded the drunken officer stopped in front of elmo dull eyes assayed us he seemed impressed we have grown hard in a rough trade and look it you he squealed suddenly exactly the way whinyvoice had done in opal he stared at raven then he spun ran raven thundered stand still lane take it like a man you gutless thief he snatched an arrow from his quiver elmo cut his bowstring lane stopped his response was not gratitude he cursed he enumerated the horrors we could expect at the hand of his patron i watched raven he stared at elmo in cold fury elmo faced it without flinching he was a hard guy himself raven did his knife trick i tapped his blade with my swordtip he mouthed one soft curse glared relaxed elmo said you left your old life behind remember raven nodded once sharply its harder than i thought his shoulders sagged run away lane youre not important enough to kill a clatter rose behind us the captain was coming that little wart of the limpers puffed up and wriggled like a cat about to pounce elmo glared at him down the length of his sword he got the hint raven muttered i should know better anyway hes only a butt boy i asked a leading question it drew a blank stare the captain rattled up what the hell is going on elmo began one of his terse reports raven interrupted yon sot is one of zouads jackals i wanted to kill him elmo and croaker stopped me zouad where had i heard that name connected with the limper colonel zouad the limpers number one villain political liaison among other euphemisms his name had occurred in a few overheard conversations between raven and the captain zouad was ravens intended fifth victim then the limper himself must have been behind ravens misfortunes curiouser and curiouser also scarier and scarier the limper is not anybody to mess with the limpers man shouted i want this man arrested the captain gave him a look he murdered two of my men the bodies were there in plain sight raven said nothing elmo stepped out of character and volunteered they were raping the child their idea of pacification the captain stared at his opposite number the man reddened even the blackest villain will feel shame if caught unable to justify himself the captain snapped croaker we found one dead rebel captain indications were this sort of thing started before he became a factor he asked the sot these people are subjects of the lady under her protection the point might be arguable in other courts but at the moment it told by his lack of a defense the man confessed a moral guilt you disgust me the captain used his soft dangerous voice get out of here dont cross my path again ill leave you to my friends mercy if you do the man stumbled away the captain turned to raven you motherlorn fool do you have any idea what youve done wearily raven replied probably better than you do captain but id do it again and you wonder why we dragged our feet taking you on he shifted subject what are you going to do with these people noble rescuer that question had not occurred to raven whatever the upheaval in his life it had left him living entirely in the present he was compelled by the past and oblivious to the future theyre my responsibility arent they the captain gave up trying to catch the limper operating independently now seemed the lesser evil the repercussions began four days later we had just fought our first significant battle having crushed a rebel force twice our size it had not been difficult they were green and our wizards helped not many escaped the battlefield was ours the men were looting the dead elmo myself the captain and a few others were standing around feeling smug oneeye and goblin were celebrating in their unique fashion taunting one another through the mouths of corpses goblin suddenly stiffened his eyes rolled up a whine slipped past his lips rose in pitch he crumpled oneeye reached him a step ahead of me began slapping his cheeks his habitual hostility had vanished give me some room i growled goblin wakened before i could do more than check his pulse soulcatcher he murmured making contact at mat moment i was glad i did not own goblins talents having one of the taken inside my mind seemed a worse violation than rape captain i called soulcatcher i stayed close the captain ran over he never runs unless we are in action what is it goblin sighed his eyes opened hes gone now his skin and hair were soaked with sweat he was pale he started shaking gone the captain demanded what the hell we helped goblin get comfortable the limper went to the lady instead of coming at us head on theres bad blood between him and soulcatcher he thinks we came out here to undermine him he tried to turn the tables but soulcatcher is in high favor since beryl and the limper isnt because of his failures the lady told him to leave us alone soulcatcher didnt get the limper replaced but he figures he won the round goblin paused oneeye handed him a long drink he drained it in an instant he says stay out of the limpers way he might try to discredit us somehow or even steer the rebel toward us he says we should recapture the fortress at deal that would embarrass the rebel and the limper both elmo muttered he wants flashy why dont he have us round up the circle of eighteen the circle is the rebel high command eighteen wizards who think that between them they have what it takes to challenge the lady and the taken raker the limpers nemesis in forsberg belonged to the circle the captain looked thoughtful he asked raven you get the feeling theres politics involved the company is soulcatchers tool thats common knowledge the puzzle is what he plans to do with it i got that feeling in opal politics the ladys empire purports to be monolithic the ten who were taken expend terrible energies keeping it that way and spend as much more squabbling among themselves like toddlers fighting over toys or competing for mothers affection is that it the captain grumbled thats it he says hell keep in touch so we went and did it we captured the fortress at deal in the dead of night within howling distance of oar they say both raker and the limper flew into insane rages i figure soulcatcher ate that up oneeye flipped a card into the discard pile he muttered somebodys sandbagging goblin snapped the card up spread four knaves and discarded a queen he grinned you knew he was going down next time holding nothing heavier than a deuce oneeye smacked the tabletop hissed he hadnt won a hand since sitting down go low guys elmo warned ignoring goblins discard he drew scrunched his cards around just inches from his face spread three fours and discarded a deuce he tapped his remaining pair grinned at goblin said that better be an ace chubby pickles snagged elmos deuce spread four of a kind discarded a trey he plied goblin with an owllike stare that dared him to go down it said an ace would not keep him from getting burned i wished raven were there his presence made oneeye too nervous to cheat but raven was on turnip patrol which is what we called the weekly mission to oar to purchase supplies pickles had his chair pickles is company quartermaster he usually went on turnip patrol he begged off this one because of stomach troubles looks like everybody was sandbagging e said and glared at a hopeless hand pair of sevens pair of eights and a nine to go with one of the eights but no run almost everything i could use was in the discard pile i drew sumbitch another nine and it gave me a run i spread it dumped the off seven and prayed prayer was all that could help oneeye ignored my seven he drew damn he dumped a six on the bottom of my straight and discarded a six the moment of truth porkchop he told goblin you going to try pickles and these forsbergers are crazy ive never seen anything like them we had been in the fortress a month it was a little big for us but i liked it i could get to like them i said if they could just learn to like me we had beaten off four counterattacks already shit or get off the pot goblin you know you got me and elmo licked pickles ticked the corner of his card with his thumbnail stared at goblin he said theyve got a whole rebel mythos up here prophets and false prophets prophetic dreams sendings from the gods even a prophecy that a child somewhere around here is a reincarnation of the white rose if the kids already here how come hes not pounding on us elmo asked they havent found him yet or her they have a whole tribe of people out looking goblin chickened he drew sputtered discarded a king elmo drew and discarded another king pickles looked at goblin he smiled a small smile took a card did not bother looking at it he tossed a five onto the six oneeye had dumped on my run and flipped his draw into the discard pile a five goblin squeaked you were holding a five i dont believe it he had a five he slapped his ace onto the tabletop he had a damned five temper temper elmo admonished youre the guy whos always telling oneeye to simmer down remember he bluffed me with a damned five pickles wore that little smile as he stacked his winnings he was pleased with himself he had pulled a good bluff i would have bet he was holding an ace myself oneeye shoved the cards to goblin deal oh come on he was holding a five and i got to deal too its your turn shut up and shuffle i asked pickles whered you hear that reincarnation stuff flick flick was the old man raven had saved pickles had overcome the old mans defenses they were getting thick the girl went by the name darling she had taken a big shine to raven she followed him around and drove the rest of us crazy sometimes i was glad raven had gone to town we would not see much of darling till he got back goblin dealt i checked my cards the proverbial hand so bad it could not make a foot damned near one of elmos fabled pismo straights or no two cards of the same suit goblin looked his over his eyes got big he slapped them down face upward tonk goddammed tonk fifty he had dealt himself five royal cards an automatic win demanding a double payoff the only way he can win is deal them to himself oneeye grumped goblin chortled you aint winning even when you deal maggot lips elmo started shuffling the next hand went the distance pickles fed us snippets of the reincarnation story between plays darling wandered by her round freckled face blank her eyes empty i tried imagining her in the white rose role i could not she did not fit pickles dealt elmo tried to go down with eighteen oneeye burned him he held seventeen after his draw i raked the cards in started shuffling come on croaker oneeye taunted lets dont fool around im on a streak one in a row deal me them aces and deuces fifteen and under is an automatic win same as fortynine and fifty oh sorry i caught myself taking this rebel superstition seriously pickles observed its a persuasive sort of nonsense it hangs together in a certain elegant illusion of hope i frowned his way his smile was almost shy its hard to lose when you know fate is on your side the rebel knows anyway thats what raven says our grand old man was getting close to raven then well have to change their thinking cant whip them a hundred times and theyll keep on coming and because of that theyll fulfill their own prophecy elmo grunted then we have to do more than whip them we have to humiliate them we meant everybody on the ladys side i flipped an eight into another of the countless discard piles which have become the milemarks of my life this is getting old i was restless i felt an undirected urge to be doing something anything elmo shrugged playing passes the time this is the life all right goblin said sit around and wait how much of that have we done over the years i havent kept track i grumbled more of that than anything else hark elmo said i hear a little voice it says my flock are bored pickles break out the archery butts and his suggestion died under an avalanche of groans rigorous physical training is elmos prescription for ennui a dash through his diabolical obstacle course kills or cures pickles extended his protest beyond the obligatory groan im gonna have wagons to unload elmo those guys should be back any time you want these clowns to exercise give them to me elmo and i exchanged glances goblin and oneeye looked alert not back yet they should have been in before noon i figured they were sleeping it off turnip patrol always came back wasted i figured they were in elmo said goblin flipped his hand at the discard pile his cards danced for a moment suspended by his trickery he wanted us to know he was letting us off i better check this out oneeyes cards slithered across the table humping like inchworms til look into it chubby i called it first toad breath i got seniority both of you do it elmo suggested he turned to me ill put a patrol together you tell the lieutenant he tossed his cards in started calling names he headed for the stables hooves pounded the dust beneath a continuous grumbling drumbeat we rode swiftly but warily oneeye watched for trouble but performing sorceries on horseback is difficult still he caught a whiff in time elmo fluttered hand signals we split into two groups ploughed into the tall roadside weeds the rebel popped up and found us at his throat he never had a chance we were travelling again in minutes oneeye told me i hope nobody over there starts wondering why we always know what theyre going to try let them think theyre up to their asses in spies how did a spy get the word to deal so fast our luck looks too good to be true the captain should get soulcatcher to pull us out while we still have some value he had a point once our secret got out the rebel would neutralize our wizards with his own our luck would take a header the walls of oar hove into view i started getting the queasy regrets the lieutenant hadnt really approved this adventure the captain himself would ream me royal his cussing would scorch the hair off my chin i would be old before the restrictions ran out so long madonnas of the streetside i was supposed to know better i was halfway an officer the prospect of careers cleaning the company stables and heads did not intimidate elmo or his corporals forward they seemed to be thinking onward for the glory of the band yech they were not stupid just willing to pay the price of disobedience that idiot oneeye actually started singing as we entered oar the song was his own wild nonsensical composition sung in a voice utterly incapable of carrying a tune can it oneeye elmo snarled youre attracting attention his order was pointless we were too obviously who we were and just as obviously were in vile temper this was no turnip patrol we were looking for trouble oneeye whooped his way into a new song can the racket elmo thundered get on your goddamned job we turned a corner a black fog formed around our horses fetlocks as we did moist black noses poked up andout and sniffed the fetid evening air they wrinkled maybe they had become as countrified as i out came almond eyes glowing like the lamps of hell a susurrus of fear swept the pedestrians watching from the streetsides up they sprang a dozen a score five score phantoms born in that snakepit oneeye calls a mind they streaked ahead weasely toothy sinuous black things that darted at the people of oar terror outpaced them in minutes we shared the streets with no one but ghosts this was my first visit to oar i looked it over like i had just come in on the pumpkin wagon well look hereelmo said as we turned into the street where the turnip patrol usually quartered heres old cornie i knew the name though not the man cornie kept the stable where the patrol always stayed an old man rose from his seat beside a watering trough heared you was coming he said done all what i could elmo couldnt get them no doctor though we brought our own though cornie was old and had to hustle to keep pace elmo did not slow down i sniffed the air it held a taint of old smoke cornie dashed ahead around an angle in the street weasel things flashed around his legs like surf foaming around a boulder on the shore we followed and found the source of the smoke smell someone had fired cornies stable then jumped our guys as they ran out the villains wisps of smoke still rose the street in front of the stable was filled with casualties the least injured were standing guard rerouting traffic candy who commanded the patrol limped toward us where do i start i asked he pointed those are the worst better begin with raven if hes still alive my heart jumped raven he seemed so invulnerable oneeye scattered his pets no rebel would sneak up on us now i followed candy to where raven lay the man was unconscious his face was paperwhite he the worst the only one i thought wouldnt make it you did all right did the tourniquets the way i taught you didnt you i looked candy over you should be lying down yourself back to raven he had close to thirty cuts on his face side some of them deep i threaded my needle elmo joined us after a quick look around the perimeter bad he asked cant tell for sure hes full of holes lost a tot of blood better have oneeye make up some of his broth oneeye makes an herb and chicken soup that will bring new hope to the dead he is my only assistant elmo asked how did it happen candy they fired the stable and jumped us when we ran out i can see that cornie muttered the filthy murderers i got the feeling he was mourning his stable more than the patrol though elmo made a face like a man chewing on a green persimmon and no dead raven is the worst thats hard to believe one dead candy corrected the old guy ravens sidekick from that village flick elmo growled flick was not supposed to have left the fortress at deal the captain did not trust him but elmo overlooked that breach of regulations were going to make somebody sorry they started this he said there wasnt a bit of emotion in his voice he might have been quoting the wholesale price of yams i wondered how pickles would take the news he was fond of flick darling would be shattered flick was her grandfather they were only after raven cornie said thats why he got cut so bad and candy flick threw himself in their way he gestured all the rest of this is because we wouldnt stand back elmo asked the question puzzling me why would the rebel be that hot to get raven doughbelly was hanging around waiting for me to get to the gash in his left forearm he said it wasnt rebels elmo it was that dumbshit captain from where we picked up flick and darling i swore you stick to your needlepoint croaker elmo said you sure doughbelly sure im sure ask jolly he seen him too the rest was just street thugs we whipped them good once we got going he pointed near the unburned side of the stable were a dozen bodies stacked like cordwood flick was the only one i recognized the others wore ragged local costume candy said i saw him too elmo and he wasnt top dog there was another guy hanging around back in the shadows he cleared out when we started winning cornie had been hanging around looking watchful and staying quiet he volunteered i know where they went place over to bleek street i exchanged glances with oneeye who was putting his broth together using this and that from a black bag of his own looks like cornie knows our crowd i said know you well enough to know you dont want nobody getting away with nothing like this i looked at elmo elmo stared at cornie there always was some doubt about the stablekeeper cornie got nervous elmo like any veteran sergeant has a baleful stare finally oneeye take this fellow for a walk get his story oneeye had cornie under hypnosis in seconds the two of them roamed around chatting like old buddies i shifted my attention to candy that man in the shadows did he limp wasnt the limper too tall even so the attack would have had the spooks blessing right elmo elmo nodded soulcatcher would get severely pissed if he figured it out the okay to risk that had to come from the top something like a sigh came out of raven i looked down his eyes were open a crack he repeated the sound i put my ear next to his lips zouad he murmured zouad the infamous colonel zouad the enemy he had renounced the limpers special villain ravens knighterrantry had generated vicious repercussions i told elmo he did not seem surprised maybe the captain had passed ravens history on to his platoon leaders oneeye came back he said friend cornie works for the other team he grinned a malific grin the one he practices so he can scare kids and dogs thought you might want to take that into consideration elmo oh yes elmo seemed delighted i went to work on the man next worse off more sewing to do i wondered if i would have enough suture the patrol was in bad shape how long till we get some of that broth oneeye still got to come up with a chicken elmo grumbled so have somebody go steal one oneeye said the people we want are holed up in a bleek street dive theyve got some rough friends what are you going to do elmo i asked i was sure he would do something raven had put us under obligation by naming zouad he thought he was dying he would not have named the name otherwise i knew him that well if i didnt know anything about his past weve got to arrange something for the colonel you go looking for trouble youre going to find it remember who he works for bad business letting somebody get away with hitting the company croaker even the limper thats taking pretty high policy on your own shoulders isnt it i could not disagree though a defeat on the battlefield is acceptable this was not the same this was empire politics people should be warned that it could get hairy if they dragged us in the limper and soulcatcher had to be shown i asked elmo what kind of repercussions do you figure on one hell of a lot of pissing and moaning but i dont reckon theres much they can do hell croaker it aint your no nevermind anyway you get paid to patch guys up he stared at cornie thoughtfully i reckon the fewer witnesses left over the better the limpet cant scream if he cant prove nothing oneeye you go on talking to your pet rebel there i got a nasty little idea shaping up in the back of my head maybe he has the key oneeye finished dishing out his soup the earliest partakers had more color in their cheeks already elmo stopped paring his nails he skewered the stablekeeper with a hard stare cornie you ever hear of colonel zouad cornie stiffened he hesitated just a second too long cant say as i have thats odd figured you would have hes the one they call the limpers left hand anyway i figure the circle would do most anything to lay hands on him what do you think i dont know nothing about the circle elmo he gazed out over the rooftops you telling me this fellow over to bleek is this zouad elmo chuckled didnt say that at all cornie did i give that impression croaker hell no what would zouad be doing hanging around a crummy whorehouse in oar the limper is up to his butt in trouble over east hed want all the help he could get see cornie but look here maybe i do know where the circle could find the colonel now him and the company aint no friends on the other hand we aint friends with the circle neither but thats business no hard feelings so i was thinking maybe we could trade a favor for a favor maybe some bigtime rebel could drop by that place in bleek street and tell the owners he dont think they ought to be looking out for those guys you see what i mean if it was to go that way colonel zouad just might drop into the circles lap cornie got the look of a man who knows he is trapped he had been a good spy when we had had no reason to worry about him he had been just plain old cornie friendly stablekeeper whom we had tipped a little extra and talked around no more nor less than anyone else outside the company he had been under no pressure he hadnt had to be anything but himself you got me all wrong elmo honest i dont never get involved in politics the lady or the whites its all the same to me horses need feeding and stabling no matter who rides them reckon youre right there cornie excuse me for being suspicious elmo winked at oneeye thats the amador where those fellows are staying elmo you better go over there before somebody tells them youre in town me id better start getting this place cleaned up were in no hurry cornie but you go ahead with whatever youve got to do cornie eyed us he went a few steps toward what was left of his stable he looked us over elmo considered him blandly oneeye lifted his horses left foreleg to check its hoof cornie ducked into the ruin oneeye elmo asked right on out the back heeling and toeing elmo grinned keep your eye on him croaker take notes i want to know who he tells and who they tell we gave him something that ought to spread like the clap zouad was a dead man from the minute raven named his name i told oneeye maybe from the minute he did whatever it was back when oneeye grunted discarded candy picked up and spread oneeye cursed i cant play with these guys croaker they dont play right elmo galloped up the street dismounted theyre moving in on that whorehouse got something for me oneeye the list was disappointing i gave it to elmo he cursed spat cursed again he kicked the planks we were using as a card table pay attention to your damned jobs oneeye controlled his temper theyre not making mistakes elmo theyre covering their asses comic has been around us too long to trust elmo stomped around and breathed fire all right backup plan number one we watch zouad see where they take him after they grab him well rescue him when hes about ready to croak wipe out any rebels around the place then hunt down anybody who checked in there i observed youre determined to show a profit arent you damned straight hows raven looks like hell pull through the infection is under control and oneeye says hes started to heal uhn oneeye i want rebel names lots of names yes sir boss sir oneeye produced an exaggerated salute it became an obscene gesture when elmo turned away push those planks together doughbelly i suggested your deal oneeye he did not respond he did not bitch or gripe or threaten to turn me into a newt he just stood there numb as death eye barely cracked elmo elmo got in front of him and stared from six inches away he snapped his fingers under oneeyes nose oneeye did not respond what do you think croaker something is happening at that whorehouse oneeye did not move a muscle for ten minutes then the eye opened unglazed and he relaxed like a wet rag elmo demanded what the hell happened give him a minute will you i snapped oneeye collected himself the rebel got zouad but not before he contacted the limper uhm the spook is coming to help him elmo turned a pale shade of grey here to oar yep oh shit indeed the limper was the nastiest of the taken think fast elmo hell trace our part in it cornie is the cutout link oneeye you find that old shit whitey still pokey got a job for you he gave instructions pokey grinned and stroked his dagger bloodthirsty bastard i cannot adequately portray the unease oneeyes news generated we knew the limper only through stories but those stories were always grim we were scared soulcatchers patronage was no real protection against another of the taken elmo punched me hes doing it again sure enough oneeye was stiff but this time he went beyond rigidity he toppled began thrashing and foaming at the mouth hold him i ordered elmo give me that baton of yours a half dozen men piled on oneeye small though he was he gave them a ride what for elmo asked ill put it in his mouth so he doesnt chew his tongue oneeye matte the weirdest sounds ive ever heard and i have heard plenty on battlefields wounded men make noises you would swear could not come from a human throat the seizure lasted only seconds after one final violent surge oneeye lapsed into a peaceful slumber okay croaker what the hell happened i dont know the falling sickness give him some of his own soup somebody suggested serve him right a tin cup appeared we forced its contents down his throat his eye clicked open what are you trying to do poison me feh what was that boiled sewage your soup i told him elmo jumped in what happened oneeye spat he grabbed a nearby wineskin sucked a mouthful gargled spat again soulcatcher happened thats what whew i feel for goblin now my heart started skipping every third beat a nest of hornets swarmed in my gut first the limper now soulcatcher so what did the spook want elmo demanded he was nervous too he is not usually impatient he wanted to know what the hell is going on he heard the limper was all excited he checked with goblin all goblin knew was that we headed here so he climbed into my head and was amazed at all the wide open space now he knows everything you know eh yes obviously oneeye did not like the idea elmo waited several seconds well well what oneeye covered his grin by pulling on the wineskin dammit what did he say oneeye chuckled he approves of what were doing but he thinks were showing all the finesse of a bull in rut so were getting a little help what kind of help elmo sounded like he knew things were out of control but could not see where hes sending somebody elmo relaxed so did i as long as the spook himself stayed away how soon i wondered aloud maybe sooner than wed like elmo muttered lay off the wine oneeye you still got to watch zouad oneeye grumbled he went into that semitrance that means he is looking around somewhere else he was gone a long time so elmo growled when oneeye came out of it he kept looking around like he expected soulcatcher to pop out of thin air so take it easy theyve got him tucked away in a secret subbasement about a mile south of here elmo was as restless as a little boy with a desperate need to pee whats the matter with you i asked a bad feeling just a bad bad feeling croaker his roving gaze came to rest his eyes got big i was right oh damn i was right it looked as tall as a house and half as wide it wore scarlet bleached by time motheaten and tattered it came up the street in a sort of shamble now fast now slow wild stringy grey hair tangled around its head its bramble patch of a beard was so thick and matted with filth that its face was all but invisible one pallid liverspotted hand clutched a pole of a staff that was a thing of beauty defiled by its bearers touch it was an immensely elongated female body perfect in every detail someone whispered they say that was a real woman back during the domination they say she cheated on him you could not blame the woman not if you gave shifter a good look shapeshifter is soulcatchers closest ally among the ten who were taken his enmity for the limper is more virulent than our patrons the limper was the third corner in the triangle explaining shifters staff he stopped a few feet away his eyes burned with an insane fire that made them impossible to meet i cannot recall what color they were chronologically he was the first great wizardking seduced suborned and enslaved by the dominator and his lady shaking oneeye stepped out front im the wizard he said catcher told me shifters voice was resonant and deep and big for even a man of his size developments ive traced zouad nothing else shifter scanned us again some folks were doing a fade he smiled behind his facial brush down at the bend in the street civilians were gathering to gape oar had not yet seen any of the ladys champions this was the citys lucky day two of the maddest were in town shifters gaze touched me for an instant i felt his cold contempt i was a sour stench in his nostrils he found what he was looking for raven he moved forward we dodged the way small males duck the dominant baboon at the zoo he stared at raven for several minutes then his vast shoulders hunched in a shrug he placed the toes of his staff on ravens chest i gasped ravens color improved dramatically he stopped sweating his features relaxed as the pain faded his wounds formed angry red scar tissue which faded to the white of old scars in minutes we gathered in a tighter and tighter circle awed by the show pokey came trotting up the street hey elmo we did it whats going on he got a look at shifter squeaked like a caught mouse elmo had himself together again wheres whitey and still getting rid of the body body shifter asked elmo explained shifter grunted this cornie will become the basis of our plan you he speared oneeye with a sausagesized finger where are those men predictably oneeye located them in a tavern you shifter indicated pokey tell them to bring the body back here pokey got grey around the edges you could see the protests piling up inside him but he nodded gulped some air and trotted off nobody argues with tile taken i checked ravens pulse it was strong he looked perfectly healthy as diffidently as i could i asked could you do that for the others while were waiting he gave me a look i thought would curdle my blood but he did it what happened what are you doing here raven frowned up at me then it came back to him he sat up zouad he looked around youve been out for two days they carved you up like a goose we didnt think youd make it he felt his wounds whats going on croaker i ought to be dead soulcatcher sent a friend shifter he fixed you up he had fixed everybody it was hard to stay terrified of a guy who would do that for your outfit raven surged to his feet wobbled dizzily that damned cornie he set it up a knife appeared in his hand damn im weak as a kitten i had wondered how cornie could know so much about the attackers that isnt cornie there raven cornie is dead thats shifter practicing to be cornie he did not need practice he was cornie enough to fool cornies mother raven settled back beside me whats going on i brought him up to date shifter wants to go in using cornie as credentials they probably trust him now ill be right behind him he might not like that i dont care what he likes zouad isnt getting out of it this time the debt is too big his face softened and saddened hows darling she hear about flick yet i dont think so nobodys been back to deal elmo figures he can do whatever he wants here as long as he dont have to face the captain till its over good i wont have to argue it with him shifter isnt the only taken in town i reminded him shifter had said he sensed the limper raven shrugged the limper did not matter to him the cornie simulacrum came toward us we rose i was shaky but did note that raven grew a shade paler good he wasnt a cold stone all the time you will accompany me he told raven he eyed me and you and the sergeant they know elmo i protested and he grinned you will appear to be rebels only one of the circle would detect the deception none of them are in oar the rebel here is independently minded we will take advantage of his failure to summon support the rebel is as plagued by personality politics as is our side shifter beckoned oneeye status of colonel zouad he hasnt cracked hes tough raven said begrudging the compliment you getting any names elmo asked me i had a nice list elmo was pleased wed better go shifter said before limper strikes oneeye gave us the passwords scared convinced i was not ready for this more convinced that i did not dare contest shifters selections i trudged along in the takens wake i dont know when it happened i just glanced up and found myself walking with strangers i gobbled at shifters back raven laughed i understood then shifter had cast his glamour over us we now appeared to be captains of the rebel persuasion who are we i asked shifter indicated raven harden of the circle rakers brotherinlaw they hate one another the way catcher and limper hate one another next elmo field major reef hardens chief of staff you hardens nephew motrin hanin as vicious an assassin as ever lived we had heard of none of them but shifter assured us their presence would not be questioned harden was in and out of forsberg all the time making life tough for his wifes brother right i thought fine and dandy and what about the limper what do we do if he shows up the people at the place where they were holding zouad were more embarrassed than curious when cornie announced harden they had not deferred to the circle they did not ask questions apparently the real harden possessed a vile volatile unpredictable temper show them the prisoner shifter said one rebel gave shifter a look that said just you wait cornie the place was packed with rebels i could almost hear elmo thinking out his plan of attack they took us down into a basement through a cleverly concealed doorway and down deeper still into a room with earthen walls and ceiling supported by beams and timbers the decor came straight out of a fiends imagination torture chambers exist of course but the mass of men never see them so they never really believe in them id never seen one before i surveyed the instruments looked at zouad there strapped into a huge bizarre chair and wondered why the lady was considered such a villain these people said they were the good guys fighting for the right liberty and the dignity of the human spirit but in method they were no better than the limper shifter whispered to raven raven nodded i wondered how we would get our cues shifter had not rehearsed us much these people would expect us to act like harden and his cutthroats we seated ourselves and observed the interrogation our presence inspired the questioners i closed my eyes raven and elmo were less disturbed after a few minutes harden ordered major reef to go handle some piece of business i do not recall the excuse i was distracted its purpose was to put elmo back on the street so he could start the roundup shifter was winging it we were supposed to sit tight till he cued us i gathered we would make our move when elmo closed in and panic started seeping down from above meantime we would watch colonel zouads demolition the colonel was not that impressive but then the torturers had had him a while i expect anyone would look hollow and shrunken after enduring their mercies we sat like three idols i sent mental hurryups to elmo i had been trained to take pleasure in the healing not the breaking of human flesh even raven seemed unhappy doubtless he had fantasized torments for zouad but when it came to the actuality his basic decency triumphed his style was to stick a knife in a man and have done the earth lurched as if stomped by a huge boot soil fell from the walls and overhead the air filled with dust earthquake somebody yelled and the rebels all scrambled for the stair shifter sat still and smiled the earth shuddered again i fought the instinct of the herd and remained seated shifter was not worried why should i be he pointed at zouad raven nodded rose went over the colonel was conscious and lucid and frightened by the quaking he looked grateful when raven started unbuckling him the great foot stamped again earth fell in one corner a supporting upright toppled a trickle of loose soil began running into the basement the other beams groaned and shifted i barely controlled myself sometime during the tremor raven stopped being harden shifter stopped being cornie zouad looked them over and caught on his face hardened went pale as if he had more to fear from raven and shapeshifter than from the rebel yeah raven said its payoff time the earth bucked overhead there was a remote rumble of falling masonry lamps toppled and went out the dust made the air almost unbreathable and rebels came tumbling back down the stair looking over their shoulders limper is here shifter said he did not seem displeased he rose and faced the stair he was cornie again and raven was harden once more rebels piled into the room i lost track of raven in the press and poor light somebody sealed the door up top the rebels got quiet as mice you could almost hear hearts hammering as they watched the stair and wondered if the secret entrance were well enough hidden despite several yards of intervening earth i heard something moving through the basement above dragthump dragthump the rhythm of a crippled man walking my gaze too locked on the secret door the earth shook its most violent yet the doorway exploded inward the far end of the subbasement caved in men screamed as the earth swallowed them the human herd shoved this way and that in search of an escape that did not exist only shifter and i were not caught up in it we watched from an island of calm all the lamps had died the only light came from the gap at the head of the stair sliding around a silhouette which at that moment seemed vile just in its stance i had cold clammy skin and violent shakes it was not just because i had heard so much about the limper he exuded something that made me feel like an arachnophobe might if you dropped a big hairy spider into his lap i glanced at shifter he was cornie just another of the rebel crew did he have some special reason for not wanting to be recognized by the limper he did something with his hands a blinding light filled the pit i could not see i heard beams creaking and giving way this time i did not hesitate i joined the rush to the stair i suppose the limper was more startled than anyone else he had not expected any serious opposition shifters trick caught him off guard the rush swept over him before he could protect himself shifter and i were the last up the stair i skipped over the limper a small man in brown who did not look terrible at all as he writhed on the floor i looked for the stair to the street level shifter grabbed my arm his grip was undeniable help me he planted a boot against the limpers ribs started rolling him through the entrance to the subbasement down below men groaned and cried out for help sections of floor on our level were sagging collapsing more in fear that i would be trapped if we did not hurry than out of any desire to inconvenience the limper i helped shifter dump the taken into the pit shifter grinned gave me a thumbs up he did something with his fingers the collapse accelerated he seized my arm and headed for the stairs we piled into the street amidst the grandest uproar in oars recent history the foxes were in the henhouse men were running hither and yon yelling incoherently elmo and the company were all around them driving them inward cutting them down the rebels were too confused to defend themselves had it not been for shifter i suppose i would not have survived that he did something that turned the points of arrows and swords cunning beast that i am i stayed in his shadow till we were safely behind company lines it was a great victory for the lady it exceeded elmos wildest hopes before the dust settled the purge had taken virtually every committed rebel in oar shifter stayed in the thick of it he gave us invaluable assistance and had a grand time smashing things up he was as happy as a child starting fires then he disappeared as utterly as if he had never existed and we so exhausted we were crawling around like lizards assembled outside comics stable elmo took the roll all accounted for but one wheres raven elmo asked i told him i think he got buried when that house fell in him and zouad both oneeye observed kind of fitting ironic but fitting hate to see him go though he played a mean game of tonk the limper is down there too elmo asked i grinned i helped bury him and shifter is gone i had begun to sense a disturbing pattern i wanted to know if it was just my imagination i brought it up while the men were getting ready to return to deal you know the only people who saw shifter were on our side the rebel and the limper saw a lot of us especially of you elmo and me and raven cornie will turn up dead i have a feeling shifters finesse didnt have much to do with getting zouad or wiping out the local rebel hierarchy i think we were put on the spot where the limper is concerned very craftily elmo likes to come across as a big dumb country boy turned soldier but he is sharp he not only saw what i meant he immediately connected it with the broader picture of politicking among the taken weve got to get the hell away from here before the limper digs his way out and i dont mean just away from oar i mean forsberg soulcatcher has put us on the board as his frontline pawns were liable to get caught between a rock and a hard place he chewed his lip for a second then started acting like a sergeant bellowing at anybody not moving fast enough to suit him he was in a near panic but was a soldier to the bone our departure was no rout we went out escorting the provision wagons candys patrol had come to collect he told me ill go crazy after we get back ill go out and chew down a tree or something and after a few miles thoughtfully been trying to decide who ought to break the news to darling croaker you just volunteered youve got the right touch so i had me something to keep my mind occupied during the ride damn that elmo the great brouhaha in oar was not the end of it ripples spread consequences piled up fate shoved its badfinger in raker launched a major offensive while the limper was digging his way out of the rubble he did so unaware that his enemy was absent from the field but the effect was the same the limpers army collapsed our victory went for naught rebel bands whooped through oar hunting the ladys agents we thanks to soulcatchers foresight were moving south when the collapse came so we avoided becoming involved we went into garrison at elm credited with several dramatic victories and the limper fled into the salient with the remnants of his force branded as an incompetent he knew who had done him in but there wasnt anything he could do his relationship with the lady was too precarious he dared do nothing but remain her faithful lapdog he would have to come up with some outstanding victories before he thought about settling with us or soulcatcher i did not feel that comforted the worm has a way of turning given time raker was so enthusiastic over his success that he did not slow down after he conquered forsberg he turned southward soulcatcher ordered us out of elm only a week after we had settled in did the captain get upset about what had happened was he displeased because so many of his men had gone off on their own exceeding or stretching his instructions lets just say the extra duty assignments were enough to break the back of an ox lets say the madonnas of the night in elm were severely disappointed in the black company i do not want to think about it the man is a diabolic genius the platoons were on review the wagons were loaded and ready to roll the captain andlieutenant were conferring with their sergeants oneeye and goblin were playing some sort of game with little shadow creatures making war in the comers of the compound most of us were watching and betting this way or that depending on shifts of fortune the gateman shouted rider coming in nobody paid any attention messengers came and went all day the gate swung inward and darling began clapping her hands she ran toward the gateway through it looking as rough as the day we had met him rode our raven he scooped up darling and gave her a big hug perched her astride his mount before him and reported to the captain i heard him say that all his debts were paid and that he no longer had any interests outside the company the captain stared at him a long time then nodded and told him to take his place in ranks he had used us and while doing so had found himself a new home he was welcome to the family we rode out bound for a new garrison in the salient chapter three raker the wind tumbled and bumbled and howled around meystrikt arctic imps giggled and blew their frigid breath through chinks in the walls of my quarters my lamplight flickered and danced barely surviving when my fingers stiffened i folded them round the flame and let them toast the wind was a hard blow out of the north gritty with powdered snow a foot had fallen during the night more was coming it would bring more misery with it i pitied elmo and his gang they were out rebel hunting meystrikt fortress pearl of the salient defenses frozen in winter swampy in spring an oven in summer white rose prophets and rebel mainforcers were the least of our troubles the salient is a long arrowhead of flatland pointing south between mountain ranges meystrikt lies at its point it funnels weather and enemies down onto the stronghold our assignment is to hold this anchor of the ladys northern defenses why the black company we are the best the rebel infection began seeping through the salient soon after the fall of forsberg the limper tried to stop it and failed the lady set us to clean up the limpers mess her only other option was to abandon another province the gate watch sounded a trumpet elmo was coming in there was no rush to greet him the rules call for casualness for a pretense that your guts are not churning with dread instead men peeped from hidden places wondering about brothers who had gone ahunting anybody lost anyone bad hurt you know them better than kin you had fought side by side for years not all of them were friends but they were family the only family you had the gateman hammered ice off the windlass shrieking its protests the portcullis rose as company historian i could go greet elmo without violating the unwritten rules fool that i am i went out into the wind and chill a sorry lot of shadows loomed through the blowing snow the ponies were dragging their riders slumped over icy manes animals and men hunched into themselves trying to escape the winds scratching talons clouds of breath smoked from mounts and men and were ripped away this in painting form would have made a snowman shiver of the whole company only raven ever saw snow before this winter some welcome to service with the lady the riders came closer they looked more like refugees than brothers of the black company icediamonds twinkled in elmos mustache rags concealed the rest of his face the others were so bundled i could not tell who was who only silent rode resolutely tall he peered straight ahead disdaining that pitiless wind elmo nodded as he came through the gate wed started to wonder i said wonder means worry the rules demand a show of indifference hard travelling howd it go black company twentythree rebel zip no work for you croaker except jojo has a little frostbite you get raker rakers dire prophecies skilled witchcraft and battlefield cunning had made a fool of the limper the salient had been ready to collapse before the lady ordered us to take over the move had sent shock waves throughout the empire a mercenary captain had been assigned forces and powers usually reserved for one of the ten salient winter being what it was only a shot at raker himself made the captain field this patrol elmo bared his face and grinned he was not talking he would just have to tell it again for the captain i considered silent no smile on his long dreary face he responded with a slight jerk of his head so another victory that amounted to failure raker had escaped again maybe he would send us scampering after the limper squeaking mice who had grown too bold and challenged the cat still chopping twentythree men out ofthe regional rebel hierarchy counted for something not a bad days work in fact better than any the limper turned in men came for the patrols ponies others set out mulled wine and warm food in the main hall i stuck with elmo and silent their tale would get told soon enough meystrikts main hall is only slightly less draughty than its quarters i treated jojo the others attacked their meals feast complete elmo silent oneeye and knuckles convened around a small table cards materialized oneeye scowled my way going to stand there with your thumb in your butt croaker we need a mark oneeye is at least a hundred years old the annals mention the wizened little black mans volcanic tempers throughout the last century there is no telling when he joined seventy years worth of annals were lost when the companys positions were overrun at the battle of urban oneeye refuses to illuminate the missing years he says he does not believe in history elmo dealt five cards to each player and a hand to an empty chair croaker oneeye snapped you going to squat nope sooner or later elmo is going to talk i tapped my pen against my teeth oneeye was in rare form smoke poured out of his ears a screaming bat popped out of his mourn he seems annoyed i observed the others grinned baiting oneeye is a favorite pastime oneeye hates field work and hates missing out even more elmos grins and silents benevolent glances convinced him he had missed something good elmo redistributed his cards peered at them from inches away silents eyes glittered no doubt about it they had a special surprise raven took the seat they had offered me no one objected even oneeye never objects to anything raven decides to do raven colder than our weather since oar a dead soul now maybe he can make a man shudder with a glance he exudes a stench of the grave and yet darling loves him pale frail ethereal she kept one hand on his shoulder while he ordered his cards she smiled for him raven is an asset in any game including oneeye oneeye cheats but never when raven is playing she stands in the tower gazing northward her delicate hands are clasped before her a breeze steals softly through her window it stirs the midnight silk of her hair tear diamonds sparkle on the gentle curve of her cheek hoowee oh wow author author may a sow litter in your bedroll willie those characters got a howl out of my fantasies about the lady the sketches are a game i play with myself hell for all they know my inventions might be on the mark only the ten who were taken ever see the lady who knows if she is ugly beautiful or what tear diamonds sparkling eh oneeye said i like that figure shes pining for you croaker knock it off i dont make fun of your games the lieutenant entered seated himself regarded us with a black scowl lately his mission in life has been to disapprove his advent meant the captain was on his way elmo folded his hand composed himself the place fell silent men appeared as if by magic bar the damned door oneeye muttered they keep stumbling in like this ill freeze my ass off play the hand out elmo the captain came in took his usual seat lets hear it sergeant the captain is not one of our more colorful characters too quiet too serious elmo laid his cards down tapped their edges into alignment ordered his thoughts he can become obsessed with brevity and precision sergeant silent spotted a picket line south of the farm captain we circled north attacked after sunset they tried to scatter silent distracted raker while we handled the others thirty men we got twentythree we yelled a lot about not letting our spy get hurt we missed raker sneaky makes this outfit work we want the rebel to believe his ranks are shot with informers that hamstrings his communications and decisionmaking and makes life less chancy for silent oneeye and goblin the planted rumor the small frame the touch of bribery or blackmail those are the best weapons we opt battle only when we have our opponents mousetrapped at least ideally you returned directly to the fortress yes sir after burning the farmhouse and outbuildings raker concealed his trail well the captain considered the smokedarkened beams overhead only oneeyes snapping of his cards broke the silence the captain dropped his gaze then pray why are you and silent grinning like a pair of prize fools oneeye muttered proud they came home emptyhanded elmo grinned some more but we didnt silent dug inside his filthy shirt produced the small leather bag that always hangs on a thong around his neck his trick bag it is filled with noxious oddiments like putrefied bats ears or elixir of nightmare this time he produced a folded piece of paper he cast dramatic glances at oneeye and goblin opened the packet fold by fold even the captain left his seat crowded the table behold said elmo taint nothing but hair heads shook throats grumbled somebody questioned elmos grasp on reality but oneeye and goblin had three big coweyes between them oneeye chirruped inarticulately goblin squeaked a few times but then goblin always squeaks is it really his he managed at last really his elmo and silent radiated the smugness of eminently successful conquistadors absodamnlutely elmo said right off the top of his bean we had that old man by the balls and he knew it he was heeling and toeing it out of mere so fast he smacked his noggin on a doorframe saw it myself and so did silent left these on the beam whoo that gaffer can step and goblin an octave above his usual rusty hinge squall dancing in his excitement said gents weve got him hes as good as hanging on a meathook right now the big one he meowed at oneeye what do you think of mat you sorry little spook a herd of miniscule lightning bugs poured out of oneeyes nostrils good soldiers all they fell into formation spelling out the words goblin is a poof their little wings hummed the words for the benefit of the illiterate there is no truth to that canard goblin is thoroughly heterosexual oneeye was trying to start something goblin made a gesture a great shadowfigure like soulcatcher but tall enough to brush the ceiling beams bent and skewered oneeye with an accusing finger a sourceless voice whispered it was you that corrupted the lad sodder oneeye snorted shook his head shook his head and snorted his eye glazed goblin giggled stifled himself giggled again he spun away danced a wild victory jig in front of the fireplace our less intuitive brethen grumbled a couple of hairs with those and two bits silver you could get rolled by the village whores gentlemen the captain understood the shadowshow ceased the captain considered h wizards he thought he paced he nodded to himself finally he asked oneeye are they enough oneeye chuckled an astonishingly deep sound for s small a man one hair sir or one nail paring is enough sir we have him goblin continued his weird dance silent kept grinning raving lunatics the lot of them the captain thought some more we cant handle this ourselves he circled the hall his pacing portentous well have to bring in one of the taken one of the taken naturally our three sorcerers are i most precious resource they must be protected but cold stole in and froze us into statues one of the lady shadow disciples one of those dark lords here no not the limper hes got a hardon for us shifter gives me the creeps nightcrawler is worse how the hell do you know you never seen him oneeye said we can handle it captain and rakers cousins would be on you like flies on horseapple soulcatcher the lieutenant suggested he is our patron more or less the suggestion carried the captain said contact him oneeye be ready to move when he gets here oneeye nodded grinned he was in love already tricky nasty plots were afoot in his twisted mind it should have been silents game really the captain gave it to oneeye because he cannot come to grips wit silents refusal to talk that scares him for some reason silent did not protest some of our native servants are spies we know who they are thanks to oneeye and goblin one who knew nothing about the hair was allowed to flee with the news that we were setting up an espionage headquarters in the free city roses when you have the smaller battalions you learn guile every ruler makes enemies the lady is no exception the sons of the white rose are everywhere if one chooses sides on emotion then the rebel is the guy to go with he is fighting for everything men claim to honor freedom independence truth the right all the subjective illusions all the eternal triggerwords we are minions of the villain of the piece we confess the illusion and deny the substance there are no selfproclaimed villains only regiments of selfproclaimed saints victorious historians rule where good or evil lies we abjure labels we fight for money and an indefinable pride the politics the ethics the moralities are irrelevant oneeye had contacted soulcatcher he was coming goblin said the old spook howled with glee he smelled a chance to raise his stock and scuttle that of the limper the ten squabble and backbite worse than spoiled children winter relaxed its siege briefly the men and native staff began clearing meystrikts courtyards one of the natives disappeared in the main hall oneeye and silent looked smug over their cards the rebel was being told exactly what they wanted whats happening on the wall i asked elmo had rigged block and tackle and was working a crenel stone loose whatre you going to do with that block a little sculpture croaker ive taken up a new hobby so dont tell me see if i care take that attitude if you want i was going to ask if you could go after raker with us so you could put it in the annals right with a word about oneeyes genius credit where credit is due croaker then silent is due a chapter isnt he he sputtered he grumbled he cursed you want to play a hand they had only three players one of whom was raven tonk is more interesting with four or five i won three hands straight dont you have anything to do a wart to cut off or something you asked him to play a kibitzing soldier observed you like flies otto flies going to turn you into a frog if you dont shut your mouth otto was not impressed you couldnt turn a tadpole into a frog i snickered you asked for it oneeye when is soulcatcher going to show when he gets here i nodded there is no apparent rhyme or reason to the way the taken do things regular cheerful charlies today arent we how much has he lost otto otto just smirked raven won the next two hands oneeye swore off talking so much for discovering the nature of his project probably for the best an explanation never made could not be overheard by the rebels spies six hairs and a block of limestone what the hell for days silent goblin and oneeye took turns working that stone i visited the stable occasionally they let me watch and growl when they would not answer questions the captain too sometimes poked his head in shrugged and went back to his quarters he was juggling strategies for a spring campaign which would throw all available imperial might against the rebel his rooms were impenetrable so thick were the maps and reports we meant to hurt the rebel some once the weather turned cruel it may be but most of us enjoy what we doand the captain more than anyone this is a favorite game matching wits with a raker he is blind to the dead to the burning villages to the starving children as is the rebel two blind armies able to see nothing but one another soulcatcher came in the deep hours amidst a blizzard which beggared the one elmo endured the wind wailed and howled snow drifted against the northeast comer of the fortress battlementhigh and spilled over wood and hay stores were becoming a concern locals said it was the worst blizzard in history at its height soulcatcher came the boomboomboom of his knock awakened all meystrikt horns sounded drums rolled the gatehouse watch screeched against the wind they could not opn the gate soulcatcher came over the wall via the drift he fell nearly vanished in the loose snow in the forecourt hardly a dignified arrival for one of the ten i hurried to the main hall oneeye silent and goblin were there already with the fire blazing merrily the lieutenant appeared followed by the captain elmo and raven came with the captain send the rest back to bed the lieutenant snapped soulcatcher came in removed a heavy black greatcloak squatted before the fire a calculatedly human gesture i wondered soulcatchers slight body is always sheathed in black leather he wears that headhiding black morion and the black gloves and black boots only a couple of silver badges break the monotony the only color about him is the uncut ruby forming the pommel of his dagger a fivetaloned claw clutches the gem to the handle of the weapon small soft curves interrupt the flatness of soulcatchers chest there is a feminine flair to his hips and legs three of the taken are female but which are which only the lady knows we call them all he their sex wont ever mean a thing to us soulcatcher claims to be our friend our champion even so his presence brought a different chill to the hall the cold of him has nothing to do with climate even oneeye shivers when he is around and raven i do not know raven seems incapable of feeling anymore except where darling is concerned someday that great stone face is going to break i hope i am there to see it soulcatcher turned his back to the fire so highpitched fine weather for an adventure baritone strange sounds followed laughter the taken had made a joke nobody laughed we were not supposed to laugh soulcatcher turned to oneeye tell me this in tenor slow and soft with a muffled quality as if it were coming through a thin wall or as elmo says from beyond the grave there was no bluster or showman in oneeye now well start from the beginning captain the captain said one of our informants caught wind of a meeting of the rebel captains oneeye goblin and silent followed the movements of known rebels you let them run around loose they lead us to their friends of course one of the limpers shortcomings no imagination he kills them where he finds themalong with everyone else in sight again that weird laughter less effective yes there was another sentence but in no language i know the captain nodded elmo elmo told his part as he had before word for word he passed the tale to oneeye who sketched a scheme for taking raker i did not understand but soulcatcher caught it instantly he laughed a third time i gathered we were going to unleash the dark side of human nature oneeye took soulcatcher to see his mystery stone we moved closer to the fire silent produced a deck there were no takers sometimes i wonder how the regulars stay sane they are around the taken all the time soulcatcher is a sweetheart compared to the others oneeye and soulcatcher returned laughing two of a kind elmo muttered in a rare statement of opinion soulcatcher recaptured the fire well done gentlemen very well done imaginative this could break them in the salient we start for roses when the weather breaks a party of eight captain including two of your witch men each sentence was followed by a break each was in a different voice weird i have heard those are the voices of all the people whose souls soulcatcher has caught bolder than my wont i volunteered for the expedition i wanted to see how raker could be taken with hair and a block of limestone the limper had failed with all his furious power the captain thought about it okay croaker oneeye and goblin you elmo and pick two more thats only seven captain raven makes eight oh raven of course of course quiet deadly raven would be the captains alterego the bond between those men surpasses understanding guess it bothers me because raven scares the i out of me lately raven caught the captains eye his right eyebrow rose the captain replied with a ghost of a nod raven twitched a shoulder what was the message i could not guess something unusual was in the wind those in the know found it delicious though i could not guess what it was i knew it would be slick and nasty the storm broke soon the roses road was open soulcatcher fretted raker had two weeks start it would take us a week to reach roses oneeyes planted tales might lose their efficacy before we arrived we left before dawn the limestone block aboard a wagon the wizards had done little but carve out a modest declivity the size of a large melon i could not fathom its value oneeye and goblin fussed over it like a groom over a new bride oneeye answered my questions with a big grin bastard the weather held fair warm winds blew out of the south we encountered long stretches of muddy road and i witnessed an outrageous phenomenon soulcatcher got down in the mud and dragged that wagon with the rest of us that great lord of the empire roses is the queen city of the salient a teeming sprawl a free city a republic the lady has not seen fit to revoke its traditional autonomy the world needs places where men of all stripes and stations can step outside the usual strictures so roses owning no master filled with agents and spies and those who live on the dark side of the law in that environment oneeye claimed his scheme had to prosper roses red walls loomed over us dark as old blood in the light of the setting sun when we arrived goblin ambled into the room we had taken i found the place he squeaked at oneeye good curious they had not exchanged a cross word in weeks usually an hour without a squabble was a miracle soulcatcher shifted in the shadowed corner where he remained planted like a lean black bush a crowd softly debating with itself go on its an old public square a dozen alleys and streets going in and out poorly lighted at night no reason for any traffic after dark sounds perfect oneeye said it is i rented a room overlooking it lets take a look elmo said we all suffered from cabin fever an exodus started only soulcatcher stayed put perhaps he understood our need to get away goblin was right about the square apparently so what i asked oneeye grinned i snapped clamlips play games tonight goblin asked oneeye nodded if the old spook says go im getting frustrated i announced whats going on ah you clowns do is play cards and watch raven sharpen his knives that went on for hours at a time the movement of whetstone across steel sending chills down my spine it was an omen raven does not do that unless he expects the situation to get nasty oneeye made a sound like a cawing crow we rolled the wagon at midnight the stablekeeper called us madmen oneeye gave him one of his famous grins he drove the rest of us walked surrounding the wagon there had been changes something had been added someone had incised the stone with a message one eye probably during one of his unexplained forays out of headquarters bulky leather sacks and a stout plank table had joined the stone the table looked capable of bearing the block its legs were of a dark polished wood inlaid in them were symbols in silver and ivory very complex hieroglyphical mystical where did you get the table i asked goblin squeaked laughed i growled why the hell cant you tell me now okay oneeye said chuckling nastily we made it what for to sit our rock on youre not telling me anything patience croaker ah in due time bastard there was a strangeness about our square it was foggy there had been no fog anywhere else oneeye stopped the wagon in the squares center out with that table boys out with you goblin squawked think you can malinger your way through this he wheeled on elmo damned old cripples always got an excuse hes got a point oneeye oneeye protested elmo snapped get your butt down off there oneeye glared at goblin going to get you someday chubbo curse of impotence how does that sound goblin was not impressed id put a curse of stupidity on you if i could improve on nature get the damned table down elmo snapped you nervous i asked he never gets riled at their fussing treats it as part of the entertainment yeah you and raven get up there and push that table was heavier than it looked it took all of us to get it off the wagon oneeyes faked grunts and curses did not help i asked him how he got it on built it there dummy he said then fussed at us wanting it moved a half inch this way then a half inch that let it be soulcatcher said we dont have time for this his displeasure had a salutory effect neither goblin nor oneeye said another word we slid the stone onto the table i stepped back wiped sweat from my face i was soaked in the middle of winter that rock radiated heat the bags soulcatcher said that voice sounded like a woman i would not mind meeting i grabbed one grunted it was heavy hey this is money oneeye snickered i heaved the sack into the pile under the table a damned fortune there i had never seen so much in one place in fact cut the bags soulcatcher ordered hurry it up raven slashed the sacks treasure dribbled onto the cobblestones we stared lusting in our hearts soulcatcher caught oneeyes shoulder took goblins arm both wizards seemed to shrink they faced table and stone soulcatcher said move the wagon i still had not read the immortal message they had carved on the rock i darted in for a look let he who would claim this wealth seat the head of the creature raker within this throne of stone ah aha plainspoken straightforward simple just our style ha i stepped back tried to guess the magnitude of soulcatchers investment i spied gold amidst the hill of silver one bag leaked uncut gems the hair soulcatcher demanded oneeye produced the strands soulcatcher thumbed them into the walls of the headsized cavity he stepped back joined hands with oneeye and goblin they made magic treasure table and stone began to shed a golden glow our archfoe was a dead man half the world would try to collect this bounty it was too big to resist his own people would turn on him i saw one slim chance for him he could steal the treasure himself tough job though no rebel prophet could outmagic one of the taken they completed their spellcasting somebody test it oneeye saidthere was a vicious crackle when ravens daggertip pricked the plane of the tablelegs he cursed scowled at his weapon elmo thrust with his sword crackle the tip of his blade glowed white excellent soulcatcher said take the wagon away elmo detailed a man the rest of us fled to the room goblin had rented at first we crowded the window willing something to happen that palled fast roses did not discover the doom we had set for raker till sunrise cautious entrepreneurs found a hundred ways to go after that money crowds came just to see one enterprising band started tearing up the street to dig under police ran them off soulcatcher took a seat beside the window and never moved once he told me have to modify the spells i didnt anticipate this much ingenuity surprised at my own audacity i asked whats the lady like i had just finished one of my fantasy sketches he turned slowly stared briefly something that will bite steel his voice was female and catty an odd answer then have to keep them from using tools so much for getting an eyewitness report i should have known better we mortals are mere objects to the taken our curiosities are of supreme indifference i retreated to my secret kingdom and its spectrum of imaginary ladies soulcatcher modified the ward sorceries that night next morning there were corpses in the square oneeye wakened me the third night got a customer hunh a guy with a head he was pleased i stumbled to the window goblin and raven were there already we crowded one side nobody wanted to get too close to soulcatcher a man stole across the square below a head dangled from his left hand he carried it by its hair i said i wondered how long it would be before this started silence soulcatcher hissed hes out there who he was patient remarkably patient another of the taken would have struck me down raker dont give us away i do not know how he knew maybe i would not want to find out those things scare me a sneak visit was in the scenario goblin whispered squeaking how can he squeak when he whispers raker has to find out what hes up against he cant do that from anywhere else the fat little man seemed proud the captain calls human nature our sharpest blade curiosity and a will to survive drew raker into our cauldron maybe he would turn it on us we have a lot of handles sticking out ourselves weeks passed raker came again and again apparently content to observe soulcatcher told us to let him be no matter how easy a target he made of himself our mentor might be considerate of us but he has his cruel streak it seemed he wanted to torment raker with the uncertainty of his fate this berg is going bountycrazy goblin squealed he danced one of his jigs you ought to get out more croaker theyre turning raker into an industry he beckoned me into the corner farthest from soulcatcher opened a wallet look here he whispered he had a double fistful of coins some were gold i observed youre going to be walking tilted to one side he grinned goblin grinning is a sight to behold made this selling tips on where to find raker he whispered with a glance toward soulcatcher bogus tips he put a hand on my shoulder he had to stretch up to do it you can get rich out there i didnt know we were in this to get rich he scowled his round pale face becoming all wrinkles what are you some kind of soulcatcher turned goblin croaked just an argument about a bet sir just a bet i laughed aloud really convincing chubbo why not just hang yourself he pouted but not for long goblin is irrepressible his humor breaks through in the most depressing situations he whispered shit croaker you should see what oneeye is doing selling amulets guaranteed to tell if theres a rebel close by a glance toward soulcatcher they really work too sort of i shook my head at least hell be able to pay his card debts that was oneeye all over he had had it rough at meystrikt where there was no room for his usual forays into he black market you guys axe supposed to be planting rumors keeping the pot boiling not sshh he glanced at soulcatcher again we are every dive in town hell the rumor mill is berserk out there come on i ii show you no soulcatcher was talking more and more i had hopes of inveigling a real conversation your loss i know a bookmaker taking bets on when raker will lose his head you got inside dope you know scoot out of here before you lose yours i went to the window a minute later goblin scampered across the square below he passed our trap without glancing its way let them play their games soulcatcher said sir my new approach brownnosing my ears are sharper than your friend realizes i searched the face of that black morion trying to capture some hint of the thoughts behind the metal its of no consequence he shifted slightly stared past me the underground is paralyzed by dismay sir the mortar in that house is rotting itll crumble soon that would not have happened had we taken raker immediately they would have made a martyr of him the loss would have saddened them but they would have gone on the circle would have replaced raker in time for the spring campaigns i stared into the plaza why was soulcatcher telling me this and all in one voice was it the voice of the real soulcatcher because you thought i was being cruel for crueltys sake i jumped how did you soulcatcher made a sound which passed as laughter no i didnt read your mind i know how minds work i am the catcher of souls remember do the taken get lonely do they yearn for simple companionship friendship sometimes this in one of the female voices a seductive one i halfturned then faced the square quickly frightened soulcatcher read that too he went back to raker simple elimination was never my plan i want the hero of forsberg to discredit himself soulcatcher knew our enemy better than we suspected raker was playing his game already he had made two spectacular vain attempts on our trap those failures had ruined his stock with fellowtravelers to hear tell roses seethed with proempire sentiment hell make a fool of himself then well squash him like a noxious beetle dont underestimate him what audacity giving advice to one of the taken the limper that i wont do im not the limper he and raker are two of a kind in the old times the dominator would have made him one of us what was he like get him talking croaker from the dominator it is only one step to the lady soulcatchers right hand rolled palm upward opened slowly made a claw the gesture rattled me i imagined that claw ripping at my soul end of conversation later on i told elmo you know that thing out there didnt have to be real anything would have done the job if the mob couldnt get to it soulcatcher said wrong raker had to know it was real next morning we heard from the captain news mostly a few rebel partisans were surrendering their weapons in response to an amnesty offer some mainforcers who had come south with raker were pulling out the confusion had reached the circle rakers failure in roses worried them whys that i asked nothing has really happened soulcatcher replied its happening on the other side in peoples minds was there a hint of smugness there raker and by extension the circle looks impotent he should have yielded the salient to another commander if i was a bigtime general i probably wouldnt admit to a screwup either i said croaker elmo gasped amazed i do not speak my mind usually its true elmo can you picture any generalours or theirsasking somebody to take over for him that black morion faced me their faith is dying an army without faith in itself is beaten more surely than an army defeated in battle when soulcatcher gets on a subject nothing deflects him i had a funny feeling he might be the type to yield command to someone better able to exercise it we tighten the screws now all of you tell it in the taverns whisper it in the streets burn him drive him push him so hard he doesnt have time to think i want him so desperate he tries something stupid i thought soulcatcher had the right idea this fragment of the ladys war would not be won on any battlefield spring was at hand yet fighting had not yet begun the eyes of the salient were locked on the free city awaiting the outcome of this duel between raker and the ladys champion soulcatcher observed its no longer necessary to kill raker his credibility is dead now were destroying the confidence of his movement he resumed his vigil at the window elmo said captain says the circle ordered raker out he wouldnt go he revolted against his own revolution he wants to beat this trap another facet of human nature working for our side overweening pride get some cards out goblin and oneeye have been robbing widows and orphans again time to clean them out raker was on his own hunted haunted a whipped dog running the alleys of the night he could trust no one i felt sorry for him almost he was a fool only a fool keeps betting against the odds the odds against raker were getting longer by the hour i jerked a thumb at the darkness near the window sounds like a convening of the brotherhood of whispers raven glanced over my shoulder said nothing we were playing head to head tonk a dull timekiller of a game a dozen voices murmured over there i smell it youre wrong its in from the south end it now not yet its time needs a while longer pushing our luck the game could turn ware pride its here the stench of it runs before it like the breath of a jackal wonder if he ever loses an argument with himself still raven said nothing in my more daring moods i have been trying to draw him out without luck i was doing better with soulcatcher soulcatcher rose suddenly an angry noise rising from deep inside him what is it i asked i was tired of roses i was disgusted with roses roses bored and frightened me it was worth a mans life to go into those streets alone one of those spook voices was right we were approaching a point of diminishing returns i was developing a grudging admiration for raker myself the man refused to surrender or run what is it i asked again the limper hes in roses here why he smells a big kill he wants to steal the credit you mean muscle in on our action thats his style wouldnt the lady this is roses shes a long way off and she doesnt care who gets him politics among the ladys viceroys it is a strange world i do not understand people outside the company we lead a simple life no thinking required the captain takes care of that we just follow orders for most of us the black company is a hiding place a refuge from yesterday a place to become a new man what do we do i asked ill handle the limper he began seeing to his apparel goblin and oneeye staggered in they were so drunk they had to prop each other up shit goblin squeaked snowing again goddamned snow i thought winter was over oneeye burst into song something about the beauties of winter i could not follow him his speech was slurred and he had forgotten half the words goblin fell into a chair forgetting oneeye oneeye collapsed at his feet he vomited on goblins boots tried to continue his song goblin muttered where the hell is everybody out carousing around i exchanged looks with raven do you believe this those two getting drunk together where you going old spook goblin squeaked at soulcatcher soulcatcher went out without answering bastard hey oneeye old buddy that right old spook a bastard oneeye levered himself off the floor looked around i dont think he was seeing with the eye he had sright he scowled at me bassard all bassard something struck him funny he giggled goblin joined him when raven and i did not get the joke he put on a very dignified face and said not our kind in here old buddy warmer out in the snow he helped oneeye stand they staggered out the door hope they dont do anything stupid more stupid like show off theyll kill themselves tonk raven said he spread his cards those two might not have come in for all the response he showed ten or fifty hands later one of the soldiers we had brought burst in you seen elmo he demanded i glanced at him snow was melting in his hair he was pale scared no what happened hagop somebody stabbed otto i think it was raker i run him off stabbed he dead i started looking for my kit otto would need me more than he would need elmo no hes cut bad lot of blood why didnt you bring him couldnt carry him he was drunk too the attack on his friend had sobered him some but that would not last you sure it was raker was the old fool trying to hit back sure hey croaker come on hes gonna die tm coming im coming wait raven was pawing through his gear im going he balanced a pair of finelyhoned knives debating a choice he shrugged stuck both inside his belt get yourself a cloak croaker its cold out there while i found one he grilled hagop about ottos whereabouts told him to stay put till elmo showed then lets go croaker down the stairs into the streets ravens walk is deceptive he never seems hurried but you have to hustle to stay up snowing was not the half of it even where the streets were lighted you could not see twenty feet it was six inches deep already heavy wet stuff but the temperature was falling and a wind was coming up another blizzard damn hadnt we had enough we found otto a quarter block from where he was supposed to be he had dragged himself under some steps raven went right to him how he knew where to look i will never know we carried otto to the nearest light he could not help himself he was out i snorted dead drunk only danger was freezing to death he had blood all over him but his wound was not bad needed some stitches that is all we lugged him back to the room i stripped him and got sewing while he was in no shape to bitch ottos sidekick was asleep raven kicked him till he woke up i want the truth raven said how did it happen hagop told it insisting it was raker man it was raker i doubted that so did raven but when i finished my needlepoint raven said get your sword croaker he had the hunter look i did not want to go out again but even less did i want to argue with raven when he was in that mood i got my swordbelt the air was colder the wind was stronger the snowflakes were smaller and more biting when they hit my cheek i stalked along behind raven wondering what the hell we were doing he found the place where otto was knifed new snow had not yet obliterated the marks on the old raven squatted stared i wondered what he saw there was not enough light to tell anything so far as i could see maybe he wasnt lying he said at last he stared into the darkness of the alley whence the attacker had come how do you know he did not tell me come on he stalked into the alley i do not like alleys i especially do not like them in cities like roses where they harbor every evil known to man and probably a few still undiscovered but raven was going in raven wanted my help raven was my brother in the black company but damned a hot fire and warm wine would have been nicer i do not think i spent more than three or four hours exploring the city raven had gone out less than i had yet he seemed to know where he was going he led me up side streets and down alleys across thoroughfares and over bridges roses is pierced by three rivers and a web of canals connect them the bridges are one of roses claims to fame bridges did not intrigue me at the moment i was preoccupied with keeping up and trying to stay warm my feet were hunks of ice snow kept getting into my boots and raven was in no mood to stop every time that happened on and on miles and hours i never saw so many slums and stews stop raven flung an arm across my path what quiet he listened i listened i did not hear a thing i had not seen much during our headlong rush either how could raven be tracking ottos assailant i did not doubt that he was i just could not figure it truth told nothing raven did surprised me nothing had since the day i watched him strangle his wife were almost up with him he peered into the blowing snow go straight ahead the pace weve been going youll catch him in a couple blocks what wherere you going i was carping at a fading shadow damn you i took a deep breath cursed again drew my sword and started forward all i could think was how am i going to explain if weve got the wrong man then i saw him in the light from a tavern door a tail lean man shuffling dispiritedly oblivious to his surroundings raker how would i know elmo and otto were the only ones who had been along on the farm raid came the dawn only they could identify raker for the rest of us otto was wounded and elmo had not been heard from where was he under a blanket of snow in some alley cold as this hideous night my fright retreated before anger i sheathed my sword and drew a dagger i kept it hidden inside my cloak the figure ahead did not glance back as i overtook it drew even rough night eh oldtimer he grunted noncommittally then he looked at me eyes narrowing when i fell into step beside him he eased away watched me closely there was no fear in his eyes he was sure of himself not the sort of old man you found wandering the streets of the slums they are scared of their own shadows what do you want it was a calm straightforward question he did not have to be frightened i was scared enough for both of us you knifed a friend of mine raker he halted a glint of something strange showed in his eye the black company i nodded he stared eyes narrowing thoughtfully the physician youre the physician the one they call croaker glad to meet you i am sure my voice sounded stronger than i felt i thought what the hell do i do now raker flung his cloak open a short stabbing sword thrust my way i slid aside opened my own cloak dodged again and tried to draw my sword raker froze he caught my eye his eyes seemed to grow larger larger i was falling into twin grey pools a smile tugged at the corners of his mouth he stepped toward me blade rising and grunted suddenly a look of total amazement came over his face i shook his spell stepped back came to guard raker turned slowly faced the darkness ravens knife protruded from his back raker reached back and withdrew it a mewl of pain passed his lips he glared at the knife then ever so slowly began to sing move croaker a spell fool i had forgotten what raker was i charged raven arrived at the same instant i looked at the body now what raven knelt produced another knife it had a serrated edge somebody claims soulcatchers bounty hed have a fit you going to tell him no but what will we do with it there had been times when the black company was prosperous but never when it was rich accumulation of wealth is not our purpose i can use some of it old debts the rest divide it up send it back to beryl whatever its there why let the taken keep it i shrugged up to you i just hope soulcatcher dont think we crossed him only you and me know i wont tell him he brushed the snow off the old mans face raker was cooling fast raven used his knife i am a physician i have removed limbs i am a soldier i have seen some bloody battlefields nevertheless i was queasy decapitating a dead man did not seem right raven secured our grisly trophy inside his cloak it did not bother him once on the way to our part of town i asked why did we go after him anyway he did not answer immediately then the captains last letter said to get it over with if i had the chance as we neared the square raven said go upstairs see if the spook is there if hes not send the soberest man after our wagon you come back here right i sighed hurried to our quarters anything for a little warmth the snow was a foot deep now i was afraid my feet were permanently damaged where the hell have you been elmo demanded when i stumbled through the doorway wheres raven i looked around no soulcatcher goblin and oneeye were back dead to the world otto and hagop were snoring like giants hows otto doing all right whatve you been up to i settled myself beside our fire prized my boots off my feet were blue and numb but not frozen soon they tingled painfully my legs ached from all that walking through the snow too i told elmo the whole story you killed him raven said the captain wants done with the project yeah i didnt figure raven would go cut his throat wheres soulcatcher hasnt been back he grinned ill get the wagon dont tell anybody else too many big mouths he flung his cloak about his shoulders stamped out my hands and feet felt halfway human i scooted over and nabbed ottos boots he was about my size and hi did not need them out into the night again morning almost dawn was due soon if i expected any remonstrance from raven i was disappointed he just looked at me i think he actually shivered i remember thinking maybe he is human after all had to change my boots elmo is getting the wagon the rest of them are passed out soulcatcher not back yet lets plant this seed he strode into the swirling flakes i hurried after him the snow had not collected on our trap it sat then glowing gold water puddled beneath it and trickled away to become ice you think soulcatcher will know when this thing get discharged i asked its a good bet goblin and oneeye too the place could burn down around those two and they wouldnt turn over nevertheless sshh somebody out there go that way he moved the other direction circling what am i doing this for i wondered as i skulked through the snow weapon in hand i ran into raven set anything he glared into the darkness somebody was here h sniffed the air turned his head slowly right and left he took a dozen quick steps pointed down he was right the trail was fresh the departing half looked hurried i stared at those marks i dont like it raven our visitors spoor indicated that he dragged his right foot the limper we dont know for sure who else wheres elmo we returned to the raker trap waited impatiently raven paced he muttered i could not recall ever having seen him this unsettled once he said the limper isnt soulcatcher really soulcatcher is almost human limper is the sort that enjoys tormenting babies a jangle of traces and squeak of poorly greased wheels entered the plaza elmo and the wagon appeared elmo pulled up and jumped down where the hell you been fear and weariness made me cross takes time to dig out a stableboy and get a team ready whats the matter what happened the limper was here oh shit what did he do nothing he just lets move raven snapped before he comes back he took the head to the stone the wardspells might not have existed he fitted our trophy into the waiting declivity the golden glow winked out snowflakes began accumulating on head and stone lets go elmo gasped we dont have much time i grabbed a sack and heaved it into the wagon thoughtful elmo had laid out a tarp to keep loose coins from dribbling between the floorboards raven told me to rake up the loose stuff under the table elmo dump some of those sacks out and give them to croaker they heaved bags i scrambled after loose coins one minute gone raven said half the bags were in the wagon too much loose stuff i complained well leave it if we have to whatre we going to do with it how will we hide it in die hay in the stable raven said for now later we put a false bed in the wagon two minutes gone what about wagon tracks elmo asked he could follow them to the stable why should he care in the first place i wondered aloud raven ignored me he asked elmo you didnt conceal them coming here didnt think of it damn all the sacks were aboard elmo and raven helped with the loose stuff three minutes raven said then quiet he listened soulcatcher couldnt be here already could he no the limper again come on you drive elmo head for a thoroughfare lose us in traffic ill follow you croaker go try to cover elmos backtrail where is he elmo asked staring into the falling snow raven pointed well have to lose him or hell take it away go on croaker get moving elmo get up elmo snapped his traces the wagon creaked away i ducked under the table and stuffed my pockets then ran away from where raven said the limper was i do not know that i had much luck obscuring elmos backtrail i think we were helped more by morning traffic than by anything i did i did get rid of the stableboy i gave him a sock full of gold and silver more than he could make in years of stable work and asked him if he could lose himself away from roses preferably he told me i wont even stop to get my things he dropped his pitchfork and headed out never to be seen again i hied myself back to our room everyone was sleeping but otto oh croaker he said bout time pain yeah hangover that too lets see what we can do how long you been awake an hour i guess soulcatcher been here no what happened to him anyway i dont know hey those are my boots what the hell do you think youre doing wearing my boots take it easy drink this he drank come on whatre you doing wearing my boots i removed the boots and set them near the fire which had burned quite low otto kept after me while i added coal if you dont calm down youre going to rip your stitches i will say this for our people they pay attention when my advice is medical angry as he was he lay back forced himself to lie still he did not stop cussing me i shed my wet things and donned a nightshirt i found lying around i do not know where it came from it was too short i put on a pot of tea then turned to otto lets take a closer look i dragged my kit over i was cleaning around the wound and otto was cursing softly when i heard the sound scrapeclump scrape clump it stopped outside the door otto sensed my fear whats the matter its the door opened behind me i glanced back i had guessed right the limper went to the table dropped into a chair surveyed the room his gaze skewered me i wondered i he recalled what i had done to him in oar inanely i said i just started tea he stared at the wet boots and cloak then at each man in the room then at me again the limper is not big meeting him in the street no knowing what he is you would not be impressed like soulcatcher he wears a single color a dingy brown ht was ragged his face was concealed by a battered leather mask which drooped tangled threads of hair protrude from under his hood and around his mask it was grey peppered with black he did not say a word just sat there and stared no knowing what else to do i finished tending otto then made the tea i poured three tin cups gave one to otto se one before the limper took the third myself what now no excuse to be busy nowhere to sit but a that table oh shit the limper removed his mask he raised the tin cup i could not tear my gaze away his was the face of a dead man of a mummy improperly preserved his eyes were alive and baleful yet directly beneath one was a patch of flesh which had rotted beneath his nose at the right corner of his mouth a square inch of lip was missing revealing gum and yellowed teeth the limper sipped tea met my eye and smiled i nearly dribbled down my leg i went to the window there was some light out there now and the snowfall was weakening but i could not see the stone the stamp of boots sounded on the stair elmo and raven shoved into the room elmo growled hey croaker how the hell did you get rid of that his words grew smaller as he recognized the limper raven gave me a questioning look the limper turned i shrugged when his back was to me raven moved to one side began removing his wet things elmo got the idea he went the other way stripped beside the fire damn its good to get out of those hows the boy otto theres fresh tea i said otto replied i hurt all over elmo the limper peered at each of us and at oneeye and goblin who had yet to stir so soulcatcher brings the black companys best his voice was a whisper yet it filled the room where is he raven ignored him he donned dry breeches sat beside otto doublechecked my handiwork good job of stitching croaker i get plenty of practice with this outfit elmo shrugged in response to the limper he drained his cup poured tea all around then filled the pot from one of the pitchers he planted a boot in oneeyes ribs while the limper glared at raven you the limper snapped i havent forgotten what you did in opal nor during the campaign in forsberg raven settled with his back against the wall he produced one of his more wicked knives and began cleaning his fingernails he smiled at the limper he smiled and there was mockery in his eyes didnt anything scare that man what did you do with the money that wasnt soulcatchers the lady gave it to me i took courage from ravens defiance arent you supposed to be in elm the lady ordered you out of the salient anger distorted that wretched face a scar ran down his forehead and left cheek it stood out supposedly it continued down his left breast the blow had been struck by the white rose herself the limper rose and that damned raven said got the cards elmo the table is free the limper scowled the tension level was rising fast he snapped i want that money its mine your choice is to cooperate or not i dont think youll enjoy it if you dont you want it you go get it raven said catch raker chop off his head take it to the stone that ought to be easy for the limper raker is only a bandit what chance would he stand against the limper i thought the taken would explode he did not for an instant he was baffled he was not off balance long all right if you want it the hard way his smile was wide and cruel the tension was near the snapping point a shadow moved in the open doorway a lean dark figure appeared stared at the limpers back i sighed in relief the limper spun for a moment the air seemed to crackle between the taken from the corner of one eye i noted that goblin was sitting up his fingers were dancing in complex rhythms oneeye facing the wall was whispering into his bedroll raven reversed his knife for a throw elmo got a grip on the tea pot ready to fling hot water there was no missile within grabbing distance of me what the hell could i contribute a chronicle of die blowup afterward if i survived soulcatcher made a tiny gesture stepped around the limper deposited himself in his usual chair he flung a toe out hooked one of the chairs away from the table put his feet up he stared at the limper his fingers steepled before his mouth the lady sent a message in case i ran into you she wants to see you soulcatcher used only one voice throughout a hard female voice she wants to ask you about the uprising in elm the limper jerked one hand extended over the table twitched nervously uprising in elm rebels attacked the palace and barracks the limpers leathery face lost color the twitching of his hand became more pronounced soulcatcher said she wants to know why you werent there to head them off the limper stayed about three seconds more in that time his face became grotesque seldom have i seen such naked fear then he spun and fled raven flipped his knife it stuck in the doorframe the limper did not notice soulcatcher laughed this was not the laugh of earlier days but a deep harsh solid vindictive laughter he rose turned to the window ah someone has claimed our prize when did that happen elmo masked his response by going to close the door raven said toss me my knife elmo i eased up beside soulcatcher looked out the snowfall had ceased the stone was visible cold unglowing with an inch of white on top i dont know i hoped i sounded sincere the snow was heavy all night last time i lookedbefore he showed upi couldnt see a thing maybe id better go down there dont bother he adjusted his chair so he could watch the square later after he had accepted tea from elmo and finished itconcealing his face by turning awayhe mused raker eliminated his vermin in panic and sweeter still the limper embarrassed again not a bad job was that true i asked about elm every word in a fey merry voice one does wonder how the rebel knew the limper was out of town and how shapeshifter caught wind of the trouble quickly enough to show up and quash the uprising before it amounted to anything another pause no doubt the limper will ponder that while he is recuperating he laughed again more softly more darkly elmo and i busied ourselves preparing breakfast otto usually handled the cooking so we had an excuse for breaking routine after a time soulcatcher observed theres no point to you people staying here your captains prayers have been answered we can go elmo asked no reason to stay is there oneeye had reasons we ignored them start packing after breakfast elmo told us youre going to travel in this weather oneeye demanded captain wants us back i took soulcatcher a platter of scrambled eggs i do not know why he did not eat often and breakfast almost never but he accepted it turned his back i looked out the window the mob had discovered the change someone had brushed the snow off rakers face his eyes were open seemed to be watching weird men were scrambling around under the table fighting over the coins we had left behind the pileup seethed like maggots in a putrid corpse somebody ought to do him honor i murmured he was a hell of an opponent you have your annals soulcatcher told me and only a conqueror bothers to honor a fallen foe i was headed for my own plate by then i wondered what he meant but a hot meal was more important at the moment they were all down at the stable except me and otto they were going to bring the wagon around for the wounded soldier i had given him something to get him through the rough handling to come they were taking their time elmo wanted to rig a canopy to shield otto from the weather i played solitaire while i waited out of nowhere soulcatcher said shes very beautiful croaker younglooking fresh dazzling with a heart of flint the limper is a warm puppy by comparison pray you never catch her eye soulcatcher stared out the window i wanted to ask questions but none would come at that moment damn i really wasted a chance then what color was her hair her eyes how did she smile it all meant a lot to me when i could not know soulcatcher rose donned his cloak if only for the limper its been worth it he said he paused at the door pierced me with his stare you and elmo and raven drink a toast to me hear then he was gone elmo came in a minute later we lifted otto and started back to meystrikt my nerves were not worth a damn for a long time chapter four whisper the engagement gave us the most gain for least effort of any i can remember it was pure serendipity that went one hundred percent our way it was a disaster for the rebel we were in flight from the salient where the ladys defenses had collapsed almost overnight running with us were five or six hundred regulars who had lost their units for speeds sake the captain had chosen to cut straight through the forest of cloud to lords instead of following the longer southern road around a rebel mainforce battalion was a day or two behind us we could have turned and whipped them but the captain wanted to give them the slip instead i liked his thinking the fighting around roses had been grim thousands had fallen with so many extra bodies attaching themselves to the company i had been losing men for lack of time to treat them our orders were to report to nightcrawler at lords soulcatcher thought lords would be the target of the next rebel thrust tired as we were we expected to see more bitter fighting before winter slowed the wars pace croaker lookee here whitey came charging toward where i sat with the captain and silent and one or two others he had a naked woman draped over his shoulder she might have been attractive had she not been so thoroughly abused not bad whitey not bad i said and went back to my journal behind whitey the whooping and screaming continued the men were harvesting the fruits of victory theyre barbarians the captain observed without rancor got to let them cut loose sometimes i reminded him better here than with the people of lords the captain agreed reluctantly he just does not have much stomach for plunder and rape much as they are part of our business i think he is a secret romantic at least when females are involved i tried to soften his mood they asked for it taking up arms bleakly he asked me how long has this been going on croaker seems like forever doesnt it can you even remember a time when you werent a soldier whats the point why are we even here we keep winning battles but the lady is losing the war why dont they just call the whole thing off and go home he was partially right since forsberg it has been one retreat after another though we have done well the salient had been secure till shapeshifter and the limper got into the act our latest retreat had brought us stumbling into this rebel base camp we presumed it was the main training and staging center for the campaign against nightcrawler luckily we spotted the rebel before he spotted us we surrounded the place and roared in before dawn we were badly outnumbered but the rebel did not put up much of a fight most were green volunteers the startling aspect was the presence of an amazon regiment we had heard of them of course there were several in the east around rust where the fighting is more bitter and sustained than here this was our first encounter it left the men disdainful of women warriors despite their having fought better than their male compatriots smoke began drifting our way the men were firing the barracks and headquarters buildings the captain muttered croaker go make sure those fools dont fire the forest i rose picked up my bag ambled down into the din there were bodies everywhere the fools must have felt completely safe they hadnt put up a stockade or trenched around the encampment stupid that is the first thing you do even when you know there is no enemy within a hundred miles you put a roof over your head later wet is better than dead i should be used to this i have been with the company a long time and it does bother me less than it used to i have hung armor plate over my moral soft spots but i still try to avoid looking at the worst you who come after me scribbling these annals by now realize that i shy off portraying the whole truth about our band of blackguards you know they are vicious violent and ignorant they are complete barbarians living out their cruelest fantasies their behavior tempered only by the presence of a few decent men i do not often show that side because these men are my brethren my family and i was taught young not to speak ill of kin the old lessons die hardest raven laughs when he reads my accounts sugar and spice he calls them and threatens to take the annals away and write the stories the way he sees them happen hardass raven mocking me and who was that out there roaming around the camp breaking it up wherever the men were amusing themselves with a little torture who had a ten year old girl trailing him on an old jack mule not croaker brothers not croaker croaker isnt no romantic that is a passion reserved for the captain and raven naturally raven has become the captains best friend they sit around together like a couple of rocks talking about the same things boulders do they are content just to share one anothers company elmo was leading the arsonists they were older company men who had sated their less intense hungers for flesh those still mauling the ladies were mostly our young regular hangerson they had given the rebel a good fight at roses but he had been too strong half the circle of eighteen had ranged themselves against us there we had had only the limper and shapeshifter on our side those two spent more time trying to sabotage one another than trying to repel the circle result a debacle the ladys most humiliating defeat in a decade the circle pulls together most of the time they do not spend more energy abusing one another than they spend on their enemies hey croaker oneeye called join the fun he tossed a burning brand through a barracks doorway the building promptly exploded heavy oaken shutters blew off the windows a gout of flame enveloped oneeye he came charging out kinky hair smoldering below the band of his weird floppy hat i wrestled him down used that hat to slap his hair all right all right he growled you dont have to enjoy yourself so damned much unable to stifle a grin i helped him up you all right singed he said assuming that air of phony dignity cats adopt after some particularly inept performance something like thats what i meant to do all along the fire roared pieces of thatch soared and bobbed over the building i observed the captain sent me to make sure you clowns didnt start a forest fire just then goblin ambled around the side of the flaming building his broad mouth stretched in a smirk oneeye took one look and shrieked you maggot brain you set me up for that he let out a spinetingling howl and started dancing the roar of the flames deepened became rhythmic soon it seemed i could see something prancing among the flames behind the windows goblin saw it too his smirk vanished he gulped went white began a little dance of his own he and oneeye howled and squawked and virtually ignored one another a watering trough disgorged its contents which arced through the air and splashed the flames the contents of a water barrel followed the roar of the fire dwindled oneeye pranced over and took a poke at goblin trying to break his concentration goblin weaved and bobbed and squeaked and kept on dancing more water hit the fire what a pair i turned elmo had come over to watch a pair indeed i replied fussing feuding whining they could be an allegory of their bigger brethren in the trade except their conflict does not run half to the bone like that between shifter and the limper when you slice through the fog you find that these two are friends there are no friends among the taken got something to show you elmo said he would not say anything more i nodded and followed him goblin and oneeye kept at it goblin appeared to be ahead i stopped worrying about the fire you figured how to read these northern chicken tracks elmo asked he had led me into what must have been the headquarters for the whole camp he indicated a mountain of papers his men had piled on the floor evidently as tinder for another fire i think i can puzzle it out thought you might find something in this stuff i selected a paper at random it was a copy of an order directing a specific rebel mainforce battalion to filter into lords and disappear into the homes of local sympathizers till called to strike at lords defenders from within it was signed whisper a list of contacts was appended ill say i said suddenly short of breath that one order betrayed a halfdozen rebel secrets and implied several more ill say i grabbed another like the first it was a directive to a specific unit like the first it was a window into the heart of current rebel strategy get the captain i told elmo get goblin and oneeye and the lieutenant and anybody else who maybe ought to be i must have looked weird elmo wore a strange nervous expression when he interrupted what the hell is it croaker all the orders and plans for the campaign against lords the complete order of battle but that was not the bottom line that i was going to save for the captain himself and hurry minutes might be critical and stop them from burning anything like this for hells sake stop them weve hit paydirt dont send it up in smoke elmo slammed through the door i heard his bellows fade into the distance a good sergeant elmo he does not waste time asking questions grunting i settled myself on the floor and began scanning documents the door creaked i did not look up i was in a fever glancing at documents as fast as i could yank them off the pile sorting them into smaller stacks muddy boots appeared at the edge of my vision can you read these raven i had recognized his step can i yes help me see what weve got here raven settled himself opposite me the pile lay between us nearly blocking our view of one another darling positioned herself behind him out of his way but well within the shadow of his protection her quiet dull eyes still reflected the horror of that far village in some ways raven is a paradigm for the company the difference between him and the rest of us is that he is a little more of everything a little bigger than life maybe by being the newcomer the only brother from the north he is symbolic of our life in the ladys service his moral agonies have become our moral agonies his silent refusal to howl and beat his breast in adversity is ours as well we prefer to speak with the metallic voice of our arms enough why venture into the meaning of it all elmo had struck paydirt raven and i went sifting for nuggets goblin and oneeye drifted in neither could read the northern script they started to amuse themselves by sending sourceless shadows chasing one another around the walls raven gave them a nasty look their ceaseless clowning and bickering can be tiresome when you have something on your mind they looked at him dropped the game sat down quietly almost like children admonished raven has that knack that energy that impact of personality to make men more dangerous than he shudder in his cold dark wind the captain arrived accompanied by elmo and silent through the doorway i glimpsed several men hanging around funny the way they smell things shaping up what have you got croaker the captain asked i figured he had milked elmo dry so i got straight to the kicker these orders i tapped one of my stacks all these reports i tapped another theyre all signed by whisper were kicking up the veggies in whispers private garden my voice was up in the high squeak range for a while nobody said anything goblin made a few squeaky noises when candy and the other sergeants rushed in finally the captain asked raven that right raven nodded judging by the documents shes been in and out since early spring the captain folded his hands began pacing he looked like a tired old monk on his way to evening prayer whisper is the best known of the rebel generals her stubborn genius has held the eastern front together despite the best efforts of the ten she is also the most dangerous of the circle of eighteen she is known for the thoroughness with which she plans campaigns in a war which too often resembles armed chaos on both sides her forces stand out for their tight organization discipline and clarity of purpose the captain mused shes supposed to be commanding the rebel army at rust right the struggle for rust was three years old rumor had hundreds of square miles laid waste during the winter past both sides had been reduced to eating their own dead to survive i nodded the question was rhetorical he was thinking out loud and rust has been a killing ground for years whisper wont break the lady wont back off but if whisper is coming here then the circle has decided to let rust fall i added it means theyre shifting from an eastern to a northern strategy the north remains the ladys weak flank the west is prostrate the ladys allies rule the sea to the south the north has been ignored since the empires frontiers reached the great forests above forsberg it is in the north that the rebel has managed his most spectacular successes the lieutenant observed they have the momentum with forsberg taken the salient overrun roses gone and rye besieged there are rebel mainforcers headed for wist and jane theyll be stopped but the circle must know that so theyre dancing on the other foot and coming at lords if lords goes theyre almost to the edge of the windy country cross the windy country climb the stair of tear and theyre looking down at charm from a hundred miles away i continued scanning and sorting elmo you might look around and see if you can come up with anything else she might have something tucked away use oneeye goblin and silent raven suggested better chance of finding something the captain okayed the proposal he told the lieutenant get that business out there wrapped up carp you and candy get the men ready to move out match double your perimeter guard sir candy asked you dont want to be here when whisper gets back do you goblin come back here get a hold of soulcatcher this goes to the top now goblin made an awful face then went into a corner and began murmuring to himself it was a quiet little sorceryto start the captain rolled on croaker you and raven pack these documents when youre done well want them along i maybe better save the best out for catcher i said some will need immediate attention if were to get any use out of them i mean something will have to be done before whisper can put the word out he cut me off right ill send you a wagon dont dillydally he looked grey around the edges as he stalked outside a new strain of terror entered the screaming and shouting outside i untangled my aching legs and went to the door they were herding the rebels together on their drill field the prisoners sensed the companys sudden eagerness to cut and run they thought they were about to die just minutes before salvation arrived shaking my head i returned to my reading raven gave me a look that might have meant he shared my pain on the other hand it might have contained contempt for my weakness with raven it is hard to tell oneeye shoved through the door stomped over dumped an armload of bundles wrapped in oilskin moist clods clung to them you were right we dug these up behind her sleeping quarters goblin let out a long shrill screech as chilling as an owls when you are alone in the woods at midnight oneeye charged the sound such moments make me doubt the sincerity of their animosity goblin moaned hes in the tower hes with the lady i see her through his eyes his eyes his eyes the darkness oh god the darkness no oh god no no his words twisted into a shriek of pure terror that faded to the eye i see the eye its looking right through me raven and i exchanged frowns and shrugs we did not know what he was talking about goblin sounded like he was regressing toward childhood make it stop looking at me make it stop ive been good make it go away oneeye was on his knees beside goblin its all right its all right its not real its going to be all right i exchanged glances with raven he turned began gesturing at darling im sending her to fetch the captain darling left reluctantly raven took another sheet from the pile and resumed reading cool as a stone mat raven goblin screamed for a while then got quiet as death i jerked around oneeye lifted a hand to tell me i was not needed goblin had finished delivering his message goblin relaxed slowly the terror left his face his color improved i knelt touched his carotid his heart was hammering but its beat was slowing surprised it didnt kill him this time i said it ever been this bad before no oneeye dropped goblins hand wed better not put it on him next time is it progressive my trade borders theirs along the shadowed edges but only in small ways i did not know no his confidence will need support for a while sounded like he caught soulcatcher right at the heart of the tower i think that would leave anybody rocky while in the presence of the lady i breathed i could not contain my excitement goblin had seen the inside of the tower he might have seen the lady only the ten who were taken ever came out of the tower popular imagination invests its interior with a thousand gruesome possibilities and i had me a live witness you just let him be croaker hell tell you when hes ready there was a hard edge to oneeyes voice they laugh at my little fantasies tell me i have fallen in love with a spook maybe they are right sometimes my interest scares me it gets close to becoming an obsession for a time i forgot my duty to goblin for a moment he stopped being a man a brother an old friend he became a source of information then shamed i retreated to my papers the captain arrived puzzled dragged by a determined darling ah i see he made contact he studied goblin said anything yet no wake him up oneeye oneeye started to protest thought better of it shook goblin gently goblin took his time awakening his sleep was almost as deep as a trance was it rough the captain asked me i explained he grunted said that wagon is on its way one of you start packing i started straightening my piles one of you means raven croaker you stand by here goblin doesnt look too good he did not he had gone pale again his bream was coming shallower and quicker getting ragged give him a slap oneeye i said he might think hes still out there the slap did the job goblin opened eyes filled with panic he recognized oneeye shuddered took a deep breath and squeaked i have to come back to this after that but his voice gave the lie to his protest the relief there was thick enough to cut hes all right i said he can bitch the captain squatted he did not say anything goblin would talk when he was ready he took several minutes to get himself together then said soulcatcher says to get the hell out of here fast hell meet us on the way to lords thats it that is all there ever is but the captain keeps hoping for more the game does not seem worth the candle when you see what goblin goes through i looked at him hard it was one hell of a temptation he looked back later croaker give me time to get it straightened out in my head i nodded said a little herb tea will perk you up oh no youre not giving me any of that rat piss of oneeyes not his my own i measured enough for a strong quart gave it to oneeye closed my kit returned to the papers as the wagon creaked up outside as i carried my first load out i noticed that the men were at the coup de grace stage on the drill field the captain was not fooling around he wanted to put a lot of distance between himself and the camp before whisper returned cant say i blame him her reputation is thoroughly vile i did not get to the oilskin packets till we were travelling again i sat up beside the driver and started the first vainly trying to ignore the savage jouncing of the springless vehicle i went through the packets twice growing ever more distressed a real dilemma should i tell the captain what i had learned should i tell oneeye or raven each would be interested should i save everything for soulcatcher no doubt he would prefer that my question was did this information fall inside or outside my obligation to the company i needed an adviser i jumped down from the wagon let the column drift past till silent caught up he had middle guard oneeye was on the point and goblin back in the rear each was worth a platoon of outriders silent looked down from the back of the big black he rides when he is in a villainous mood he scowled of our wizards he is the nearest to what you could call evil though like so many of us he is more image than substance ive got a problem i told him a big one youre i glen cook the best sounding board i looked around i dont want anyone else to hear this silent nodded he made complicated fluid gestures too quick to follow suddenly i could not hear anything from more than five feet away you would be amazed how many sounds you do not notice till they are gone i told silent what i had found silent is hard to shock he has seen and heard it all but he looked properly astonished this time for a moment i thought he was going to say something should i tell soulcatcher vigorous affirmative nod all right i hadnt doubted that the news was too big for the company it would eatus up if we kept it to ourselves how about the captain oneeye some of the others he was less quick to respond and less decisive his advice was negative with a few questions and the intuition one develops on long exposure i understood silent to feel that soulcatcher would want to spread the word on a needtoknow basis right then i said and thanks and started trotting up the column when i was out of sight of silent i asked one of the men you seen raven up with the captain that figured i resumed trotting after a moment of reflection i had decided to buy a little insurance raven was the finest policy i could imagine you read any of the old languages i asked him it was hard talking to him he and the captain were mounted and darling was right behind them her mule kept trying to tromp my heels some all part of a classical education why i scrambled a few steps ahead were going to be having mule stew if you dont watch it animal i swear that beast sneered i told raven some of those papers arent modern the ones oneeye dug up not important then are they i shrugged and ambled along beside him picking my words carefully you never know the lady and the ten they go way back i let out a yelp spun ran backward gripping my shoulder where the mule had nipped me the animal looked innocent but darling was grinning impishly it was almost worth the pain just to see her smile she did so so seldom i cut across the column and drifted back till i was walking beside elmo he asked is something wrong croaker uhm no not really you look scared i was scared i had tipped the lid off a little box just to see what was inside and had found it filled with nastiness the things i had read could not be unlearned when next i saw raven his face was as grey as mine maybe more so we walked together while he sketched what he had learned from the documents i had not been able to read some of them belonged to the wizard bomanz he told me others date from the domination some are tellekurre only the ten use that language anymore bomanz i asked right the one who wakened the lady whisper got a hold of his secret papers somehow oh indeed yes oh we parted each to be alone with his fears soulcatcher came sneakily he wore clothing not unlike ours outside his customary leathers he slipped into the column unremarked how long he was there i do not know i became aware of him as we were leaving the forest after three eighteen hour days of heavy marching i was putting one foot ahead of the other aching and mumbling about getting too old when a soft feminine voice inquired how are you today physician it lilted with amusement had i been less exhausted i might have jumped ten feet screaming as it was i just took my next step cranked my head around and muttered finally showed up eh profound apathy was the order of the moment a wave of relief would arrive later but just then my brain was running as sluggishly as my body after so long on the run it was hard to get the adrenaline pumping the world held no sudden excitements or terrors soulcatcher marched beside me matching stride for stride occasionally glancing my way i could not see his face but i sensed his amusement the relief came and was followed by a wave of awe at my own temerity i had talked back like catcher was one of the guys it was thunderbolt time so why dont we look at those documents he asked he seemed positively cheerful i showed him to the wagon we scrambled aboard the driver gave us one wideeyed look then stared determinedly forward shivering and trying to become deaf i went straight to the packets that had been buried started to slip out stay he said they dont need to know yet he sensed my fear giggled like a young girl youre safe croaker in fact the lady sends her personal thanks he laughed again she wanted to know all about you croaker all about you youve caught her imagination too another hammer blow of fear nobody wants to catch the ladys eye soulcatcher enjoyed my discomfiture she might grant you an interview croaker oh my youre so pale well it isnt mandatory to work then never have i seen anyone read so fast he went through the old documents and the new zip catcher said you werent able to read all of this he used his businesslike female voice no neither can i some only the lady will be able to decipher odd i thought i expected more enthusiasm the seizure of the documents represented a coup for him because he had had the foresight to enlist the black company how much did you get i talked about the rebel plan for a thrust through lords and about what whispers presence implied he chuckled the old documents croaker tell me about the old documents i was sweating the softer the more gentle he became the more i felt i had to fear the old wizard the one who wakened you all some of them were his papers damn i knew i had stuck my foot in my mouth before i finished raven was the only man in the company who could have identified bomanzs papers as his soulcatcher chuckled gave me a comradely shoulder slap i thought so croaker i wasnt sure but i thought so i didnt think you could resist telling raven i did not respond i wanted to lie but he knew you couldnt have known any other way you told him about the references to the limpers true name so he just had to read everything he could right still i kept my peace it was true though my motives had not been wholly brotherly raven has his scores to settle but limper wants all of us the most jealously guarded secret of any wizard of course is his true name an enemy armed with that can stab through any magic or illusion straight to the heart of the soul you only guessed at the magnitude of what you found croaker even i can only guess but what will come of it is predictable the biggest disaster ever for rebel arms and a lot of rattling and shaking among the ten he slapped my shoulder again youve made me the second most powerful person in the empire the lady knows all our true names now i know three of the others and ive gotten my own back no wonder he was effusive he had ducked an arrow he had not known was coming and had lucked onto a stranglehold on the limper at the same time he had stumbled over a rainbow pot of power but whisper whisper will have to go the voice he used was deep and chill it was the voice of an assassin a voice accustomed to pronouncing death sentences whisper has to die fast otherwise nothing is gained suppose she told someone else she didnt oh no i know whisper i fought her at rust before the lady sent me to beryl i fought her at were i chased her through the talking menhirs upon the plain of fear i know whisper shes a genius but shes a loner had she lived during the first era the dominator would have made her one of his own she serves the white rose but her heart is as black as the night of hell that sounds like the whole circle to me catcher laughed yes every one a hypocrite but there isnt a one like whisper this is incredible croaker how did she unearth so many secrets how did she get my name i had it hidden perfectly i admire her truly such genius such audacity a strike through lords across the windy country and up the stair of tear incredible impossible and it would have worked but for the accident of the black company and you youll be rewarded i guarantee it but enough of this ive got work to do nightcrawler needs this information the lady has to see these papers i hope youre right i grumbled kick ass then take a break im worn out weve been humping and fighting for a year dumb remark croaker i felt the chill of the frown inside the black morion how long had soulcatcher been humping and fighting an age you go on now he told me ill talk to you and raven later cold cold voice i got the hell out of there it was all over in lords when we got there nightcrawler had moved fast and had hit hard you could not go anywhere without finding rebels hanging from the trees and lampposts the company went into barracks expecting a quiet boring winter and a spring spent chasing rebel leftovers back to the great northern forests ah it was a sweet illusion while it lasted tonk i said slapping down five face cards given me on the deal ha double you guys double pay up oneeye grumbled and growled and shoved coins across the table raven chuckled even goblin perked up enough to smile oneeye had not won a hand all morning even when he cheated thank you gentlemen thank you deal oneeye whatre you doing croaker eh how are you doing it the hand is quicker than the eye elmo suggested just clean living oneeye clean living the lieutenant shoved through the door face drawn into a fierce scowl raven croaker the captain wants you chopchop he surveyed the various card games you degenerates oneeye sniffed then worked up a wan smile the lieutenant was a worse player than he i looked at raven the captain was his buddy but he shrugged tossed his cards in i filled my pockets with any winnings and followed him to the captains office soulcatcher was there we had not seen him since that day at the edge of the forest i had hoped he had gotten too busy to get back to us i looked at the captain trying to divine the future from his face i saw that he was not happy if the captain was not happy i wasnt sit he said two chairs were waiting he prowled around fidgeting finally he said we have movement orders straight from charm us and nightcrawlers whole brigade he gestured toward soulcatcher passing the explaining to him catcher seemed lost in thought barely audibly he finally asked how are you with a bow raven fair no champion better than fair the captain countered damned good you croaker i used to be good i havent drawn one for years get some practice catcher started pacing too the office was small i expected a collision momentarily after a minute soulcatcher said there have been developments we tried to catch whisper at her camp we just missed her she smelled the trap shes still out there somewhere hiding the lady is sending in troops from all sides that explained the captains remark it did not tell me why i was supposed to hone my archery skills near as we can tell soulcatcher continued the rebel doesnt know what happened out there yet whisper hasnt found the nerve to pass the word about her failure shes a proud woman looks like she wants to try recouping first with what raven asked she couldnt put together a platoon with memories memories of the material you found buried we dont think she knows we got it she didnt get close to her headquarters before limper tipped our hand and she fled into the forest and just we four and the lady know of the documents raven and i nodded now we understood catchers restlessness whisper knew his true name he was on the bullseye what do you want with us raven asked suspiciously he was afraid catcher thought we had deciphered that name ourselves hed even suggested we kill the taken before he killed us the ten are neither immortal nor invulnerable but they are damned hard to reach i did not ever want to have a try at one we have a special mission we three raven and i exchanged glances was he setting us up catcher said captain would you mind stepping outside for a minute the captain shambled through the doorway his bear act is all for show i dont suppose he realizes that we have had it figured for years he keeps on with it trying for effect im not going to take you off where i can kill you quietly soulcatcher told us no raven i dont think you figured out my true name spooky i scrunched my head down against my shoulders raven flicked a hand a knife appeared he began cleaning already immaculate nails the critical development is this whisper suborned the limper after we made a fool of him in the raker affair i burst out that explains what happened in the salient we had it sewed up it fell apart overnight and he was a pure shit during the battle at roses raven agreed roses was his fault but nobody thought it was treason after all hes one of the ten yes catcher said it explains many things but the salient and roses are yesterday our interest now is tomorrow its getting rid of whisper before she gifts us with another disaster raven eyed catcher eyed me pursued his needless manicure i was not taking the taken at face value either we lesser mortals are but toys and tools to them they are the kind of people who dig up the bones of their grandmothers to win points with the lady this is our edge on whisper soulcatcher said we know she has agreed to meet the limper tomorrow how raven demanded dont know the lady told me limper doesnt know we know about him but he does know he cant last much longer hell probably try to make a deal so the circle will protect him he knows if he doesnt hes dead what the lady wants is them to die together so the circle will suspect she was selling out to the limper instead of the other way around it wont wash raven grumbled theyll believe it so were going to knock him off i said me and raven with bows and how are we supposed to find them catcher would not be there himself no matter how he talked both the limper and whisper would sense his presence long before he came within bowshot limper will be with the forces moving into the forest not knowing that hes suspected he wont hide from the ladys eye hell expect his movements to be taken as part of the search the lady will report his whereabouts to me ill put you on his trail when they meet you take them out sure raven sneered sure itll be a turkey shoot he threw his knife it bit deep into a windowsill he stomped out of the room the deal sounded no better to me i stared at soulcatcher and debated with myself for about two seconds before i let fear push me in ravens wake my last glimpse of catcher was of a weary person slumped in unhappiness i guess it is hard for them to live with their reputations we all want people to like us i was doing one of my little fantasies about the lady while raven systematically plunked arrows into a red rag pinned to a straw butt i had had trouble hitting the butt itself my first round let alone the rag it seemed raven could not miss this time i was playing around with her childhood that is something i like to look at with any villain what twists and knots went into the thread tying the creature at charm to the little girl who was consider little children there are not many of them not cute and lovable and precious sweet as whipped honey and butter so where do all the wicked people come from i walk through our barracks and wonder how a giggling inquisitive toddler could have become a three fingers a jolly or a silent little girls are twice as precious and innocent as little boys i do not know a culture that does not make them that way so where does a lady come from or for that matter a whisper i was speculating in this latest tale goblin sat down beside me he read what i had written i dont think so he said i think she made a conscious decision in the beginning i turned toward him slowly acutely conscious of soulcatcher standing only a few yards behind me watching the arrows fly i didnt really think it was this way goblin its a well you know you want to understand so you put it together some way you can handle we all do that in everyday life its called making excuses true raw motives are too rough to swallow by the time most people reach my age they have glossed their motives so often and so well they fall completely out of touch with them i became conscious of a shadow across my lap i glanced up soulcatcher extended a hand inviting me to take my turn with the bow raven had recovered his arrows and was standing by waiting for me to step to the mark my first three shafts plunked into the rag how about that i said and turned to take a bow soulcatcher was reading my little fantasy he raised his gaze to mine really croaker it wasnt like that at all didnt you know that she murdered her twin sister when she was fourteen rats with icy claws scrambled around on my spine i turned let a shaft fly it ripped wide right of the butt i sprayed a few more around and did nothing but irritate the pigeons in the background catcher took the bow your nerves are going croaker in a blur he snapped three arrows into a circle less than an inch across keep at it youll be under more pressure out there he handed the bow back the secret is concentration pretend youre doing surgery pretend im doing surgery right i have managed some fancy emergency work in the middle of battlefields right but this was different the grand old excuse yes but this is different i calmed down enough to hit the butt with the rest of my shafts after recovering them i stood aside for raven goblin handed me my writing materials irritably i crumpled my little fable need something for your nerves goblin asked yeah the iron filings or whatever it is raven eats my selfesteem was pretty shaky try this goblin offered me a little sixpointed silver star hanging on a neck chain at its center was a medusa head in jet an amulet yes we thought you might need it tomorrow tomorrow nobody was supposed to know what was happening we have eyes croaker this is the company maybe we dont know what but we can tell when something is going on yeah i suppose so thanks goblin me and oneeye and silent we all worked on it thanks what about raven when somebody makes a gesture like that i feel more comfortable shifting the subject raven doesnt need one raven is his own amulet sit down lets talk i cant tell you about it i know i thought you wanted to know about the tower he had not talked about his visit yet i had given up on him all right tell me i stared at raven arrow after arrow skewered the rag arent you going to write it down oh yeah i readied pen and paper the men are tremendously impressed by the fact that i keep these annals their only immortality will be here glad i didnt bet him bet who raven wanted to make a wager on our marksmanship goblin snorted youre getting too smart to get hooked by a sucker bet get your pen ready he launched his story he did not add much to rumors i had picked up here and there he described the place he had gone as a big drafty box of a room gloomy and dusty about what i expected of the tower or of any castle what did she look like that was the most intriguing part of the puzzle i had a mental picture of a dark haired ageless beauty with a sexual presence that hit mere mortals with the impact of a mace soulcatcher said she was beautiful but i had no independent corroboration i dont know i dont remember what do you mean you dont remember how can you not remember dont get all excited croaker i cant remember she was there in front of me then then all i could see was that giant yellow eye that kept getting bigger and bigger and stared right through me looking at every secret i ever had thats all i remember i still have nightmares about that eye i sighed exasperated i guess i shouldve expected that you know she could come walking by right now and nobody would know it was her i expect thats the way she wants it croaker if it does all fall apart the way it looked before you found those papers she can just walk away only the ten could identify her and she would make sure of them somehow i doubt it would be that simple people like the lady have trouble assuming a lesser role deposed princes keep acting like princes thanks for taking the trouble to tell me about it goblin no trouble i didnt have anything to tell only reason i put it off was it upset me so much raven finished retrieving his arrows he came over and told goblin why dont you go put a bug in oneeyes bedroll or something weve got work to do he was nervous about my erratic marksmanship we had to depend on one another if either missed chances were we would die before a second shaft could be sped i did not want to think about that but thinking about it improved my concentration i got most of my arrows into the rag this time it was a pain in the ass damned thing to have to do night before whatever faced raven and i but the captain refused to part with a tradition three centuries old he also refused to entertain protests about our having been drafted by soulcatcher or demands for the additional knowledge he obviously commanded i mean i understood what catcher wanted done and why i just could not make sense of why he wanted raven and i to do it having the captain back him only made it more confusing why croaker he finally demanded because i gave you an order thats why now get out there and do your reading once each month in the evening the entire company assembles so the annalist can read from his predecessors the readings are supposed to put the men in touch with the outfits history and traditions which stretch back centuries and thousands of miles i placed my selection on a crude lectern and went with the usual formula good evening brothers a reading from the annals of the black company last of the free companies of khatovar tonight im reading from the book of kette set down early in the companys second century by annalists lees agrip holm and straw the company was in service to the paingod of chon delor at that time that was when the company really was black the reading is from annalist straw it concerns the companys role in events surrounding the fall of chon delor i began to read reflecting privately that the company has served many losing causes the chon delor era bore many resemblances to our own though then standing more than six thousand strong the company was in a better position to shape its own destiny i lost track entirely old straw was hell with a pen i read for three hours raving like a mad prophet and held them spellbound they gave me an ovation when i finished i retreated from the lectern feeling as though my life had been fulfilled the physical and mental price of my histrionics caught up as i entered my barracks being a semiofficer i rated a small cubicle of my own i staggered right to it raven was waiting he sat on my bunk doing something artistic with an arrow its shaft had a band of silver around it he seemed to be engraving something had i not been exhausted i might have been curious you were superb raven told me even i felt it eh you made me understand what it meant to be a brother of the black company back then what it still means to some yes and more you reached them where they lived yeah sure whatre you doing fixing an arrow for the limper with his true name on it catcher gave it to me oh exhaustion kept me from pursuing the matter what did you want you made me feel something for the first time since my wife and her lovers tried to murder me and steal my rights and titles he rose closed one eye looked down the length of his arrow thanks croaker for a while i felt human again he stalked out i collapsed on the bunk and closed my eyes recalling raven strangling his wife taking her wedding ring and saying not a word he had revealed more in that one rapidfire sentence than since the day we had met strange i fell asleep reflecting that he had evened scores with everyone but the ultimate source of his despair the limper had been untouchable because he was one of the ladys own but no more raven would be looking forward to tomorrow i wondered what he would dream tonight and if he would have much purpose left if the limper died a man cannot survive on hatred alone would he bother trying to survive what was coming maybe that was what he wanted to say i was scared a man thinking that way could get a little flashy a little dangerous to those around him a hand closed on my shoulder time croaker the captain himself was doing the wakeup calls yeah im awake i had not slept well catcher is ready to go it was still dark out time almost four he wants to be gone before first light oh croaker be careful out there i want you back sure captain you know i dont take chances captain why me and raven anyway maybe he would tell me now he says the lady calls it a reward no shit some reward i felt around for my boots as he moved to the door captain thanks sure he knew i meant thanks for caring raven stuck his head in as i was lacing my jerkin ready one minute cold out there nippy take a coat wouldnt hurt mail shirt he touched my chest yeah i pulled my coat on picked up the bow i was taking bounced it on my palm for an instant goblins amulet lay cool on my breastbone i hoped it would work raven cracked a smile me too i grinned back lets go get them soulcatcher was waiting on the court where we had practiced our archery he was limned by light from the company mess the bakers were hard at work already catcher stood at a stiff parade rest a bundle under his left arm he stared toward the forest of cloud he wore only leathers and morion unlike some of the taken he seldom carries weapons he prefers relying on his thaumaturgic skills he was talking to himself weird stuff want to see him go down been waiting four hundred years we cant get that close hell smell us coming put aside all power oh thats too risky a whole chorus of voices got into the act it got really spooky when two of them talked at once raven and i exchanged glances he shrugged catcher did not faze him but then he grew up in the ladys dominions he has seen all the taken soulcatcher is supposedly one of the least bizarre we listened for a few minutes it did not get any saner out finally raven growled lord were ready he sounded a little shaky i was beyond speech myself all i could think of was a bow an arrow and a job i was expected to do i rehearsed the draw release and flight of my shaft over and over again unconsciously i rubbed goblins gift i would catch myself doing that often soulcatcher shuddered like a wet dog drew himself together without looking at us he gestured said come and started walking raven turned he yelled darling you get back in there like i told you go on now how is she supposed to hear you i asked looking back at the child watching from a shadowed doorway she wont but the captain will go on now he gestured violently the captain appeared momentarily darling vanished we followed soulcatcher raven muttered to himself he worried about the child soulcatcher set a brisk pace out of the compound out of lords itself across fields never looking back he led us to a large woodlot several bowshots from the wall to a glade at the lots heart there on the bank of a creek lay a ragged carpet stretched on a crude wooden frame about a foot high and six feet by eight soulcatcher said something the carpet twitched wriggled a little stretched itself taut raven you sit here catcher indicated the righthand corner nearest us croaker over here he indicated the left corner raven placed a foot on the carpet gingerly seemed surprised that the works did not collapse sit down soulcatcher placed him just so with his legs crossed and his weapons lying beside him near the carpets edge he did the same with me i was surprised to find the carpet rigid ft was like sitting on a tabletop its imperative that you dont move around catcher said wriggling himself into position ahead of us centered a foot forward of the carpets midline if we dont stay balanced we fall off understand i did not but i agreed with raven when he said yes ready raven said yes again i guess he knew what was happening i was taken by surprise soulcatcher laid his hands out palms upward beside him said a few strange words raised his hands slowly i gasped leaned the ground was receding sit still raven snarled you trying to kill us the ground was only six feet down then i straightened up and went rigid but i did turn my head enough to check a movement in the brush yes darling with mouth an o of amazement i faced forward gripped my bow so tightly i thought i would crush handprints into it i wished i dared finger my amulet raven did you make arrangements for darling in case you know the captain will look out for her i forgot to fix it with somebody for the annals dont be so optimistic he said sarcastically i shivered uncontrollably soulcatcher did something we started gliding over the treetops chill air whispered past us i glanced over the side we were a good five stories high and climbing the stars twisted overhead as catcher changed course the wind rose till we seemed to be flying into the face of a gale i leaned farther and farther forward afraid it would push me off there was nothing behind me but several hundred feet and an abrupt stop my fingers ached from gripping my bow i have learned one thing i told myself how catcher manages to show up so fast when he is always so far from the action when we get in touch it was a silent journey catcher stayed busy doing whatever it was he did to make his steed fly raven closed in on himself so did i i was scared silly my stomach was in revolt i do not know about raven the stars began to fade the eastern horizon lightened the earth materialized below us i chanced a look we were over the forest of cloud a little more light catcher grunted considered the east then the distances ahead he seemed to listen for a moment then nodded the carpet raised its nose we climbed the earth rocked and dwindled till it looked like a map the air became ever more chill my stomach remained rebellious way off to our left i glimpsed a black scar on the forest it was the encampment we had overrun then we entered a cloud and catcher slowed our rush well drift a while he said were thirty miles south of the limper hes riding away from us were overtaking him fast when were almost up to where he might detect me well go down he used the businesslike female voice i started to say something he snapped be quiet croaker dont distract me we stayed in that cloud unseen and unable to see for two hours then catcher said time to go down grip the frame members and dont let go it may be a little unsettling the bottom fell out we went down like a stone dropped from a cliff the carpet began to rotate slowly so the forest seemed to turn below us then it began to slide back and forth like a feather falling each time it tilted my way i thought i would tumble over the side a good scream might have helped but you could not do that in front of characters like raven and soulcatcher the forest kept getting closer soon i could distinguish individual trees when i dared to look we were going to die i knew we were going to smash right down through the forest canopy fifty feet into the earth catcher said something i did not catch it he was talking to his carpet anyway the rocking and spinning gradually stopped our descent slowed the carpet nosed down slightly and began to glide forward eventually catcher took us below treetop level into the aisle over a river we scooted along a dozen feet above the water with soulcatcher laughing as birds scattered in panic he brought us to earth in a glen beside the river off and stretch he told us after we had loosened up he said the limper is four miles north of us hes reached the meeting place youll go on from here without me hell detect me if i get any closer i want your badges he can detect those too raven nodded surrendered his badge strung his bow nocked an arrow pulled back relaxed i did the same it settled my nerves i was so grateful to be on the ground i could have kissed it the bole on the big oak raven pointed across the river he let fly his shaft struck a few inches off center i took a deep relaxing breath followed suite my shaft struck an inch nearer center should have bet me that time he remarked to catcher were ready i added well need more specific directions follow the river bank there are plenty of game trails the going shouldnt be hard no need to hurry anyway whisper shouldnt be there for hours yet the river heads west i observed it loops back follow it for three miles then turn a point west of north and go straight through the woods catcher crouched and cleared the leaves and twigs off some bare earth used a stick to sketch a map if you reach this bend youve gone too far then catcher froze for a long minute he listened to something only he could hear then he resumed the lady says youll know youre close when you reach a grove of huge evergreens it was the holy place of a people who died out before the domination the limper is waiting at the center of the grove good enough raven said i asked youll wait here have no fear croaker i took another of my relaxing breaths lets go raven one second croaker soulcatcher said he retrieved something from his bundle it proved to be an arrow use this i eyed it uncertainly then placed it in my quiver raven insisted on leading i did not argue i was a city boy before i joined the company i cannot become comfortable with forests especially not woods the size of the forest of cloud too much quiet too much solitude too easy to get lost for the first two miles i worried more about finding my way back than i did about the coming encounter i spent a lot of time memorizing landmarks raven did not speak for an hour i was busy thinking myself i did not mind he raised a hand i stopped far enough i think he said we go that way now uhm lets rest he settled on a huge tree root his back against a trunk awful quiet today croaker things on my mind yeah he smiled like what kind of reward were set up for among other things i drew out the arrow catcher had given me you see this a blunt head he felt it soft almost what the hell exactly means im not supposed to kill her there was no question of who would let fly at whom the limper was ravens all the way maybe but im not going to get killed trying to take her alive me either thats whats bothering me along with about ten other things like why the lady really picked you and me and why she wants whisper alive oh the hell with it itll give me ulcers ready i guess we left the riverbank the going became more difficult but soon we crossed a low ridgeline and reached the edge of the evergreens not much grew beneath them very little sunlight leaked through their boughs raven paused to urinate wont be any chance later he explained he was right you do not want that sort of problem when you are in ambush a stones throw from an unfriendly taken i was getting shaky raven laid a hand on my shoulder well be okay he promised but he did not believe it himself his hand was shaky too i reached inside my jerkin and touched goblins amulet it helped raven raised an eyebrow i nodded we resumed walking i chewed a strip of jerky which burned off nervous energy we did not speak again there were ruins among the trees raven examined the glyphs incised in the stones he shrugged they meant nothing to him then we came to the big trees the grandfathers of those through which we had been passing they towered hundreds of feet high and had trunks as thick as the spans of two mens arms here and there the sun thrust swords of light down through the boughs the air was thick with resin smells the silence was overwhelming we moved one step at a time making sure our footfalls sent no warnings ahead my nervousness peaked out began to fade it was too late to run too late to change my mind my brain bancelled allemotion usually that only happened when i was forced to treat casualties while people werekilling one another all around me raven signaled a halt i nodded i had heard it too a horse snorting raven gestured for me to stay put he eased to our left keeping low and disappeared behind a tree about fifty feet away he reappeared in a minute beckoned i joined him he led me to a spot from which i could look into an open area the limper and his horse were there the clearing was maybe seventy feet long by fifty wide a tumble of crumbling stone stood at its center the limper sat on one fallen rock and leaned against another he seemed to be sleeping one corner of the clearing was occupied by the trunk of a fallen giant that had not been down long it showed very little weathering raven tapped the back of my hand pointed he wanted to move on i did not like moving now that we had the limper in sight each step meant another chance to alert the taken to his peril but raven was right the sun was dropping in front of us the longer we stayed put the worse the light would become eventually it would be in our eyes we moved with exaggerated care of course one mistake and we were dead when raven glanced back i saw sweat on his temples he stopped pointed smiled i crept up beside him he pointed again another fallen tree lay ahead this one was about four feet in diameter it looked perfect for our purpose it was big enough to hide us low enough to let fly over we found a spot providing a clean aisle of fire to the heart of the clearing the light was good too several spears broke through the canopy and illuminated most of the clearing there was a little haze in the air pollen perhaps which made the beams stand out i studied the clearing for several minutes imprinting it on my mind then i sat behind the log and pretended i was a rock raven took the watch it seemed weeks passed before anything happened raven tapped my shoulder i looked up he made a walking motion with two fingers the limper was up and prowling i rose carefully watched the limper circled the pile of stones a few times bad leg dragging then sat down again he picked up a twig and broke it into small pieces tossing each at some target only he could see when the twig was gone he scooped up a handful of small cones and threw them lazily portrait of a man killing time i wondered why he had come on horseback he could get places fast when he wanted i supposed because he had been close by then i worried that some of his troops might show up he got up and walked around again collecting cones and chucking them at the fallen behemoth across the clearing damned but i wished we could take him then and have done the limpers mounts head jerked up the animal whickered raven and i sank down crushed ourselves into the shadows and needles beneath our trunk a crackling tension radiated from the clearing a moment later i heard hooves crunching needles i held my breath from the corner of my eye i caught flickers of a white horse moving among the trees whisper would she see us yes and no thank whatever gods there are yes and no she passed within fifty feet without noticing us the limper called something whisper replied in a melodious voice that did not at all fit the wide hard homely woman i had seen pass she sounded seventeen and gorgeous looked fortyfive and like she had been around the world three times raven prodded me gently i rose about as fast as a flower blooms scared they would hear my sinews crackle we peeped over the fallen tree whisper dismounted and took one of the limpers hands in both of hers the situation could not have been more perfect we were in shadow they were fixed in a shaft of sunlight golden dust sparkled around them and they were restricting one another by holding hands it had to be now we both knew it both bent our bows we both had additional arrows gripped against our weapons ready to be snapped to our strings now raven said my nerves did not bother me till my arrow was in the air then i went cold and shaky ravens shaft went in under the limpers left arm the taken made a sound like a rat getting stomped he arched away from whisper my shaft smashed against whispers temple she was wearing a leather helmet but i was confident the impact would down her she spun away from the limper raven sped a second arrow i fumbled mine i dropped my bow and vaulted over the log ravens third arrow whistled past me whisper was on her knees when i arrived i kicked her in the head whirled to face the limper ravens arrows had struck home but even catchers special shaft had not ended the takens story he was trying to growl out a spell through a throat filled with blood i kicked him too then raven was there with me i spun back to whisper that bitch was as tough as her reputation woozy as she was she was trying to get up trying to draw her sword trying to mouth a spell i scrambled her brains again got rid of her blade i didnt bring any cord i gasped you bring any cord raven no he just stood there staring at the limper the takens battered leather mask had slipped sideways he was trying to straighten it so he could see who we were how the hell am i going to tie her up better worry about gagging her first raven helped the limper with his mask smiling that incredibly cruel smile he gets when he is about to cut a special throat i yanked out my knife and hacked at whispers clothing she fought me i had to keep knocking her down finally i had strips of rag to bind her and to stuff into her mouth i dragged her over to the pile of stones propped her up turned to see what raven was doing he had ripped the limpers mask away exposing the desolation of the takens face what are you doing i asked he was binding the limper i wondered why he was bothering got to thinking maybe i dont have the talent to handle this he dropped into a squat and patted the limpers cheek the limper radiated hatred you know me croaker im an old softy id just kill him and be satisfied but he deserves a harder death catcher has more experience in these things he chuckled wickedly the limper strained against his bonds despite the three arrows he seemed normally strong even vigorous the shafts certainly did not inconvenience him raven patted his cheek again hey old buddy word of warning one friend to another wasnt that what you told me about an hour before morningstar and her friends ambushed me in that place you sent me word of warning yeah look out for soulcatcher he got a hold of your true name character like that theres no telling what he might do i said take it easy on the gloating raven watch him hes doing something with his fingers he was wriggling them rhythmically aye raven shouted laughing he grabbed the sword i had taken from whisper and chopped fingers off each of the limpers hands raven rides me for not telling the whole truth in these annals someday maybe he will look at this and be sorry but honestly he was not nice people that day i had a similar problem with whisper i chose a different solution i cut off her hair and used it to tangle her fingers together raven tormented the limper till i could stand no more raven thats really enough why dont you back off and keep them covered he had been given no specific instructions about what to do after we captured whisper but i figured the lady would tell catcher and he would drop in we just had to keep things under control till he arrived soulcatchers magic carpet dropped from the sky half an hour after i chased raven away from the limper it settled a few feet from our captives catcher stepped off stretched looked down at whisper he sighed observed not a pretty sight whisper in that businesslike female voice but then you never were yes my friend croaker found the buried packets whispers hard cold eyes sought me they were informed with a savage impact rather than face that i moved i did not correct soulcatcher he turned to the limper shook his head sadly no its not personal you used up your credit she ordered this the limper went rigid soulcatcher asked raven why didnt you kill him raven sat on the trunk of the larger fallen tree bow across his lap staring at the earth he did not reply i said he figured you could think of something better catcher laughed i thought about it corning over here nothing seemed adequate im taking ravens way out i told shifter hes on his way he looked down at the limper youre in trouble arent you to me youd think a man this old would have garnered some wisdom along the way he turned to raven raven he was the ladys reward to you raven grunted i appreciate it i had figured that out already but i was supposed to get something out of this too and i had not seen anything remotely fulfilling any dream of mine soulcatcher did his mindreading trick yours has changed i think it hasnt been delivered yet make yourself comfortable croaker well be here a long time i went and sat beside raven we did not talk there was nothing i wanted to say and he was lost somewhere inside himself like i said a man cannot live on hatred alone soulcatcher doublechecked our captives bonds dragged his carpet rack into the shadows then perched himself on the stone pile shapeshifter arrived twenty minutes later as huge ugly dirty and stinking as ever he looked the limper over conferred with catcher growled at the limper for half a minute then remounted his flying carpet and soared away catcher explained hes passing it on too nobody wants the final responsibility who could he pass it to i wondered the limper had no heavy enemies left catcher shrugged and returned to the stone pile he muttered in a dozen voices drawing into himself almost shrinking i think he was as happy to be there as was i time trudged on the slant of the bars of sunlight gi ever steeper one after another winked out i began to wonder if ravens suspicions had not been correct we would be easy pickings after dark the taken do not need the sun to see i looked at raven what was happening inside his head his face was a morose blank it was the face he wore while playing cards i dropped off the log and prowled following the pattern set by the limper there was nothing else to do i whipped a pine cone at a burl on the log raven and i had used for cover and it ducked i started a headlong charge toward whispers bloody sword before i fully realiwed what i had seen whats wrong soulcatcher asked as i pulled up i improvised pulled muscle i think i was going to loosen up with some sprints but something happened in my leg i massaged my right calf he seemed satisfied i glanced toward the log saw nothing but i knew silent was there would be there if he was needed silent how the hell had he gotten here same way as the rest of us did he have tricks that nobody suspected after the appropriate theatrics i limped over and joined raven by gesturing i tried to make him understand that we would have help if push came to shove but the message did not penetrate he was too withdrawn it was dark there was a half moon overhead poking a few mild silvery bars into the clearing catcher remained on the stone pile raven and i remained on the log my behind was aching my nerves were raw i was tired and hungry and scared i had had enough but did not have the courage to say so raven shed his funk suddenly he assayed the situation asked what the hell are we doing soulcatcher woke up waiting shouldnt be much longer waiting for what i demanded i can be brave with raven backing me soulcatcher stared my way i became aware of an unnatural stir in the grove behind me of raven coiling himself for action waiting for what i repeated weakly for me physician i felt the speakers breath on the back of my neck i jumped halfway to catcher and did not stop till i reached whispers blade catcher laughed i wondered if he had noticed that my leg had gotten better i glanced at the smaller log nothing a glorious light poured over the log i had quitted i did not see raven he had vanished i gripped whispers sword and resolved to lay a good one on soulcatcher the light floated over the fallen giant settled in front of catcher it was too brilliant to look at long it illuminated the whole clearing soulcatcher dropped to one knee and then i understood the lady this fiery glory was the lady we had been waiting for the lady i stared till my eyes ached and dropped to one knee myself i offered whispers sword on my palms like a knight doing homage to his king the lady was this my reward to actually meet her that something that called to me from charm twisted filled me and for one foolish instant i was totally in love but i could not see her wanted to see what she looked like she had that capacity i found so disconcerting in soulcatcher not this time croaker she said but soon i think she touched my hand her fingers burned me like the first sexual touch of my first lover remember that racing stunning raging instant of excitement the reward comes later this time youll be permitted to witness a rite unseen for five hundred years she moved that has to be uncomfortable get up i rose backed away soulcatcher stood in his parade rest stance watching the light its intensity was falling i could watch without pain it drifted around the stone pile to our prisoners waning till i could discern a feminine shape inside the lady looked at the limper a long time the limper looked back his face was empty he was beyond hope or despair the lady said you served me well for a while and your treachery helped more than it hurt i am not without mercy she flared on one side a shadow diminished there stood raven arrow across bow hes yours raven i looked at the limper he betrayed excitement and a strange hope not that he would survive of course but that he would die quickly simply painlessly raven said no nothing else just a flat refusal the lady mused too bad limper she arched back and screamed something at the sky limper flopped violently the gag flew out of his mouth his ankle bonds parted he gained his feet tried to run tried to mouth some spell that would protect him he had gone thirty feet when a thousand fiery snakes streaked out of the night and swarmed him they covered his body they slithered into his mouth and nose into his eyes and ears they went in the easy way and came gnawing out through his back and chest and belly and he screamed and screamed and screamed and the same terrible vitality which had fought off the lethality of ravens arrows kept him alive throughout this punishment i heaved up the jerky that had been my only meal all day the limper was a long time screaming and never did die eventually the lady tired and sent the serpents away she spun a whispery cocoon around the limper shouted another series of syllables a gigantic luminescent dragonfly dropped from the night snapped him up and hummed away toward charm the lady said hell provide years of entertainment she glanced at soulcatcher making sure the lesson had not gone over his head catcher had not moved a muscle he did not do so now the lady said croaker what you are about to witness exists only in a few memories even most of my champions have forgotten what the hell was she talking about she looked down whisper cringed the lady said no not all that youve been such an outstanding enemy im going to reward you strange laughter there is a vacancy among the taken so the blunted arrow the weird circumstances leading to that moment came clear the lady had decided that whisper should replace the limper when just when had she made that decision the limper had been in bad trouble for a year suffering one humiliation after another had she orchestrated those i think she had a clue here a clue there a strand of gossip and a stray memory catcher had been in on part of it using us maybe he had been in on it as far back as when he had enlisted us surely our crossing paths with raven had been no accident ah she was a cruel wicked deceitful calculating bitch but everyone knew that that was her story she had dispossessed her own husband she had murdered her sister if soulcatcher could be believed so why was i disappointed and surprised i glanced at catcher he had not moved but there was subtle change in his stance he was dazed by surprise yes the lady told him you thought only the dominator could take soft laughter you were wrong pass that along to anyone still thinking about resurrecting my husband catcher moved slightly i could not read the movements significance but the lady seemed satisfied she faced whisper again the rebel general was more terrified than the limper had been she was about to become the thing she hated mostand she could do nothing the lady knelt and began whispering to her i watched and still i do not know what went on nor can i describe the lady any more than goblin could despite having been near her all night or maybe for several nights time had a surreal quality we lost some days somewhere but see her i did and i witnessed the rite that converted our most dangerous enemy into one of our own i recall one thing with a razoredged clarity a huge yellow eye the same eye that so croggled goblin it came and looked into me and raven and whisper it did not shatter me the way it had goblin maybe i am less sensitive or just more ignorant but it was bad like i said some days disappeared that eye is not infallible it does not do well with short term memories the lady remained unaware of silents proximity of the rest of it there are only flickers of recollection most filled with whispers screams there was a moment when the clearing filled with dancing devils all glowing with their inner wickedness they fought for the privilege of mounting whisperthere was a time when whisper faced the eye a time when i think whisper died and was resurrected died and was resurrected till she became intimate with death there were times when she was tortured and another time with the eye the fragments i retain suggest that she was shattered slain revived and reassembled as a devoted slave j recall her pledge of fealty to the lady her voice dripped a craven eagerness to please long after it was over i wakened confused and lost and terrified it took a while to reason out the confusion was part of the ladys protective coloration what i could not remember could not be used against her some reward she was gone likewise whisper but soulcatcher remained pacing the clearing muttering in a dozen frantic voices he fell silent the instant i tried to sit up he stared head thrust forward suspiciously i groaned tried to rise fell back i crawled over and propped myself on one of the stones catcher brought me a canteen i drank clumsily he said you can eat after you pull yourself together which remark alerted me to ravenous hunger how long had it been what happened what do you remember not much whisper was taken shes replacing limper the lady took her to the eastern front her knowledge of the other side should shake things loose out there i tried to shake the cobwebs i thought they were shifting to a northern strategy they are and as soon as your mend recovers we have to return to lords in a soft female voice he admitted i didnt know whisper as well as i thought she did pass the word when she learned what happened at her camp for once the circle responded quickly they avoided the usual infighting they smell blood they accepted their losses and let us divert ourselves while they started their maneuvers kept them damned well hidden now hardens army is headed toward lords our forces are still scattered throughout the forest she turned the trap around on us i did not want to hear it a year of bad news is enough why couldnt one of our coups remain solid she sacrificed herself intentionally no she wanted to run us around the woods to buy time for the circle she didnt know the lady knew about the limper i thought i knew her but i was wrong well benefit eventually but there are going to be hard times till whisper straightens out the east i tried to rise could not take it easy he suggested first time with the eye is always rough think you could eat something now drag one of those horses over here better go easy at first how bad is it i was not quite sure what i was asking he assumed i meant the strategic situation hardens army is bigger than any weve yet faced up here and its only one of the groups that are on the move if nightcrawler doesnt reach lords first well lose the city and kingdom which might give them the momentum to drive us out of the north entirely our forces at wist jane wine and so forth arent up to a major campaign the north has been a sideshow till now but after all weve been through were worse off than when we lost roses damn that isnt fair i was tired of retreating not to worry croaker if lords goes well stop them at the stair of tear well hold them there while whisper runs wild they cant ignore her forever if the east collapses the rebellion will die the east is their strength he sounded like a man trying to convince himself he had been through these oscillations before during the last days of the domination i buried my head in my hands muttered i thought we had them whipped why the hell had we left beryl soulcatcher prodded raven with a toe raven did not stir come on catcher grumbled they need me at lords nightcrawler and i may end up trying to hold the city by ourselves why didnt you just leave us if the situation is so critical he hemmed and hawed and slid around it and before he finished i suspected that this one taken had a sense of honor a sense of duty toward those who had accepted his protection he would not admit it though never that would not fit the image of the taken i thought about another journey through the sky i thought hard i am as lazy as the next guy but i could not take that not now not feeling the way i did id fall off for sure theres no point you hanging around we wont be ready for days hell we can walk out i thought about the forest walking did not appeal to me either give us our badges back so you can locate us again then you can pick us up if you get time he grumbled we batted it back and forth i kept on about how shaky i was about how shaky raven would be he was anxious to get moving he let me convince him he unloaded his carpethe had gone somewhere while i was unconsciousand climbed aboard ill see you in a few days his carpet rose far faster than it had done with raven and i aboard and then it was gone i dragged myself to the things he had left behind you bastard i chuckled his protest had been a shuck he had left food our own weapons that we had left in lords and odds and ends we might need to survive not a bad boss for one of the taken hey silent where the hell are you silent drifted into the clearing he looked at me at raven at the supplies and did not say anything of course not he is silent he looked ragged around the edges not enough sleep i asked he nodded you see what happened here he nodded again i hope you remember it better than i do he shook his head damn so it will go into the annals unclear it is a weird way to hold a conversation one man talking and the other headshaking getting information across can be incredibly difficult i should study the communicative gestures raven has learned from darling silent is her second best friend it would be interesting just to eavesdrop on their conversations lets see what we can do for raven i suggested raven was sleeping the sleep of the exhausted he did not come out of it for hours i used the interim to interrogate silent the captain had sent him he had come on horseback he was in fact on his way before raven and i were summoned for our interview with soulcatcher he had ridden hard day and night he had reached the clearing only a short while before i spotted him i asked how he had known where to go granting that the captain would have nursed enough information from catcher to get him starteda move which fit the captains style silent admitted he had not known where he was headed except generally till we had reached the area then he had tracked us through the amulet goblin had given me crafty little goblin he had not betrayed a hint good thing too the eye would have found the knowledge you think you could have done something if wed really needed help i asked silent smiled shrugged stalked over to the stone pile and seated himself he was done with the question game of all the company he is the least concerned about the image he will present in the annals he does not carewhether people like or hate him does not care where he has been or where he is going sometimes i wonder if he cares whether he lives or dies wonder what makes him stay he must have some attachment to the company raven finally came around we nursed him and fed him and finally bedraggled we rounded up whispers and the limpers horses and headed for lords we traveled without enthusiasm knowing we were headed for another battlefield another land of standing dead men we could not get close hardens rebels had the city besieged circumvallated and bottled in a double fosse a grim black cloud concealed the city itself cruel lightning rambled its edges dueling the might of the eighteen harden had not come alone the circle seemed determined to avenge whisper catcher and nightcrawler are playing rough raven observed after one particularly violent exchange i suggest we drift south and wait if they abandon lords well join back up when they run toward the windy country his face twisted horribly he did not relish that prospect he knew the windy country so south we scooted and joined up with other stragglers we spent twelve days in hiding waiting raven organized the stragglers into the semblance of a military unit i passed the time writing and thinking about whisper wondering how much she would influence the eastern situation the rare glimpses i got of lords convinced me that she was our sides last real hope rumor had the rebel applying just as much pressure elsewhere the lady supposedly had to transfer the hanged man and bonegnasher from the east to stiffen resistance one rumor had shapeshifter slain in the fighting at rye i worried about the company our brethren had gotten into lords before hardens arrival not a man falls without my telling his tale how can i do that from twenty miles away how many details will be lost in the oral histories i will have to collect after the fact how many men will fall without their deaths being observed at all but mostly i spend my time thinking about the limper and the lady and agonizing i do not think that i will be writing any more cute romantic fantasies about our employer i have been too close to her i am not in love now i am a haunted man i am haunted by the limpers screams i am haunted by the ladys laughter i am haunted by my suspicion that we are furthering the cause of something that deserves to be scrubbed from the face of the earth i am haunted by the conviction that those bent upon the ladys eradication are little better than she i am haunted by the clear knowledge that in the end evil always triumphs oh my trouble there is a nasty black cloud crawling over the hills to the northeast everybody is running around grabbing weapons and saddling horses raven is yelling at me to get my butt moving chapter five harden the wind howled and flung blasts of dust and sand against our backs we retreated into it walking backward the gritty storm finding every gap in armor and clothing combining with sweat in a stinking salty mud the air was hot and dry it sucked the moisture away quickly leaving the mud dried in clots we all had lips cracked and swollen tongues like moldy pillows choking on the grit crusting the insides of our mouths stormbringer had gotten carried away we were suffering almost as much as was the rebel visibility was a scant dozen yards i could barely see the men to my right and left and only two guys in the rearguard line walking backward before me knowing our enemies had to come after us facing into the wind did not cheer me much the men in the other line suddenly scuttled around plying their bows tall somethings loomed out of the swirling dust cloakshadows swirling around them flapping like vast wings i drew my bow and let fly sure my shaft would drift astray it did not a horseman threw up his hands his animal whirled and ran before the wind pursuing riderless companions they were pushing hard keeping close trying to pick us off before we escaped the windy country to the more defensible stair of tear they wanted every man of us stretched dead and plundered beneath the unforgiving desert sun step back step back so damned slow but there was no choice if we turned our backs they would swarm over us we had to make them pay for every approach to intimidate their exuberance thoroughly stormbringers sending was our best armor the windy country is wild and brisk at the best of times flat barren and dry uninhabited a place where sandstorms are common but never had it seen a storm like this that went on hour after hour and day after day relenting only in the hours of darkness it made the windy country no fit place for any living thing and only that kept the company alive there were three thousand of us now falling back before the inexorable tide that had swamped lords our little brotherhood by refusing to break had become the nucleus to which the fugitives from the disaster had attached themselves once the captain had fought his way through the siege lines we had become the brains and nerves of this fleeing shadow of an army the lady herself had sent orders for all imperial officers to defer to the captain only the company had produced any signal successes during the northern campaign someone came out of the dust and howl behind me tapped my shoulder i whirled it was not yet time to leave the line raven faced me the captain had figured out where i was ravens whole head was wrapped in rags i squinted one hand raised to block the biting sand he screamed something like ta kata wa ya i shook my head he pointed rearward grabbed me yelled into my ear the captain wants you of course he did i nodded handed over bow and arrows leaned into the wind and grit weapons were in short supply the arrows i had given him were spent rebel shafts gleaned after they had come wobbling out of the brownish haze trudge trudge trudge sand pattering against the top of my head as i walked with chin against chest hunched eyes slitted i did not want to go back the captain was not going to say anything i wanted to hear a big bush came spinning and bounding toward me it nearly bowled me over i laughed we had shapeshifter with us the rebel would waste a lot of arrows when that hit their lines they outnumbered us ten or fifteen to one but numbers could not soften their fear of the taken i stamped into the fangs of the wind till i was sure i had gone too far or had lost my bearings it was always the same after i decided to give up there it was the miraculous isle of peace i entered it staggering in the sudden absence of wind my ears roared refusing to believe the quiet thirty wagons rolled along in tight formation inside the quiet wheel to wheel most were filled with casualties a thousand men surrounded the wagons tramping doggedly southward they stared at the earth and dreaded the coming of their turns out on the line there was no conversation no exchange of witticisms they had seen too many retreats they followed the captain only because he promised a chance to survive croaker over here the lieutenant beckoned me from the formations extreme right flank the captain looked like a naturally surly bear wakened from hibernation prematurely the grey at his temples wriggled as he chewed his words before spitting them out his face sagged his eyes were dark hollows his voice was infinitely tired thought i told you to stick around it was my turn you dont take a turn croaker let me see if i can put it into words simple enough for you we have three thousand men were in continuous contact with the rebel weve got one halfassed witchdoctor and one real doctor to take care of those boys oneeye has to spend half his energy helping maintain this dome of peace which leaves you to carry the medical load which means you dont risk yourself out on the line not for any reason i stared into the emptiness above his left shoulder scowling at the sand swirling around the sheltered area am i getting through croaker am i making myself clear i appreciate your devotion to the annals your determination to get the feel of the action but i bobbed my head glanced at the wagons and their sad burdens so many wounded and so little i could do for them he did not see the helpless feeling that caused all i could do was sew them up and pray and make the dying comfortable till they wentwhereupon we dumped them to make room for newcomers too many were lost who need not have been had i had time trained help and a decent surgery why did i go out to the battle line because i could accomplish something there i could strike back at our tormentors croaker the captain growled i get the feeling youre not listening yes sir understood sir ill stay here and tend to my sewing don look so bleak he touched my shoulder catcher says well reach the stair of tear tomorrow then we can do what we all want bloody hardens nose harden had become the senior rebel general did he say how were going to manage that outnumbered a skillion to one the captain scowled he did his shuffling little bear dance while he phrased a reassuring answer three thousand exhausted beaten men turn back hardens victoryhopped horde not bloody likely not even with three of the ten who were taken helping i thought not i sneered thats not your department though is it catcher doesnt secondguess your surgical procedures does he then why question the grand strategy i grinned the unwritten law of all armies captain the lower ranks have the privilege of questioning the sanity and competence of their commanders its the mortar holding an army together the captain eyed me from his shorter stature wider displacement and from beneath shaggy brows that holds them together eh and you know what keeps them moving whats that guys like me asskicking guys like you when they start philosophizing if you get my drift i believe i do sir i moved out recovered my kit from the wagon where i had stashed it went to work there were few new casualties rebel ambition was wearing down under stormbringers ceaseless assault i was loafing along waiting for a call when i spotted elmo loping out of the weather i hadnt seen him for days he fell in beside the captain i ambled over sweep around our right he was saying maybe trying to reach the stair first he glanced at me lifted a hand in greeting it shook he was pallid with weariness like the captain he had had little rest since we had entered the windy country pull a company out of reserve take them in flank the captain replied hit them hard and stand fast they wont expect that itll shake them make them wonder what were up to yes sir elmo turned to go elmo sir be careful out there save your energy were going to keep moving tonight elmos eyes spoke tortured volumes but he did not question his orders he is a good soldier and as did i he knew they came from above the captains head perhaps from the tower itself hitherto night had brought a tacit truce the rigors of the days had left both armies unwilling to take one needless step after dark there had been no nighttime contact even those hours of respite when the storm slept were not enough to keep the armies from marching with their butts drooping against their heels now our high lords wanted an extra effort hoping to gain some tactical advantage get to the stair by night get dug in make the rebel come at us out of perpetual storm it made sense but it was the sort of move ordered by an armchair general three hundred miles behind the fighting you hear that the captain asked me yeah sounds dumb i agree with the taken croaker the travelling will be easier for us and more difficult for the rebel are you caught up yes then try to stay out of the way go hitch a ride fake a nap i wandered away cursing the ill fortune that had stripped us of most of our mounts gods walking was getting old i did not take the captains advice though it was sound i was too keyed up to rest the prospect of a night march had shaken me i roamed around seeking old friends the company had scattered throughout the larger mob as cadre for the captains will some men i hadnt seen since lords i did not know if they were still alive i could find no one but goblin oneeye and silent today goblin and oneeye were no more communicative than silent which said a lot about morale they trudged doggedly onward eyes on the dry earth only rarely making some gesture or muttering some word to maintain the integrity of our bubble of peace i trudged with them finally i tried breaking the ice with a hi goblin grunted oneeye gave me a few seconds of evil stare silent did not acknowledge my existence captain says were going to march through the night i told them i had to make someone else as miserable as i was goblins look asked me why i wanted to tell that kind of lie oneeye muttered something about turning the bastard into a toad the bastard youre going to have to turn is soulcatcher i said smugly he gave me another evil look maybe ill practice on you croaker oneeye did not like the night march so goblin immediately approved the genius of the man who had initiated the idea but his enthusiasm was so slight oneeye did not bother taking the bait i thought i would give it another try you guys look as sour as i feel no rise not even a turn of the head be that way i drooped too put one foot ahead of the other blanked my mind they came and got me to take care of elmos wounded there were a dozen of them and that was it for the day the rebel had run out of do or die darkness came early under the storm we went about business as usual we got a little away from the rebel waited for the storm to abate pitched a camp with fires built of whatever brush could be scrounged only this time it was just a brief rest till the stars came out they stared down with mockery in their twinkles saying all our sweat and blood really had no meaning in the long eye of time nothing we did would be recalled a thousand years from now such thoughts infected us all no one had any ideals or glorylust left we just wanted to get somewhere lie down and forget the war the war would not forget us as soon as he believed the rebel to be satisfied that we were encamped the captain resumed the march now in a ragged column snaking slowly across moonlighted barrens hours passed and we seemed to get nowhere the land never changed i glanced back occasionally checking the renewed storm stormbringer was hurling against the rebel camp lightning rippled and flickered in this one it was more furious than anything they had faced so far the shadowed stair of tear materialized so slowly that it was there for an hour before i realized it was not a bank of cloud low on the horizon the stars began to fade and the east to lighten before the land started rising the stair of tear is a rugged wild range virtually impassable except for the one steep pass from which the cordillera takes its name the land rises gradually till it reaches sudden towering red sandstone bluffs and mesas which stretch either way for hundreds of miles in the morning sun they looked like the weathered battlements of a giants fortress the column wound into a canyon choked with talus halted while a path was cleared for the wagons i dragged myself to a bluff top and watched the storm it was moving our way would we get through before harden arrived the blockage was a fresh fall which covered only a quarter mile of road beyond it lay the route traveled by caravans before the war interrupted trade i faced the storm again harden was making good time i suppose anger drove him he was not about to turn loose we had killed his brotherinlaw and had engineered the taking of his cousin movement to the west caught my eye a whole range of ferocious thunderheads was moving toward harden rumbling and brawling among themselves a funnel cloud spun off and streaked toward the sandstorm the taken play rough harden was stubborn he kept coming through everything yo croaker someone shouted come on i looked down the wagons were through the worst time to go out on the flats the thunderheads spun off another funnel cloud i almost felt sorry for hardens men soon after i rejoined the column the ground shuddered the bluff i had climbed quivered groaned toppled sprawled across the road another little gift for harden we reached our stopping place shortly before nightfall decent country at last real trees a gurgling creek those who had any strength left began digging in or cooking the rest fell in their tracks the captain did not press the best medicine at the moment was the simple freedom to rest i slept like the proverbial log oneeye wakened me at rooster time lets get to work he said the captain wants a hospital set up he made a face his looks like a prune at the best of times were supposed to have some help coming up from charm i groaned and moaned and cursed and got up every muscle was stiff every bone ached next time were someplace civilized enough to have taverns remind me to drink a toast to eternal peace i grumbled oneeye im ready to retire so who isnt but youre the annalist croaker youre always rubbing our noses in tradition you know you only got two ways out while weve got this commission dead or feet first shove some chow in your ugly face and lets get cracking i got more important things to do than play nursemaid cheerful this morning arent we positively rosy he grumped around while i got myself into an approximation of order the camp was coming to life men were eating and washing the desert off their bodies they were cussing and fussing and bitching some were even talking to one another the recovery had begun sergeants and officers were out surveying the lie of the slope seeking the most defensible strongpoints this then was the place where the taken wanted to make a stand it was a good spot it was that part of the pass which gave the stair its name a twelve hundred foot rise overlooking a maze of canyons the old road wound back and forth across the mountainside in countless switchbacks so that from a distance it looked like a giants lopsided stairway oneeye and i drafted a dozen men and began moving the wounded to a quiet grove well above the prospective battleground we spent an hour making them comfortable and getting set for future business whats that oneeye suddenly demanded i listened the din of preparation had died something up i said genius he countered probably the people from charm lets take a look i tramped out of the grove and down toward the captains headquarters the newcomers were obvious the moment i left the trees i would guess there were a thousand of them half soldiers from the ladys personal guard in brilliant uniforms the rest apparently teamsters the tram of wagons and livestock were more exciting than the reinforcements feast time tonight i called to oneeye who was following me he looked the wagons over and smiled pure pleasure smiles from him are only slightly more common than the fabled hens teeth they are certainly worth recording in these annals with the guards battalion was the taken called the hanged man he was improbably tall and lean his head was twisted way over to one side his neck was swollen and purpled from the bite of a noose his face was frozen into the bloated expression of one who has been strangled i expect he had considerable difficulty speaking he was the fifth of the taken i had seen following soulcatcher the limper shapeshifter and whisper i missed nightcrawler in lords and had not yet seen stormbringer despite proximity the hanged man was different the others usually wore something to conceal head and face excepting whisper they had spent ages in the ground the grave had not treated them kindly soulcatcher and shapeshifter were there to greet the hanged man the captain was nearby back to them listening to the commander of the ladys guardsmen i eased closer hoping to eavesdrop the guardsman was being surly because he had to place himself at the captains disposal none of the regulars liked taking orders from a comelately mercenary from overseas i sidled nearer the taken and found i could not understand a word of their conversation they were speak tellekurre which had died with the fall of the domination a hand touched mine lightly startled i looked down into the wide brown eyes of darling whom i had not seen for days she made rapid gestures with her fingers i have been learning her signs she wanted to show me something she led me to ravens tent which was not far from the captains she scrambled inside returned with a wooden doll loving craftsmanship had gone into its creation i could not imagine the hours raven must have put into it i could not imagine where he had found them darling slowed her finger talk so i could follow more easily i was not yet very facile she told me raven made the doll as i had guessed and that now he was sewing up a wardrobe she thought she had a great treasure recalling the village where we had found her i could not doubt that it was the finest toy she had ever possessed revealing object when you think about raven who comes across so bitter cold and silent whose only use for a knife seems so sinister darling and i conversed for several minutes her thoughts are delightfully straightforward a refreshing contrast in a world filled with devious prevaricating unpredictable scheming people a hand squeezed my shoulder halfway between angry and companionable the captain is looking for you croaker ravens dark eyes glinted like obsidian under a quarter moon he pretended the doll was invisible he likes to come across hard i realized right i said making manual goodbyes i enjoyed learning from darling she enjoyed teaching me i think it gave her a feeling of worth the captain was considering having everyone learn her sign language it would make a valuable supplement to our traditional but inadequate battle signals the captain gave me a black look when i arrived but spared me a lecture your new help and supplies are over yonder show them where to go yes sir the responsibility was getting to him he hadnt ever commanded so many men nor faced conditions so adverse with orders so impossible staring at a future so uncertain from where he stood it looked like we would be sacrificed to buy time we of the company are not enthusiastic fighters but the stair of tear could not be held by trickery it looked like the end had come no one will sing songs in our memory we are the last of the free companies of khatovar our traditions and memories live only in these annals we are our only mourners it is the company against the world thus it has been and ever will be my aid from the lady consisted of two qualified battlefield surgeons and a dozen trainees of various degrees of skill along with a brace of wagons brimming with medical supplies i was grateful now i stood a chance of saving a few men i took the newcomers to my grove explained how i worked turned them loose on my patients after making sure they were not complete incompetents i turned the hospital over and left i was restless i did not like what was happening to the company it had acquired too many new followers and responsibilities the old intimacy was gone time was i saw every one of the men every day now there were some i had not seen since before the debacle at lords i did not know if they were dead alive or captive i was almost neurotically anxious that some men had been lost and would be forgotten the company is our family the brotherhood makes it go these days with all these new northern faces the prime force holding the company together is a desperate effort by the brethren to reachieve the old intimacy the strain of trying marks every face i went out to one of the forward watchpoints which overlooked the fall of the brook into the canyons way way down there below the mist lay a small glimmering pool a thin trickle left it running toward the windy country it would not complete its journey i searched the chaotic ranks of sandstone towers and buttes thunderheads with lightning swords aflash on their brows grumbled and pounded the badlands reminding me that trouble was not far away harden was coming despite stormbringers wrath he would make contact tomorrow i guessed i wondered how much the storms had hurt him surely not enough i spied a brown hulk shambling down the switchback road shapeshifter going out to practice his special terrors he could enter the rebel camp as one of them practice poison magics upon their cookpots or fill their drinking water with disease he could become the shadow in the darkness that all men fear taking them one at a time leaving only mangled remains to fill the living with terror i envied him even while i loathed him the stars twinkled above the campfire it had burned low while some of us old hands played tonk i was a slight winner i said im quitting while im ahead anybody want my place i unwound my aching legs and moved away settled against a log stared at the sky the stars seemed merry and friendly the air was cool and fresh and still the camp was quiet crickets and nightbirds sang their soothing songs the world was at peace it was hard to believe that this place was soon to become a battlefield i wriggled till i was comfortable watched for shooting stars i was determined to enjoy the moment it might be the last such i would know the fire spit and crackled somebody found ambition enough to add a little wood it blazed up sent piney smoke drifting my way launched shadows which danced over the intent faces of the card players oneeyes lips were taut because he was losing goblins frog mouth was stretched in an unconscious grin silent was a blank being silent elmo was thinking hard scowling as he calculated odds jolly was more sour than customary it was good to see jolly again i had feared him lost at lords only one puny meteor rolled across the sky i gave it up closed my eyes listened to my heartbeat harden is coming harden is coming it said it pounded out a drumbeat mimicking the tread of advancing legions raven settled down beside me quiet tonight he observed calm before the storm i replied whats cooking with the high and the mighty lot of argument the captain catcher and the new one are letting them yap letting them get it out of their systems whos ahead goblin oneeye isnt dealing from the bottom of the deck we never caught him i heard that oneeye growled one of these days raven i know zap im a frog prince croaker you been up the hill since it got dark no why something unusual over in the east looks like a comet my heart did a small flip i calculated quickly youre probably right its due back i rose he did too we walked uphill every major event in the saga of the lady and her husband has been presaged by a comet countless rebel prophets have predicted that she will fall while a comet is in the sky but their most dangerous prophecy concerns the child who will be a reincarnation of the white rose the circle is spending a lot of energy trying to locate the kid raven led me to a height from which we could see the stars lying low in the east sure enough something like a faraway silver spearhead rode the sky there i stared a long time before observing it seems to be pointed at charm i thought so too he was silent for a while im not much on prophecies croaker they sound too much like superstition but this makes me nervous youve heard those prophecies all your life id be surprised if they hadnt touched you he grunted not satisfied the hanged man brought news of the east whisper has taken rust good news good news i said with considerable sarcasm shes taken rust and surrounded trinkets army we can have the whole east by next summer we faced the canyon a few of hardens advance units had reached the foot of the switchbacks stormbringer had broken off her long assault in order to prepare for hardens attempt to break through here so it comes down to us i whispered we have to stop them here or the whole thing goes because of a sneak attack through the back way maybe but dont count the lady out even if we fail the rebel hasnt yet faced her and they know it to a man each mile they move toward the tower will fill them with greater dread terror itself will defeat them unless they find their prophesied child maybe we watched the comet it was far far away yet just barely detectable it would be up there a long time great battles would be fought before it departed i made a face maybe you shouldnt have shown me now ill dream about the damned thing raven flashed a rare grin dream us a victory he suggested i did some dreaming aloud weve got the high ground harden has to bring his men up twelve hundred feet of switchback theyll be easy meat when they get here whistling in the dark croaker im going to turn in good luck tomorrow same to you i replied he would be in the thick of it the captain had chosen him to command a battalion of veteran regulars they would be holding one flank sweeping the road with arrow flights i dreamed but my dreams were not what i expected a wavering golden thing came hovered above me glowing like shoals of faraway stars i was not sure whether i was asleep or awake and still have not satisfied myself either way i will call it dream because it sits more comfortably that way i do not like to think the lady had taken that much interest in me it was my own fault all those romances i wrote about her had gone to seed on the fertile stable floor of my imagination such presumption my dreams the lady herself send her spirit to comfort one silly warweary quietly frightened soldier in the name of heaven why that glow came and hovered above me and sent reassurances overtoned by harmonics of amusement fear not my faithful the stair of tear is not the lock of the empire it can be broken without harm whatever happens my faithful will remain safe the stair is but a milemark along the rebels road to destruction there was more all of a puzzlingly personal nature my wildest fantasies were being reflected back upon me at the end for just an instant a face peeked from the golden glow it was the most beautiful female face i have ever seen though i cannot now recall it next morning i told oneeye about the dream as i hounded my hospital into life he looked at me and shrugged too much imagination croaker he was preoccupied anxious to complete his medical chores and get gone he hated the work my work caught up i meandered toward the main encampment my head was stuffy and my mood sour the cool dry mountain air was not as invigorating as it should have been i found the temper of the men as sour as my own below hardens forces were moving part of winning is a downdeep certainty that no matter how bad things look a road to victory will open the company carried that conviction through the debacle at lords wed always found a way to bloody the rebels nose even while the ladys armies were in retreat now though the conviction has begun to waver forsberg roses lords and a dozen lesser defeats part of losing is the converse of winning v e were haunted by a secret fear that despite the obvious advantages of terrain and backing by the taken something would go wrong maybe they cooked it up themselves maybe the captain was behind it or even soulcatcher possibly it came about naturally as these things once did oneeye had trooped downhill behind me sour surly grumbling to himself and spoiling for a row his path crossed goblins slugabed goblin had just dragged out of his bedroll he had a bowl of water and was washing up he is a fastidious little wart oneeye spotted him and saw a chance to punish somebody with his foul mood he muttered a string of strange words and went into a curious little fling that looked half ballet and half primitive war dance goblins water changed i smelled it from twenty feet away it had turned a malignant brown sickening green gobs floated on its surface it even felt foul goblin rose with magnificent dignity turned he looked an evilly grinning oneeye in the eye for several seconds then he bowed when his head came up he wore a huge frog smile he opened his mouth and let fly the most godawful earthshaking howl i have ever heard they were off and damned be the fool who got in their way shadows scattered round oneeye wriggling across the earth like a thousand hasty serpents ghosts danced crawling from under rocks jumping down from trees hopping out of bushes the latter squealed and howled and giggled and chased oneeyes shadow snakes the ghosts stood two feet tall and very much resembled halfpint oneeyes with doubleugly faces and behinds like those of female baboons in season what they did with captured shadow snakes taste forbids me tell oneeye foiled leapt into the air he cursed shrieked foamed at the mouth to us old hands who had witnessed these hattermad battles before it was obvious that goblin had been laying in the weeds waiting for oneeye to start something this was one time when oneeye had more than a lone bolt to shoot he banished the snakes the rocks bushes and trees that had belched goblins critters now disgorged gigantic glossygreen dung beetles the big bugs jumped goblins elves rolled them right up and began tumblebugging them toward the edge of the cliff needless to say all the whoop and holler drew an audience laughter ripped out of us old hands long familiar with this endless duel it spread to the others once they realized this was not sorcery run amok goblins redbottomed ghosts sprouted roots and refused to be tumbled they grew into huge droolingmawed carnivorous plants fit to inhabit the crudest jungle of nightmare clicketyclacketycrunch all across the slope carapaces broke between closing vegetable jaws that spineshaking toothgrinding feeling you get when you crunch a big cockroach slithered across the slopes magnified a thousand times birthing a plague of shudders for a moment even oneeye remained motionless i glanced around the captain had come to watch he betrayed a satisfied smile it was a precious gem that smile rarer than rocs eggs his companions regular officers and guards captains appeared baffled someone took up position beside me at an intimate comradely distance i glanced sideways found myself shoulder to shoulder with soulcatcher or elbow to shoulder the taken does not stand very tall amusing yes he said in one of his thousand voices i nodded nervously oneeye shuddered all over jumped high in the air again wailed and howled then went down kicking and flopping like a man with the falling sickness the surviving beetles rushed together zipzap clicketyclack into two seething piles clacking their mandibles angrily scraping against one another chitinously brown smog wriggled from the piles in thick ropes twisted and joined became a curtain concealing the frenzied bugs the smoke contracted into globules which bounced bounding higher after each contact with the earth then they did not come down but rather drifted on the breeze sprouting what grew into gnarly digits what we had here were replicas of oneeyes horny paws a hundred times life size those hands went weedplucking through goblins monster garden ripping his plants up by the roots knotting their stems together in elegant complicated sailors knots forming an everelongating braid they do have more talent than one would suspect soulcatcher observed but so wasted on frivolity i dont know i gestured the show was having an invigorating effect on morale feeling a breath of that boldness which animates me at odd moments i suggested this is a sorcery they can appreciate unlike the oppressive bitter wizardries of the taken catchers black morion faced me for a few seconds i imagined fires burning behind the narrow eyeslits then a girlish giggle slipped forth youre right were so filled with doom and gloom and brooding and terror we infect whole armies one soon forgets the emotional panorama of life how odd i thought this was a taken with a chink in its armor a soulcatcher drawing aside one of the veils concealing its secret being the annalist in me caught the scent of a tale and began to bay catcher sidestepped me as though reading my thoughts you had a visitation last night the annalisthounds voice died in midcry i had a strange dream about the lady catcher chuckled a deep bass rumble that constant change of voices can rattle the most stolid of men it put me on the defensive his very comradeliness too disturbed me i think she favors you croaker some little thing about you has captured her imagination just as she has caught yours what did she have to say something way back told me to be careful catchers query was warm and offhand yet there was a hidden intensity there which said that the question was not at all casual just reassurances i replied something about the stair of tear not being all that critical in her scheme but it was only a dream of course he seemed satisfied only a dream but the voice was the female one he used when he was most serious the men were oohing and ahing i turned to check the progress of the contest goblins skein of pitcherplants had transmogrified into a huge airborne manofwar jellyfish the brown hands were entangled in its tentacles trying to tear themselves free and over the cliff face observing floated a giant pink face bearded surrounded by tangled orange hair one eye was half closed sleepily by a livid scar i frowned baffled whats that i knew it was not any doing of goblins or oneeyes and wondered if silent had joined the game just to show them up soulcatcher made a sound that was a creditable imitation of a birds dying squawk harden he said and whirled to face the captain bellowing to arms they come in seconds men were flying toward their positions the last hints of the struggle between goblin and oneeye became misty tatters floating on the wind drifting toward the leering harden face giving it a loathsome case of acne where they touched a cute fillip i thought but dont try to take him heads up boys he wont play games the answer to our scramble was a lot of hornblowing from below and a grumble of drums which echoed in the canyons like distant thunder the rebel poked at us all day but it was obvious that he was not serious that he was just prodding the hornets nest to see what would happen he was well aware of the difficulty of storming the stair all of which portended harden having something nasty up his sleeve overall though the skirmishes boosted morale the men began to believe there was a chance they could hold though the comet swam among the stars and a galaxy of campfires speckled the stair below the night gave the lie to my feeling that the stair was the heart of war i sat on an outcrop overlooking the enemy knees up under my chin musing on the latest news from the east whisper was besieging frost now after having finished trinkets army and having defeated moth and sidle among the talking menhirs of the plain of fear the east looked a worse disaster for the rebel than was the north for us it could get worse here moth and sidle and linger had joined harden others of the eighteen were down there as yet unidentified our enemies did smell blood i have never seen the northern auroras though i am told we would have gotten glimpses had we held oar and deal long enough to have wintered there the tales i have heard about those gentle gaudy lights make me think they are the only thing to compare with what took shape over the canyons as the rebel campfires dwindled long long thin banners of tenuous light twisted up toward the stars shimmering undulating like seaweed in a gentle current soft pinks and greens yellows and blues beautiful hues a phrase leapt into my mind an ancient name the pastel wars the company fought in the pastel wars long long ago i tried to recall what the annals said about those conflicts it would not all come to the fore but i remembered enough to become frightened i hurried toward the officers compound seeking soulcatcher i found him and told him what i remembered and he thanked me for my concern but said he was familiar with both the pastel wars and the rebel cabal sending up these lights we had no worries this attack had been anticipated and the hanged man was here to abort it take yourself a seat somewhere croaker goblin and oneeye put on their show now its the turn of the ten he oozed a confidence both strong and malignant so that i supposed the rebel had fallen into some taken trip i did as he suggested venturing back out to my lonely watchpost along the way i passed through a camp arouse by the growing spectacle a murmur of fear ran hither and yon rising and falling like the mutter of distant surf the colored streamers were stronger now and there was a frenetic jerkiness to their movements which suggested a thwarted will maybe catcher was right maybe this would come to nothing but a flashy show for the troops i resumed my perch the canyon bottom no longer twinkled it was a sea of ink down there not at all softened by the glow of the writhing streamers but if nothing could be seen plenty could be heard the acoustics of the land were remarkable harden was on the move only the advance of his entire army could generate so much metallic rattle and tinkle harden and his henchmen were confident too a soft green light banner floated up into the night fluttering lazily like a streamer of tissue in an updraft it faded as it rose and disintegrated into dying sparks high overhead what snipped it loose i wondered harden or the hanged man did this bode good or ill it was a subtle contest almost impossible to follow it was like watching superior fencers duel you could not follow everything unless you were an expert yourself goblin and oneeye had gone at it like a couple of barbarians with broadswords comparatively speaking little by little the colorful aurora died that had to be the doing of the hanged man the unanchored light banners did us no harm the racket below got closer where was stormbringer we had not heard from her for a while this seemed an ideal time to gift the rebel with miserable weather catcher too seemed to be laying down on the job in all the time we have been in service to the lady we have not seen him do anything really dramatic was he less mighty than his reputation or perhaps saving himself for some extremity only he foresaw something new was happening below the canyon walls had begun to glow in stripes and spots a deep deep red that was barely noticeable at first the red became brighter only after patches began to drip and ooze did i notice the hot draft riding up the cliff face great gods i murmured stricken here was a deed worthy of my expectations of the taken stone began to grumble and roar as molten rock ran away and left mountainsides undermined there were cries from below the cries of the hopeless who see doom coming and can do nothing to stay or evade it hardens men were being cooked and crushed they were in the witchs cauldron for sure but something made me uneasy anyway there seemed to be too little yelling for a force the size of hardens in spots the rock became so hot it caught fire the canyon expelled a furious updraft the wind howled over the hammering of falling rocks the light grew bright enough to betray rebel units climbing the switchbacks too few i thought a lonely figure on another outcrop caught my eye one of the taken though in the shifting uncertain light i could not be certain which it was nodding to itself as it observed the enemys travails the redness the melting the collapsing and burning spread till the whole panorama was veined with red and poked with bubbling pools a drop of moisture hit my cheek i looked up startled and a second fat drop smacked the bridge of my nose the stars had vanished the spongy bellies of fat grey clouds raced overhead almost low enough to touch garishly tinted by the hellscape below the bellies of the clouds opened over the canyon caught on the edge of the downpour i was nearly beaten to my knees out there it was more savage rain hit molten rock the roar of steam was deafening particolored it stormed toward the sky the fringe i caught as i turned to run was hot enough to redden patches of skin those poor rebel fools i thought steamed like lobsters i had been dissatisfied because i had seen little spectacular from the taken not anymore i had trouble keeping my supper down as i reflected on the cold cruel calculation that had gone into the planning of this i suffered one of those crises of conscience familiar to every mercenary and which few outside the profession understand my job is to defeat my employers enemies usually any way i can and heaven knows the company has served some blackhearted villains but there was something wrong about what was happening below in retrospect i think we ail felt it perhaps it sprang from a misguided sense of solidarity with fellow soldiers dying without an opportunity to defend themselves we do have a sense of honor in the company the roar of downpour and steam faded i ventured back to my vantage point except for small patches the canyon was dark i looked for the taken i had seen earlier he was gone above the comet came out from behind the last clouds marring the night like a tiny mocking smile it had a distinct bend in its tail over on the sawtoothed horizon a moon took a cautious peek at the tortured land horns blared in that direction their tinny voices distinctly edged with panic they gave way to a distance muddled sound of fighting an uproar which swelled rapidly the fighting sounded heavy and confused i started toward my makeshift hospital confident there would be work for me soon for some reason i was not particularly startled or upset messengers dashed past me zipping around purposefully the captain had done that much with those stragglers he had restored their senses of order and discipline something whooshed overhead a seated man riding a dark rectangle swooped through the moonlight banking toward the uproar soulcatcher on his flying carpet a bright violet shell flared around him his carpet rocked violently slid sideways for a dozen yards the light faded shrank in upon him and vanished leaving me with spots before my eyes i shrugged tramped on up the hill the early casualties beat me to the hospital in a way i was pleased that indicated efficiency and retention of cool heads under fire the captain had worked wonders the clatter of companies moving through the darkness confirmed my suspicion that this was more than a nuisance attack by men who seldom dared the dark somehow we had been flanked about damned time you showed your ugly face oneeye growled over there surgery i had them start setting up lights i washed and got to it the ladys people joined me and pitched in heroically and for the first time since we had taken the commission i felt like i was doing the wounded some good but they just kept pouring in the clangor continued to rise soon it was evident that the rebels canyon thrust had been but a feint all that showy drama had been to little purpose dawn was coloring the sky when i glanced up and found a tattered soulcatcher facing me he looked like he had been roasted over a slow fire and basted in something bluish greenish and nasty he exuded a smoky aroma start loading your wagons croaker he said in his businesslike female voice the captain is sending you a dozen helpers all the transport including that come up from the south was parked above my openair hospital i glanced that way a tall lean crookednecked individual was harassing the teamsters into hitching up the battle going sour i asked caught you by surprise didnt they catcher ignored the latter remark we have achieved most of our goals only one task remains unfulfilled the voice he chose was deep sonorous slow a speechmakers voice the fighting may go either way its too soon to tell your captain has given this rabble backbone but lest defeat catch you up get your charges moving a few wagons were creaking down toward us already i shrugged passed the word found the next man who needed my attention while i worked i asked catcher if the thing is in the balance shouldnt you be over there pounding on the rebel im doing the ladys bidding croaker our goals are almost met linger and moth are no more sidle is grievously injured shifter has accomplished his deceit there is naught left but to deprive the rebel of their general i was confused divergent thoughts found their ways to my tongue and betrayed themselves but shouldnt we try to break them here and this northern campaign has been hard on the circle first raker then whisper now linger and moth with sidle and harden to go yes they beat us again and again and each time it costs them the heart of their strength he gazed downhill toward a small company coming our way raven was in the lead catcher faced the wagon park the hanged man stopped gesturing and struck a pose man listening suddenly soulcatcher resumed talking whisper has breached the walls of frost nightcrawler has negotiated the treacherous menhirs on the plain of fear and approaches the suburbs of thud the faceless is on the plain now moving toward barns they say parcel committed suicide last night at ade to avoid capture by bonegnasher things arent the disaster they seem croaker the hell they arent i thought thats the east this is here i could not get excited about victories a quarter of the world away here we were getting stomped and if the rebel broke through to charm nothing that happened in the east would matter raven halted his group and approached me alone what do you want them to do i assumed the captain had sent him so was sure the captain had ordered the withdrawal he would not play games for catcher put the ones weve treated into the wagons the teamsters were arraying themselves in a nice line send a dozen or so walking wounded with each wagon me and oneeye and the rest will keep cutting and sewing what he had a look in his eye i did not like it he glanced at soulcatcher so did i i havent told him yet catcher said told me what i knew i would not like it when heard i it they had that nervous smell about them it screamed bad news raven smiled not a happy smile but a sort of gruesome rictus you and me weve been drafted again croaker what come on not again i still got the shakes thinking about helping do in the limper and whisper you have the practical experience catcher said i kept shaking my head raven growled i have to go so do you croaker besides youll want to get it in the annals how you took out more of the eighteen than any of the taken crap what am i a bounty hunter no im a physician the annals and fighting are incidental raven told catcher this is the man the captain had to drag off the line when we were crossing the windy country his eyes were narrow his cheeks taut he did not want to go either he was displacing his resentment by chiding me there is no option croaker soulcatcher said in a childs voice the lady chose you he tried to soften my disappointment by adding she rewards well those who please her and you have caught her fancy i damned myself for my earlier romanticism that croaker who had come north so thoroughly bemused by the mysterious lady was another man a stripling filled with the foolish ignorances of youth yeah sometimes you he to yourself just to keep going catcher told me were not going it alone this time croaker well have help from crooked neck shifter and stormbringer sourly i remarked takes the whole gang to scrub one bandit eh catcher did not take the bait he never does the carpet is over there collect your weapons and join me he stalked away i took my ire out on my helpers completely unfairly finally when oneeye was ready to blow raven remarked dont be an asshole croaker weve got to do it lets do it so i apologized to everyone and marched down to join soulcatcher soulcatcher said get aboard indicating places raven and i assumed the positions we had used before catcher handed us lengths of cord tie yourselves securely this could get rough i dont want you falling off and keep a knife handy so you can cut loose when we go in my heart fluttered to tell the truth i was excited about flying again moments from my previous flight haunted me with their joy and beauty there is a glorious feeling of freedom up there with the cool wind and the eagles catcher even tied himself bad sign ready not awaiting an answer he started muttering the carpet rocked gently floated upward light as down on a breeze we cleared the treetops frame wood smacked me in the behind my guts sank air whipped around me my hat blew off i grabbed and missed the carpet tilted precariously i found myself gaping down at an earth receding rapidly raven grabbed me had we not been tied we both would have gone over the side we drifted out over the canyons which looked like a crazy maze from above the rebel mass looked like army ants on the march i glanced around the sky which itself is a marvel from that perspective there were no eagles on the wing just vultures catcher made a dash through one flight scattered them another carpet floated up passed nearby drifted away till it became but a distant speck it carried the hanged man and two heavily armed imperials wheres stormbringer i asked catcher extended an arm squinting i discerned a dot on the blue over the desert we drifted till i began to wonder if anything was going to happen studying the rebels progress palled fast he was making too much headway get ready catcher called over his shoulder i gripped my ropes anticipating something nerve wracking now the bottom fell out and stayed out down down and down we plunged the air screamed the earth rolled and twisted and hurtled upward the distant specks that were stormbringer and the hanged man also plummeted they grew more distinct as we slanted in from three directions we whipped past the level where our brethren were striving to stem the rebel flood down we continued into a less steep glide rolling twisting fishtailing to avoid colliding with wildly eroded sandstone towers some i could have touched as we hurtled past a small meadow appeared ahead our velocity dropped dramatically till we hovered hes there catcher whispered we slid forward a few yards floated just peeping round a pillar of sandstone the once green meadow had been churned by the passage of horses and men a dozen wagons and their teamsters remained there catcher cursed under his breath a shadow flew from between rock spires to our left flash thunder shook the canyon sod hurtled into the air men cried out staggered around scrambled for their weapons another shadow whipped through from another direction i do not know what the hanged man did but the rebels began clawing their throats gasping one big man shook the magic and staggered toward a huge black horse tethered to a picket post at the nether end of the meadow catcher took our carpet in fast the earth slammed against its frame off he growled as we bounced he snatched a sword himself raven and i clambered off and followed catcher on unsteady legs the taken swooped down on the choking teamsters and raged among them blade throwing gore raven and i contributed to the massacre i hope with less enthusiasm what the hell are you doing here catcher raved at his victims he was supposed to be alone the other carpets returned and settled nearer the fleeing man the taken and their henchmen pursued him on wobbly legs he vaulted onto the horses back and parted the picket rope with a vicious swordstroke i stared i had not expected harden to be so intimidating he was every bit as ugly as the apparition that had appeared during goblins bout with oneeye catcher cut down the last rebel teamster come he snapped we dogged him as he loped toward harden i wondered why i did not have sense enough to hang back the rebel general stopped fleeing he felled one of the imperials who had outdistanced everybody let out a great bellow of laughter then howled something unintelligible the air crackled with the imminence of sorcery violet light flared around all three taken more intense than when it had hit catcher during the night it stopped them in their tracks it was a most puissant sorcery it occupied them totally harden turned his attention to the rest of us the second imperial reached him his great sword hammered down pounding through the soldiers guard the horse ambled forward at hardens urging gingerly stepping over the fallen harden looked at the taken and cursed the animal flailed around with his blade the horse moved no faster harden smote its neck savagely then howled his hand would not come free of its mane his cry of rage became one of despair he turned his blade on the beast could not harm it instantly hurled the weapon at the taken the violet surrounding them had begun to weaken raven was two steps from harden i three behind him stormbringers men were as close approaching from the other side raven slashed a strong upward cutting stroke his swordtip thumped hardens bellyand rebounded chain mail hardens big fist lashed out and connected with ravens temple he wobbled a step and sagged without thought i shifted aim and slashed at hardens hand we both yelled when iron bit bone and scarlet flowed i leapt over raven stopped spun stormbringers soldiers were hacking at harden his mouth was open his scarred face was contorted as he concentrated on ignoring pain while he used his powers to save himself the taken remained out of it for the moment he faced three ordinary men but all that did not register till later i could see nothing but hardens steed the animal was melting no not melting changing i giggled the great rebel general was astride shapeshifters back my giggles became crazy laughter my little fit cost me my opportunity to participate in the death of a champion stormbringers two soldiers cut harden to pieces while shifter held and stifled him he was dead meat before i regained my selfcontrol the hanged man too missed the denouement he was busy dying hardens great thrown blade buried in his skull soulcatcher and stormbringer moved toward him shifter completed his change into a great greasy stinking fat naked creature which despite standing on its hind legs seemed no more human than the beast he had portrayed he kicked hardens remains and quaked with mirth as though his deadly trick had been the finest jest of the century then he saw the hanged man shudders ran through his flab he hastened toward the other taken incoherencies frothing his lips crooked neck worked the sword loose from his skull he tried to say something had no luck stormbringer and soulcatcher made no move to help i stared at stormbringer such a tiny thing she was i knelt to test ravens pulse she was no bigger than a child how could such a small package chain such terrible wrath shifter shambled toward the tableau anger knotting the muscles under the fat across his shaggy shoulders he halted faced catcher and stormbringer from a tense stance nothing was said but it seemed the hanged mans fate was being decided shifter wanted to help the others did not puzzling shifter is catchers ally why this sudden conflict why this daring of the ladys wrath she would not be pleased if the hanged man died ravens pulse was fluttery when first i touched his throat but it firmed up i breathed a little easier stormbringers soldiers eased up toward the taken eyeing shifters gross back catcher exchanged glances with stormbringer the woman nodded soulcatcher whirled the slits in his mask blazed a lava red suddenly there was no catcher there was a cloud of darkness ten feet high and a dozen across black as the inside of a coal sack thicker than the densest fog the cloud jumped quicker than an adders strike there was one mouselike squeak of surprise then a sinister enduring silence after all the roar and clangor the quiet was deadly ominous i shook raven violently he did not respond changer and stormbringer stood over the hanged man staring at me i wanted to scream to run to crawl into the ground to hide i was a magic man able to read their thoughts i knew too much terror froze me the coal dust cloud vanished as quickly as it had appeared soulcatcher stood between the soldiers both toppled slowly with the majesty of stately old pines i gouged raven he groaned his eyes flickered open and i caught a glimpse of pupil dilated concussion damn it catcher looked at his partners in crime then slowly he turned on me the three taken closed in in the background the hanged man went on dying he was very noisy about it i did not hear him though i rose knees watery and faced my doom its not supposed to end this way i thought this isnt right all three stood there and stared i stared back nothing else i could do brave croaker guts enough at least to stare death in the eye you didnt see a thing did you catcher asked softly cold lizards slithered down my spine that voice was one one of the dead soldiers had used while hacking away at harden i shook my head you were too busy fighting harden then you were occupied with raven i nodded weakly my knee joints were jelly i would have bolted otherwise foolish as that would have been catcher said get raven onto bringers carpet he pointed nudging whispering cajoling i helped raven walk he hadnt the least idea where he was or what he was doing but he let me steer him i was worried i could find no obvious damage yet he was not acting right take him straight to my hospital i said i could not look stormbringer in the eye nor did i achieve the inflection i wanted my words came out sounding like a plea catcher summoned me to his carpet i went with all the enthusiasm of a hog to the slaughter chute he could be playing a game a fall from his carpet would be a permanent cure for any doubts he harbored about my ability to keep quiet he followed me tossed his bloody sword aboard settled himself the carpet floated upward crawled toward the great scrap of the stair i glanced back at the still forms on the meadow nagged by undirected feelings of shame that had not been right and yet what could i have done something golden something like a pale nebula in the farthest circle of the midnight sky moved in the shade cast by one of the sandstone towers my heart nearly stopped the captain sucked the headless and increasingly demoralized rebel army into a trap a great slaughter ensued lack of numbers and sheer exhaustion kept the company from hurling the rebel off the mountainnor did the complacency of the taken help one fresh battalion one sorcerous assault might have given us the day i treated raven on the run after placing him aboard the last wagon to head south he would remain odd and remote for days care of darling fell my way by default the child was a fine distraction from the depression of yet another retreat maybe that was the way she had rewarded raven for his generosity this is our last withdrawal the captain promised he would not call it a retreat but hadnt the gall to call it an advance to the rear retrograde action or any of that gobbledegook he did not mention the fact that any further withdrawal would come after the end charms fail would mark the deathdate of the ladys empire in all probability it will terminate these annals and scriven the end of company history rest in peace you last of the warrior brotherhoods you were home and family to me news came which had not been allowed to reach us at the stair of tear tidings of other rebel armies advancing from the north along routes more westerly than our line of retreat the list of cities lost was long and disheartening even granting exaggeration by the reporters soldiers defeated always overestimate the strength of their foe that soothes egos suspecting their own inferiority walking with elmo down the long gentle south slope toward the fertile farmlands north of charm i suggested sometime when there arent any taken around how about you hint to the captain that it might be wise if he started disassociating the company from soulcatcher he looked at me oddly my old comrades had been doing that lately since hardens fall i had been moody dour and uncommunicative not that i was a bonfire at the best of times mind the pressure was crushing my spirit i denied myself my usual outlet the annals for fear soulcatcher would somehow detect what i had written it might be better if we werent too closely identified with him i added what happened out there by then everyone knew the basic tale harden slain the hanged man fallen raven and i the only soldiers who got out alive everybody had an insatiable thirst for details i cant tell you but you tell him when none of the taken are around elmo did his sums and came to the conclusion not far off the mark all right croaker will do take care take care i would if fate let me that was the day we received word of new victories in the east the rebel redoubts were collapsing as fast as the ladys armies could marchit was also the day we heard that all four northern and western rebel armies had halted to rest recruit and refit for an assault on charm nothing stood between them and the tower nothing that is but the black company and its accumulation of beaten men the great comet is in the sky that evil harbinger of all great shifts of fortune the end is near we are retreating still toward our final appointment with destiny i must record one final incident in the tale of the encounter with harden it took place three days north of the tower and consisted of another dream like the one i suffered at the head of the stair the same golden dream which might have been no dream at all promised me my faithful need have no fear once again it allowed me a glimpse of that heartstopping face and then it was gone and the fear returned not lessened in the least the days passed the miles wore away the great ugly block of the tower hove over the horizon and the comet grew ever more brilliant in the nighttime sky chapter six lady the land slowly became silvery green dawn scattered feathers of crimson upon the walled town golden flashes freckled its battlements where the sun touched dew the mists began to slide into the hollows trumpets sounded the morning watch the lieutenant shaded his eyes squinted he grunted disgustedly glanced at oneeye the little black man nodded time goblin the lieutenant said over his shoulder men stirred back in the woods goblin knelt beside me peered out at the farmland he and four other men were clad as poor townswomen with their heads wrapped in shawls they carried pottery jars swinging from wooden yokes had their weapons hidden inside their clothing go the gate is open the lieutenant said they moved out following the edge of the wood downhill damn its good to be doing this kind of thing again i said the lieutenant grinned he had smiled seldom since we had left beryl below the five fake women slipped through shadow toward the spring beside the road to town already a few townswomen were headed down to draw water we expected little trouble getting to the gatekeepers the town was filled with strangers refugees and rebel campfollowers the garrison was small and lax the rebel had no cause to suppose the lady would strike this far from charm the town had no significance in the grand struggle except that two of the eighteen privy to rebel strategies were quartered there we had lurked in those woods three days watching feather and journey recently promoted to the circle were honeymooning there before moving south to join the assault on charm three days three days of no fires during the chillnights of dried food at every meal three days of misery and our spirits were their highest in years i think well pull it off i opined the lieutenant gestured several men stole after the disguised oneeye remarked whoever thought this up knew what he was doing he was excited we all were it was a chance to do that at which we are best for fifty days we had done plain physical labor preparing charm for the rebel onslaught and for fifty nights we had agonized about the coming battle another five men slipped downhill bunch of women coming out now oneeye said tension mounted women paraded toward the spring there would be a flow all day unless we interrupted they had no water source inside the wall my stomach sank our infiltrators had started uphill stand ready the lieutenant said loosen up i suggested exercise helps dissipate nervous energy no matter how long you soldier fear always swells as combat nears there is always the dread that the numbers will catch up oneeye enters every action sure the fates have checked his name off their list the infiltrators exchangedfalsetto greetings with the townswomen they arrived at the gate undiscovered it was guarded by a single militiaman a cobbler busy hammering brass nails into the heel of a boot his halberd was ten feet away goblin scampered back outside he clapped his hands overhead a crack reverberated across the countryside his arms fell level with his shoulders palms up a rainbow arced between his hands always has to ham it up oneeye grumbled goblin did a jig the patrol swept forward the women at the spring screamed and scattered wolves jumping into a sheepfold i thought we ran hard my pack hammered my kidneys after two hundred yards i was stumbling over my bow younger men began passing me i reached the gate unable to whip a grandmother lucky for me the grandmas were goofing off the men swept through the town there was no resistance we who were to tackle feather and journey hastened to the tiny citadel that was no better defended the lieutenant and i followed oneeye silent and goblin inside we encountered no resistance below the top level there incredibly the newlyweds were still entangled in sleep oneeye brushed their guards aside with a terrifying illusion goblin and silent shattered the door to the lovenest we stormed inside even sleepy baffled and frightened they were feisty they bruised several of us good before we got gags into their mouths and bonds onto their wrists the lieutenant told them were supposed to bring you back alive that dont mean we cant hurt you some come quiet do what youre told and youll be all right i halfway expected him to sneer twirl the end of his mustache and punctuate with evil laughter he was clowning assuming the villains role the rebel insists we play feather and journey would give us all the trouble they could they knew the lady hadnt sent us to bring them round for tea halfway back to friendly territory on our bellies on a hilltop studying an enemy encampment big i said twentyfive thirty thousand men it was one of six such camps on an arc bending north and west of charm they sit on their hands much longer theyre in trouble the lieutenant said they should have attacked immediately after the stair of tear but the loss of harden sidle moth and linger had set lesser captains to squabbling over supreme command the rebel offensive had stalled the lady had regained her balance her patrolsinforce now harassed rebel foragers exterminated collaborators scouted destroyed everything the enemy might find useful despite vastly superior numbers the rebels stance was becoming defensive every day in camp sapped his psychological momentum two months ago our morale was lower than a snakes butt now it was on the rebound if we made it back it would soar our coup would stun the rebel movement if we made it back we lay motionless upon steep lichened limestone and dead leaves the creek below chuckled at our predicament shadows of naked trees stippled us lowgrade spells by oneeye and his cohorts further camouflaged us the smell of fear and of sweaty horses taunted my nostrils from the road above came the voices of rebel cavalrymen i could not understand their tongue they were arguing though scattered with undisturbed leaves and twigs the road had looked unpatrolled weariness had overcome our caution we had decided to follow it then we had rounded a turn and found ourselves facing a rebel patrol across the meadowed valley into which the creek below flowed they were cursing our disappearance several dismounted and urinated down the bank feather started thrashing damn i screamed inside damn damn i knew it the rebels yammered and lined the edge of the road i smacked the womans temple goblin clipped her from the other side quickthinking silent wove nets of spell with tentaclelimber fingers dancing close to his chest a ragged bush shivered a fat old badger waddleran down the bank and crossed the creek vanishing into a dense stand of poplars cursing the rebels threw rocks they clattered like dropped stoneware as they skipped off boulders in the streambed the soldiers stamped around telling one another we had to be nearby we could not have gotten much farther on foot logic might undo the best efforts of our wizards i was scared with a kneeknocking handshaking gutemptying kind of fear it had built steadily through too many narrow escapes superstition told me my odds were getting too long so much for that earlier gust of refreshed morale the unreasoning fear betrayed it for the illusion it was beneath its patina i retained the defeatist attitude brought down from the stair of tear my war was over and lost all i wanted to do was run journey showed signs of getting frisky too my glare was fierce he subsided a breeze stirred the dead leaves the sweat on my body chilled my fear cooled somewhat the patrol remounted still fussing they rode on up the road i watched them come into sight where the way curled eastward with the canyon they wore scarlet tabards over good link mail their helmets and arms were of excellent quality the rebel was getting prosperous they had started out as a rabble armed with tools we could have taken them someone said stupid the lieutenant snapped right now they arent sure who they saw if we fought they would know we did not need the rebel getting a line on us this close to home there was no room for maneuvering the man who had spoken was one of the stragglers we had accumulated during the long retreat brother you better learn one thing if you want to stick with us you fight when there aint no other choice some of us would have gotten hurt too you know he grunted theyre out of sight the lieutenant said lets move he took the point headed for the rugged hills beyond the meadow i groaned more crosscountry my every muscle ached already exhaustion threatened to betray me man was not meant for endless dawn to dusk marching with sixty pounds on his back damned fast thinking back there i told silent he accepted praise with a shrug saying nothing as always a cry from the rear theyre coming back we sprawled on the flank of a grassy hill the tower rose above the horizon due south that basaltic cube was intimidating even from ten miles awayand implausible in its setting emotion demanded a surround of fiery waste or at best a land perpetually locked in winter instead this country was a vast green pasture gentle hills with small farms dotting their southern hips trees lined the deep slow brooks snaking between nearer the tower the land became less pastoral but never reflected the gloom rebel propagandists placed around the ladys stronghold no brimstone and barren broken plains no bizarre evil creatures strutting over scattered human bones no dark clouds ever rolling and grumbling in the sky the lieutenant said no patrols in sight croaker oneeye do your stuff i strung my bow goblin brought three prepared arrows each had a malleable blue ball at its head oneeye sprinkled one with grey dust passed it to me i aimed at the sun let fly blue fire too bright to view flared and sank into the valley below then a second and a third the fireballs dropped in a neat column appearing to drift down more than fall now we wait goblin squeaked and threw himself down in the tall grass and hope our friends arrive first any nearby rebel surely would investigate the signal yet we had to call for help we could not penetrate the rebel cordon unnoticed get down the lieutenant snapped the grass was tall enough to conceal a supine figure third squad take me watch men grumbled and claimed it was another squads turn but they took sentinel positions with that minimal obligatory complaint their mood was bright hadnt we lost those fools back in the hills what could stop us now i made a pillow of my pack and watched cumulus mountains drift over in stately legions it was a gorgeous crisp springlike day my gaze dropped to the tower my mood darkened the pace would pick up the capture of feather and journey would spur the rebel into action surrender secrets those two would there was no way to hide or lie when the lady asked a question i heard a rustle turned my head found myself eye to eye with a snake it wore a human face i started to yellthen recognized that silly grin oneeye his ugly mug in miniature but with both eyes and no floppy hat on top the snake snickered winked slithered across my chest here they go again i murmured and sat up to watch there was a sudden violent thrashing in the grass farther on goblin popped up wearing a shiteating grin the grass rustled animals the size of rabbits trooped past me carrying chunks of snake in bloody needle teeth homemade mongooses i guessed goblin had anticipated oneeye again oneeye let out a howl and jumped up cursing his hat spun around smoke poured out of his nostrils when he yelled fire roared in his mouth goblin capered like a cannibal just before they dish up the long pig he described circles with his forefingers rings of pale orange glimmered in the air he flipped them at oneeye they settled around the little black man goblin barked like a seal the hoops tightened oneeye made weird noises and negated the rings he made throwing notions with both hands brown balls streaked toward goblin they exploded yielding clouds of butterflies that went for goblins eyes goblin did a backflip scampered through the grass like a mouse fleeing an owl popped up with a counterspell the air sprouted flowers each bloom had a mouth each mouth boasted walruslike tusks the flowers skewered butterfly wings with their tusks then complacently munched butterfly bodies goblin fell over giggling oneeye cussed a literal blue streak a cerulean banner trailing from his lips argent lettering proclaimed his opinion of goblin knock it off the lieutenant thundered belatedly we dont need you attracting attention too late lieutenant somebody said look down there soldiers were headed our way soldiers wearing red with the white rose emblazoned on their tabards we dropped into the grass like ground squirrels into their holes chatter ran across the hillside most threatened oneeye with dire dooms a minority included goblin for having shared in the betraying fireworks trumpets sounded the rebel dispersed for an assault on our hill the air whined in torment a shadow flashed over the hilltop rippling across windblown grass taken i murmured and popped up for the instant needed to spot a flying carpet banking into the valley soulcatcher i couldnt be sure at that distance it could have been any of several taken the carpet dove into massed arrow fire lime fog enveloped it trailed behind it for a moment recalled the comet which overhung the world the lime haze scattered resolved into threadlike snippets a few filaments caught the breeze and drifted our way i glanced up the comet hung on the horizon like a ghost of a gods scimitar it had been in the sky so long we scarcely noticed it now i wondered if the rebel had become equally indifferent for him it was one of the great portents of impending victory men screamed the carpet had passed along the rebel line and now drifted like down on the wind just beyond bowshot the limecolored thread was so scattered it was barely visible the screams came from men who had suffered its touch grisly green wounds opened wherever there was contact some thread seemed determined to come our way the lieutenant saw it lets move out men just in case he pointed across the wind the thread would have to drift sideways to catch us we hustled maybe three hundred yards writhing the thread crawled on air coming our way it was after us the taken watched intently ignoring the rebel that bastard wants to kill us i exploded terror turned my legs to gelatin why would one of the taken want us to become victims of an accident if that was catcher but catcher was our mentor our boss we wore his badges he wouldnt the carpet snapped into motion so violently its rider almost tumbled off it hurtled toward the nearest wood vanished the thread lost volition and drifted down disappearing in the grass what the devil holy hell i whirled a vast shadow moved toward us expanding as a gigantic carpet descended faces peeped over its edges we froze bristling with ready weapons the howler i said and had my guess confirmed by a cry like that of a wolf challenging the moon the carpet grounded get aboard you idiots come on move it i laughed tension draining away that was the captain he danced like a nervous bear along the near edge of the carpet others of our brethren accompanied him i threw my pack aboard accepted a hand up raven you showed up in the nick this time youll wish wed let you take your chances eh captain will tell you the last man scrambled aboard the captain gave feather and journey the hard eye then marched around getting the men evenly distributed at the rear of the carpet unmoving shunned sat a childsized figure concealed in layers of indigo gauze it howled at random intervals i shuddered what are you talking about captain will tell you he repeated sure hows darling doing all right lots of words in our raven the captain settled beside me bad news croaker he said yeah i reached for my vaunted sarcasm give it to me straight i can take it tough guy raven observed thats me eat nails for breakfast whip wildcats with my bare hands the captain shook his head hang on to that sense of humor the lady wants to see you personally my stomach dropped to the ground which was a couple hundred feet down oh shit i whispered oh damn yeah what did i do youd know better than i do my mind hurtled around like a herd of mice fleeing a cat in seconds i was soaked with sweat raven observed cant be as bad as it sounds she was almost polite the captain nodded it was a request sure it was raven said if she had a grudge youd just disappear i did not feel reassured one too many romances the captain chided now shes in love with you too they never forget never let up it had been months since i had written one of those romances whats it about she didnt say silence reigned the rest of the way they sat beside me and tried to reassure me with traditional company solidarity as we came in on our encampment though the captain did say she told us to bring our strength up to the thousand mark we can enlist volunteers from the lot we brought out of the north good news good news that was cause for jubilation for the first time in two centuries we were going to grow plenty of stragglers would be eager to exchange their oaths to the taken for oaths to the company we were in high favor we had mana and being mercenaries we got more leeway than anyone else in the ladys service i could not get excited though not with the lady waiting the carpet grounded brethren crowded around anxious to see how we had done lies and jocular threats flew the captain said you stay aboard croaker goblin silent oneeye you too he indicated the prisoners deliver the merchandise as the men slid over the side darling came bouncing out of the mob raven hollered at her but of course she could not hear she scrambled aboard carrying a doll raven had carved it was dressed neatly in clothing of superb miniature detail she handed it to me and started flashing finger language raven hollered again i tried to interrupt but darling was intent on telling me about the dolls wardrobe some might have thought her retarded to be so excited about such things at her age she was not she had a mind like a razor she knew what she was doing when she boarded the carpet she was stealing a chance to fly honey i said both aloud and with signs youve got to get off were going raven yelled in outrage as the howler lifted off oneeye goblin and silent all glared at him he howled the carpet continued to rise sit down i told darling she did so not far from feather she forgot the doll wanted to know about our adventure i told her it kept me occupied she spent more time looking over the side than paying attention to me yet she missed nothing when i finished she looked at feather and journey with adult pity she was unconcerned about my appointment with the lady though she did give me a reassuring hug goodbye the howlers carpet drifted away from the tower top i waved a feeble farewell darling blew me a kiss goblin patted his breast i touched the amulet he had given me in lords small comfort that imperial guards strapped journey and feather onto litters what about me i asked shakily a captain told me youre supposed to wait here he stayed when the others left he tried to make small talk but i wasnt in the mood i wandered to the towers edge looked out on the vast engineering project being undertaken by the ladys armies at the time of the towers construction huge basalt billets had been imported shaped on site they had been the black company stacked and fused into this gigantic cube of stone the waste chips blocks broken during shaping billets found unsuitable and overage had been left scattered around the tower in a vast wild jumble more effective than any moat it extended a mile in the north though a depressed pieceofpie section remained unlittered this constituted the only approach to the tower on the ground in that arc the ladys forces prepared for the rebel onslaught no one down there believed his labor would shape the battles outcome the comet was in the sky but every man worked because labor provided surcease from fear the pieslice rose to either side meeting the rock jumble a log palisade spanned the slices wide end our camps lay behind that behind the camps was a trench thirty feet deep and thirty wide a hundred yards nearer the tower there was another trench and a hundred yards nearer still a third still being dug the excavated earth had been transported nearer the tower and dumped behind a twelve foot log retaining wall spanning the slice from this elevation men would hurl missiles on an enemy attacking our infantry on ground level a hundred yards back stood a second retaining wall providing another two fathom elevation the lady meant to array her forces in three distinct armies one on each level and force the rebel to fight three battles in series an earthen pyramid was a building a dozen rods behind the final retaining wall it was seventy feet high already its sides sloping about thirtyfive degrees obsessive neatness characterized everything the plain in places scraped down several feet was as level as a tabletop it had been planted with grass our animals kept that cropped like a wellkept lawn stone roadways ran here andthere and woe betide the man who strayed off without orders below on the middle level bowmen were ranging fire on the ground between the nearer trenches while they loosed their officers adjusted the positions of racks from which they drew their arrows on the upper terrace guards bustled around ballistae calculating fire lanes and survivability ranging their engines on targets farther away carts laden with ammunition sat near each weapon like the grass and mannered roadways these preparations betrayed an obsession with order on the bottom level workmen had begun demolishing short sections of retaining wall baffling i spotted a carpet coming in turned to watch it settled to the roof four stiff shaky windburned soldiers stepped off a corporal led them away the armies of the east were headed our way hoping to arrive before the rebel assault with little hope of actually making it the taken were flying day and night bringing in what manpower they could men shouted below i turned to look threw up an arm slam impact threw me a dozen feet spinning my guard guide yelled the tower roof came up to meet me men shouted and ran my way i rolled tried to get up slipped in a slick of blood blood my blood it spurted from the inside of my left upper arm i stared at the wound with dull amazed eyes what the hell lay down the guard captain ordered come on he slapped me a good one quick tell me what to do tourniquet i croaked tie something around it stop the bleeding he yanked his belt off good quick thinking one of the best tourniquets there is i tried to sit up to advise while he worked hold him down he told several bystanders foster what happened one of the weapons fell off the upper tier it went off when it fell theyre running around like chickens wasnt no accident i gasped somebody wanted to kill me getting hazy i could think of nothing but lime thread crawling against the wind why tell me and well both know friend you men get a litter he snugged the belt tighter going to be all right fellow well have you to a healer in a minute severed artery i said thats tricky my ears hummed the world began to turn slowly getting cold shock how much blood did i lose the captain had moved fast enough plenty of time if the healer was not some butcher the captain grabbed a corporal go find out what happened down there dont take any bullshit answers the litter came they lifted me in hoisted me and i passed out i wakened in a small surgery tended by a man who was as much sorcerer as surgeon better job than i could have done i told him when he finished any pain nope going to ache like hell in a while i know how many times had i said the same the guard captain came going all right done the surgeon replied to me no work no activity no sex you know the drill i do sling he nodded well bind your arm to your side too for a few days the captain was antsy find out what happened i asked not really the ballista crew couldnt explain it just got away from them somehow maybe you got lucky he recalled me saying somebody was trying to kill me i touched the amulet goblin had given me maybe hate to do it he said but ive got to take you for your interview fear what about youd know better than i but i dont i had a remote suspicion but had forced that out of mind there seemed to be two towers one sheathing the other the outer was the seat of empire manned by the ladys functionaries the inner as intimidating to them as was the whole to us outside took up a third of the volume and could be entered at only one point few ever did so the entrance was open when we reached it there were no guards i suppose none were needed i should have been more scared but was too dopey the captain said ill wait here he had placed me in a wheeled chair which he rolled through the doorway i went in with my eyes sealed and heart hammering the door chunked shut the chair rolled a long way making several turns i dont know what impelled it i refused to look then it stopped moving i waited nothing happened curiosity got the best of me i blinked she stands in the tower gazing northward her delicate hands are clasped before her a breeze steals softly through her window it stirs the midnight silk of her hair tear diamonds sparkle on the gentle curve of her cheek my own words written more than a year before came back it was that scene from that romance to the least detail to detail i had imagined but never written as if that fantasy instant had been ripped from my brain whole and given the breath of life i did not believe it for a second of course i was in the bowels of the tower there were no windows in that grim structure she turned and i saw what every man sees in dreams perfection she did not have to speak for me to know her voice her speech rhythms the breathiness between phrases she did not have to move for me to know her mannerisms the way she walked the odd way she would lift her hand to her throat when she laughed i had known her since adolescence in seconds i understood what the old stories meant about her overwhelming presence the dominator himself must have swayed in her hot wind she rocked me but did not sweep me away though half of me hungered the remainder recalled my year around goblin and oneeye where there is sorcery nothing is what it seems nice yes but sugar candy she studied me as intently as i studied her finally we meet again the voice was everything i expected and more it had humor too indeed i croaked youre frightened of course i am maybe a fool would have denied it maybe you were injured she drifted closer i nodded my heartbeat increasing i wouldnt subject you to this if it wasnt important i nodded again too shaky to speak totally baffled this was the lady the villain of the ages the shadow animate this was the black widow at the heart of darkness web a demigoddess of evil what could be important enough for her to take note of the likes of me again i did have suspicions i would not admit to myself my moments of critical congress with anyone important were not numerous someone tried to kill you who i dont know taken on the wind lime thread why i dont know you know even if you think you dont flint razored through that perfect voice i had come expecting the worst had been taken in by the dream had let my defenses fall the air hummed a lemon glow formed above her she moved closer becoming hazyexcept for that face and that yellow that face expanded vast intense swooping closer yellow filled the universe i saw nothing but the eye the eye i remembered the eye in the forest of cloud i tried to throw my arm across my face i could not move i think i screamed hell i know i screamed there were questions i did not hear answers spooled across my mind in rainbows of thought like oil droplets spreading on still crystal water i had no more secrets no secrets no thought id ever had was hidden terror writhed in me like snakes afraid i had written those silly romances true but i also had my doubts and disgusts a villain as black as she would destroy me for having seditious thoughts wrong she was secure in the strength of her wickedness she did not need to quash the questions and doubts and fears of her minions she could laugh at our consciences and moralities this was no repeat of our encounter in the forest i did not lose my memories i just did not hear her questions those could be inferred from my answers about my contacts with the taken she was hunting the something i began to suspect at the stair of tear i had stumbled into as deadly a trap as ever snapped shut taken as the one jaw the lady as the other darkness and awakening she stands in the tower gazing northward tear diamonds sparkle on her cheek a spark of croaker remained unintimidated this is where i came in she faced me smiled she stepped over and touched me with the sweetest fingers ever woman possessed all fear went away all darkness closed in again passageway walls were rolling by when i recovered the guard captain was pushing me how are you doing he asked i took stock good enough where you taking me now the front door she said cut you loose just like that hmm i touched my wound healed i shook my head things like this did not happen to me i paused at the place where the ballista had had its mishap there was nothing to see and no one to question i descended to the middle level and visited one of the crews excavating there they had orders to install a cubicle twelve feet wide and eighteen deep they had no idea why i scanned the length of the retaining wall a dozen such sites were under construction the men eyed me intently when i limped into camp they choked on questions they could not ask on concern they could not express only darling refused to play the traditional game she squeezed my hand gave me a big smile her little fingers danced she asked the questions machismo forbid the men slow down i told her i was not yet proficient enough to catch everything she signed yet her joy communicated itself i had a big grin on when i became aware that someone was in my way i looked up raven captain wants you he said he seemed cool figures i signed goodbye strolled toward headquarters i felt no urgency no mere mortal could intimidate me now i glanced back raven had his arm across darlings shoulder proprietary looking puzzled the captain was off his style he dispensed with the customary growling oneeye was the only third party present and he too was interested in nothing but business we got trouble the captain asked what do you mean what happened in the hills no accident eh the lady summons you and half an hour later one of the taken goes zuzu then theres your accident at the tower youre bad hurt and nobody can explain oneeye observed logic insists a connection the captain added yesterday we heard you were dying today youre fine sorcery yesterday time had gotten away again i pushed the tent flap aside stared at the tower another night in elf hill was it an accident oneeye asked it wasnt accidental the lady hadnt thought so captain that jibes the captain said somebody tried to knife raven last night darling ran him off raven darling something woke her up she whacked the guy in the head with her doll whoever it was got away weird decidedly oneeye said why would raven sleep through and a deaf kid wake up raven can hear the footfall of a gnat smells of sorcery cockeyed sorcery the kid shouldnt have awakened the captain jumped in raven you taken the lady murder attempts an interview in the tower you have the answer spill it my reluctance showed you told elmo we should disassociate ourselves from catcher how come catcher treats us good what happened when you took out harden spread it around and there wouldnt be any point to killing you good argument only i like to be sure before i shoot my mouth off i think theres a plot against the lady soulcatcher and stormbringer might be involved i related details of hardens fall and whispers taking shifter was really upset because they let the hanged man die i dont think the limper was part of anything he was set up and manipulated craftily the lady was too maybe the limper and the hanged man were her supporters oneeye looked thoughtful you sure catcher is in on it im not sure of anything i wouldnt be surprised by anything either ever since beryl ive thought he was using us the captain nodded definitely i told oneeye to cook up an amulet thatll warn you if one of the taken gets too close for what good itll do i dont think youll be bothered again though the rebel is on the move thatll be everybodys first order of business a chain of logic lightninged to a conclusion the data was there all the time it just needed a nudge to drop into place i think i know what its about the lady being an usurper oneeye asked one of the boys in the masks wants to do her the way she done her old man no they want to bring back the dominator eh hes still up north in the ground the lady just kept him from returning when the wizard bomanz opened the way for her he could be in touch with taken who are faithful to him bomanz proved communication with those buried in the barrowland was possible he could even be guiding some of the circle harden was as big a villain as any of the taken oneeye pondered then prophesied the battle will be lost the lady will be overthrown her loyal taken will be laid low and her loyal troops wiped out but they will take the most idealistic elements among the rebel with them meaning essentially a defeat for the white rose i nodded the comet is in the sky but the rebel hasnt found his mystic child yeah youre probably right on the mark when you say maybe the dominator is influencing the circle yeah and in the chaos afterward while theyre squabbling over the spoils up jumps the devil i said so where do we fit the captain asked the question i replied is how do we get out from under flying carpets buzzed around the tower like flies around a corpse the armies of whisper the howler the nameless bonegnasher and moonbiter were eight to twelve days away converging eastern troops were pouring in by air the gate in the palisade was busy with the comings and goings of parties harassing the rebel the rebel had moved his camps to within five miles of the tower some company troops made the occasional night raid abetted by goblin oneeye and silent but the effort seemed pointless the numbers were too overwhelming for hit and run to have any substantial effect i wondered why the lady wanted the rebel kept stirred up construction was complete the obstacles were prepared boobytraps were in place there was little to do but wait six days had passed since our return with feather and journey id expected their capture to electrify the rebel into striking but still they were stalling oneeye believed they had hopes of a lastminute finding of their white rose only the drawing of lots remained undone three of the taken with armies assigned them would defend each level it was rumored that the lady herself would command forces stationed on the pyramid nobody wanted to be on the front line no matter how things went those troops would be badly hurt thus the lottery there had been no more attempts on raven or myself our antagonist was covering his tracks some other way too late to do unto us anyway id seen the lady the tenor changed returning skirmishers began to look more battered more desperate the enemy was moving his camps again a messenger reached the captain he assembled the officers its begun the lady has called the taken to the lottery he wore an odd expression the main ingredient was astonishment we have special orders from the lady herself whispermurmurrastlegrumble everyone shaken she was giving us all the rough jobs i envisioned having to anchor the first line against rebel elite troops were to strike camp and assemble on the pyramid a hundred questions buzzed like hornets he said she wants us for bodyguards the guard wont like that i said they did not like us anyway having had to submit to the captains orders at the stair of tear think theyll give her a hard way to go croaker gents the boss says go so we go you want to talk about it do it while youre breaking camp without the men hearing for the troops this was great news not only would we be behind the worst fighting we would be in a position to fall back into the tower was i that sure we were doomed did my negativism mirror a general attitude was this an army defeated before the first blow the comet was in the sky considering that phenomenon while we moved amidst animals being driven into the tower i understood why the rebel had stalled they had hoped to find their white rose at the last minute of course and they had been waiting for the comet to attain a more auspicious aspect its closest approach i grumbled to myself raven trudging beside me burdened with his own gear and a bundle belonging to darling grunted huh they havent found their magic kid they wont have everything going their way he looked at me oddly almost suspiciously then yet he said yet there was a big clamor as rebel cavalry hurled javelins at sentinels on the palisade raven did not look back it was just a probe we had a hell of a view from the pyramid though it was crowded up there hope were not stuck here long i said and going to be hell treating casualties the rebel had moved his camps to within a half mile of the stockade they blended into one there was constant skirmishing at the palisade most of our troops had taken their places on the tiers the first level forces consisted of those who had served in the north fleshed out by garrison troops from cities abandoned to the rebel there were nine thousand of them divided into three divisions the center had been assigned to stormbringer had i been running things she would have been on the pyramid hurling cyclones the wings were commanded by moonbiter and bonegnasher two taken id never encountered six thousand men occupied the second level also divided into three divisions most were archers from the eastern armies they were tough and far less uncertain than the men below them their commanders from left to right were the faceless or nameless man the howler and nightcrawler countless racks of arrows had been provided them i wondered how they would manage if the enemy broke the first line the third tier was manned by the guard at the ballistae whisper on the left with fifteen hundred veterans from her own eastern army and shifter on the right with a thousand westerners and southerners in the middle below the pyramid soulcatcher commanded the guard and allies from the jewel cities his troops numbered twentyfive hundred and on the pyramid was the black company one thousand strong with banners bright and standards bold and weapons ready to hand so roughly twentyone thousand men against more man ten times that number numbers arent always critical the annals recall many moments when the company beat the odds but not like this this was too static there was no room for retreat for maneuver and an advance was out of the question the rebel got serious the palisades defenders withdrew quickly dismantling the spans across the three trenches the rebel did not pursue instead he began demolishing the stockade they look as methodical as the lady i told elmo yep theyll use the timber to bridge the trenches he was wrong but we would not learn that immediately seven days till the eastern armies get here i muttered at sunset glancing back at the huge dark bulk of the tower the lady had not come forth for the initial scrimmage more like nine or ten elmo countered theyll want to get here all together yeah shouldve thought of that we ate dried food and slept on the earth and in the morning we rose to the bray of rebel trumpets the enemy formations stretched as far as the eye could see a line of mantlets started forward they had been built from timber scavenged from our palisade they formed a moving wall stretched across the pieslice the heavy ballistae thumped away large trebuchets hurled stones and fireballs the damage they did was inconsequential rebel pioneers began bridging the first trench using timber brought from their camps the foundations for these were huge beams fifty feet long impervious to missile fire they had to use cranes to position them they exposed themselves while assembling and operating the devices wellranged guard engines made that expensive where the palisade had stood rebel engineers were assembling wheeled towers from which bowmen could shoot and wheeled ramps to roll up to the first tier carpenters were making ladders i saw no artillery i guess they planned to swamp us once they crossed the trenches the lieutenant knew siegework well i went to him how they going to bring up those ramps and towers theyll fill the ditches he was right as soon as they had bridges across the first and started moving mantlets over carts and wagons appeared carrying earth and stone teamsters and animals took a beating many a corpse went into the fill the pioneers moved up to the second trench assembled their cranes the circle gave them no armed support stormbringer sent archers to the lip of the final trench the guard laid down heavy fire with the ballistae the pioneers suffered heavy casualties the enemy command simply sent more men the rebel began moving mantlets across the second trench an hour before noon wagons and carts crossed the first carrying fill the pioneers encountered withering fire moving up to bridge the final ditch the archers on the second tier sped their shafts high they fell nearly straight down the trebuchets shifted their aim blasting mantlets into toothpicks and timbers but the rebel kept coming on moonbiters flank they got a set of supporting beams across moonbiter attacked crossing with a picked force his assault was so ferocious he drove the pioneers back over the second trench he destroyed their equipment attacked again then the rebel command brought up a strong heavy infantry column moonbiter withdrew leaving the second trench bridges ruined inexorably the rebel bridged again moved to the final trench with soldiers to protect his workmen stormbringers snipers retreated the arrows from the second tier fell like flakes in a heavy winter snow steadily and evenly the carnage was spectacular rebel troops rolled into the witchs cauldron in a flood a river of wounded flowed out at the last trench the pioneers began keeping to the shelter of their mantlets praying those would not be shattered by the guard thus it stood as the sun settled casting long shadows across the field of blood id guess the rebel lost ten thousand men without bringing us to battle through that day neither the taken nor the circle unleashed their powers the lady did not venture out of the tower one less day to await the armies of the east hostilities ended at sunset we ate the rebel brought another shift to work the trenches the newcomers went at it with the gusto their predecessors had lost the strategy was obvious they would rotate fresh troops in and wear us down the dark was the time of the taken their passivity ended i could see little initially so cannot for certain say who did what shifter i suspect changed shape and crossed into enemy territory the stars began to fade behind onrushing storm clouds cold air rushed across the earth the wind rose howled riding it came a horde of things with leathery wings flying serpents the length of a mans arm their hissing overshadowed the tumult of the storm thunder crashed and lightning stalked jabbing enemy works with its spears the flashes revealed the ponderous advance of giants from the rock wastes they hurled boulders like children throw balls one snatched up a bridge beam and used it as a twohanded club smashing siege towers and ramps the look of them in the treacherous light was of creatures of stone basaltic rubble cobbled together in grotesque gargantuan parody of the human form the earth shivered patches of plain glowed a bilious green radiant ten foot bloodstreaked orange worms slithered amongst the foe the heavens opened and dumped rain and burning brimstone the night coughed up more horrors killing fogs murderous insects a beginning glow of magma such as we had seen at the stair of tear and all this in just minutes once the circle responded the terrors faded though some it took hours to neutralize they never took the offensive the taken were too strong by midnight all was quiet the rebel had given up everything but fill work at the far trench the storm had become a steady rain it made the rebel miserable but did him no harm i wriggled down amongst my companions and fell asleep thinking how nice it was that our part of the world was dry dawn first view of the takens handiwork death everywhere horribly mutilated corpses the rebel labored till noon cleaning up then he resumed his assault on the trenches the captain received a message from the tower he assembled us word is we lost shifter last night he gave me a look meant to be significant the circumstances were questionable weve been told to stay alert that means you oneeye and you goblin and silent you send a yell to the tower if you see anything suspicious understand they nodded shapeshifter gone that must have taken some doing the rebel lose anybody important i asked whiskers roper tamarask but they can be replaced shifter cant rumors floated around the deaths of members of the circle had been caused by some catlike beast so strong and quick even the powers of its victims were of no consequence several score senior rebel functionaries had fallen victim as well the men recalled a similar beast from beryl there were whispers catcher had brought the forvalaka over on the ship was he using it against the rebel i thought not the attack fit shifters style shifter loved sneaking into the enemy camp oneeye went around wearing a thoughtful look so selfengrossed he bumped into things once he stopped and smashed a fist into a ham hanging near the newly erected cook tents he had it figured out how catcher could send the forvalaka into the bastion to slaughter the syndics entire household and end up controlling the city through a puppet through no cost to the ladys overextended resources catcher and shifter were thick then werent they he had figured out who killed his brothertoo late to extract revenge he went around and beat on that ham several times during the course of the day i joined raven and darling later they were watching the action i checked shapeshifters force his standard had been replaced raven isnt that jalenas banner yes he spat shifter wasnt a bad guy for one of the taken none of them are for taken as long as you dont get in their way he spat again eyed the tower whats going on here croaker eh he was as civil as he had been since our return from the field whats this show all about why is she doing it this way i was not sure what he was asking i dont know she doesnt confide in me he scowled no as though he did not believe me then he shrugged be interesting to find out no doubt i watched darling she was inordinately intrigued by the attack she asked raven a stream of questions they were not simple you might expect their like from an apprentice general a prince someone expected to assume eventual command shouldnt she be somewhere safer i asked i mean where raven demanded where would she be safer than with me his voice was hard his eyes narrow with suspicion startled i dropped the subject was he jealous because i had become darlings friend i dont know everything about raven is strange stretches of the farther trench had vanished in places the middle trench had been filled and tamped the rebel had moved his surviving towers and ramps up to the extreme limit of our artillery new towers were abuilding new mantlets were everywhere men huddled behind every one braving merciless fire rebel pioneers bridged the final trench counterattacks stalled them again and again yet they kept coming they completed their eighth bridge about the third hour after noon vast infantry formations moved forward they swarmed across the bridges into the teeth of the arrowstorm they hit our first line randomly pelting in like sleet dying against a wall of spears and shields and swords bodies piled up our bowmen threatened to fill the ditches around the bridges and still they came i recognized a few banners seen at roses and lords the elite units were coming up they crossed the bridges and formed up advanced in fair order exerted heavy pressure on our center behind them a second line formed stronger deeper and broader when it was solid its officers moved it forward a few yards had their men crouch behind their shields pioneers moved mantlets across joined them in a sort of palisade our heaviest artillery concentrated on these behind the ditch hordes ran fill to selected points though the men on the bottom level were our least reliablei suspect the lottery was riggedthey repelled the rebel elite success gave them only a brief respite the next mass attacked our line creaked it might have broken had the men had anywhere to run they had the habit of fleeing but here they were trapped with no chance of getting up the retaining wall that wave receded on his end moonbiter counterattacked and routed the enemy before him he destroyed most of their mantlets and briefly threatened their bridges i was impressed by his aggressiveness it was late the lady had not come forth i suppose she had not doubted we would hold the enemy launched a last assault a human wave attack that came within a whisper of swamping our men in places the rebel reached the retaining wall and tried to scale or dismantle it but our men did not collapse the incessant rain of arrows broke the rebel determination they withdrew fresh units filled in behind the mantlets a temporary peace settled in the field belonged to their pioneers six days i said to no one in particular i dont think we can hang on the first line shouldnt survive tomorrow the horde would storm the second level our archers were deadly as archers but i doubted they would do well handtohand moreover once forced into close combat they could no longer punish the enemy coming up then the rebel towers would do them as they had been done we had cut a narrow trench near the rear of the pyramid top it served as our latrine the captain caught me at my most inelegant they need you down on the bottom level croaker take oneeye and your crew what youre a physician arent you oh silly of me should have known i could not remain an observer the rest of the company went down too to perform other tasks getting down was no trouble though traffic was heavy on the temporary ramps men from the upper level and pyramid top hauled munitions down to the bowmen brought corpses and casualties up be a good time to jump us i told oneeye just scamper up the ramps theyre too busy doing the same things we are we passed within ten feet of soulcatcher i lifted a hand in tentative greeting he did the same after a pause i got the feeling he was startled down we went and down again into stormbringers territory it was hell down there every battlefield is after but never had i seen anything like this men were down everywhere many were rebels our men hadnt the energy to finish even the troops from up top just booted them aside so they could collect our people forty feet away ignored rebel soldiers were gathering their own people and ignoring ours its like something out of the old annals i told oneeye maybe the battle at torn torn wasnt this bloody uhm he was there he went back a long way i found an officer and asked where we should set up shop he suggested wed be the most use to bonegnasher going we passed uncomfortably near stormbringer oneeyes amulet burned my wrist friend of yours oneeye asked sarcastically what such a look you got from the old spook i shuddered lime thread taken on the wind that could have been stormbringer bonegnasher was a big one bigger than shifter eight feet tall and six hundred pounds of iron mean muscle he was so strong it was grotesque he had a mouth like a crocodile and supposedly had eaten his enemies in the old days a few of the old stories also call him bonecrusher because of his strength while i stared one of his lieutenants told us to go out to the far right flank where fighting had been so light no medical team had yet been assigned we located the appropriate battalion commander set up right here he told us ill have the men brought to you he looked sour one of his staff volunteered he was a company commander this morning it was hard on officers today when you have heavy casualties among your officers they are leading from the front to keep the men from breaking oneeye and i started patching thought you had it easy over here easy is relative he looked at us hard talking about easy when we had spent the day loafing on the pyramid torchlight medicine is a bunch of fun between us we treated several hundred men whenever i paused to work the pain and stiffness out of my hands and shoulders i glanced at the sky perplexed i had expected the taken to go crazy again tonight bonegnasher ambled into our makeshift surgery naked to the waist maskless looking like an oversized wrestler he said nothing we tried to ignore him his piggy little eyes remained tight as he watched oneeye and i were working on the same man from opposite ends he stopped suddenly head coming up like that of a startled horse his eye got big he looked around wildly what is it i asked i dont odd its gone for a second never mind i kept an eye on him he was frightened more frightened than the presence of the taken justified as if some personal danger threatened him i glanced at bonegnasher he was watching oneeye too oneeye did it again later while we were working separate patients i looked up beyond him down at waist level i caught the glow of eyes a chill scrambled down my spine oneeye watched the darkness nervousness increasing when he finished with his patient he cleansed his hands and drifted toward bonegnasher an animal screamed a dark shape hurtled into the circle of light toward me forvalaka i gasped and threw myself aside the beast passed over me one claw ripping my jerkin bonegnasher reached the manleopards point of impact the moment it did so oneeye unleashed a spell that blinded me the forvalaka and everyone watching i heard the beast roar anger became agony my vision returned bonegnasher had the monster in a deadly hug right arm crushing its windpipe left its ribs it clawed air futilely it was supposed to have the strength of a dozen natural leopards in bonegnashers arms it was helpless the taken laughed took a bite from its left shoulder oneeye staggered over to me should have had that guy with us in beryl i said my voice quavered oneeye was so frightened he was gagging he did not laugh i did not have much humor in me either frankly just a reflex sarcasm gallows humor trumpets filled the night with their cries men ran to their stations the rattle of arms overrode the strangling of the forvalaka oneeye grabbed my arm got to get out of here he said come on i was mesmerized by the struggle the leopard was trying to change it looked vaguely womanish come on oneeye swore sulphurously that thing was after you you know sent lets move before it gets away it had no end of energy despite bonegnashers immense strength and savagery the taken had destroyed its left shoulder with his teeth oneeye was right across the way the rebel was getting excited fighting could break out time to make tracks for both reasons i grabbed my kit and scooted we passed both stormbringer and soulcatcher getting back i gave each a mocking salute driven by i dont know what tomfool bravado one i was sure initiated the attack neither responded reaction did not set in till i was safe atop the pyramid with the company with nothing to do but think about what could have happened then i started shaking so bad oneeye gave me one of my own knockout draughts something visited my dreams old friend now golden glow and beautiful face as before my faithful need not fear there was a hint of light in the east when the drug wore off i wakened less frightened but hardly confident three times they had tried anyone that set on killing me would find a way no matter what the lady said oneeye appeared almost immediately you all right yeah fine you missed a hell of a show i raised an eyebrow the circle and the taken went at it after your lights went out only stopped a little while ago a little hairy around the edges this time bonegnasher and stormbringer got skragged looks like they did it to each other come here i want to show you something grumbling i followed him how bad did the rebel get hurt you hear different stories but plenty at least four of them bought it he halted at the front edge of the pyramid top gestured dramatically what you blind i got only one eye and i can see better than you give me a hint look for a crucifixion oh that told i had no trouble finding the cross planted near stormbringers command post okay so what thats your friend the forvalaka mine ours a delightfully wicked expression crossed his face end of a long story croaker and a satisfying one either way it was whoever killed tomtom i lived to see them reach an evil end yeah to our left raven and darling watched the rebel move up their fingers blurred they were too far for me to catch much it was like overhearing a conversation in a language with which you have only a formal acquaintance goobledegook whats eating raven lately what do you mean he dont have anything to do with anybody but darling dont even hang around the captain anymore hasnt gotten into a card game since we brought in feather and journey gets all sour whenever you try to be nice to darling something happen while we were away oneeye shrugged i was with you croaker remember nobody aint said nothing but now you mention it yeah he is acting strange he chuckled for raven strange i surveyed the rebels preparations they seemed halfhearted and disorganized even so despite the fury of the night he had finished filling the farther two trenches his efforts at the nearest had provided a half dozen crossing places our second and third level forces looked thin i asked why the lady ordered a bunch down to the first level especially off the top mostly from soulcatchers division i realized his outfit looked puny think theyll break through today oneeye shrugged if they stay as stubborn as they were but look they aint eager no more they found out we werent going to be easy we made them start to wonder to remember the old spook in the tower she hasnt come out yet maybe theyre getting worried i suspected it was more because of casualties among the circle than because of growing trepidation among the soldiers the rebel command structure must be chaotic any army falters when nobody knows who is in charge nevertheless four hours after dawn they began dying for their cause our front line braced itself the howler and the faceless man had replaced stormbringer and bonegnasher leaving the second level to nightcrawler the fighting had become formularized the horde swept forward into the teeth of the arrowstorm crossed the bridges hid behind the mantlets streamed around those to hit our first line they kept coming a neverending stream thousands fell before reaching their foes many who did make it battled only a short while then wandered off sometimes helping injured comrades more often just getting out of harms way their officers had no control the reinforced line consequently held together longer and more resolutely than i anticipated nevertheless the weight of numbers and accumulated fatigue eventually told gaps appeared enemy troops reached the retaining wall the taken organized counterattacks most of which did not attain the momentum to carry through here there weaker willed troopers tried to flee to the higher level nightcrawler distributed squads along the edge they threw the fugitives back resistance stiffened still the rebel now scented victory he became more enthusiastic the distant ramps and towers started forward their advance was ponderous a few yards a minute one tower toppled when it hit fill inadequately tamped in the far trench it crushed a ramp and several dozen men the remaining engines came on the guard redirected its heaviest weapons throwing fireballs a tower caught then another a ramp came to a halt in flames but the other engines rolled steadily forward reaching the second trench the lighter ballistae shifted aim as well savaging the thousands hauling the engines forward at the nearest trench pioneers kept filling and tamping and falling to our bowmen i had to admire them they were the bravest of the foe the rebel star was rising he overcame his weak start and became as ferocious as before our first level units fractured into ever smaller knots whirling swirling the men nightcrawler had scattered to keep ours from fleeing now battled overbold rebels who clambered up the retaining wall in one spot rebel troops pulled some of the logs free and tried to excavate a pathway up it was the middle of the afternoon the rebel still had hours of daylight i began to get the shakes oneeye whom i hadnt seen since it started joined me again word from the tower he said they lost six of the circle last night means there are only maybe eight left out there probably none who were in the circle when we first came north no wonder they started slow he eyed the fighting dont look good does it hardly guess thats why shes coming out i turned yeah shes on her way in person cold coldcoldcold i do not know why then i heard the captain yelling the lieutenant and candy and elmo and raven and who knows all else all yelling for us to get into formation grabass time was over i withdrew to my surgery which was a clump of tents at the rear unfortunately on the downwind side of the latrine quick inspection i told oneeye see that everything is squared away the lady came on horseback up the ramp climbing from near the tower entrance she rode an animal bred for the part it was huge and spirited a glossy roan that looked like an artists conception of equine perfection she was very stylish in red and gold brocade white scarves gold and silver jewelry a few black accents like a rich lady one might see in the streets of opal her hair was darker than midnight and hung long from beneath an elegant white and lace tricorner hat trailing white ostrich plumes a net of pearls kept it constrained she looked twenty at the oldest quiet islanded her as she passed men gaped nowhere did i see a hint of fear the ladys companions were more in keeping with her image of medium height all swathed in black faces concealed behind black gauze mounted upon black horses harnessed and saddled in black leather they resembled the popular picture of the taken one bore a long black spear tipped with blackened steel the other a big silver horn one rode to either flank trailing by a rigid yard she honored me with one sweet smile as she passed her eyes sparkled with humor and invitation she still loves you oneeye quipped i shuddered thats what im afraid of she rode through the company straight to the captain spoke to him for half a minute he showed no emotion corning face to face with this old evil nothing shakes him when he assumes his iron commander mask elmo came hustling up how you doing buddy i asked i had not seen him in days she wants you i said something like glug real intelligent i know what you mean enough is enough but what can you do get yourself a horse a horse why where just carrying a message croaker dont ask me speak of the devil a young trooper wearing the howlers colors appeared over the edge of the rear of the pyramid he led a string of horses elmo trotted over after a brief exchange he beckoned me reluctantly i joined him take your pick croaker i selected a chestnut mare with good lines and apparent docility swung aboard it felt good to be in the saddle it had been a while wish me luck elmo i wanted to sound flip it came out squeaky you got it and as i started away teach you to write those silly stories let up eh as i went forward i did wonder for a moment how much art does effect life could i have brought this on myself the lady did not look back as i approached she did make a small gesture the horseman on her right edged away leaving me room i took the hint halted concentrated on the panorama instead of looking at her i sensed her amusement the situation had worsened in the minutes i had been away rebel soldiers had attained several footholds on the second tier on the first our formations had been shattered the howler had relented and was letting his men help those below scramble up the retaining wall whispers troops on the third level were using bows for the first time the assault ramps were almost up to the nearest ditch the great towers had halted over half were out of action the remainder had been manned but were so far away the bowmen there were doing no damage thank heaven for small favors the taken on the first level were using their powers but were in so much danger they had little chance to wield them effectively the lady said i wanted you to see this annalist eh another sparkling gem from the company wit what is about to transpire so that it is properly recorded in at least one place i snuck a glance at her she wore a teasing little smile i shifted my attention to the fighting what she did to me just sitting there amidst the fury of the end of the world was more frightening than the prospect of a death in battle i am too old to boil like a horny fifteen year old the lady snapped her fingers the rider on her left raised the silver horn cleared the gauze from her face so she could bring the instrument to her lips feather my gaze flicked to the lady she winked taken feather and journey had been taken like whisper before them what power and might they possessed was now at the ladys disposal my mind scampered around that implications implications old taken fallen new taken stepping in to replace them the horn called out a sweet note like that of an angel summoning the hosts of heaven it was not loud yet it rang out everywhere as if coming from the very firmament the fighting stopped cold all eyes turned to the pyramid the lady snapped her fingers the other rider lifted his spear high let its head fall the forward retaining wall exploded in a dozen places bestial trumpeting filled the silence even before i saw them burst forth i knew and laughed elephants i hadnt seen war elephants since my first year with the company where did you get elephants the ladys eyes sparkled she did not respond the answer was obvious from overseas from her allies among the jewel cities how she had gotten them here unnoted and had kept them concealed ah that was the mystery it was a delectable surprise to spring on the rebel at the moment of his apparent triumph nobody in these parts had ever seen war elephants let alone had any notion of how to fight them the great grey pachyderms smashed into the rebel horde the mahouts had great fun charging their beasts back and forth trampling rebels by the hundred totally shattering their morale they pulled the mantlets down they lumbered across the bridges and went after the siege towers toppling them one by one there were twentyfour of the beasts two for each place of hiding they had been provided with armor and their drivers were encased in metal yet here and there the random spear or arrow found a chink either felling mahout or pricking a beast enough to enrage it elephants that lost riders lost interest in the fray the wounded animals went crazy they did more damage than those still under control the lady gestured again again journey signalled troops below lowered the ramps we had used for hauling material down and casualties up the troops off the third level saving the guard marched down formed up launched an attack upon chaos considering the respective numbers that seemed mad but considering the wild swing in fortunes morale was more important whisper on the left wing catcher in the center fat old lord jalena on the right drums pounding they rolled forward slowed only by the problem of slaughtering the panicked thousands the rebel was afraid not to run yet afraid to flee toward the rampaging elephants between him and his camp he did little to defend himself clear to the first ditch biter the howler and the faceless whipped their survivors into line cursed and frightened them into moving forward to fire all the enemy works attackers to the second ditch swirling over and around the abandoned towers and ramps passing on following the bloody trail of the elephants now fires among the engines as the men from the first level arrived the attackers advancing toward the nether ditch the whole field carpeted with enemy dead dead in numbers unlike anything i had seen anywhere before the circle what remained of it finally recovered enough to try its powers against the beasts they scored a few successes before being neutralized by the taken then it depended on the men in the field as always the rebel had the numbers one by one the elephants fell the enemy piled up before the attacking line we had no reserves fresh troops streamed from the rebel camps without enthusiasm but sufficiently strong to turn our advance a withdrawal became necessary the lady signaled it through journey very good i muttered very good indeed as our men returned to their positions sank down in weariness darkness was not far away we had made it through another day but now what those fools wont quit while the comet is in the sky and weve shot our last bolt the lady smiled record it as you saw it annalist she and her companions rode away what am i going to do with this horse i grumbled there was a battle of powers that night but i missed it i do not know for whom it was the greater disaster we lost moonbiter the faceless man and nightcrawler only nightcrawler fell to enemy action the others were consumed by the feud among the taken a messenger came not an hour after sundown i was readying my team to go below after having fed them elmo ran the relay again tower croaker your girlfriend wants you take your bow along there is only so much you can fear someone even someone like the lady resigned i asked why a bow he shrugged arrows too no word on that doesnt sound smart youre probably right oneeye its all yours silver lining time at least i would not spend my night amputating limbs sewing cuts and reassuring youngsters whom i knew would not survive the week serving with the taken gives a soldier a better chance of surviving wounds but still gangrene and peritonitis take their tolls down the long ramp to the dark gate the tower loomed like something out of myth awash in the silver light of the comet had the circle blundered waited too long was the comet no longer a favorable omen once it began to wane how close were the eastern armies not close enough but our strategy did not seem predicated on stalling if that were the plan we would have marched into the tower and sealed the door wouldnt we i dithered natural reluctance i touched the amulet goblin had given me back when the amulet oneeye had presented more recently not much assurance there i glanced at the pyramid thought i saw a stocky silhouette up top the captain i raised a hand the silhouette responded cheered i turned the gate looked like the mouth of the night but a step forward took me into a wide lighted passageway it reeked of the horses and cattle which had been driven in an age ago a soldier awaited me are you croaker i nodded follow me he was not a guard but a young infantryman from the howlers army he seemed bewildered here there i saw more of his ilk it hit me the howler had spent his nights ferrying troops while the rest of the taken battled the circle and one another none of those men had come to the battlefield how many were there what surprises did the tower conceal i entered the inner tower through the portal i had used before the soldier halted where the guard captain had he wished me luck in a pale shaky voice i thanked him squeakily she played no games at least nothing flashy and i did not slip into my role as sexbrained boy this was business all the way she seated me at a dark wood table with my bow lying before me said i have a problem i just looked at her rumors are running wild out there arent they about whats happened among the taken i nodded this isnt like the limper going bad theyre murdering each other the men dont want to get caught in the crossfire my husband isnt dead you know that hes behind it all hes been awakening very slowly but enough to have reached some of the circle enough to have touched the females among the taken theyll do anything for him the bitches i watch them as close as i can but im not infallible they get away with things this battle it isnt what it seems the rebel army was brought here by members of the circle under my husbands influence the fools they thought they could use him to defeat me and grab power for themselves theyre all gone now slain but the thing they set in motion goes on im not fighting the white rose annalistthough a victory over that silliness could come from this as well im fighting the old slaver the dominator and if i lose i lose the world cunning woman she did not assume the role of maiden in distress she played it as one equal to another and that won my sympathy more surely she knew i knew the dominator as well as did any mundane now alive knew i must fear him far more than her for who fears a woman more than a man i know you annalist i have opened your soul and peered inside you fight for me because your company has undertaken a commission it will pursue to the bitter end because its principal personalities feel its honor was stained in beryl and that though most of you think youre serving evil evil is relative annalist you cant hang a sign on it you cant touch it or taste it or cut it with a sword evil depends on where you are standing pointing your indicting finger where you stand now because of your oath is opposite the dominator for you he is where your evil lies she paced a moment perhaps anticipating a response i made none she had encapsulated my own philosophy that evil tried to kill you three times physician twice for fear of your knowledge once for fear of your future that woke me up my future the taken sometimes glimpse the future perhaps this conversation was foreseen she had me baffled i sat there looking stupidshe left the room momentarily returned carrying a quiver of arrows spilled them on the table they were black and heavy silverheaded inscribed with almost invisible lettering while i examined them she took my bow exchanged it for another of identical weight and pull it was a gorgeous match for the arrows too gorgeous to be used as a weapon she told me carry these always ill have to use them its possible tomorrow will see the end of the matter one way or the other the rebel has been mauled yet he retains vast manpower reserves my strategy may not succeed if i fail my husband wins not the rebel not the white rose but the nominator that hideous beast lying restless in his grave i avoided her gaze eyed the weapons wondered what i was supposed to say to not hear what i was supposed to do with those death tools and if i could do it when the time came she knew my mind youll know the moment and youll do what you think is right i looked up now frowning wishing even knowing what she was wishing maybe my idiot brothers were right she smiled reached with one of those tooperfect hands clasped my fingers i lost track i think i do not recall anything happening yet my mind did fuzz for a second and when it unfuzzed she was holding my hand still smiling saying time to go soldier rest well i rose zombielike and shambled toward the door i had a distinct feeling that i had missed something i did not look back i couldnt i stepped into the night outside the tower and immediately knew i had lost time again the stars had moved across the sky the comet was low rest well the hours for rest were nearly gone it was peaceful out cool with crickets chirping crickets who would believe it i looked down at the weapon she had given me when had i strung it why was i carrying an arrow across it i could not recall taking them off the table for one frightened instant i thought my mind was going cricket song brought me back i looked up the pyramid someone was up top watching i raised a hand he responded elmo by the way he moved good old elmo couple hours till dawn i could get a little shuteye if i didnt dawdle a quarter way up the ramp i got a funny feeling halfway there i realized what it was oneeyes amulet my wrist was burning taken danger a cloud of darkness reared out of the night from some imperfection in the side of the pyramid it spread like the sail of a ship flat and moved toward me i responded the only way i could with an arrow my shaft ripped through that sheet of darkness and a long wail surrounded me filled with more surprise than rage more despair than agony the sheet of darkness shredded something manshaped scuttled across the slope i watched it go never thinking of spending another arrow though i laid another across the bow boggled i resumed my climb what happened elmo asked when i got to the top i dont know i said i honestly dont have the foggiest what the hell happened tonight he gave me the onceover you look pretty rocky get some rest i need it i admitted pass it to the captain she says tomorrow is the day win or lose much good the news would do him but i thought he would like to know yeah they do something to you in there i dont know i dont think so he wanted to talk more despite his admonition about resting i pushed him away gently went into one of my hospital tents and curled up in a tight corner like a wounded animal denning up i had been touched somehow even if i could not name it i needed time to recover probably more time than i would be given they sent goblin to waken me i was my usual charming morning self threatening blood feud with anyone fool enough to disturb my dreams not that they didnt deserve disturbing they were foul i was doing unspeakable things with a couple of girls who could not have been more than twelve and making them love it its disgusting the shadows that lurk in the mind revolting as my dreams were i did not want to get up my bedroll was toasty warm goblin said you want i should play rough listen croaker your girlfriend is coming out captain wants you up to meet her yeah sure i grabbed my boots with one hand parted the tent flap with the other i growled what the hell time is it looks like the suns been up for hours it has elmo figured you needed the rest said you had it rough last night i grunted hastily put myself together i considered washing up but goblin headed me off get your war gear on the rebel is headed this way i heard distant drums the rebel had not used drums before i asked about it goblin shrugged he was looking pale i suppose he had heard my message to the captain win or lose today theyve elected themselves a new council he began to natter as men will do when frightened telling me the nights history of the feud among the taken and of how the rebel had suffered i heard nothing cheering he helped me don what armor i possessed i hadnt worn anything but a mail shirt since the fighting around roses i collected the weapons the lady had given me and stepped out into one of the most glorious mornings id ever seen hell of a day for dying i said yeah how soon is she going to be here the captain would want us on station when she arrived he liked to present a portrait of order and efficiency when she gets here we just had a message saying she would be out uhm i surveyed the pyramid top the men were about their business preparing for a fight nobody seemed in any hurry im going to wander around goblin did not say anything he just followed pallid face pulled into a concerned frown his eyes moved constantly watching everything from the set of his shoulders and careful way he moved i realized he had a spell ready for instant use it was not till he had dogged me a while that i realized he was body guarding i was both pleased and distressed pleased because people cared enough to look out for me distressed because my situation had become so bad i glanced at my hands unconsciously i had strung the bow and laid an arrow across part of me was on maximum alert too everyone eyed the weapons but no one asked i suspect stories were making the rounds strange that my comrades did not corner me to doublecheck the rebel arrayed his forces carefully methodically beyond the reach of our weapons whoever had taken charge had restored discipline and had constructed a whole armada of new engines during the night our forces had abandoned the lower level all that remained down there was a crucifix with a figure writhing upon it writhing after all it had suffered including having been nailed up on that cross the forvalaka remained alive the troops had been shuffled the archers were upon the third level now whisper having taken command of that whole tier the allies the survivors from the first level catchers forces and what not were on the second level catcher had the center lord jalena the right and the howler the left an effort had been made to restore the retaining wall but it remained in terrible shape it would be a poor obstacle oneeye joined us you guys hear the latest lifted an inquiring eyebrow they claim theyve found their white rose child after reflection i responded dubious for sure word from the tower is shes a fake just something to get the troops fired up i figured surprised they didnt think of it before speak of the devil goblin squeaked he pointed i had to search a moment before spotting the soft glow advancing along the aisles between enemy divisions it surrounded a child on a big white horse bearing a standard of red emblazoned with a white rose not even good showmanship oneeye complained that guy on the bay is making the light my insides had knotted in fear that this was the real thing after all i looked down at my hands wondering if this child was the target the lady had in mind but no i had no impulse to speed a shaft in that direction not that i could have gotten one halfway there i glimpsed raven and darling on the far side of the pyramid hands going zipzip i headed that way raven spotted us when we were twenty feet away he glanced at my weapons his face tightened a knife appeared in his hand he started cleaning his nails i stumbled so startled was i the knife business was a tick he did it only under stress why with me i was no enemy i tucked my bow and arrow under my left arm greeted darling she gave me a big grin quick hug she didnt have anything against me she asked if she could see the bow i let her look but did not turn loose i couldnt raven was as restless as a man seated on a griddle what the hell is the matter with you i demanded you been acting like the rest of us have the plague his behavior hurt we had been through some shit together raven and i he had no call to turn on me his mouth tightened to a tiny point he dug under his nails till it seemed he had to be hurting himself well dont push me croaker with my right hand i scratched darlings back as she leaned against me my left tightened on my bow my knuckles turned the color of old ice i was ready to thump the man take that dagger away and i stood a chance he is a tough bastard but ive had a few years to get tough myself darling seemed oblivious to the tension between us goblin stepped in he faced raven his stance as belligerent as mine youve got a problem raven i think maybe we better have a sitdown with the captain raven was startled he realized if only for a moment that he was making enemies its damned hard to make goblin mad really mad not mad like he gets with oneeye something died behind ravens eyes he indicated my bow ladys leman he accused f was more baffled than angry not true i said but so what if it was he moved restlessly his gaze kept flicking to darling leaning against me he wanted her away but could not put the demand into acceptable words first sucking up to soulcatcher all the time now to the lady what are you doing croaker who are you selling what only darlings presence kept me from going after him thats enough goblin said his voice was hard without a hint of squeak im pulling rank on everybody right now right here were going to the captain and get this talked out or were unvoting your membership in the company raven croaker is right youve been a pure ass lately we dont need it weve got enough trouble out there he stabbed a finger at the rebel the rebel answered with trumpets there was no confab with the captain it was obvious somebody new was in charge the enemy divisions came forward in lockstep slowly their shields arrayed in proper turtle fashion turning most of our arrows whisper adjusted quickly concentrating the guards fire on one formation at a time having the archers wait till the heavy weapons broke the turtle effective but not effective enough the siege towers and ramps rumbled forward as fast as men could drag them the guard did their best but could destroy only a few whisper was in a dilemma she had to choose between targets she elected to concentrate on breaking turtles the towers came closer this time the rebel archers were able to reach our men that meant our archers could reach them and ours were better marksmen the enemy crossed the nearest ditch encountering massed missile fire from both levels only when they reached the retaining wall did they break their formations streaming to the weak points where they had little success they then attacked everywhere at once their ramps were slow arriving men with ladders rushed forward the taken did not hold back they threw everything they could rebel wizards fought them all the way and despite the harm they had suffered for the most part kept them neutralized whisper did not participate she was too busy the lady and her companions arrived again i was summoned i clambered aboard my horse and joined her bow across my lap they came on and on occasionally i glanced at the lady she remained an ice queen utterly without expression the rebel gained foothold after foothold he tore whole sections of retaining wall away men with shovels hurled earth around building natural ramps the wooden ramps continued their advance but would not arrive soon there was one island of peace out there around the crucified forvalaka the attackers gave it a wide berth lord jalenas troops began to waver you could see a collapse threatening even before men turned to eye the retaining wall behind them the lady gestured journey spurred his horse forward down the face of the pyramid he passed behind whispers men through them stationed himself at the edge of the level behind jalenas division he raised his spear it blazed why i dont know but jalenas troops took heart solidified began to push the rebel back the lady gestured to her left feather went down the slope like a daredevil winding her horn its silver call drowned the blare of rebel trumpets she passed through the third level troops and leapt her horse off the wall the drop would have killed any horse id ever seen this one landed heavily gained its balance reared neighed in triumph as feather winded her horn as on the right the troops took heart and began driving the rebel back a small indigo shape clambered up the wall and scuttled to the rear skirting the base of the pyramid it ran all the way to the tower the howler i frowned puzzled had he been relieved our center became the focus of battle catcher struggling valiantly to keep his line i heard sounds glanced over saw that the captain had come up on the ladys far side he was mounted i looked back a number of horses had been brought up i stared down that long steep slope at the narrowness of the third level and my heart sank she was not planning a cavalry charge was she feather and journey were big medicine but not medicine big enough they stiffened resistance only till the rebel ramps arrived the level went slower than i expected but it went no more than a thousand men escaped i looked at the lady her face remained ice yet i felt she was not displeased whisper poured arrows into the mass below guards fired ballistae point blank a shadow crept over the pyramid i looked up the howlers carpet drifted out over the foe men crouched along its edges dropping balls the size of heads those plummeted into the rebel mass without visible effect the carpet crawled toward the enemy camp raining those pointless objects it took the rebel an hour to establish solid bridgeheads upon the third level and another hour to bring up enough men to press the attack whisper feather journey and catcher mauled them mercilessly oncoming troops clambered over drifts of their comrades to reach the top the howler carried his balldropping to the rebel camp i doubted there was anyone out there they were all in the pieslice awaiting their turns at us the false white rose sat her horse out about the second trench glowing surrounded by the new rebel council they remained frozen acting only when one of the taken used their powers they had done nothing about the howler though apparently there was nothing they could do i checked the captain who had been up to something he was lining horsemen up across the front of the pyramid we were going to attack down that slope what idiocy a voice inside told me my faithful need not fear i faced the lady she looked at me coolly regally i turned back to the battle it would not be long our troops had put aside their bows and abandoned the heavy weapons they were bracing themselves on the plain the whole horde was in motion but a vaguely slowed indecisive motion it seemed this was the moment when they should have run headlong swamping us roaring into the tower before the gate could be closed the howler came roaring back from the enemy camp moving a dozen times faster than any horse could run i watched the big carpet pass over even now unable to restrain my awe for an instant it masked the comet then passed on toward the tower a strange howl wafted down unlike any howler cry i had heard before the carpet dipped slightly tried to slow ploughed into the tower a few feet below its top my god i murmured watching the thing crumple watching men tumble down the five hundred foot fall my god then the howler died or lost consciousness the carpet itself began to fall i shifted my gaze to the lady who had been watching too her expression did not change the slightest softly in a voice only i heard she said you will use the bow i shuddered and for a second images flashed through my mind a hundred of them too quickly for any to be caught i seemed to be drawing the bow she was angry angry with a rage so great i shook just contemplating it even knowing it was not directed at me its object was not hard to determine the howlers demise was not caused by enemy action there was but one taken likely to be responsible soulcatcher our former mentor the one who had used us in so many schemes the lady murmured something i am not sure i heard it right sounded like i gave her every chance i whispered we werent part of it come she kneed her animal it went over the edge i threw one despairing look at the captain and followed she went down that slope with the speed that feather had shown my mount seemed determined to keep pace we plunged toward an island of screaming men it centered on a fountain of lime thread which boiled up and spread on the wind taking rebel and friend alike the lady did not swerve soulcatcher was in flight already friend and enemy were eager to get out of his way death surrounded him he ran at journey leapt knocked him off his horse bestrode the animal himself leapt it down to the second level ploughed through the enemy there descended to the plain and roared away the lady followed the path he blazed dark hair streaming i stayed in her wake utterly baffled yet unable to change what i was doing we reached the plain three hundred yards behind soulcatcher the lady spurred her mount mine kept pace i was sure one or both animals would stumble over abandoned equipment or bodies yet they and catchers beast too were as surefooted as horses on a track catcher sped directly to the enemy encampment and through we followed in the open country beyond we began to gain those beasts all three were as tireless as machines miles rolled away we gained fifty yards with every one i clutched my bow and clung to the nightmare ive never been religious but that was a time when i was tempted to pray she was as implacable as death my lady i pitied soulcatcher when she caught him soulcatcher raced along a road winding through one of the valleys west of charm we were near the place where we had rested on a hilltop and encountered lime thread i recalled what we had ridden through back at charm a fountain of the stuff and it hadnt touched us what was happening back there was this some scheme to leave our people at the rebels mercy it had become clear toward the end that the ladys strategy involved maximum destruction that she wanted only a small minority of either side to survive she was cleaning house she had but one enemy left among the taken soulcatcher catcher who had been almost good to me who had saved my life at least once at the stair of tear when stormbringer would have slain raven and i catcher who was the only taken to speak to me as a man to tell me a bit about the old days to respond to my insatiable curiosities what the devil was i doing here in a hellride with the lady hunting a thing that could gobble me up without blinking catcher turned the flank of a hill and when seconds later we rounded the same impediment had disappeared the lady slowed for a moment head turning slowly then yanked her reins swung toward woods that swept down to the edge of the road she halted when she reached the first trees my beast stopped beside hers the lady threw herself off her mount i did the same without thinking by the time i gained my feet her animal was collapsing and mine was dead standing on stiff legs both had fistsized black burns upon their throats the lady pointed started forward crouching arrow across bow i joined her i went carefully soundlessly sliding through the brush like a fox she stopped crouched pointed i looked along her arm flicker flicker two seconds of rapid images they stopped i saw a figure perhaps fifty feet distant back to us kneeling doing something swiftly no time for the moral questions i had debated riding out that creature had made several attempts on my life my arrow was in the air before i realized what i was doing it smacked into the head of the figure the figure pitched forward i gaped a second then released a long breath so easy the lady took three quick steps forward frowning there was a rapid rustle to our right something rattled brush she whirled and ran for open country slapping my arm as she passed in seconds we were on the road another arrow lay across my bow her arm rose pointing a squarish shape slid out of the woods fifty yards away a figure aboard made a throwing motion our way i staggered under the impact of the blow from no visible source spiderwebs seemed drawn across my eyes blurring my vision vaguely i sensed the lady making a gesture the webs disappeared i felt whole she pointed as the carpet began to rise and move away i drew and loosed with no hope my arrow would strike a moving target at that range it did not but only because the carpet jerked violently downward and to one side while the arrow was in the air my shaft ripped past inches behind the carpet riders head the lady did something the air hummed from nowhere came a giant dragonfly like the one i had seen in the forest of cloud it streaked toward the carpet hit the carpet spun flipped jerked around its rider fell free plummeted with a despairing cry i loosed another shaft the instant the man hit earth he twitched a moment lay still and we were upon him the lady ripped the black morion off our victim and cursed softly steadily she cursed like a senior sergeant what i filially asked the man was dead enough to satisfy me its not her she whirled faced the wood her face blanked for several seconds then she faced the drifting carpet she jerked her head at the wood go see if thats a woman see if the horse is there she began making comehither gestures at catchers carpet i went mind aboil catcher was a woman eh crafty too all prepared to be chased here by the lady herself fear grew as i slipped through the wood slow silent catcher had played a game on everyone and far more shrewdly than even the lady had anticipated what next then there had been so many attempts on my life might this not be the moment to end whatever threat i represented nothing happened though except that i crept up to the corpse in the wood ripped off a black morion and found a handsome youth inside fear anger and frustration overwhelmed me i kicked him some good abusing dead meat the fit did not last i began looking around the camp where the substitutes had waited they had been there a while and been prepared to stay a while longer they had supplies for a month a large bundle caught my eye i cut the cords binding it peeped inside papers a bale that must have weighed eighty pounds curiosity grabbed me i looked around hastily saw nothing threatening probed a little deeper and immediately realized what i had these were part of the hoard we had unearthed in the forest of cloud what were they doing here id thought catcher had turned them over to the lady eh plot and counterplot maybe he had delivered some and maybe he kept back others he thought would be useful later maybe we had been so close on his heels he had not had time to collect them maybe he would be back i looked around again frightened once more nothing stirred where was he she i reminded myself catcher was one of the shes i looked around hunting evidence of the takens departure soon discovered hoofprints leading deeper into the wood a few paces beyond the camp they reached a narrow trail i crouched looking down an aisle of forest through golden motes floating in shafts of sunlight i tried to work myself up to go on come a voice said in my mind come the lady relieved not to have to follow that trail i turned back it was a man i said as i approached the lady i thought so she had the carpet under one hand floating two feet off the earth get aboard i swallowed did as i was told it was like climbing aboard a boat from deep water i almost fell off twice as she followed me aboard i told her heshestayed on the horse and went on down the trail through the woods what direction south the carpet rose swiftly the dead horses dwindled beneath us we began to drift over the wood my stomach felt like i had drunk several gallons of wine the night before the lady cursed softly under her breath finally in a louder voice she said the bitch she ran a game on us all my husband included i said nothing i was debating whether or not to mention the papers she would be interested but so was i and if i mentioned them now id never get a chance to poke through them ill bet that was what she was doing getting rid of the other taken by pretending to be part of their plot then it would have been me then she would just leave the dominator in the ground she would have it all and be able to keep him restrained he cant break out without help she was thinking aloud more than speaking to me and i missed the evidence or ignored it it was right there all the time cunning bitch shell bum for that we began to fall i nearly lost what little my stomach contained we fell into a valley deeper than most in the area though the hills to either hand stood no more than two hundred feet high we slowed arrow she said i had forgotten to ready another we drifted down the valley a mile or so then upslope till we floated beside an outcrop of sedimentary rock there we hovered nudging the stone there was a brisk cold wind my hands grew numb we were far from the tower into country where winter held full sway i shivered continuously the only warning was a soft hang on the carpet shot forward a quarter mile distant was a figure lying low on the neck of a racing horse the lady dropped till we hurtled along just two feet off the ground catcher saw us she threw up a hand in a warding gesture we were upon her i released my shaft the carpet slammed up against me as the lady pulled it upward trying to clear horse and rider she did not pull up enough impact made the carpet lurch frame members cracked broke we spun i hung on desperately while sky and earth wheeled about me there was another shock as we hit ground more spinning as we went over and over i threw myself clear i was on my feet in an instant wobbling slapping another arrow across my bow catchers horse was down with a broken leg catcher was beside her on hands and knees stunned a silver arrowhead protruded from her waist indicting me i loosed my shaft and another and another recalling the terrible vitality the limper had shown in the forest of cloud after raven had felled him with an arrow bearing die power of his true name still in fear i drew my sword once my final arrow was gone i charged i do not know how i retained the weapon through everything that had happened i reached catcher raised the blade high swung with a vicious twohanded stroke it was the most fearful violent blow i have ever struck soulcatchers head roiled away the morions face guard popped open a womans face stared at me with accusing eyes a woman almost identical in appearance to the one with whom i had come catchers eyes focused upon me her lips tried to form words i stood there frozen wondering what the hell it all meant and life faded from catcher before i caught the message she tried to impart i would return to that moment ten thousand times trying to read those dying lips the lady crept up beside me dragging one leg habit forced me to turn kneel its broken she said never mind it can wait her breathing was shallow rapid for a moment i thought it was the pain then i saw she was looking at the head she began to giggle i looked at that face so like her own then at her she rested a hand on my shoulder allowing me to take some of her weight i rose carefully slid an arm around her never did like that bitch she said even when we were children she glanced at me warily shut up the life left her face she became the ice lady once more if ever there was some weird love spark within me as my brothers accused it flickered its last i saw plainly what the rebel wanted to destroythat part of the movement which was true white rose not puppet to the monster who had created this woman and now wanted her destroyed so it could bring its own breed of terror back to the world at that moment id gladly have deposited her head beside her sisters second time if catcher could be believed second sister this deserved no allegiance there are limits to ones luck ones power to how much one dares resist i hadnt the nerve to follow through on my impulse later maybe the captain had made a mistake taking service with soulcatcher was my unique position adequate to argue him out of that service on grounds that our commission ended with catchers death i doubted it it would take a battle to say the least especially if as i suspected he had helped the syndic along in beryl the companys existence did not appear to be in absolute jeopardy assuming we survived the battle he would not countenance another betrayal in the conflict of moralities he would find that the greater evil was there a company now the battle of charm had not ended because the lady and i had absented ourselves who knew what had happened while we were haring after a renegade taken i glanced at the sun was astonished to discover that only a little over an hour had passed the lady recalled charm too the carpet physician she said wed better get back i helped her hobble to the remnant of catchers carpet it was half a ruin but she believed it would function i deposited her collected the bow she had given me sat in front of her she whispered creaking the carpet rose it provided a very unstable seat i sat with eyes closed debating myself as she circled the site of catchers fall i could not get my feelings straight i did not believe in evil as an active force only as a matter of viewpoint yet i had seen enough to make me question my philosophy if the lady were not evil incarnate then she was as close as made no difference we began limping toward the tower when i opened my eyes i could see that great dark block tilting on the horizon gradually swelling i did not want to go back we passed over the rocky ground west of charm a hundred feet up barely creeping along the lady had to concentrate totally to keep the carpet aloft i was terrified the thing would go down there or gasp its last over the rebel army i leaned forward studying the jumble trying to pick a place to crash that was how i saw the girl we were three quarters of the way across i saw something move eh darling looked up at us shading her eyes a hand whipped out of shadow dragged her into hiding i glanced at the lady she had noticed nothing she was too busy staying aloft what was going on had the rebel driven the company into the rocks why wasnt i seeing anyone else straining the lady gradually gained altitude the sliceofpie expanded before me land of nightmare tens of thousands of dead rebels carpeted it most had fallen in formation the tiers were inundated in dead of both persuasions a white rose banner on a leaning pole fluttered atop the pyramid nowhere did i see anyone moving silence gripped the land except for the murmur of a chill northern wind the lady lost it for an instant we plunged she caught us a dozen feet short of crashing nothing stirred but windrippled banners the battlefield looked like something from the imagination of a mad artist the top layer of rebel dead lay as though they had died in terrible pain their numbers were incalculable we rose above the pyramid death had swept around it toward the tower the gate remained open rebel bodies lay in its shadow they had gotten inside there were but a handful of bodies atop the pyramid all rebel my comrades must have made it inside they had to be fighting still inside those twisted corridors the place was too vast to overrun quickly i listened but heard nothing the tower top was three hundred feet above us we couldnt get any higher a figure appeared there beckoning it was short and clad in brown i gaped i recalled only one taken who wore brown it moved to a slightly better vantage limping still beckoning the carpet rose two hundred feet to go one hundred i looked back on the panorama of death quarter of a million men mindboggling too vast to have real meaning even in the nominators heyday battles never approached that scale i glanced at the lady she had engineered it she would be total mistress of the world nowif the tower survived the battle underway inside who could oppose her the manhood of a continent lay dead a half dozen rebels came out the gate they launched arrows at us only a few wobbled as high as the carpet the soldiers stopped loosing waited they knew we were in trouble fifty feet twentyfive the lady struggled even with limpers help i shivered in the wind which threatened to bounce us off the tower i recalled the howlers long plunge we were as high as he had been a glance at the plain showed me the forvalaka it hung limp upon its cross but i knew it was alive men joined the limper some carried ropes some lances or long poles we rose ever more slowly it became a ridiculously tense game safety almost within reaching distance yet never quite at hand a rope dropped into my lap a guard sergeant shouted harness her up what about me asshole i moved about as fast as a rock grows afraid id upset the carpets stability i was tempted to tie some false knot that would give way under strain i did not like the lady much anymore the world would be better for her absence catcher was a murdering schemer whose ambitions sent hundreds to their deaths she deserved her fate how much more so this sister who had hurried thousands down the shadowed road a second line came down i tied myself we were five feet from the top unable to get higher the men on the lines took in the slack the carpet slid in against the tower poles reached down i grabbed one the carpet dropped away for a second i thought i was gone then they hauled me in there was heavy fighting downstairs they said the limper ignored me completely hurried away to get in on the action i just sprawled atop the tower glad to be safe i even napped i wakened alone with the north wind and an enfeebled comet on the horizon i went down to audit the endgame of the ladys grand design she won not one in a hundred rebels survived and most of those deserted early the howler spread disease with the globes he dropped it reached its critical stage soon after the lady and i departed chasing soulcatcher the rebel wizards could not stem it on any significant scale thus the windrows of dead even so many of the enemy proved partially or wholly immune and not all of ours escaped infection the rebel took the top tier the plan at that point called for the black company to counterattack the limper rehabilitated was to assist them with men from inside the tower but the lady was not there to order the charge in her absence whisper ordered a withdrawal into the tower the interior of the tower was a series of death traps manned not only by the howlers easterners but by wounded taken inside previous nights and healed by the ladys powers it ended long before i could thread the maze to my comrades when i did cross their trail i learned i was hours behind they had departed the tower under orders to establish a picket line where the stockade had stood i reached ground level well after nightfall i was tired i just wanted peace quiet maybe a garrison post in a small town my mind wasnt working well i had things to do arguments to argue a battle to fight with the captain he would not want to betray another commission there are the physically dead and the morally dead my comrades were among the latter they would not understand me elmo raven candy oneeye goblin they would act like i was talking a foreign language and yet could condemn them they were my brothers my friends my family and acted moral within that context the weight of it fell on me i had to convince them there was a larger obligation i crunched through dried blood stepping over corpses leading horses i had liberated from the ladys stables why i took several is a mystery except for a vague notion that they might come in handy the one that feather had ridden i took because i did not feel like walking i paused to stare at the comet it seemed drained not this time eh i asked it cant say im totally dismayed fake chuckle how could i be had this been the rebels hour as he had believed i would be dead i stopped twice more before reaching camp the first time i heard soft cursing as i descended the remnants of the lower retaining wall i approached the sound found oneeye seated beneath the crucified forvalaka he talked steadily in a soft voice in a language i did not understand so intent was he that he did not hear me come neither did he hear me go a minute later thoroughly disgusted oneeye was collecting for the death of his brother tomtom knowing him he would stretch it out for days i paused again where the false white rose had watched the battle she was there still very dead at a very young age her wizard friends had made her death harder by trying to save her from the howlers disease so much for that i looked back at the tower at the comet she had won or had she what had she accomplished really the destruction of the rebel but he had become the instrument of her husband an even greater evil it had been he defeated here if only he she and i knew that the greater wickedness had been forestalled moreover the rebel ideal had passed through a cleansing tempering flame a generation hence i am not religious i cannot conceive of gods who would give a damn about humanitys frothy carryingson i mean logically beings of that order just wouldnt but maybe there is a force for greater good created by our unconscious minds conjoined that becomes an independent power greater than the sum of its parts maybe being a mindthing it is not timebound maybe it can see everywhere and everywhen and move pawns so that what seems to be todays victory becomes the cornerstone of tomorrows defeat maybe weariness did things to my mind for a few seconds i believed i saw the landscape of tomorrow saw the ladys triumph turning like a serpent and generating her destruction during the next passage of the comet i saw a true white rose carrying her standard to the tower saw she and her champions as clearly as if i were there that day myself i swayed atop that beast of feathers stricken and terrified for if it were a true vision i would be there if it were a true vision i knew the white rose had known her for a year she was my friend and i had discounted her because of a handicap i urged the horses toward camp by the time a sentinel challenged me i had regained enough cynicism to have discounted the vision id just been through too much in one day characters like me dont become prophets especially not from the wrong side elmos was the first familiar face i saw god you look awful he said you hurt i could do nothing but shake my head he dragged me off the horse and put me away somewhere and that was the last i knew for hours except that my dreams were as disjointed and timeloose as the vision and i did not like them at all and i could not escape them the mind is resilient though i managed to forget the dreams within moments of awakening chapter seven rose the argument with the captain raged for two hours he was unyielding he did not accept my arguments legal or moral time brought others into the fray as they came to the captain on business by the time i really lost my temper most of the principals of the company were present the lieutenant goblin silent elmo candy and several new officers recruited here at charm what little support i received came from surprising quarters silent backed me so did two of the new officers i stamped out silent and goblin followed i was in a towering rage though unsurprised by their response with the rebel beaten there was little to encourage the companys defection they would be hogs kneedeep in slops now questions of right and wrong sounded stupid basically who cared it was still early the day after the battle i had not slept well and was full of nervous energy i paced vigorously trying to walk it off goblin timed me stepped into my path after i settled down silent observed from nearby goblin asked can we talk ive been talking nobody listens youre too argumentative come over here and sit down over here proved to be a pile of gear near a campfire where some men were cooking others were playing tonk the usual crowd they looked at me from the corners of their eyes and shrugged they all seemed worried like they were concerned for my sanity i guess if any of them had done what i had a year ago i would have felt the same it was honest confusion and concern based in care for a comrade their thickheadedness irritated me yet i could not sustain that irritation because by sending goblin around they had proven they wanted to understand the game went along quiet and sullen initially growing animated as they exchanged gossip about the course of the battle goblin asked what happened yesterday croaker i told you gently he suggested how about we go over it again get more of the detail i knew what he was doing a little mental therapy based on an assumption that prolonged proximity to the lady had unsettled my mind he was right it had it had opened my eyes too and i tried to make that clear as i reiterated my day calling on such skills as i have developed scribbling these annals hoping to convince him that my stance was rational and moral and everyone elses was not you see what he did when those oar boys tried to get behind the captain one of the cardplayers asked they were gossiping about raven i had forgotten him till then i pricked up my ears and listened to several stories of his savage heroics to hear them talk raven had saved everybody in the company at least once somebody asked where is he lots of headshaking someone suggested must have gotten killed the captain sent a detail after our dead guess well see him go in the ground this afternoon what happened to the kid elmo snorted find him and youll find her talking about the kid you see what happened when they tried to clobber second platoon with some kind of knockout spell it was weird the kid acted like nothing ever happened everybody else went down like a rock she just looked kind of puzzled and shook raven up he came bam hacking away she shook them all back awake like the magic couldnt touch her or something somebody else said maybe thats cause shes deaf like maybe the magic was sound ah who knows pity she didnt make it though kind of got used to her hanging around raven too need him to keep old oneeye from cheating everybody laughed i looked at silent who was eavesdropping on my conversation with goblin i shook my head he raised an eyebrow i used darlings signs to tell him they arent dead he liked darling too he rose walked behind goblin jerked his head he wanted to see me alone i extricated myself and followed him i explained that i had seen darling while returning from my venture with the lady that i suspected raven was deserting by the one route he thought would not be watched silent frowned and wanted to know why you got me you know how hes been lately i did not mention my vision or dreams all of which seemed fantastic now maybe he got fed up with us silent smiled a smile that said he did not believe a word of that he sighed want to know why what do you know he assumed i knew more about raven and darling than anyone else because i was always probing for personal details to put into the annals i dont know anything you dont he hung around with the captain and pickles more than anybody else he thought for about ten seconds then signed you saddle two horses no four horses with some food we may be a few days i will go ask questions his manner did not brook argument that was fine with me a ride had occurred to me while i was talking to goblin i had given up the notion because i could think of no way to pick up ravens trail i went to the picket where elmo had taken the horses last night four of them for an instant i reflected on the chance a greater force existed moving us i conned a couple men into saddling the beasts for me while i went and finagled some food out of pickles he was not easy to get around he wanted the captains personal authorization we worked out a deal where he would get a special mention in the annals silent joined me at the tail of the negotiations once we had strapped the supplies aboard the horses i asked you learn anything he signed only that the captain has some special knowledge he will not share i think it had more to do with darling than with raven i grunted here it was again the captain had come up with a notion like mine and had had it this morning while we were arguing hmm he had a tricky mind i think raven left without the captains permission but has his blessing did you interrogate pickles thought you were going to do that he shook his head he hadnt had time go ahead now still a few things i want to get together i hustled to the hospital tent accoutered myself with my weapons and dug out a present i had been saving for darlings birthday then i hunted elmo up and told him i could use some of my share of the money we had kyped in roses how much much as i can get he looked at me long and hard decided to ask no questions we went to his tent and counted it out quietly the men knew nothing about that money the secret remained with those of us who had gone to roses after raker there were those though who wondered how oneeye managed to keep paying his gambling debts when he never won and had no time for his usual black marketeering elmo followed me when i left his tent we found silent already mounted up the horses ready to go going for a ride eh he asked yeah i secured the bow the lady had given me to my saddle mounted up elmo searched our faces with narrowed eyes then said good luck he turned and walked away i looked at silent he signed pickles claims ignorance too i did trick him into admitting he had given raven extra rations before the fighting started yesterday he knows something too well hell everybody seemed to be in on the guesswork as silent led off i turned my thoughts to the mornings confrontation seeking hints of things askew and i found a few goblin and elmo had their suspicions too there was no avoiding a passage through the rebel camp pity i would have preferred to have avoided it the flies and stench were thick when the lady and i rode through it looked empty wrong wed simply not seen anyone the enemy wounded and camp followers were there the howler had dropped his globes on them too id selected animals well in addition to having taken feathers mount i had acquired others of the same tireless breed silent set a brisk pace eschewing communication till as we hastened down the outer border of the rocky country he reined in and signed for me to study my surroundings he wanted to know the line of flight the lady had followed approaching the tower i told him i thought we had come in about a mile south of where we were then he gave me the extra horses and edged near the rocks proceeded slowly studying the ground carefully i paid little attention he could find sign better than i i could have found this trail though silent threw up a hand then indicated the ground they had departed the badlands about where the lady and i had crossed the boundary going the other way trying to make time not cover his trail i guessed silent nodded stared westward he signed questions about roads the main northsouth high road passes three miles west of the tower it was the road we followed to forsberg we guessed he would head there first even in these times there would be traffic enough to conceal the passage of a man and child from ordinary eyes silent believed he could follow remember this is his country i said he knows it better than we do silent nodded absently unconcerned i glanced at the sun maybe two hours of daylight left i wondered how big a lead they had we reached the high road silent studied it a moment rode south a few yards nodded to himself he beckoned me spurred his mount and so we rode those tireless beasts hard hour after hour after the sun went down all the night long into the next day heading toward the sea till we were far ahead of our quarry the breaks were few and far between i ached everywhere it was too soon after my venture with the lady for this we halted where the road hugged the foot of a wooded hill silent indicated a bald spot that made a good watchpoint i nodded we turned off and climbed i took care of the horses then collapsed getting too old for this i said and fell asleep immediately silent wakened me at dusk they coming i asked he shook his head signed that he did not expect them before tomorrow but i should keep an eye out anyway in case raven was travelling by night so i sat under the pallid light of the comet wrapped in a blanket shivering in the winter wind for hour upon hour alone with thoughts i did not want to think i saw nothing but a brace of roebuck crossing from woods to farmland in hopes of finding better forage silent relieved me a couple hours before dawn oh joy oh joy now i could lie down and shiver and think thoughts i did not want to think but i did fall asleep sometime because it was light when silent squeezed my shoulder they coming he nodded i rose rubbed my eyes with the backs of my hands stared up the road sure enough two figures were coming south one taller than the other but at that distance they could have been any adult and child we packed and readied the horses hurriedly descended the hill silent wanted to wait down the road around the bend he told me to get on the road behind them just in case you never knew about raven he left i waited shivering still feeling very lonely the travelers breasted a rise yes raven and darling they walked briskly but raven seemed unafraid certain no one was after him they passed me i waited a minute eased out of the woods followed them around the toe of the hill silent sat his mount in the middle of the road leaning forward slightly looking lean and mean and dark raven had stopped fifty feet away exposed his steel he held darling behind him she noticed me coming grinned and waved i grinned back despite the tension of the moment raven whirled a snarl stretched his lips anger possibly even hatred smoldered in his eyes i stopped beyond the reach of his knives he did not look willing to talk we all remained motionless for several minutes nobody wanted to speak first i looked at silent he shrugged he had come to the end of his plan curiosity had brought me here i had satisfied part of it they were alive and were running only the why remained shadowy to my amazement raven yielded first whatre you doing here croaker id thought him able to outstubborn a stone looking for you why curiosity me and silent we got an interest in darling we were worried he frowned he was not hearing what he had expected you can see shes all right yeah looks like how about you i look like im not i glanced at silent he had nothing to contribute one wonders raven one wonders he was on the defensive what the hell does that mean fellow freezes out his buddies treats them like shit then he deserts makes people wonder enough to go find out whats happening the captain know youre here i glanced at silent again he nodded yeah want to let us in on it old buddy me silent the captain pickles elmo goblin we all maybe got an idea dont try to stop me croaker why are you always looking for a fight who said anything about stopping you they wanted you stopped you wouldnt be out here now youd never have gotten away from the tower he was startled they saw it coming pickles and the old man they let you go some of the rest of us wed like to know why i mean like we think we know and if its what we think then at least you have my blessing and silents and i guess everybodys who didnt hold you back raven frowned he knew what i was hinting but couldnt make sense of it his not being old line company left a communications gap put it this way i said me and silent figure youre going down as killed in action both of you nobody needs to know any different but you know its like youre running away from home even if we wish you well we maybe feel a little hurt an account of the way you do it you were voted into the company you went through hell with us you look what you and me went through together and you treat us like shit that dont go down too well it sank in he said sometimes something comes up thats so important you cant tell your best friends could get you all killed figured that was it hey take it easy silent had dismounted and begun an exchange with darling she seemed oblivious to the strain between her friends she was telling silent what they had done and where they were headed think thats smart i asked opal couple things you should know then one the lady won guess you figured that saw it coming or you wouldnt have pulled out okay more important the limper is back she didnt do him in she shaped him up and hes her number one boy now raven turned pale it was the first i could recall seeing him truly frightened but his fear was not for himself he considered himself a walking dead man a man with nothing to lose but now he had darling and a cause he had to stay alive yeah the limper me and silent went over this a lot actually this had occurred to me only a moment earlier i felt it would go better if he thought some considered deliberation had gone into it we figure the lady will catch on sooner or later shell want to make a move if she connects you youll have the limper on your trail he knows you hed start looking in your old stomping grounds figuring youd get in touch with old friends you got any friends who could hide you from the limper raven sighed seemed to lose stature he put his steel away that was my plan thought wed cross to beryl and hide out there beryl is technically only the ladys ally but her word is law there youve got to go somewhere where theyve never heard of her where this isnt my part of the world he seemed calm enough now so i dismounted he eyed me warily then relaxed i said i pretty much know what i came to find out silent silent nodded continued his conversation with darling i took the money bag from my bedroll tossed it to raven you left your share of the roses take i brought the spare horses up you could travel faster if you were riding raven struggled with himself trying to say thank you unable to get through the barriers he had built around the man inside guess we could head toward i dont want to know ive met the eye twice already shes got a thing about getting her side set down for posterity not that she wants to look good just that she wants it down true she knows how history rewrites itself she doesnt want that to happen to her and im the boy shes picked to do the writing get out croaker come with us you and silent come with us it had been a long lonely night i had thought about it a lot cant raven the captain has to stay where hes at even if he dont like it the company has to stay im company im too old to run away from home well fight the same fight you and me but ill do my share staying with the family come on croaker a bunch of mercenary cutthroats whoa hold it my voice hardened more than i wanted he stopped i said remember that night in lords before we went after whisper when i read from the annals what you said he did not respond for several seconds yes that youd made me feel what it meant to be a member of the black company all right maybe i dont understand it but i did feel it thanks i took another package from my bedroll this one was for darling you talk to silent a while eh i got a birthday present here he looked at me a moment then nodded i turned so my tears would not be so obvious and after i said my goodbyes to the girl and cherished her delight in my feeble present i went to the roadside and had myself a brief quiet cry silent and raven pretended blindness i would miss darling and i would spend the rest of my days frightened for her she was precious perfect always happy the thing in that village was behind her but ahead lay the most terrible enemy imaginable none of us wanted that for her i rose erased the evidence of tears took raven aside i dont know your plans i dont want to know but just in case when the lady and i caught up with soulcatcher the other day he had a whole bale of those papers we dug up in whispers camp he never turned them over to her she doesnt know they exist i told him where they could be found ill ride out that way in a couple weeks if theyre still there ill see what i can find in them myself he looked at me with a cool expressionless face he was thinking my death warrant was signed if i came under the eye again but he did not say it thanks croaker if im ever up that way ill check into it yeah you ready to go silent silent nodded darling come here i squeezed her in a long tight hug you be good for raven i unfastened the amulet oneeye had given me fixed it on her wrist told raven thatll let her know if any unfriendly taken comes around dont ask me how but it works luck yeah he stood there looking at us as we mounted still baffled he raised a hand tentatively dropped it i told silent lets go home and we rode away neither of us looked back it was an incident that never happened after all hadnt raven and his orphan died at the gates of charm back to the company back to business back to the parade of years back to these annals back to fear thirtyseven years before the comet returns the vision has to be false ill never survive that long will i
