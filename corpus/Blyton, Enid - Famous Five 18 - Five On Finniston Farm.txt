 chapter one the five are all together again phew said julian mopping his wet forehead what a day lets go and live at the equator it would be cool compared to this he stood leaning on his bicycle out of breath with a long steep ride up a hill dick grinned at him youre out of training ju he said lets sit down for a bit and look at the view were pretty high up they leaned their bicycles against a nearby gate and sat down their backs against the lower bars below them spread the dorset countryside shimmering in the heat of the day the distance almost lost in a blue haze a small breeze came wandering round and julian sighed in relief id never have come on this biking trip if id guessed it was going to be as hot as this he said good thing anne didnt come shed have given up the first day george wouldnt have minded said dick shes game enough for anything good old georgina said julian shutting his eyes ill be glad to see the girls again fun to be on our own of course but things always seem to happen when the four of us are together five you mean said dick tipping his hat over his eyes dont forget old timmy what a dog never knew one that had such a wet lick as tim i say wont it be fun to meet them all dont lets forget the time julian hey wake up ass if we go to sleep now well not be in time to meet the girls bus julian was almost asleep dick looked at him and laughed then he looked at his watch and did a little calculating it was half past two lets see now anne and george will be on the bus that stops at finniston church at five past three he thought finniston is about a mile away down this hill ill give julian fifteen minutes to have a nap and hope to goodness i dont fall asleep myself he felt his own eyes closing after a minute and got up at once to walk about the two girls and tim must be met because they would have suitcases with them which the boys planned to wheel along on their bicycles the five were going to stay at a place called finniston farm set on a hill above the little village of finniston none of them had been there before nor even heard of it it had all come about because georges mother had heard from an old school friend who had told her that she was taking paying guests at her farmhouse and had asked her to recommend visitors to her george had promptly said she would like to go there with her cousins in the summer holidays hope its a decent place thought dick gazing down into the valley where cornfields waved in the little breeze anyway we shall only be there for two weeks and it will be fun to be together again he looked at his watch time to go he gave julian a push hey wake up nother ten minutes muttered julian trying to turn over as if he were in bed he rolled against the gatebars and fell on to the hard dry earth below he sat up in surprise gosh i thought i was in bed he said my word i could have gone on sleeping for hours well its time to go and meet that bus said dick ive had to walk about all the time you were asleep i was so afraid id go off myself come on julian we really must go they rode down the hill going cautiously round the sharp corners remembering how many times they had met herds of cows wide farmcarts tractors and the like on their way through this great farming county ah there was the village at the bottom of the hill it looked old and peaceful and halfasleep thank goodness it sells gingerbeer and icecreams said dick seeing a small shop with a big sign in the window i feel as if i want to hang out my tongue like timmy does im so thirsty lets find the church and the busstop said julian i saw a spire as we rode down the hill but it disappeared when we got near the bottom theres the bus said dick as he heard the noise of wheels rumbling along in the distance look here it comes well follow it theres anne in it and george look shouted julian were here exactly on time whoohoo george the bus came to a stop by the old church and out jumped anne and george each with a suitcase and out leapt old timmy too his tongue hanging down very glad to be out of the hot jerky smelly bus there are the boys shouted george and waved wildly as the bus went off again julian dick im so glad youre here to meet us the two boys rode up and jumped off their bikes while timmy leapt round them barhng madly they thumped the girls on their backs and grinned at them just the same old couple said dick youve got a spot on your chin george and why on earth have you tied your hair into a ponytail anne youre not very polite dick said george bumping him with her suitcase i cant think why anne and i looked forward so much to seeing you again here take my suitcase havent you any manners plenty said dick and grabbed the case i just cant get over annes new hairdo i dont like it anne do you ju ponytail a donkeytail would suit you better anne its all right its just because the back of my neck was so hot said anne shaking her hair free in a hurry she hated her brothers to find fault with her julian gave her arm a squeeze nice to see you both he said what about some gingerbeer and icecream theres a shop over there that sells them and ive a sudden longing for nice juicy plums you havent said a word to timmy yet said george halfoffended hes been trotting round you and licking your hands and hes so dreadfully hot and thirsty shake paws tim said dick and timmy politely put up his right paw he shook hands with julian too and then promptly went mad careering about and almost knocking over a small boy on a bicycle come on tim want an icecream said dick laying his hand on the big dogs head hark at him panting george i bet he wishes he could unzip his hairy coat and take it off dont you tim woof said tim and slapped his tail against dicks bare legs they all trooped into the icecream shop it was half dairy half bakers a small girl of about ten came to serve them mums lying down she said what can i get you icecreams i suppose thats what everyone wants today you supposed right said julian a large one each please five in all and four bottles of ginger pop as well five icecreams do you want one for that dog then said the girl in surprise looking at timmy woof he said at once there you are said dick he said yes soon the five were eating their cold icecreams timmy licking his from a saucer before he had had many licks the icecream slid from the saucer and timmy chased it all the way round the shop as it slid away from his vigorous licks the little girl watched him fascinated i must apologize for his manners said julian solemnly he hasnt been very well brought up he at once had a glare from george and grinned he opened his bottle of gingerbeer nice and cold he said heres a happy fortnight to us all he drank half the glass at top speed and set it down with a great sigh well blessings on the person who invented icecream gingerpop and the rest he said id rather invent things like that any day than rockets and bombs ha i feel better now what about you others do you feel like going to find the farm whose farm asked the little girl coming out from behind the counter to pick up timmys saucer timmy gave her a large wet and loving lick as she bent down ooooh she said pushing him away he licked all down my face probably thought you were an icecream said dick giving her his hanky to wipe her cheek the farm we want is called finniston farm do you know it oh yes said the little girl you go down the village street right to the end and turn up the lane there up to the right the farmhouse is at the top of the lane are you staying with the philpots yes do you know them asked julian getting out some money to pay the bill i know the twins there said the girl the two harries at least i dont know them well nobody does theyre just wrapped up in each other they never make any friends you look out for their old greatgranddad hes a one he is he once fought a mad bull and knocked it out and his voice you can hear it for miles i was real scared of going near the farm when i was little but mrs philpot shes nice youll like her the twins are very good to her and to their dad too work like farmhands all the holidays you wont know tother from which theyre so alike why did you call them the two harries asked anne curiously oh because theyve both began the child and then broke off as a plump woman came bustling into the shop janie you go and see to the baby for me ill see to the shop now run along away went the small girl scuttling through the door little gasbag she is said her mother anything more you want no thanks said julian getting up we must go were to stay at finniston farm so we may be seeing you again soon we liked the icecreams oh so youre going there are you said the plump woman i wonder how youll get on with the harries and keep out of granddads way hes over eighty but he can still give a mighty good thumping to anyone who crosses him the five went out into the hot sun again julian grinned round at the others well shall we go and find the nice mrs philpot the unfriendly harries whoever they are and the fearsome greatgranddad sounds an interesting household doesnt it chapter two finniston farm the four children with timmy trotting beside them walked down the hot dusty village street until they came to the end and then saw the lane turning off to the right just as the little girl had told them wait a minute said anne stopping at a curious little shop at the end of the village street look heres a queer shop it sells antiques look at those old horsebrasses id like to get one or two of those and just see those lovely old prints oh no not now anne said julian with a groan this awful sudden craze of yours for secondhand shops has been going on too long horsebrasses youve got stacks of them already if you think were going to go into that dark smelly little shop and oh im not going in now said anne hurriedly but it does look rather exciting ill come by myself sometime and prowl round she glanced at the name on the shop front william finniston how funny to have the same name as the village i wonder if oh come on anne said george impatiently and timmy tugged at her skirt anne gave one backward glance at the fascinating little shopwindow and hurried after the others making up her mind to slip down to the shop one day when she was alone they all went up the little winding lane where red poppyheads jigged about in the breeze and after a while they came in sight of the farmhouse it was a big one three storeys high with whitewashed walls and the rather small windows belonging to the age in which it was built oldfashioned red and white roses rambled over the porch and the old wooden door stood wide open the five stood on the scrubbed stone entrance looking into the dim hall an old wooden chest stood there and a carved chair a rather threadbare rug lay on the stone floor and a grandfather clock ticked slowly and loudly somewhere a dog barked and timmy at once barked back woof woof be quiet timmy said george sharply afraid that a horde of farmdogs might come rushing out she looked for a bell or a knocker but couldnt see either then dick spotted a beautiful wroughtiron handle hanging down from the roof of the porch could it be a bell he pulled it and at once a bell jangled very loudly somewhere in the depths of the farmhouse making them all jump they stood in silence waiting for someone to come then they heard footsteps and two children came up the hallway they were exactly alike the most twinny twins ive ever seen thought anne in amazement julian smiled his friendliest smile good afternoon were the kirrins i er i hope youre expecting us the twins stared at him without a smile they nodded together come this way they both said and marched back down the hall the four stared at one another in surprise why so stiff and haughty whispered dick putting on a face exactly like the twins anne giggled they all followed the twins who were dressed exactly alike in navy shorts and navy shirts they went right down the long hall passed a stairway round a dark corner and into an enormous kitchen which was obviously used as a sittingroom as well the kirrins mother said the twins together and at once disappeared through another door shoulder to shoulder the children found themselves facing a pleasantlooking woman standing by a table her hands white with flour she smiled and then gave a little laugh oh my dears i didnt expect you quite so soon do forgive my not being able to shake hands with you but i was just making scones for your tea im so pleased to see you did you have a good journey here it was nice to hear her welcoming voice and see her wide smile the five warmed to her at once julian put down the suitcase he was carrying and looked round the room what a lovely old place he said you carry on with your sconemaking mrs philpot well look after ourselves just tell us where to go its nice of you to have us im glad to said mrs philpot i expect your aunt told you the farms not doing too well and she kindly said shed send you here for two weeks ive some other boarders too an american and his son so im pretty busy well you dont need to bother too much about us said dick in fact well camp out under a haystack if you like or in a barn were used to roughing it well that might be a help said mrs philpot going on with her mixing ive a bedroom that would do for the girls all right but im afraid you boys would have to share one with the american boy and er well you mightnt like him oh i expect well get on all right said julian but my brother and i would certainly prefer to be by ourselves mrs philpot what about putting up campbeds or something in a barn wed love that anne looked at mrs philpots kind tired face and felt suddenly sorry for her how awful to have to have your home invaded by strangers whether you liked them or not she went over to her you tell georgina and me anything youd like us to do to help she said you know making the beds and dusting and things like that were used to doing things at home and im going to enjoy having you said mrs philpot looking round at them all and you wont need to help very much the twins do a great deal too much i think bless them because they help on the farm too now you go up the stairs to the very top of the house and youll see two bedrooms one on each side of the landing the lefthand one is yours girls the other is where the american boy is sleeping and as for you two boys you can slip out to the barn and see if youd like a couple of campbeds there ill get the twins to take you the twins came back at this minute and stood silently shoulder to shoulder as alike as peas george looked at them whats your name she said to one twin harry was the answer she turned to the other and whats yours harry but surely you dont both have the same name exclaimed george well you see explained their mother we called the boy henry and he became harry of course and we called the girl harriet and she calls herself harry for short so theyre known as the harries i thought they were both boys said dick in amazement i wouldnt know which is which well they felt they have to be alike said mrs philpot and as harry cant have long hair like a girl harriet has to have short hair to be like harry i often dont know one from the other myself dick grinned funny how some girls want to be boys he said with a sly glance at george who gave him a furious look twins show the kirrins up to the top bedroom said mrs philpot and then take the boys out to the big barn they can have the old campbeds if they like the look of the barn we sleep out there said the harries both together and scowled just like george well you shouldnt said their mother i told you to take your mattresses to the little room off the dairy its too stuffy said the twins i say look here we dont want to cause trouble said julian feeling that the twins were too unfriendly for words cant we sleep in the room off the dairy certainly not said mrs philpot and sent the harries a warning glance theres room for you all in the big barn go on now twins do as i tell you take the four up to the top bedroom with the cases and then out to the barn the twins went to pick up the suitcases still looking mutinous dick interposed himself between them and the cases well carry them he said stiffly we dont want to be any more trouble to you than we can help and he and julian picked up a suitcase each and set off after the harries who looked suddenly surprised george followed with timmy more amused than cross anne went to pick up a spoon that mrs philpot had dropped thank you dear said mrs philpot look dont get upset by the twins theyre a funny pair but good at heart they just dont like strangers in their home thats all promise you wont mind them i do want you to be happy here anne looked at the kindly tired face of the woman beside her and smiled well promise not to worry about the twins if youll promise not to worry about us she said we can look after ourselves you know honestly were used to it and please do tell us when you want anything done she went out of the room and up the stairs the others were already in one of the two bedrooms at the top of the house it was a fairly big room whitewashed with rather a small window and boarded floors julian looked at the boards he was standing on i say look at the wood this floors made of solid old oak worn white with the years my word this farmhouse must be very old and look at the beams running across the walls and into the roof hey twins this is a fine old house of yours the twins unbent enough to nod in time together seems as if you two go by clockwork you speak the same words at the same time you walk in time you nod your heads in time said dick but i say do you ever smile the twins looked at him with dislike anne nudged dick stop it dick dont tease them perhaps theyd show you the barn now well unpack some clean things weve brought for you in our case and come down with them when were ready right said dick and he and julian went out of the room opposite with its door open was the other room where the american boy slept it was so very untidy that dick couldnt help exclaiming gosh how does he get his room into all that mess he and julian went down the stairs and dick turnecl back to see if the harries were following he saw them standing at the top each shaking a furious fist at the door of the american boys room and what a furious look on their faces too whew thought dick the harries have got some sort of hate on there lets hope they dont get one for us too well now for the barn he said aloud dont go so fast ju wait for the twins theyre just falling over themselves to look after us chapter three out in the barn the twins stalked out of the farmhouse and took the two boys round the dairy shed and up to an enormous barn one of them pushed open the great door i say said julian gazing into the dark barn i never saw such a fine barn in all my life its as old as the hills look at those beams soaring up into the roof it reminds me of a cathedral somehow i wonder why they built the roof so high what do you store in here twins sacks of meal said the harries together opening and shutting their mouths as one the two boys saw a couple of campbeds in a corner of the barn look here said julian if you really would rather sleep here alone well sleep in the little room off the dairy that your mother spoke of before the twins could answer a shrill barking came from the direction of the campbeds and the boys saw a tiny black poodle there standing up quivering in every hair what a tiny thing said julian is he yours twins whats his name snippet came the answer from both at once come here snippet at once the tiny black poodle hurled hunself off the campbed and raced over to them he fawned on them all barking in delight licking everyone in turn dick picked him up but the twins at once clutched snippet themselves hes our dog they said so fiercely that dick backed away all right all right you can have him but be careful tim doesnt eat him he said a look of fear came over the faces of the harries and they turned to one another anxiously its all right said julian hastily tims gentle with small things you neednt be afraid i say why do you have to be so dumb it really wouldnt hurt you to be a bit friendly and do let us sleep in your old room we really dont mind the twins looked at each other again as if reading one anothers thoughts and then they turned gravely to the boys not looking quite so unfriendly we will all sleep here they said we will fetch the other campbeds and off they marched snippet running excitedly at their heels julian scratched his head those twins make me feel peculiar he said i somehow dont feel they are quite real the way they act and speak together makes me feel as if theyre puppets or something theyre just jolly rude and unfriendly said dick bluntly oh well they wont get in our way much i vote we explore the farm tomorrow it looks quite a big one spreading out over the hillslopes everywhere i wonder if we could get a ride on a tractor at that moment a bell rang loudly from the direction of the house whats that for said dick tea i hope the twins came back at that moment with two more campbeds wkich they proceeded to set up as far from their own as possible dick went to give a hand but they waved him off and put up the beds most efficiently and quickly by themselves tea is ready they said standing up when the beds were finished and blankets and pillows set out on them we will show you where to wash thanks said dick and julian together and then grinned at one another better be careful said julian or well catch their habit of speaking exactly at the same moment i say isnt that poodle an amusing little fellow look at him stalking that jackdaw a black jackdaw the nape of his neck showing grey as he ran in front of snippet had flown down from somewhere in the roof of the barn as snippet danced after him he ran behind sacks scurried into corners and led the little dog such a dance that the two boys roared even the twins smiled chack said the jackdaw and rose into the air he settled himself neatly on the middle of the poodles back and snippet promptly went mad and tore about the barn at top speed roll over snippet shouted the harries and snippet at once flung himself on his back but the jackdaw with a triumphant chack rose at once into the air and alighted on one twins head i say is he tame said dick whats his name nosey hes ours he fell down a chimney and broke his wing said the twins so we kept him till it was well and now he wont leave us gosh said dick starring at them did you really say all that or was it the jackdaw you can talk properly after all nosey pecked at the twins ear nearest to him and the twin gave a yell stop it nosey the jackdaw rose into the air with a chackchackchack that sounded very like a laugh and disappeared somehere in the roof just then the two girls came to find the boys in the barn sent by mrs philpot who was sure they hadnt heard the bell timmy was with them of course sniffing into every corner enjoying the farmsmells everywhere they came to the barn and looked in oh there you are called anne mrs philpot said we timmy began to bark and she stopped he had caught sight of snippet sniffing behind the sacks still hunting for the cheeky jackdaw he stood still and stared what in the wide world was that funny little black creature he gave another loud bark and shot over towards the poodle who gave a tenified yelp and leapt into the arms of one of the twins take your dog away said both twins fiercely glaring at the four its all right he wont hurt snippet said george advancing on timmy and taking hold of his collar he really wont take your dog away shouted the twins and up in the roof somewhere the jackdaw said chack chack chack just as fiercely all right all right said george glaring as angrily as the twins come on tim that poodle wouldnt be more than a mouthful for you anyway they all went back to the farmhouse in silence snippet having been left behind on the campbed belonging to one of the twins they cheered up when they came into the big cool kitchen tea was now laid on the farmhouse table a big solid affair of old old oak chairs were set round and it all looked very homelike hot scones said george lifting the lid off a dish i never thought id like hot scones on a summers day but these look heavenly running with butter just how i like them the four looked at the homemade buns and biscuits and the great fruit cake they stared at the dishes of homemade jam and the big plate of ripe plums then they looked at mrs philpot sitting behind a very big teapot pouring out cups of tea you mustnt spoil us mrs philpot said julian thinking that really his hostess was doing too much please dont let us make too much work for you a loud commanding voice suddenly made them all jump sitting in a big wooden armchair near the window was someone they hadnt seen a burly old man with a shock of snowy white hair and a luxurious white beard almost down to his waist his eyes were startlingly bright as he looked across at them too much work whats that you say too much work ha people nowadays dont know what work is that they dont grumble grumble grumble asking for this and expecting that pah pah i say now now granddad said mrs philpot gently you just sup your tea and rest youve been out on the farm all day and its too much work for you that set the old man off again too much work now let me tell you something when i was a young lad i hallo whos this it was timmy he had been startled by the sudden shouting of the old man and had stood up his hackles rising and a low growl down in his throat and then a very curious thing happened timmy walked slowly over to the fierce old man stood by him and laid his head gently on his knee everyone stared in astonishment and george could hardly believe her eyes at first the old man took no notice he just let timmy stay there and went on with his shouting no one knows anything these days they dont know a good sheep or a good bull or a good dog they timmy moved his head a little and the old man stopped again he looked down at timmy and patted him on the head now heres a dog a real dog a dog that could be the best friend any man ever had ah he reminds me of my old true he does george was staring in amazement at timmy hes never done a thing like that before she said all dogs are like that with old granddad said mrs philpot softly dont mind his shouting hes like that see your timmy is lying down by granddad now theyll both be happy granddad will have his tea and be nice and quiet dont take any notice of him now still astonished the children ate a marvellous tea and were soon talking eagerly to mrs philpot asking her questions about the farm yes of course you can go on the tractor and weve an old landrover too you can motor round the farm in that if you like wait till my husband comes in hell tell you what you can do nobody saw a little black shadow come in at the door and sidle softly over to granddad snippet the poodle he had left the barn and come to the kitchen he loved it was only when mrs philpot turned round to ask the old man to have another cup of tea that she saw a very strange sight indeed she nudged the twins and they turned to look they saw timmy lying peacefully down on granddads big feet and snippet the poodle lying between timmys great front paws well what an astonishing sight to be sure granddads happy now said mrs philpot two dogs at his feet and now look heres my husband come along in trevor were all here the dogs as well chapter four junior a big man came into the kitchen very like the twins to look at he stooped and seemed tired he didnt smile but just nodded trevor here are the visitors i told you about said mrs philpot look this is julian and more visitors said trevor with a groan good heavens what a crowd of children wheres that american boy ive got a bone to pick with him he tried to set the tractor going by himself this morning and oh trevor never mind about that now just wash and come and have your tea said mrs philpot ive kept some of your favourite scones for you dont want any tea said her husband cant stop except for just one cup and that ill take into the dairy ive got to go and see to the milking bobs off today well help dad said the twins speaking together as usual and they got up from the table at once no you sit down said their mother youve been on the go from seven oclock this morning sit down and finish your tea in peace i could do with your help twins said their father as he went through the door towards the dairies but now your mothers got so many on her hands shell need you more than i do mrs philpot let the twins go if they want to said julian at once we can help you know were used to helping at home and whats more we like it said anne do let us mrs philpot well feel much more at home then cant we clear away and wash up and all that while the twins go and help with the milking you let em help shouted old greatgranddad suddenly from his corner making timmy and snippet leap to their feet startled what are children coming to nowadays waited on hand and foot pah now now granddad said poor mrs philpot dont you start worrying we can manage fine the old man made a loud explosive noise and banged his hand down on the arm of his chair what i say is this but he got no further for the sound of footsteps could be heard in the hall coming towards the kitchen and loud american voices came nearer and nearer see here pop i wanna come with you this is a deadandalive place you take me up to london with you aw pop go on do that the americans asked dick turning to the twins their faces had gone as black as thunder they nodded in came a burly man looking rather odd in smart town clothes and a fat pastyfaced boy of about eleven the father stood at the door and looked round rubbing his hands hiya folks weve bin over to that swell old town and picked up some fine souvenirs my my they were cheap as dirt we late for tea hallo whore all these folks he grinned round at julian and the others julian stood up politely were four cousins he said weve come to stay here stay here where you gonna sleep then demanded the boy pulling up a chair to the table this is a oneeyed place aint it pop no washbasins no shut up said the twins together and gave the boy such a glare that anne stared in astonishment aw go on i can say what i like cant i said the boy free country isnt it gee you should just see america thats something mrs philpot ill have a bit of that cake looks good to me cant you say please roared a voice from the corner that was greatgranddad of course but the boy took no notice and merely held out his plate while mrs philpot cut him an enormous slice of cake ill have the same as junior mrs philpot mam said the american and sat down at the table he held out his plate too say you should see the things weve bought weve had a day havent we junior sure pop said junior say cant i have an iced drink lookahere whos going to drink hot tea on a day like this ill get you some iced orangeade said mrs philpot rising let him get it himself little varmint that was greatgranddad again of course but the twins were already up and on their way to fetch the orangeade themselves george caught sight of their faces as they passed her and had a shock of surprise goodness how those twins hated that boy that old granddaddy of yours must be a bit of a nuisance to you said the american in a low voice to mrs philpot always butting in isnt he rude old fellow too now dont you set there whispering shouted granddad i can hear every word now now granddad dont upset yourself said poor mrs philpot you just sit there and have a nap no im going out again said greatgranddad heaving himself up theres some people that fair make me ill and out he went leaning on his stick a magnificent figure with his head of snowwhite hair and his long beard like someone out of the old testament said anne to dick timmy got up and followed the old man to the door with snippet close behind him junior saw timmy at once i say look at that big dog he said whos he ive not seen him before hey you come and have a bun timmy took not the slightest notice george addressed junior in an icy voice thats my dog timmy i dont allow anyone to feed him except myself shucks said junior and threw the cake down on the floor so that it slid to tims feet thats for you dog timmy looked down at the cake and stood perfectly still then he looked at george come here timmy said george and he walked straight to her the cake lay on the floor halfbroken into crumbs my dog is not going to eat that said george better pick it up hadnt you its made a bit of a mess on the floor pick it up yourself said junior helping himself to another bun my my what a glare youve got makes me want my sunglasses brother he gave george a sudden sharp dig in the ribs and she gasped timmy was beside her in a moment growling so deeply that junior slid out of his seat in alarm say pop this dogs fierce he said he made to bite me he did not said george but he might bite if you dont do what i said and pick up that bun now now said mrs philpot really distressed leave it it can be swept up afterwards will you have another piece of cake mr henning it really was an embarrassing meal and anne longed for it to be over junior quietened down considerably when he saw timmy lying down between his chair and georges but his father made up for that by talking nonstop about the wunnerful things he had bought that day everyone was extremely bored the twins came back with a jug of orangeade which they placed on the table with two glasses in case mr henning wanted some they then disappeared where have they gone demanded junior having poured a glass of orangeade straight down his throat in a most remarkable manner gee that was good the twins have gone to help with the milking i expect said mrs philpot looking suddenly very weary julian looked at her she must find these meals very tiring he thought coping with so many people junior piped up at once ill go and help with the milking he said and slid off his chair id rather you didnt junior said mrs philpot you upset the cows a bit last time you know aw gee that was because i was new to it said junior julian looked at mr henning expecting him to forbid junior to go but he said nothing he lighted a cigarette and threw the match down on the floor george scowled when she saw junior heading for the door how dare he go out to the milking against the wishes of his hostess she murmured a few words to timmy and he got up at once and ran to the door barring it against junior get outa my way you said junior stopping timmy growled say call him back will you said junior turning round no one said anything mrs philpot rose and began to gather things together it seemed to george as if she had tears in her eyes no wonder if this kind of thing happened every day as timmy stood like a statue in the doorway giving small threatening growls every now and again junior decided to give up he dearly longed to give the dog a kick but didnt dare to he walked back to his father say pop coming for a walk he said lets get out of here without a word father and son walked out of the other door everyone heaved a sigh of relief you go and sit down and have a rest mrs philpot said anne well do the washingup wed love to well its really kind of you said mrs philpot ive been on the go all day and twenty minutes rest will do me good im afraid junior gets on my nerves i do hope timmy wont bite him hell probably give him a nip before long said george cheerfully collecting cups and saucers with anne what are you boys going to do go to the milkingshed yes weve milked cows plenty of times said dick nice job i like the smell of cows see you later girls and if that little pest tries any tricks just give us a call id love to rub his face into that crumby mess on the floor im just going to sweep it up said anne see you at suppertime the boys went out whistling mrs philpot had disappeared only george anne and timmy were left for snippet had gone out with the harries i rather wish we hadnt come said george carrying out a tray to the scullery its an awful lot for mrs philpot to do still if she needs the money oh well we can help and well be out most of the day said anne we shant see much of junior little beast youre wrong anne youll see far too much of him its a good thing timmys there hes the only one that can manage people like junior chapter five evening at the farm george and anne went out to find the others in the milkingshed there were plenty of cows there swishing their tails the milking was almost finished and the twins were driving some of the cows back to their field hallo how did you get on asked anne fine it was fun said dick my cows did better than julians though i sang to them all the time and they loved it ass said george did you have a talk with the farmer yes he says hes got an old landrover and hell take us all over the farm tomorrow said dick pleased and we can ride on that tractor if bill thats one of his farmhands will let us he says bill wont have junior on the tractor at any price so maybe therell be ructions if he sees us on it well im all ready for a ruction and so is timmy said george grimly sooner or later im going to tell junior a few hometruths wed all like to do that said julian but lets hold our horses till a good moment comes i dont want that nice mrs phitpot upset and you know if we caused her to lose the two americans she might suffer badly in her pocket i bet they pay well well i understand all that too ju said george but timmy doesnt hes longing to have a go at junior and how i share that feeling said dick rubbing timmys big head whats the time shall we go for a walk no said julian my legs feel stiff with cycling up so many dorset hills today i vote we just stroll around a bit not go for miles the five set off together wandering round the farm buildings they were all very old some of them falling to pieces the roofs had great dorset tiles made of stone uneven and roughly shaped they were a lovely grey and were brilliant with lichen and moss arent they gorgeous said george stopping to look at the tiles on a small outhouse look at that lichen did you ever see such a brilliant orange but what a pity half of them have gone from this roof and someone has replaced them with horrid cheap tiles maybe the philpots sold them said julian old tiles like that brilliant with lichen can fetch quite a bit of money especially from americans theres many a barn out in america covered with old tiles from this country moss and all a bit of old england if i had a lovely old place like this i wouldnt sell one single tile or one single bit of moss said george quite fiercely maybe you wouldnt said dick but some would if they loved their farm enough and didnt want to see it go to pieces for lack of money their fields would be worth more than old tiles to them i bet old granddad wouldnt sell them if he could help it said anne i wonder if the american has tried to buy any of these tiles i guess he has they had an interesting time wandering round they found one old barnlike shed stacked with ancient castaway junk and julian rummaged in it with great interest look at this giant cartwheel he said peering into a dark corner its almost as tall as i am my word they must have made all their own wheels here in the old days in this very shed perhaps and maybe their own tools too look at this old tool what in the world is it they gazed at the curious curved tool still as strong and as good as it had been two or three centuries before it was heavy and julian thought that he wouldnt have liked to use it for more than ten minutes at a time but i bet old granddad could use it for a whole day and never get tired he said when he was a young man i mean he must have been as strong as an ox then well you remember what the girl at the dairy said put in anne she said he had once fought a bull and knocked it out we must ask him about that i bet hed love to tell us hes a real old character said julian i like him shouts and temper and all come on its getting latish we didnt ask about the evening meal i wonder what time we ought to get back for it half past seven said george i asked wed better go back now because well have to get ourselves clean and anne and i want to help lay the table right back we go said julian come on tim stop sniffing about that old rubbish surely you cant smell anything exciting there they went back to the farmhouse and the girls went to wash at the kitchen sink seeing mrs philpot already preparing for supper wont be a minute called anne well do those potatoes for you mrs philpot i say what a lovely farm this is weve been exploring those old sheds yes they need clearing out said mrs philpot who looked better for the rest she had had but old greatgranddad he wont have them touched says he promised his granddad not to let them go to anyone but we did sell some of those lovely old grey tiles once to an american of course a friend of mr bennings and granddad almost went out of his mind shouted day and night poor old chap and went about with a pitchfork in his hand all the time daring any stranger even so much as to walk over the fields we had such a time with him good gracious said anne having a sudden vision of the grand old man stalking about his fields shouting and waving a great pitchfork supper was really a very pleasant meal for mr henning and junior didnt come in there was much talk and laughter at the table though the twins as usual said hardly anything they puzzled anne why should they be so unfriendly she smiled at them once or twice but each time they turned their eyes away snippet lay at their feet and timmy lay under the table greatgranddad was not there nor was mr philpot theyre both making the best of the daylight said mrs philpot theres a lot to do on the farm just now the children enjoyed the meatpie that mrs philpot had baked and the stewed plums and rich cream that followed anne suddenly yawned a very large yawn sorry she said it just came all of a sudden i dont know why i feel so sleepy youve set me off now said dick and put his hand in front of an even larger yawn well i dont wonder we feel sleepy ju and i set off at dawn this morning and i know you girls had a jolly long busride well you go to bed all of you as early as you like said mrs philpot i expect youll want to be up bright and early in the morning the harries are always up about six oclock they just will not stay in bed and what time does junior get up asked george with a grin six oclock too oh not before nine oclock usually said mrs philpot mr henning comes down about eleven he likes his breakfast in bed so does junior what you dont mean to say you take breakfast up to that lazy little pest said dick astounded why dont you go and drag him out by the ankles well they are guests and pay well for being here said mrs philpot ill take junior his breakfast said george much to everyones astonishment timmy and i together wed like to wouldnt we timmy timmy made a most peculiar noise from under the table that sounded like a laugh to me said dick and im not surprised id just like to see juniors face if you and tim walked in on him with his breakfast do you bet me i wont do it demanded george really on her mettle now yes i do bet you said dick at once i bet you my new pocketknife you wont taken said george mrs philpot looked puzzled no no my dears she said i cant have one guest waiting on another though i must say those stairs are a trial to my legs when im carrying up trays ill take up juniors tray and mr hennings too if you like said george in a halfkind halffierce voice not mr hennings said julian giving george a warning look dont go too far old thing just juniors tray will be enough all right all right said george rather sulkily arent junior and mr henning coming in to supper not tonight said mrs philpot in a thankful voice theyre dining at some hotel in dorchester i think i expect they get a bit tired of our simple farmhouse meals i only hope they wont be too late back greatgranddad likes to lock up early the children were really glad when the evening meal was cleared away and washed up for they all felt heavy with sleep the good strong air the exciting day and the many jobs they had done had really tired them good night mrs philpot they said when everything was done were off to bed are the twins coming too the twins actually condescended to nod they looked tired out julian wondered where mr philpot and old greatgranddad were still out working he supposed he yawned well he was for bed and even if he had had to sleep on the bare ground that night he knew he would sleep well he thought longingly of his campbed they went their various ways the twins and julian and dick to the big barn the girls upstairs to the room opposite juniors george peeped into it it was even untidier than before and obviously junior must have been eating nuts up there for the floor was strewn with shells they were soon in bed the girls cuddled together in the big rather hard old bed the boys in their separate campbeds timmy was on georges feet and snippet slept first on one twins feet and then on the others he was always perfectly fair in his favours a crashing noise awoke the girls about two hours later and they sat upright in bed alarmed timmy began to bark george crept to the top of the stairs hearing granddads loud voice below and then crept back to anne its mr henning and junior come back she said apparently old granddad had locked up and they crashed and banged on the knocker my what a todo here comes junior and indeed here junior did come stamping up the stairs and singing loudly little pest said george wait till i take him his breakfast tomorrow chapter six a little excitement for breakfast it was fun to sleep in the barn dick tried to keep awake for a while and enjoy the barnsmell and the sight of the stars in the sky seen through the open door where a cool little nightbreeze came wandering in julian fell asleep at once and did not even hear the crashing of the knocker at the front door of the farmhouse when the hennings came in or the loud voices he awoke with a start at about one oclock in the morning and sat straight up in bed his heart beating fast what on earth was that noise he had heard he heard it again and laughed what an ass i am its only an owl or maybe more than one and gosh what was that high little scream a mouse or a rat perhaps the owls are hunting in here he lay still and listened he suddenly felt a rush of cool air over his face and stiffened that must have been an owls softfeathered wings owls wings made no noise he knew the feathers were so soft that not even a quickeared mouse could hear an owl swooping silently down there came another little highpitched squeak the owls doing his job well thought julian what a fine huntingplace for him a barn where foodstuffs are stored overrun with mice and rats of course i bet this owl is worth his weight in gold to the farmer well owl do your job but for goodness sake dont mistake my nose for a mouse ah there you go again just over my head i saw you then a shadow passing by he fell asleep once more and didnt wake until the sun streamed into the barn lighting up hundreds of tiny motes floating in the air julian looked at his watch half past seven and i meant to be up at seven dick wake up dick was so sound asleep that he didnt wake even when julian shook him he merely rolled over and settled down again julian glanced across the barn and saw that the twins campbeds were empty they had stacked their pillows and bedclothes in neat piles and disappeared silently out of the door without waking us thought julian pulling on his socks i wonder if i can wash at the big kitchensink dick will you wake up he said loudly it might be ten oclock for all you care dick heard the two shouted words and sat up at once looking aghast ten oclock oh no gosh i must have slept all round the clock oh i say i didnt mean to be late for breakfast i calm down grinned julian brushing his hair i only said it might be ten oclock for all you care actually its just gone half past seven thank goodness for that said dick lying back in bed oh for ten minutes more the twins have gone already said julian i wonder if the girls are up oh my goodness whats that something had jabbed him sharply in the back making him jump violently julian swung round expecting it to be junior or one of the twins playing a silly joke oh its you nosey the jackdaw he said looking at the cheeky bird now perched on his pillow youve got a jolly sharp beak chack said the jackdaw and flew to his shoulder julian felt flattered until the jackdaw pecked his ear here you take the bird he said to the unwary dick and handed nosey to him nosey promptly pounced on the watch lying beside dicks pillow and flew off with it dick gave an angry yell bring that back you ass of a bird dont you know a watch when you see one hes taken my watch ju goodness knows where hell hide it hes gone into the roof said julian wed better tell the twins perhaps they can deal with him now why doesnt he take juniors watch that would be a trick i should really applaud chack chack chack said nosey exactly as if he agreed he had to open his beak to say chack and the watch promptly fell out it bounced on to a sack far below and the bird swooped down to get it dick also swooped and as the watch had now slipped between two sacks he managed to get it before the jackdaw nosey flew up into the roof and chacked angrily dont use such bad language said dick severely strapping on his watch you ought to be ashamed of yourself they went out of the barn and round to the farmhouse there were sounds of people about and the two boys felt quite ashamed of being so late breakfast was on the table but already quite a number of people seemed to have had it the girls havent had theirs said dick looking at the places set in front of the chairs where george and anne had sat the night before but the twins have it looks as if everyone has except us four apparently ah heres mrs philpot sorry were late we overslept im afraid thats all right said mrs philpot smiling i dont expect my visitors to be up early anyone can sleep late on a holiday she held a tray in her hands and set it down on the table thats for mr henning hell ring when he wants his breakfast thats juniors tray over there i make the coffee when they ring she said and went out again there was cold ham for breakfast boiled eggs and fruit the two boys tucked in and looked round reprovingly when the two girls came with timmy behind them still sleepyeyed overslept i suppose said dick pretending to be shocked sit down ill pour you some coffee wheres junior not down yet i hope said george anxiously ive not forgotten my bet about taking up his breakfast i say do you think its all right to let george take up juniors breakfasts said julian after a pause george dont throw the tray at him or anything will you i might said george eating a boiled egg anything to get your new pocketknife from you well dont go too far in teasing junior said julian warningly you dont want to make the henning family walk out and leave mrs philpot high and dry all right all right said george dont nag i think ill have another egg dick pass one over please i dont know why im so hungry leave a bit of room for this ham said dick who had cut himself two good slices its out of this world simply too good to be true i could eat it all day the two girls tucked into their breakfast and just as they were finishing a bell rang very loudly in the kitchen jangling just above their heads they jumped violently mm philpot came into the room at once thats mr hennings bell she said i must make his coffee ill take up his tray said anne george is going to take up juniors oh no i really dont like you to do that said mrs philpot distressed just then another bell rang it jangled to and fro for a very long time thats juniors bell said mrs philpot he always seems to think im quite deaf badmannered little beast said dick and was pleased to find that mrs philpot didnt disagree anne waited till mr hennings tray was ready and then firmly put her hands to the sides im going to take it to mr henning she said in a most determined voice and mrs philpot smiled gratefully and let her lift it bedroom on the left of the stairs first floor she said and he likes his curtains pulled too when his breakfast is brought and does junior like his pulled as well inquired george in such a sugary voice that the two boys looked round at her suspiciously what was she up to now well i do pull them for him said mrs philpot but dont you pull them if you dont feel like it thank you very much dear anne had already gone upstairs with mr hennings tray and now george set off with juniors she winked at dick get that pocketknife ready for me she said and disappeared through the door grinning wickedly she went carefully upstairs with timmy close at her heels wondering whatever george was doing with a tray george came to juniors door it was shut she gave it a violent kick and it flew open she entered clattering with her feet and set the tray down on a table with a jolt that upset the coffee she went whistling to the windows and pulled the curtains back across the poles so that they made a loud clattering noise junior had apparently fallen asleep again his head under the clothes george upset a chair with a crash that made junior sit up half scared whats going on here he began cant you bring my breakfast without then he saw that it was george in the room not the kindly mrs philpot get out he said angrily crashing about like that pull the curtains across again the suns too strong and look how youve spilt the coffee why didnt mrs philpot bring my breakfast she usually does here put the tray on my knees like she does george whipped the bedclothes off him took up the tray and set it down violently on his pyjamad knees the hot coffee got a violent jerk and some drops fell on to his bare arm they were hot and he yelled loudly he lashed out at george and hit her hard on the shoulder that was a very great mistake timmy who was at the door watching leapt on to the bed at once growling he pulled the terrified boy on to the floor and kept him lying there standing over him deep growls coming from the depths of his great body george took absolutely no notice she went round the room humming a little tune putting this and that straight tidying the dressingtable not seeming to notice what timmy was doing she shut the door so that no one would hear juniors howls george take this dog off me begged junior hell kill me george ill tell my pop of you im sorry i hit you oh no take this dog off me please do he began to weep and george looked scornfully down at him you nasty spoilt little pest she said ive a good mind to leave you here all morning with timmy on guard but this time ill be generous to you come here tim leave that funny little worm there on the floor junior was still weeping he crept into bed and wrapped the blankets round him i dont want any breakfast he wept ill tell pop about you hell lam you all right yes you tell him said george tucking him in so tightly that he couldnt move you tell him and ill whisper into timmys ear that youve told tales of me and honestly i simply dont know what hell do you are the most horrible boy ive ever met said junior knowing when he was beaten george grinned so he thought she was a boy did he good mrs philpot isnt going to bring up your breakfast any more she said im going to with timmy see and if you dare to ring that bell more than once each morning youll be sorry i dont want my breakfast brought up said junior in a small voice id rather get up and go downstairs for it i dont want you to bring it right ill tell mrs philpot said george but if you change your mind just tell me ill bring it up any morning with timmy she went out and banged the door timmy trotting down the stairs in front of her puzzled but pleased he didnt like junior any more than george did george went into the kitchen dick and julian were still there youve lost your bet dick said george pocketknife please i not only took up his breakfast and accidentally spilt hot coffee on him but timmy here pulled him out of bed and stood over him growling what a sight that was poor junior doesnt want his breakfast in bed any more hes coming down for it each morning good for you george said dick and slid his pocketknife across the table you deserve to win now sit down and finish your breakfast and mind im not betting anything else for a long long time chapter seven the twins change their minds the twins harry and harriet had had their breakfast some while ago they now came into the big kitchen snippet at their heels and scowled to see the five still having breakfast there anne was in fits of laughter over georges account of the way she had dealt with junior you should have seen his face when i planked the breakfast tray on his knees and the hot coffee splashed him said george he let out a yell that startled even old timmy and when he hit me and timmy leapt on the bed and dragged him out on to the floor his eyes nearly fell out of his head no wonder hes decided to come down to breakfast each morning then said julian hell be scared stiff of you appearing with a breakfast tray again the twins listened to this in amazement they looked at one another and nodded then they walked up to the breakfast table and for once in a way only one twin spoke whether it was harry or harriet nobody knew for they both looked so much alike whats happened said the twin to george why did you take up juniors breakfast tray because we were all so fed up with the way junior and his pop impose on your mother said george fancy a boy having breakfast in bed so old george took it into her head to take up his breakfast herself and said shed teach him such a lesson hed be a bit more considerate of your mother in future said dick whats more i was idiotic enough to bet george she wouldnt do it and now shes won my best pocketknife off me look george proudly displayed the knife the twins each gave a sudden loud laugh which surprised the others very much well im blessed said dick fancy you being able to laugh you always look so fierce and unfriendly well now that youve condescended to talk to us let me tell you this we think your mother is absolutely tops and far from giving her more trouble were all going to help as much as we can got that both twins were smiling broadly now they took it in turns to speak which was really much more friendly than their usual stiff way of talking in unison we hate junior said one twin he thinks our mother is a kind of slave to come when he rings for her or shouts for her his fathers the same said the other twin wanting this and that and sending our mother all over the place to fetch and carry for him why doesnt he go and stay at a hotel he doesnt because hes so set on snooping out our old things and buying them said the other twin i know for a fact that mother has sold him some of her own things but she just had to have some money things are so expensive and we grow out of our clothes so quickly i say it is nice to hear you talking properly said julian clapping the twin on the back and now would you mind letting us know how to tell which of you is which i know ones a boy and ones a girl but you both look exactly alike to me you might be two boys the twins gave sudden mischievous grins well dont you tell junior then said one you can always tell me by this scar on my hand see harriet hasnt any scar im harry the four looked at the long thin scar on the boys hand i got that by tearing the back of my hand on barbed wire said harry now youll know us from each other i say tell us all about george and the breakfast tray from beginning to end good old george she looks just as much a boy as harriet does it was very pleasant to find the twins so friendly after their stiff sullen dislike the four warmed to them and when mrs philpot suddenly appeared in the kitchen to clear away breakfast she was astounded to see her twins talking and laughing gaily with the others she stood and stared a delighted smile on her face mother juniors not going to have breakfast in bed any more said harry listen why and the story had to be told all over again george went red she was half afraid that mrs philpot would be really displeased but no she threw back her head and iaughed oh that really does me good she said but i hope junior doesnt tell his father and they dont both go off in a hurry we do need their money you know much as i hate having them here now i must clear away breakfast no you mustnt thats our job said anne isnt it twins yes said both twins together were all friends now mother let them belong to the family well ill go and see to the chickens then if youre going to clear away said mrs philpot you can wash up too bless you look how would you like to go round the farm in our old landrover today said harry to the others its the best way to see over the farm i think bills got to go round this morning and check on the fields and the stock hell take you if i ask him fine said julian what time in about half an hour said harry ill find bill and when you hear a horn hooting come on out by the way bill isnt much of a talker but if he takes to you hell be quite pally right said julian can dick and i do something while the girls are clearing away gosh yes theres always something to do on a farm said harry come on up to the chickenhouses harriet and i are patching them up to stop the rain leaking in julian and dick with timmy behind them immediately went off with the twins now as merry and friendly as before they had been dour and sullen what a change well thank goodness i took juniors breakfast up to him and put him in his place said george folding up the tablecloth it was apparently just the one thing that would make the twins friendly hark anne i believe thats junior coming she slipped behind the dresser while anne set the chairs straight round the table junior came creeping in very quietly indeed and looked round fearfully he seemed very relieved to find only anne there he considered that she was quite harmless wheres that dog he asked what dog said anne innocently snippets no that great ugly mongrel and that awful boy he belongs to said junior still fearful oh you mean george i suppose said anne amused that junior thought george was a boy well look over there junior saw george advancing on him from behind the dresser gave one agonized yell and fled fearing that she had timmy somewhere behind her george laughed we shant have much trouble with him in future she said i just hope he doesnt say too much to his pop after a while they heard the sound of a hooter outside thats the landrover said george excited well weve just finished the washingup hang up the teacloths to dry anne ill pop these dishes into the cupboard soon they were out of the great kitchen door and down the passage that led to the yard not far off was a vanlike car the landrover it was an old one very dirty and a bit lopsided dick and julian yelled to the girls buck up didnt you hear us hooting the girls ran to the landrover bill the farmhand was at the wheel he grinned at them and nodded timmy greeted george as if he hadnt seen her for a year and almost knocked her down in his playfulness tim dont be such an ass said george planting your great muddy paws all over me where are the twins arent they coming naw said bill they be busy they all got in and were just about to set off when someone else appeared wait im coming wait i say and up ran junior full of himself as usual jump down tim go to him said george in a low voice and very willingly indeed timmy leapt down and ran fulltilt towards the unsuspecting junior he gave one loud yell turned and fled for his life well thats got rid of him said dick with much satisfaction look at timmy hes laughing all over his hairy old face you love a joke dont you tim it did indeed look as if tim was laughing for he had his mouth wide open showing all his teeth and his tongue was hanging out happily he leapt back into the car sensible dog that said bill and then relapsed into his usual silence as he started up the landrover with a really shattering noise it moved off towards the fields how it jolted the four clung to the sides of the van ahnost bumped off their seats as the landrover jerked its way over fieldpaths up hill and down hill jolting in and out of deep ruts appearing to be on the point of overturning at any minute anne wasnt sure that she liked it much but the others enjoyed every minute now youll see the farmland said bill as they came to the top of the hill look yonder could be the finest farm in the county if mester philpot had the money chapter eight all round the farm the five thoroughly enjoyed their ride over the big farm it spread out in all directions over undulating hills and the van swung up and down and continually lurched round corners it stopped every now and again so that the children might see the magnificent views bill told them the names of the great fields as they passed them thats oaktree field thats hangmans copse over there thats tinkers wood field and thats faraway field the furthest from the farmhouse name after name came from his lips and it seemed as if the sight of the fields he knew and loved suddenly set his tongue going he told them about the stock too thems the new cows over there give good milk they do helps a farmer no end to get money every week for milk you know and thems the bulls down in that field fine creatures too cost a mint of money but mester philpot he believes in good animals hed rather go without a new car than buy poor stock thems the sheep right away over there see dotted about on those slopes cant take you to see em today though youd like shepherd hes been here so long and is so old he knows every inch of the farm he relapsed into silence after this unusual spate of talk and turned down a path that took the children back towards the farmhouse using a different route to show them even more fields there were glorious fields of corn golden in the sun waving in the breeze with a wonderful rustling noise i could sit here for hours and look at that and listen said anne then dont you marry a farmer if so be you wants to do that for a farmers wife has no time to sit said bill dryly and was silent again they jolted along shaken to the bones but loving every minute cows calves sheep lambs bulls dogs ducks chickens chanted anne corn kale beet cauliflower ooh bill look out the van had gone at such speed into a deep rut that anne was nearly flung out timmy shot through the back entrance of the van and landed on the ground rolling over and over he got slowly to his feet looking most amazed timmy its all right it was only a bigger hole than usual shouted george buck up jump in as the landrover didnt stop timmy had to gallop after it and enter with a flying leap from the back bill gave a snort of laughter which made the wheel wobble dangerously this here old cars almost human he said just jigs about for joy on a day like this and he drove headlong over a slanting path and straight down into a hollow making poor anne groan again all very well for bill she said in julians ear hes got the wheel to hang on to in spite of the jolting and bumping the five immensely enjoyed their ride round the farm now we really know what its like said julian as the landrover came to a very sudden stop near the farmhouse throwing them all on top of one another my word no wonder old greatgranddad and mr and mrs philpot love the place its grand thanks awfully bill weve enjoyed it tremendously wish my people had a farm like this farm like this ay its taken centuries to grow said bill all them names i told you theym centuries old too nobody knows now who was hanged down in hangmans copse or what tinkers came to tinkers wood but theym not forgot as long as they fields are there anne stared at bill in wonder why that was almost poetry she thought he turned and saw her gazing at him he nodded at her you unnerstand all right miss dont you he said theres some that dont though that mr henning he raves about it all but he dont unnerstand a thing as fer that boy of his and to annes surprise he turned and spat into the ditch thats what i thinks of him oh its just the way hes been brought up i expect said anne ive met heaps of fine american children and well that one wants a hiding said bill grimly and if it wasnt that mrs philpot begged me to keep my hands offen him hed be black and blue that boy and so i tell you trying to ride on them scarey calves and chasing the hens till theyre scared off egglaying and stoning the ducks poor critturs and slitting sacks of seed just for the fun of seeing it dribble out and waste hoo wouldnt i like to shake him till his bones rattled the four listened in silence horrified junior was much worse than they had thought then george felt very very pleased that she had taught him a lesson that morning dont you worry any more about junior said julian grimly well keep him in order while were here they said goodbye and walked back to the farmhouse stiff and sore from the bumpy boneshaking ride but with their minds full of the lovely sloping hills the blue distance the waving corn and the feel of a farmland in good heart that was good said julian voicing the feelings of the others very good i somehow feel more english for having seen those dorset fields set about by hedges basking in the sun i liked bill said anne hes so so solid and real he belongs to the land just as the land belongs to him theyre one ah anne has discovered what farming really means said dick i say im most awfully hungry but i really dont like to go and ask for anything at the farmhouse lets go down to the village and get buns and milk at the dairy oh yes said anne and george and timmy gave a few sharp short barks as if he thoroughly agreed they set off down the lane that led to the village and soon came to the little icecream shop half bakers half dairy janie the small talkative girl was there again she smiled at them in delight youre here again she said in pleasure mums made some macaroons this morning see all gooey and fresh now how did you guess that we are all very partial to macaroons said dick sitting down at one of the two little tables there well have a plateful please what a whole plateful exclaimed janie but theres about twenty on a plate just about right said dick and an icecream each please large and dont forget our dog will you oh no i wont said janie hes a very nice dog isnt he have you noticed what lovely smiley eyes he has well yes we have we know him quite well you see said dick amused george looked pleased she did so like timmy to be praised timmy liked it too he actually went up to janie and licked her hand soon they had a plateful of delicious macaroons in front of them and they were indeed nice and very gooey inside as janie had so rightly said george gave timmy one but it was really wasted on him because he gave one crunch and then swallowed it he also chased his icecream all over the floor again much to janies delight how do you like it at mrs philpots she asked kind isnt she very said everyone together we love being at the farm said anne weve been all over it this morning in the landrover did bill take you asked janie hes my uncle but he dont usually say much to strangers well he said plenty to us said julian he was most interesting does he like macaroons oooh yes said janie rather astonished everyone likes mums macaroons could he eat six do you think asked julian ooooh yes said janie still astonished her blue eyes opened wide right put six in a bag for me said julian ill give them to him in return for a jolly fine ride thats right down nice of you said janie pleased my uncles been on finniston farm all his life you ought to get him to show you where finniston castle used to stand before it was burnt down and finniston castle exclaimed george in surprise we went all over the farm this morning and saw every field but we didnt see any ruined castle oh no you wouldnt see anything said janie i told you it was burnt down right to the ground ages ago finniston farm belonged to it you know theres some pictures of it in a shop down the road i saw them and now janie janie how many times have i told you not to chatter to customers said janies mother bustling in frowning that tongue of yours cant you learn that people dont want to hear your chatter chatter chatter we like talking to janie said julian politely shes most interesting please dont send her away but janie had fled redcheeked and scared her mother began to arrange the goods on the counter lets see now what did you have she said good gracious where are all those macaroons gone there were at least two dozen there er well we had almost twenty and the dog helped of course and janie put six in a bag for us lets see now there were twentyfour on that plate said janies mother still amazed twentyfour i counted them and five icecreams said julian how much is that altogether most delicious macaroons they were janies mother couldnt help smiling she totted up the bill and julian paid come again she said and dont you let that little gasbag of mine bore you they set off down the street feeling very pleased with life timmy kept licking his lips as if he could still taste macaroon and icecream they walked to the end of the street and came to the little lane that led up to the farm anne stopped id like to go and look at the horsebrasses in this little antique shop she said you go on ill come later ill come in with you said george and she turned to the little shopwindow the boys walked on by themselves well probably be helping on the farm somewhere shouted back dick so long just as anne and george were going into the shop two people came out and almost bumped into them one was mr henning the american the other was a man they hadnt seen before good morning mr henning said to them and went into the street with his friend anne and george walked into the dark little shop there was an old man there drumming on the counter looking quite angry he gave the two girls such a glare that they felt quite frightened that man said the old man and frowned so fiercely that his glasses fell off anne helped him to find them among the clutter of quaint old trinkets on his counter he fixed them on his nose again and looked sternly at the two girls and timmy if youve come to waste my time please go he said im a busy man children are no good to me just want to nose round and touch this and that and never buy anything that american boy now hes ah but you dont know what im talking about do you im upset im always upset when people want to buy our beautiful old things and take them away to a country they dont belong to now its all right mr finniston said anne in her gentle voice you are mr finniston arent you i just wanted to look at those lovely old horsebrasses please i wont bother you for long were staying at finniston farm and ah at finniston farm did you say said the old man his face brightening then youve met my great friend dear old jonathan philpot my very great friend is that mr philpot the twins father asked george no no no its old greatgranddad we went to school together said the old man excited ah i could tell you some tales of the finnistons and the castle they once owned yes yes im a descendant of the owners of that castle you know the one that was burnt down oh the tales i could tell you and it was just at that moment that the adventure began the finniston farm adventure that the fivewere never to forget chapter nine a very interesting tale anne and george looked at the quaint old man fascinated as he talked to them he stood there behind the counter of his little dark antique shop surrounded by things even older than himself a little bent old man with only a few hairs on his head he had a kindly wrinkled face with eyes so hooded with drooping lids that they seemed to look out through slits the two girls were thrilled to hear that old mr finniston was actually descended from the longago finnistons who lived in finniston castle is that why your names finniston asked anne tell us about the castle we only heard about it for the first time today but we dont even know exactly whereabouts it stood i didnt see a single stone when we went round the farm this morning no no you wouldnt said mr finniston it was burnt right down to the ground you see and through the centuries people have taken the old stones for building walls ah well it was a long long time ago how long asked george lets see now it was burnt down in the twelfth century said mr finniston norman times you know ever heard of the normans schooling isnt what it was i know so maybe of course weve heard of the normans said george indignantly every child knows them they conquered england and the first norman king was william the first hmm thats right youve had some schooling then said mr finniston well it was a norman castle look like that one in this picture see and he showed them a copy of an old print they gazed at the stone castle pictured there yes its a norman castle said george was finniston castle just like that ive got a copy of an old drawing of it somewhere said the old fellow ill find it and show it to you sometime a small castle of course but a very fine specimen well well you wont be interested in such details i know how it was burnt down i dont know cant find out for certain the story goes that it was attacked at night by the enemy and there were traitors in the castle itself who set fire to it and while the castle folk were fighting the fire the enemy walked in and slew nearly all of them so the castle was no use for living in after that i suppose said anne but its strange there isnt even a stone to be seen anywhere oh but thats where youre wrong said mr finniston triumphantly there are stones from the castle all over the farm but only i and old greatgranddad know where they are now theres an old wall with some of the castle stones at the bottom and theres a well but no i mustnt tell you these secrets you might tell them to the americans who come here and buy up all our old treasures we wont we promise said both girls at once and timmy thumped his tail on the floor as if he too agreed well maybe greatgranddad will show you one or two of the old castle stones said mr finniston but i doubt it i doubt it ill tell you one thing you can see at the farmhouse though everybody knows about it so its no secret have you seen the old kitchen door that leads out into the yard yes that oak door studded with iron knobs do you mean said anne at once theyre quite fashionable now as front doors in ordinary houses you know surely that farmhouse door isnt a real old one mr finniston put his head into his hands and groaned as if he were in pain fashionable fashionable what will they do next surely you cant mix up that fine old door with the trashy copies youve seen in modern houses whats the world coming to couldnt you feel that that door was real was as old as the centuries and once hung on great hinges in a castle dont you know when things are grand with the weight of years well said anne rather out of her depth i did notice the door but you see its very dark just there and we really cant see it very clearly ah well most people go about with their eyes shut half the time said mr finniston you have a look at that door feel it look at the great knocker on it think of the old norman folk who hammered on the door with it all those ages ago george sighed this kind of thing didnt interest her as much as it interested anne a thought suddenly struck her but mr finniston if the castle was built of stone how was it burnt to the ground she said what happened i cant find out said mr finniston sadly ive been into every old library in the county and looked up every old book of that period and ive delved into the old records in finniston church as far as i can make out the castle was stormed by enemies and as i said a traitor inside set fire to it at the same time the floors fell in and the castle was left blazing from top to bottom the great walls fell inwards and covered the base and the finniston family fled lord finniston was killed but his lady took the children and hid them its said she hid them in the old chapel near the barns of the farm maybe she took them down a secret underground passage leading from the dungeons to the old chapel itself an old chapel is it still there asked anne or was it burnt too no it wasnt burnt its still standing said mr finniston old greatgranddad will show you he shook his head sorrowfully its a storehouse for grain now sad sad but mind you its still full of prayer the girls stared at him wondering what he meant they began to think he must be a little mad he stood with his head bent saying nothing for a while then he looked up well thats the story my dears and its not only a story its history it happened over seven hundred years ago and ill tell you something else what asked the two girls that castle had cellars and dungeons said the old man the fire only burnt down to the ground floor which was made of earth flattened down not wood so it wouldnt burn the cellars and dungeons cant have been destroyed are they still there undamaged thats whats been in my mind all these long years what was down in those cellars and is it still there he spoke in such a hollow voice that the girls felt quite scared george recovered herself first but why were the dungeons never uncovered she asked i mean surely someone must have thought of them and wondered about them well when the castle fell and the walls collapsed any underground entrances must have been completely covered with enormously heavy stones said mr finniston peering at them earnestly the peasants and farmhands living around couldnt possibly move them and maybe they were too scared to anyhow they probably lay there for years till the wind and weather broke them up then they were taken to build walls and line wells but by that time everyone had forgotten about dungeons might have been centuries later you see he stood and brooded for a while and the girls waited politely for him to go on yes everyone forgot and everyone still forgets he said sometimes i wake up in the night and wonder whats underground there bones of prisoners chests of money things stored away by the lady of the castle i wake up and wonder anne felt uncomfortable poor old man he lived absolutely in the past his mind had weaved for him a living fantasy a story that had no certain foundation no real truth she was sorry for him she wished she could go and see the place where the old castle had once stood it would be overgrown with grass and weeds nettles would wave there and poppies dance in the summer there would probably be nothing at all to show where once a proud castle had stood its towers high against the sky flags flying along the battlements she could almost hear the cries of the enemy galloping up on horseback and the fearful clash of swords she shook herself and stood up straight im as bad as this old man she thought imagining things but what a tale the others will love to hear it i wonder if the american knows it does that american mr henning know the old story she asked and the old man straightened up at once not the whole of it only what he has heard in the village he said he comes here and pesters me hed like to bring in men and dig up the whole thing i know him hed buy up all the farm just for the sake of getting that castle site if he really knew there was something worth having deep under the ground where it once stood you wont tell him what ive told you will you ive talked too much i always do when someones upset me ah to think my ancestors once lived in finniston castle and here i am now a poor old man in a little antique shop that nobody comes to well weve come to it said anne i did want to buy some horsebrasses but ill come another time youre upset now you go and have a rest they went out of the little shop almost on tiptoe my word said george thrilled i just cant wait to tell the boys what a story and it really sounded true anne didnt it i vote we find out where that old castle really stood and then go and have a look round who knows what we might find come along lets get back to the farm as quickly as we can chapter ten quite a bit of shouting anne and george with timmy running in front went back to the farm to find the boys but they couldnt see them anywhere and gave it up then they went indoors and found mrs philpot shelling peas they took over the job at once the boys are still helping to mend the henhouse said mrs philpot the harries are pleased to have two more pairs of hands to help them something always seems to need repairing if only we could get a few things we need so badly a new tractor for instance but they cost so much the barns want mending too and the henhouses are almost falling down i hope the harvest will be good for you said anne that will help wont it oh yes well keep our fingers crossed for fine weather from now on said mrs philpot thank goodness the cows are such good milkers what we should do without our milkmoney i really dont know but there why should i bother you with my troubles when youre here for a nice holiday you dont bother us and we think its awfully nice of you to let us help said anne we shouldnt like it if you didnt the girls had no chance of telling the boys what old mr finniston had told them until the afternoon came they were up at the henhouses with the two harries and snippet happily hammering and sawing snippet was delighted to have so many people whistling cheerily round him and busily took bits of wood from one boy to another under the mistaken impression that he was a great help nosey the jackdaw was there too but he wasnt nearly so popular as snippet he pounced on any bright nail or screw he saw and flew off with it heedless of the exasperated shouts that followed him blow that jackdaw said julian looking up crossly hes just taken the very nail i wanted nosey by name and nosey by nature the twins laughed they seemed entirely different children now that they were friendly amusing helpful and most responsible julian and dick admired them no work was too hard no hours were too long if they could help their mother or father we hated you coming here because we knew it would give mother so much more work said harry we thought if we were beastly to you youd go but you dont make more work you help an awful lot its fun to have you here i hope the girls are back said dick i know your mother wants help with the peas such a lot of people to shell for let me see counting in your greatgranddad there will be about a dozen people in to dinner whew i certainly do hope the girls are in ah here comes that nosey jackdaw again look out dick hes after those screws snippet chase him away went the tiny poodle after the cheeky jackdaw barking in his high little voice thoroughly enjoying having so many children round him nosey flew up on to the top of the henhouse and flapped his wings chacking rude things in a very loud voice indeed dinner was rather a crowded meal for everyone was there greatgranddad frowned when he saw mr henning come in with junior junior strutted to his place at table giving george his best scowl however she was just as good at scowling as junior and mr henning who happened to catch sight of her giantsize scowl had quite a shock now now my boy he said to her why pull such an ugly face nobody told him that george was a girl mrs philpot was really very much amused she liked george and couldnt help thinking she would have made a very good boy indeed er mrs philpot would it be all right if i bring a friend to lunch here tomorrow asked mr henning hes called durleston mr durleston and hes a great authority on antiques hes going to give me some advice youll remember that you told me you had a quaint old hole in the wall in one of the bedrooms where in the old days people used to heat embers for warmingpans and bricks to put in between the bedsheets i thought i you thought you could buy em i suppose suddenly shouted old greatgranddad from his place at the head of the table he thumped on the cloth with the handle of his knife well you ask my permission first see this place is still mine im an old man im nearly ninety but ive still got all my wits about me i dont like this selling of things that have been in our family for donkeys years that i dont and now now granddad dont excite yourself said mrs philpot in her gentle voice surely its better to sell old things that we shall never use in order to buy a new set of tools or wood to mend the barns why can t we sell em to our own folks then shouted greatgranddad banging with his fork as well taking them out of the country part of our history they are selling our birthright thats what were doing for a mess of pottage thats out of the bible let me tell you mr henning in case you dont know shure i know said mr henning getting up and shouting back at greatgranddad im not as ignorant as you seem to think you ought to be glad that a poor rundown backdated country like britain has got anything to sell to a fine upstanding one like america you thats enough mr henning said mrs philpot with such dignity that mr henning blushed red and sat down in a great hurry sorry mam he said but that old man he gets under my skin sure he does whats gotten into him all i want is to buy things you want to sell you want new tractors i want old junk and im willing to pay for it thats all there is to it buying and selling old junk shouted greatgranddad again banging with his glass now do you call that great old cartwheel you bought old junk why thats more than two hundred years old my greatgranddad made it he told me so when i was a mite of a boy you wont find another wheel like it in england hoo that wheel was made before the first american was born i tell you now now granddad you know youll feel ill if you go on like this said mrs philpot and she got up and went to the old man who was shaking with fury you belong to old times and you dont like the new times and i dont blame you but things change you know calm yourself and come with me and have a liedown surprisingly the old fellow allowed mrs philpot to lead him out of the room the seven children had all sat silent while the shouting had been going on mr philpot looking worried broke his habitual silence and addressed a few words to the equally worriedlooking mr henning storm in a teacup he said soon blow over hmmmm said mr henning spoilt my dinner selfish ignorant rude old man hes not said one of the twins in a voice trembling with anger hes enough harry said his father in such a stern voice that harry subsided at once but began to grind his teeth to show that he was still angry making a most remarkable noise at the now silent table junior had sat as still as a mouse all the time scared of the angry old man timmy had given a few small growls and snippet had shot straight out of the kitchen as soon as greatgranddad had begun to shout mrs philpot came back and sat down looking sad and tired julian began to talk to her about janie and the macaroons and soon succeeded in making her smile she even laughed out loud when george told her that they had six macaroons to give bill for taking them out in the landrover i know those macaroons announced junior i buy about thirty a week theyre just wunnerful thirty no wonder youre so pastyfaced then said george before she could stop herself aw shucks pastyface yourself retorted junior feeling safe with his father near him he heard a sudden ominous growl under the table felt hot breath on his bare leg and decided to say no more he had forgotten all about the watchful timmy julian thought it was about time to have some bright conversation and began to tell mrs philpot about the henhouses and what a good job they were making of patching them to make them rainproof mr philpot listened too nodded and actually joined in yes youre good with your hands you boys i had a look when i came by fine work harriets good too said harry at once she did that corner where the rats get in didnt you harry i wanted to help pop but they shooed me off like i was a hen said junior in an aggrieved tone seems as if they dont want me around that makes it pretty lonely pop cant i come out with you this afternoon no said pop shortly aw cmon pop said junior in a whiny voice aw shucks pop lemme come no said pop exasperated timmy gave a growl again he didnt like cross voices he couldnt imagine why there was so much quarrelling here and sat up tense and still until george gave him a gentle push with her toe then he lay down again his head across her feet everyone was glad when the meal was over delicious though the food had been the girls and harriet insisted that mrs philpot should go and have a rest while they did all the clearingaway and washingup now try not to be unkind to junior this afternoon she said as she went hell be all alone when his fathers gone do let him be with you nobody answered they hadnt the least intention of allowing junior to be with them spoilt badmannered little idiot thought george clearing away with such vigour that she almost knocked anne over julian she said in a low voice catching him at the door as he went out anne and i have something interesting to tell you where will you be this afternoon up in the henhouses i expect said julian well watch out for you and anne see you in about half an hour junior had sharp ears he heard exactly what george had said and he was full of curiosity at once what was this interesting thing george wanted to tell the boys was it a secret all right hed be on hand somewhere to hear it and so when the girls had finished their work and set off to the henhouses junior followed discreetly behind he kept well out of sight until he saw george and anne disappear into a henhouse where the others were working and then he crept to a corner outside and put his ear to a knothole in the wood ill get my own back now he thought ill make them smart for leaving me out of things just see if i dont chapter eleven a most exciting talk the boys were busy hammering and sawing and the girls sat and waited till the noise died down snippet was there leaping about ridiculously with little bits of wood in his mouth and nosey the jackdaw had suddenly taken a fancy to the shavings that now covered the floor and ran about chacking and picking them up outside the hens clucked and squawked and not far off the ducks quacked loudly those are the kind of noises i like to hear said anne settling herself on a sack in a corner she raised her voice and shouted above the hammering to dick want any help dick no thanks said dick well just finish this job then sit down and have a rest and listen to what you have to say you sit and watch our wonderful carpentering honestly id make pounds a week if i took it up look out nosey has got your nails again shouted george timmy leapt up as if he was going to chase nosey and the jackdaw promptly flew up to a crossbeam and sat there chacking with laughter timmy thought him a very exasperating bird indeed he lay down again with a thump at last the boys had finished the job they were on and sat down rubbing their hands over their wet foreheads well now you can tell us your news said dick good thing we got rid of that little pest of a junior i might have hammered a few nails into him by mistake if hed come worrying us this afternoon he imitated juniors whining drawl aw shucks pop lemme come with yew outside his ear to the hole junior clenched his fists he would willingly have stuck a few nails into dick at that moment george and anne began to tell the four listening children what old mr finniston had told them that morning its about finniston castle said anne the old castle that gave the village its name and the farm as well the old fellow who told us about it is called finniston too and will you believe it hes a descendant of the finnistons who lived in the castle centuries ago he seems to have spent most of his life trying to discover everything possible about the old castle said george he said hed delved into old libraries and into the church records here anywhere that might help him to piece together the castles history outside the henhouse junior held his breath so as not to miss a single word why his pop had told him that he couldnt get anything out of that old mr finniston at the antique shop not a word about the castle and its history or even where the site was then why had he told anne and that horrible boy george junior felt angry and listened even more keenly the story goes that in the twelfth century enemies came to attack the castle one night and there were traitors already inside it who set it on fire so that the castlefolk would be busy trying to put out the fire and wouldnt be prepared for a fight said george the inside of it was burnt right down to the ground and then the great stone walls outside collapsed inwards and lay in enormous heaps there covering the place where the castle had stood whew said dick visualizing it all what a night that must have been everybody killed or burnt i suppose no the lady of the castle wasnt killed and it is said that she took her children to the little chapel near the farmhouse we really must go and see that twins and they stayed there in safety anyway some of the family must have escaped because it is one of their descendants who keeps that little antique shop old mr finniston this is tremendously interesting said julian wheres the site of the castle it should easily be known because of the great mass of stones that fell there when the walls collapsed no theyre not there now said george mr finniston said he thought that when the wind and weather had broken them up small enough to be lugged away by the farmers and peasants living near by they were taken to build field walls or to line wells he said there were some on this farm he didnt know himself where the castle once stood because the site would be all grown over and with no stones left to mark it it wouldnt be easy to find but oh julian i wish we could find it cried anne her voice rising in excitement because so mr finniston says the cellars and dungeons are probably still there quite untouched you see no one could uncover them for years because of the heavy stones there and when the stones were taken away people had forgotten about the castle and the dungeons gosh so they may still be there with whatever was stored in them hundreds of years ago said dick thrilled my word there might be priceless things there as old as the hills i mean even an old broken sword would be worth its weight in gold because it would be so very very old i say dont say a word of all this in front of that american or hed dig up the whole farm we shouldnt dream of it said george he shant get to hear a word of this alas george little knew that every single word had been overheard by junior whose left ear was still pinned to the knothole in the wood his face was red with surprise and delight what a secret whatever would his pop say dungeons perhaps full of gold and jewels and all kinds of things he rubbed his hands together in delight thinking that he would soon get even with these annoying children now as soon as his pop came home hed spill everything to him gee timmy heard the small sound of junior rubbing his hands together and sat up growling his ears pricked snippet growled too a miniature little sound that nobody took seriously timmy then heard junior creeping away afraid because he had heard the big dog growling timmy growled again and then barked sharply running to the shut door of the henhouse scraping at it with his foot somebodys outside quick if its junior ill throw him on to the muckheap yelled dick and flung open the door they all trooped out and looked round but there was nobody there junior had shot off at top speed and was now safely behind the nearest hedge what was it tim said george she turned to the others he may have heard those hens scratching near the door she said theres no one about gosh i was so afraid that it was that little sneak of a junior hed tell his pop every single thing twins listen mr finniston told us that one of the things that was saved from the castle or found afterwards perhaps was a great old oak door ironstudded said anne suddenly remembering is that one of your kitchen doors yes that must be the door leading into the dark little passage said harry you wouldnt have noticed it particularly because its usually kept open and its very dark just there gosh i suppose it could have come from the castle its enormously thick and strong i wonder if dad knows well tell him said harriet i say shall we go and look for the site of the castle sometime if only we could find it do you suppose that if we found the cellars and dungeons full of chests and things theyd belong to us the farm belongs to our family of course and all the land round does it well then of course anything found on this land would be yours said julian we might be able to buy a new tractor said the twins both together in the same excited voice lets go and look for the castlesite now said george her voice sounding so excited that timmy sat up and barked no we must finish this job said julian we promised we would theres plenty of time to hunt around because nobody knows about this except us julian was wrong of course junior knew and junior meant to tell the whole secret to his father as soon as ever he could he could hardly wait for him to come home well wed better be getting back to the house said george we told mrs philpot wed pick some raspberries for supper tonight so wed better fetch baskets and begin oh i do hope we find that castlesite i shall dream about it tonight i know i shall well try and dream where it is said julian with a laugh then you can lead us straight to it tomorrow morning i suppose you havent any idea where it might be have you twins no they said together frowning no idea at all and harriet added you see the farms so big and i suppose it might have been built anywhere on our land yes but probably near the top of a hill said julian castles used to overlook surrounding land you know so that approaching enemies could easily be seen and then again george said mr finniston told them that the lady of the castle escaped with her children and took them in safety to the chapel which wouldnt be very far away i should guess that the castlesite must be not further than a quarter of a mile from the chapel so that narrows the search down a bit by the way we really must look at that chapel it sounds interesting even though it has been used as a storehouse for years the girls picked raspberries for the rest of the afternoon and the boys finished their jobs they went back to the farmhouse for tea feeling pleasantly tired the girls were already there laying the table they pounced on the twins and george spoke excitedly twins weve been looking at the old studded door its magnificent come and see it julian and dick if it isnt from the old castle ill eat my hat and my shoes as well she took them to the great door that opened from the kitchen into the passage that led to the yard with much difficulty she swung it shut they all gazed at it it had been almost too heavy for george to move it was very stout and strong made of old old oak great iron studs had been driven into it so deeply and firmly that only by destroying the door itself could they ever be removed there was a curious iron handle in the middle of the outer side and george raised it and brought it down smartly a loud bang resounded through the kitchen and made the others jump the knocker that visitors used when they came to the castle i suppose said george laughing at their surprised faces noise enough to rouse everyone and alert any guard at once do you suppose it was the front door of the castle its big enough it must be worth hundreds of pounds look out theres junior said anne in a low voice hes grinning all over his face what do you suppose hes been up to i wish i knew chapter twelve really very thrilling ar teatime julian spoke to mrs philpot about the old kitchen door thats a fine old door he said did it come from the castle do you suppose yes so its said answered mrs philpot greatgranddad here knows more about it than i do though greatgranddad was not at the table he was sitting in his enormous old chair in the window with snippet at his feet he was pulling contentedly at his pipe a cup of tea on the windowsill beside him whats that called the old man speak up julian repeated what mrs philpot had said and the old fellow nodded oh ay that doors from the castle all right made of the same oak as the beams in the barns and the floors of the bedrooms above ay and that american fellows been at me about it too ho offered me fifty pounds for it fifty pounds i wouldnt take a thousand what have that old door hanging in some newfangled house out in that american country wherever it is no i say no and ill say it till im blue in the face all right granddad dont upset yourself said mrs philpot she spoke to julian in a low voice change the subject quickly or granddad will go on and on poor old fellow julian racked his brain for a change of subject and fortunately remembered the henhouses he at once began to tell greatgranddad all they had done that afternoon and the old fellow calmed down at once and listened with pleasure snippet who had run in fright to the twins as soon as greatgranddad had begun to shout ran back to him and settled on his feet timmy also decided to join them and soon greatgranddad was completely happy again drawing on his old pipe with one dog at his feet the other resting a great head on his knee timmy certainly did love greatgranddad mr henning did not come back that night much to everyones relief but arrived next day just before lunch bringing with him a driedup little fellow wearing thick glasses whom he introduced as mr richard durleston the great mr durleston he said proudly knows more about old houses in england than anyone else in the country id like him to see that old door after lunch mrs philpot and that queer opening in the wall of the bedroom upstairs which was used to heat embers and bricks for warming beds years ago fortunately greatgranddad was not there to object and after they had had dinner mrs philpot took mr durleston to the old studded door ah yes he said quite genuine very fine specimen i should offer two hundred pounds mr henning how mrs philpot longed to accept such an offer what a difference it would make to her housekeeping she shook her head youd have to talk to old greatgranddad she said but im afraid hell say no now ill take you to see the queer old opening up in one of the bedrooms she took mr henning and mr durleston upstairs and the four followed with timmy it was indeed a strange opening in the wall it had a wroughtiron door rather like an old oven door mrs philpot opened it inside was a big cavity which had obviously been used as a kind of oven to heat bricks for placing into cold beds some of the old bricks were actually still there blackened with longago heating mrs philpot took out what looked like a heavy iron tray with an ornamented raised edge on it were old old embers this tray was used for heating and holding the embers before they were put into warmingpans she said we still have one old warmingpan left there on the wall look the four just as interested as the two men looked at the copper warmingpan glowing redgold on the wall the redhot embers were emptied into that mrs philpot told the children and then the pan was carried by its long handle into all the bedrooms and thrust into each bed for a few minutes to warm it and that funny little opening in the wall is as i said where people years and years ago heated the embers and the bricks too which were wrapped in flannel and left in each bed hmmmmm very interesting quite rare to see one in such a wellpreserved state said mr durleston peering into the opening through thick glasses you could make an offer for this too mr henning interesting old place well have a look at the barns too i think and the outbuildings might be a few things there you could pick up with advantage george thought it was a good thing the twins were not with them to hear all this they seemed to share with their greatgranddad a hatred of parting with any of the treasures belonging to the old farmhouse mrs philpot took the two men downstairs again and the four followed ill just take mr durleston to the old chapel mam said mr henning and mrs philpot nodded she left them and hurried back into the kitchen where she had a cake baking the four looked at one another and julian nodded his head towards the two men now making their way out of doors shall we go too he said we havent seen this chapel yet either so they followed the two men and soon came to a tall quaint old building with small and beautiful arched windows set high up in the walls they went in at the door a few paces behind the two men and stared in wonder yes you can see it was once a chapel said julian speaking instinctively in a low voice those lovely old windows that arch there and the feel of it said anne i know now what old mr finniston down at that little shop meant when he said that though it was now a storehouse it was still full of prayer you can feel that people have been here to pray cant you what a lovely little chapel oh i do wish it wasnt used as a storehouse i was told by an old fellow down in the village antique shop that a lady phillippa who was once the lady of the castle brought each of her fifteen children here to learn their prayers said mr durleston surprisingly hmm hmm nice old story probably true chapels were often built near to castles wonder which path they took from the castle to the chapel all gone now no castle nothing hmm hmm id like to buy this chapel knock it down and take it stone by stone to my place in the states said the american enthusiastically fine specimen isnt it it would look wunnerful in my place cant advise that said mr durleston shaking his head not in good taste lets go to those outbuildings yonder might see something in the old junk there they went off and the children stayed behind entranced with the little chapel sacks upon sacks of grain and what looked like fertilizer were arranged in rows all over the floor a cat had three kittens cuddled together on one sack and a dove cooed somewhere high up in the arched roof it was a very peaceful sound somehow just right for the silent little place the children trooped out quietly not feeling inclined to follow the brash mr henning round any more at least the other man stopped him from his mad idea of removing the chapel stone by stone said anne i couldnt bear that beautiful old place to be torn up by its roots and replanted somewhere else you sound quite angry anne almost as fierce as old greatgranddad said julian slipping his arm through his sisters i dont somehow think the old chapel will be sold to mr henning even if he offered a million dollars for it well i like most americans very much said anne but not mr henning he he wants to buy history just as if it were chocolate or toffee that made the others laugh i say said julian what about having a snoop round now were out and just see if we can decide where to hunt for the site of the castle i presume we all agree that it cant be very far away from the chapel yes thats agreed said dick and its also agreed that the site is probably on a hill the snag is that there are rather a lot of hills on this undulating farmland lets make our way over there up the nearest slope said george hallo here are the twins well call them they might like to come the twins soon joined them and said yes they would certainly like to hunt for the castlesite but it might take years said harry it might be anywhere on the farm well we plan to examine this first slope said julian heel tim heel snippet oh gosh heres nosey the jackdaw too not on my shoulder if you dont mind nosey i rather value my ears chack said the jackdaw and flew to the twins they made their way up the slope there was however absolutely nothing to be seen except grass grass grass they came to a big mound and stood looking at it a very large mole must have made that said dick which made them all laugh for the mound was as high as their shoulders rabbitholes could be seen at the bottom though it was probable that very few burrowed there now the great rabbitdisease myxomatosis had wiped them practically out of existence on finniston farm timmy couldnt see a rabbithole without scraping at it and soon he and snippet were scattering earth over everyone snippet was small enough to disappear into one hole and came out carrying of all things an oyster shell julian took it out of his mouth in amazement look here an oyster shell and were miles from the sea how did it get there go in again snippet scrape hard timmy buck up an idea is glimmering in my brain before long what with timmys excited scraping and snippets explorations deep into the burrow quite a collection of oyster shells and small and large bones lay on the grass bones said anne not bones of people surely dont tell me this is a mound covering an old grave or something ju no but it is something rather exciting said julian im pretty sure its an old kitchenmidden a kitchenmidden what on earths that said george oh look timmys got another mouthful of oyster shells a kitchenmidden is what you might call the rubbishheap of the old days explained julian picking up some oyster shells it was often very big when it comprised the rubbish thrown out from large houses or castles things like bones and shells wouldnt rot away like other rubbish and i do believe weve found the kitchenmidden of the old castle my word what a find now we know something very important what asked everyone in excitement well we know now that the site of the castle must be somewhere on this slope said julian the kitchenmidden was probably not far from its walls were on the scent scouts were on the scent come on lets go further on spread out examine every inch of the ground chapter thirteen junior springs a surprise the six children felt a sudden upsurge of excitement and timmy felt it too and barked loudly snippet joined in and the jackdaw danced up and down on harrys shoulder chacking hoarsely junior who had seen them start out and was tracking them stared in surprise from behind a bush in a nearby hedge now what was all the excitement about what had timmy and snippet found he saw the six children spread out and begin to go slowly up the great slope of the hill timmy followed them rather puzzled he wished he knew what they were looking for then he could hunt too junior kept safely behind the bush he knew that if he followed too closely after the children timmy would hear him and bark suddenly the harries gave a shout hey the others looked up from their search and saw them beckoning in excitement what about this come and look everyone hurried over to the twins who were standing on a little ridge about two hundred yards below the top of the gently sloping hill look said harry sweeping his arm in a circle would this be a likely place for the castlesite the four looked at the great shallow depression that the twins pointed to in shape it was like a very shallow soupplate certainly big enough for a castle to have been built there it was covered with thick closelygrowing grass which was a little darker in colour than the grass around julian clapped harry on the shoulder yes i bet this is where the castle once stood why should the ground here suddenly have this great depression in it as if it had sunk down for some reason the only reason could be that some enormously heavy building once stood here and it must have been the castle its not too far from the kitchenmidden where they threw their rubbish is it asked anne anxiously looking back to see how far away that was no just about right said julian they would be sure to have it some distance away because it would smell especially in the hot weather yes twins i think you really have hit on the castlesite and i bet if we had the machinery to excavate here wed come across dungeons cellars underground passages and all they contain the twins went red with excitement and stared solemnly at the great basinlike circle green with grass what will our mother say they said both together plenty said dick this might be the saving of your farm but look lets not say a word about it yet in case it gets round to mr henning lets get bill and ask him if hell lend us spades and things well tell him weve found some interesting old shells and bones on the hill and want to do a little digging well soon know if this really is the site of the castle good idea said julian excited at the thought of being one of the first to dig down into the old dungeons lets pace round this old site and see how big it is they walked round and round it and decided it was more than big enough for even a large castle they thought it was strange that the grass should be a different colour there but it does sometimes happen that grass marks out where old buildings once stood said julian i say this is just about the most exciting thing that ever happened to us and im so glad it was the twins who first recognized the site after all its on their farm isnt that junior running over there said george suddenly as she saw timmy prick up his ears and turn his nose to the wind yes it is hes been spying on us the little beast there he goes look well he cant know much said julian gazing after the running figure i dont expect he even knows that a castle was once built here at the top of this hill and he certainly wouldnt know we were looking for the site hes just snooping thats all but junior did know all about the old castle for he had overheard the children talking in the henhouse and he did know what they had been looking for he had followed them as closely as he dared listening to their shouts and now he felt that he must get back to his father and tell him what he knew he found his father still with mr durleston examining an old fireplace now thats worth buying mr durleston was saying you could rip that out and use it in your own house a beautiful thing very old and pop i say pop listen cried junior bursting in mr durleston looked annoyed that boy again but junior took no notice of the old mans annoyance and pulled urgently at his fathers arm dad i know where the place is that the castle once stood on and theres dungeons and cellars underneath full of treasure i know there are pop those kids found the place but they dont know i saw them what is all this junior said his father halfannoyed too silly talk you dont know anything about castlesites and dungeons and the rest i do i do i heard them all talking in the henhouse i told you i did cried junior tugging at his fathers sleeve againpop theyve found an old rubbishheap too that belonged to the castle they called it a a let me see now a a midden asked mr durleston suddenly taking an interest yes thats it a kitchenmidden said junior triumphantly with bones and shells and then they looked for where the old castle might have been built they said it couldnt have been far away and well they were right said mr durleston a kitchenmidden would certainly pinpoint the castle area mr henning this is extremely interesting if you could get permission to excavate it would be a oh boy said mr henning interrupting his eyes almost starting out of his head cant you see the papers american discovers old castlesite unknown for centuries excavates dungeons find bones of longago prisoners chests of gold coins not so fast not so fast said mr durleston disapprovingly there may be nothing at all there let us not count our chickens before theyre hatched and mind not a word to the newspapers henning we dont want a crowd of people rushing to pry over the farm sending up its price i didnt think of that said mr henning a little castdown all right well go carefully what do you advise i should advise you to approach mr philpot not the old greatgranddad but the farmer himself and offer to put down say ј for the right to excavate up on the hill there said mr durleston then if you strike anything interesting you can offer a further sum for whatevers down there say another ј if there is anything there it will be extremely valuable so very very old hmmm hmmm yes that is my advice to you and it sounds pretty good to me said mr henning excitement flooding him again youll stay here and advise me wont you durleston certainly certainly if you are prepared to pay my fee said mr durleston i think it would perhaps be advisable if i approached mr philpot mr henning not you you might er well give something away in your excitement you will come with me of course but let me do the talking right old man you do everything said mr henning feeling friendly with the whole world he clapped the listening junior on the back well done son you may have let us into something good now dont you breathe a word to anyone see aw shucks said junior what do you think i am my mouths sewn up from now on think id split pop when theres a chance of getting even with those snooty kids you go on up that hill when theyve gone and have a look yourself mr durleston will know if its the real thing or not so when the six children and dogs were safely out of sight gone to help with various jobs of work on the farm mr henning and mr durleston went with junior to see the kitchenmidden and the supposed site of the old castle mr henning became very excited indeed and even the wearylooking mr durleston brightened up and nodded his head several times looks the real thing he said yes well get going this evening after that fierce old fellow the old greatgranddad has gone to bed he might put a spoke in our wheels hes as old as the hills but as cute as a jackdaw and so that evening when greatgranddad was safely in bed mr henning and mr durleston had a private very private talk with mr and mrs philpot together the farmer and his wife listened amazed when they heard that mr henning proposed to hand them a cheque for ј merely for the right to do a little digging mrs philpot almost cried and i have advised mr henning that he should offer you further sums if he finds anything he would like to take back to the states with him as er as mementos of a very pleasant stay here finished mr durleston it sounds too good to to be true said mrs philpot we could certainly do with the money couldnt we trevor mr henning took out his cheque book and produced his fountainpen before mr philpot could say anything else he wrote out the sum of ј and signed the cheque with a flourish he then presented it to mr philpot and i hope therell be more cheques to come he said thank you sir ill get men along tomorrow to start digging ill have a formal agreement drawn up put in mr durleston thinking that he saw a rather doubtful look coming over mr philpots face as he took the cheque but you can cash the cheque straight away well well leave you to talk over it when the twins and the four heard of this the next morning they were astounded mrs philpot told the twins first and harry and harriet ran at once to find the others they listened amazed and angry how did they know all that how did they guess where to find the castlesite said dick fiercely i bet its that snoopy little junior who put them on to this i bet he spied on us i thought i saw two people up on that hill after tea yesterday it must have been mr henning and that friend of his with junior gosh i could pull that kids hair out well i suppose theres absolutely nothing we can do now said george angrily the next thing well see is lorries rolling up with men inside and spades and drills and goodness knows what she was quite right that very morning the hill became quite a busy place four men had already been hired by mr henning and they all went up the hill in their lorry bumping slowly along past the kitchenmidden mound and on up to the shallow basinlike depression near the summit of the hill spades forks and drills rattled in the lorry junior was mad with joy and danced about at a safe distance yelling defiance at the six children you thought i didnt know anything didnt you i heard everything serves you right yah timmy chase him ordered george in a furious voice but dont hurt him mind go on and off went timmy at a gallop and if junior hadnt leapt into the lorry and picked up a spade timmy would certainly have rolled him over and over on the ground now what was to be done the children almost gave up but not quite there might be something they could do there might why was julian suddenly looking so excited chapter fourteen snippet and nosey are very helpful listen said julian lowering his voice and looking all about to make sure that no one was near do you remember what you told us george about a secret passage from the castle to the old chapel yes yes i do said george and anne nodded her eyes bright you mean the story that old mr finniston told us down at the little antique shop about the lady of the castle taking her children in safety from the burning castle by way of an underground passage to the old chapel gosh id forgotten that oh julian yes george is right said anne are you thinking that the passage might still be there hidden underground what i think is this said julian if the lady and her children escaped underground they must first have fled down into the cellars of the castle and so the passage or tunnel must have started from there they couldnt have escaped in any other way because the castle was itself surrounded by enemies so she must have gone with her children to hide in the cellars and then when the castle fell she took them safely down the secret passage that led to the old chapel so that means that means that if we can find the secret passage we can get into the cellars ourselves perhaps before the workmen do cried george almost shouting with excitement exactly said julian his eyes shining now dont lets lose our heads and get too excited lets talk about it quietly and for goodness sake keep a watch for junior timmy on guard said george and timmy at once went some paces away and stood up straight looking now in this direction and now in that nobody could come within sight now without timmy giving a warning bark the children settled down beside a hedge whats the plan asked dick i vote we go to the old chapel take a line from there to the castlesite and walk slowly up that line said julian we might possibly see something that would guide us as to where the secret passage is i dont know what maybe the grass might be slightly different in colour a bit darker than the surrounding grass just as it was on the castlesite anyway its worth trying if we do see a line of darker grass or something like that well dig down underground ourselves hoping the secret passage is underneath oh ju what a wonderful idea said anne come on lets go down to the chapel straight away so off they all went timmy snippet and nosey the jackdaw too he loved being with snippet though he teased him unmercifully they arrived quickly at the chapel door and went in i always feel as if there ought to be an organ playing when im inside said anne looking round the stacked sacks of grain never mind about organs said julian standing at the open door and pointing up the hill now see theres the place where the old castle stood where the men are already at work and if we take a fairly straight line to it we should be more or less walking over the old passage i should think the men who made it would drive as straight a tunnel as they could to save themselves work a grinding one would take a long time i cant see that the grass is any different in colour along the line im looking said dick squinting and everyone agreed very disappointed so theres nothing to help us said george mournfully all we can do is to walk in a straight line up the hill and hope to find something that will tell us if were over a tunnel hollowsounding footsteps perhaps thats very doubtful im afraid said julian still i cant see that we can do anything else come on then all right tim you can come back to us look at nosey on snippets back again thats right snippet roll over and get him off chack said nosey crossly as he flew up in the air chack the six children walked up the slope in as straight a line as they could they came right up to where the men were digging without having seen or heard anything of any help at all it was most disappomting junior saw them and yelled loudly children not allowed here keep off my dads bought this place fibber shouted back the two harries at once youve got the right to dig and thats all yah yelled junior you wait now dont you set that great dog on me again ill tell my pop see timmy barked loudly and junior disappeared in a hurry george laughed silly little fathead why doesnt somebody box his ears i bet one of the men will before hes many hours older look at him trying to use that drill junior was certainly not at all popular he made himself a great nuisance and in the end his father put him roughly into a lorry and told him to stay there he howled dismally but as no one paid any attention he soon stopped the six children went slowly back down the gentle slope of the hill taking a slightly different line still hopeful the jackdaw flew down to harrys shoulder chacking loudly bored with all this walking he suddenly saw snippet sitting down to scratch his neck and at once launched himself at him he knew that the poodle always shut his eyes when he scratched himself and that that was a very good time to give him a wellplaced peck but unfortunately for nosey the poodle opened his eyes too soon and saw the jackdaw just about to perch on him he snapped at him and got him by the wing chackchackchack cried the jackdaw urgently calling for help chack harry ran to snippet shouting drop him snippet drop him youll break his wing before he could reach the pair the jackdaw managed to free himself by giving snippet a sudden peck on his nose which made him bark in pain as soon as he opened his mouth to bark the jackdaw dropped on the ground and scuttled away his wing drooping unable to fly the poodle was after him in a second the twins yelled in vain he meant to catch that exasperating jackdaw if it was the last thing he did the squawking bird looked anxiously for a hidingplace and saw one a rabbithole just the thing to hop down in a trice in he went with another loud squawk and disappeared from sight hes gone down that rabbithole said dick with a shout of laughter clever old bird youre outwitted snippet but no snippet wasnt he disappeared down the hole too he was as small as a rabbit and could easily run down a burrow he had never done more than sniff at one before being rather scared of dark tunnels but if nosey had gone down well he would too the children stared in surprise first the jackdaw now snippet the twins bent down by the hole and yelled come back snippet you idiot the hills honeycombed with old warrens youll get lost for ever come back snippet snipsnipsnippet can you hear us come here there was silence down the rabbithole no chack no bark they must have gone deep down said harry anxiously theres a perfect maze of burrows in this hill dad said there used to be thousands of rabbits here at one time hey snippet come here well wed better sit down till they come back said anne feeling suddenly tired with excitement and with climbing up hill and down right said julian anyone got any sweets i have said george as usual and took out a rather grimy packet of peppermints here you are have one twins thanks they said we really ought to be getting back weve plenty of work to do they sat sucking their peppermints wondering what in the world the jackdaw and snippet were up to at last timmy pricked up his ears and gave a small bark looking at the entrance of the burrow as he did so theyre coming said george timmy knows sure enough timmy was right out came first snippet and then nosey apparently quite good friends again snippet rushed to the twins and flung himself on them as if he hadnt seen them for days he put something down at their feet whats this youve found said harry picking it up some dirty old bone julian suddenly took it from him almost snatching it bone no thats not a bone its a small carved dagger with a broken handle old as the hills snippet where did you find it the jackdaws got something too cried anne pointing to him look in his beak harriet caught the jackdaw easily for he still could not fly its a ring she said with a red stone in it look all six children gazed at the two strange articles an old carved knife black with age and an old ring with a stone still set in it they could have come from only one place george said what everyone was thinking snippet and the jackdaw have been to the cellars of the castle they must have that burrow must have led straight into the tunnel that goes to the dungeons and the cellars and theyve been there oh snippet you clever clever dog youve told us just what we want to know george is right said dick jubilantly we know quite a lot of things now because of snippet and nosey we know there must be plenty of things still in those castle cellars and we know that somewhere near the end of this burrow is the secret passage because thats the only way they could have got into the cellars by using the passage the burrow led into the passage dont you agree julian rather said julian flushed with excitement my word this is a bit of good luck hurrah for snippet and nosey look the jackdaws trying to fly his wing isnt badly hurt just bruised i expect good old nosey little did he know what his bit of mischief would lead to what happens now said george her eyes shining do we dig too now that we know where the passage is it cant be very far and once weve got down to it we can easily get into the cellars before that american does what an excitement timmy really thought everyone had gone completely mad chapter fifteen digging for the secret tunnel how can we get permission to dig asked anne i mean will we be allowed to i dont see why not mr henning has only been given permission to dig in one place said julian i bet wed get permission to dig just here its a pretty good way from the castlesite anyway why shouldnt we just dig and see if anyone stops us said george if mr philpot stops us we could tell him what were really doing hed probably let us then but whatever happens we dont want mr henning to know what weve discovered or think weve discovered well what shall we say then if he asks why were digging said anne say silly things joke about it said dick twins have you work to do this morning can you find us spades do you think yes you can have our spades and dads old ones too said harry we wish we could help but weve tons to do and were late already oh dear and i promised that george and i woulcl help in the kitchen said anne and pick peas for dinner and pod them and get more raspberries can you and dick dig all on your own ju good heavens yes said julian itll be slower with just two of us digging but well soon get deep down youll see anyway we could all take turns this afternoon perhaps if the twins finish their work we will well do it at top speed said harry and harriet together now well get some spades for you they raced off with snippet beside them and the two girls went down the hill more slowly feeling very thrilled if only only they could dig down and find the secret passage from the chapel to the cellars of the old castle timmy felt the excitement and wagged his tail happily he was always happy when george was thrilled about anything harriet soon brought two big spades and two smaller ones to the boys they were heavy and she panted as she carried them up the hill good girl or is it good boy asked dick as he took the spades wait its harriet isnt it youve no scar on your hand harriet grinned and ran off swiftly to join her brother in the farmwork that was their task julian gazed after her theyre good kids he said as he turned to drive his spade into the earth worth a hundred juniors funny how some children are made of such good stuff and others arent worth a penny well dick go to it this earth is pretty hard i wish we could borrow one of those machines the men are using up there they dug hard and were soon very hot indeed they stripped themselves to their shorts but were still far too hot they greeted anne with joy when she laboured up the slope carrying a jug of cool lemonade and some buns i say youve made quite a hole already she said how far down do you think the tunnel will be well not too far down really said dick taking a long drink of the lemonade this is super anne thanks awfully weve dug into the burrow and were following it at the moment hoping it will enter the secret tunnel before were too tired to dig any more i say here comes junior said anne suddenly looking up the slope sure enough it was the american boy feeling quite brave now that neither timmy nor snippet were about he stopped a little way away and shouted what do you think youre doing digging in our hill go away and lose yourself shouted back dick this isnt your hill if you can dig so can we copycats shouted junior my pops laughing his head off about you well tell him to pick it up before it rolls down the hill yelled dick clear off junior watched them for a little while puzzled and then went off up the hill presumably to report to his father anne laughed and went back to the farmhouse as his pop doesnt know a thing about the secret passage he must think were off our heads digging here said julian with a chuckle well let him think so hell be off his head with rage when he finds out what were really doing and he wont know that till were in the cellars dick laughed and wiped his forehead again i wish this burrow would come to an end and i hope to goodness it does lead into the side of the tunnel i dont want to have to dig up half the hillside the grounds so hard and dry well thank goodness its getting sandy here said julian driving his spade deeper down he suddenly gave a cry i say my spade went right down by itself then i believe ive come to the secret passage the burrow must go right through one side of it he was right the rabbithole ran sideways and down and into a passage the boys dug feverishly now panting their hair falling over their foreheads perspiration dripping off their faces soon they had a deep hole fairly wide and at the bottom of it a way into the tunnel beneath they lay down and peered into it its only about four feet below the surface said dick we might have had to do much more digging than this whew im hot it must be dinnertime said julian i dont really like to leave our hole now that weve got down to the tunnel and yet we simply must have something to eat im ravenous so am i but if we leave the hole unguarded that pest of a junior might come along and climb down and find the passage said dick look here comes george with old tim i wonder if shed leave him here to guard the hole george was delighted to hear their news she gazed down the hole in great excitement how deeply youve dug she said no wonder youre hot my word if mr benning knew what youve found hed be down here in two shakes of a ducks tail he certainly would said julian soberly thats what were afraid of or that snoopy junior might climb down into the hole if he came along hes been here already to see what were doing were scared of going in to dinner in case one of them comes along and investigates the hole while its unguarded said dick and we wondered if but george interrupted him almost as if she knew what he was going to say ill leave timmy here on guard while you come down to dinner she said he wont let anyone come within yards of it thanks old thing said the boys gratefully and went off down the hill with george leaving timmy behind on guard timmy said george on guard dont let anyone come near that hole woof said timmy understanding at once and looking fiercely all round and about him he lay down with a small growl let anyone come near the boys hole if they dare they did dare but when they saw timmy leaping to his feet the hackles on his neck thick and upright and heard his deep continuous growl junior and his father thought better of it and went on down the hill to have dinner at the farmhouse poor mr durleston trailed behind them almost knocked out by the heat of the sun silly kids said mr henning to junior thinking its clever to dig just because were digging what do they suppose theyll find down there another kitchenmidden junior sent a stone scudding along towards timmy and then fled for his life as the dog came bounding angrily down the slope even mr henning hurried he didnt like timmy either that afternoon the twins julian dick george anne and snippet all climbed the hill to the hole where tim still lay watching for intruders they brought him two fine bones and a jug of water he was very pleased indeed snippet danced round hoping for a bite at a bone and the jackdaw his wing apparently quite recovered now dared to go and peck at the bigger bone even though timmy growled warningly the twins were thrilled to see the deep hole cant we go down now they said eagerly both together yes it would be a jolly good time to let ourselves slide into the tunnel said julian all the men working on the castlesite have gone off to have dinner at the little village pub and havent yet come back and the hennings and mr durleston are safely at the farmhouse ill go first said dick and lowered himself into the hole he held on to the grassy edges and poked hard with his feet to widen the opening into the tunnel then he let himself slide down until his legs were out of the rabbit hole and dangled through the wall of the tunnel here we go he said and let himself drop whoooooosh he slid right into a dark musty tunnel and landed on soft earth chuck me down a torch he shouted its pitchdark in here did you remember to bring our torches george yes george had four look out she said here comes one and she dropped it down the hole she had already switched it on so dick saw it coming and caught it neatly he shone it into the dark place around him yes it is a tunnel he shouted the secret passage no doubt about it i say isnt this great come on down all of you lets share in the find together lets walk right up to the castle cellars come on everybody come on chapter sixteen up the tunnel and into the cellars dick held up his torch to the hole so that the others might see their way one by one they slid into the dark tunnel too excited for words timmy came too and so did snippet but the jackdaw thought better of it and remained at the enlarged opening of the burrow chacking loudly the children swung their torches to and fro that must be the way down to the old chapel said julian his torch shining down the dark tunnel no one could stand upright just there except timmy for the roof was low he sniffed suspiciously here and there and kept close to george well come on said julian his voice shaking a little with excitement well go straight up and see where the passage ends my word i can hardly wait to see whats at the top they made their way slowly up the passage there had been rooffalls here and there but not enough to matter treeroots withered and twining sometimes caught their feet funny said harry in astonishment there arent any trees growing on the hillside here why the roots then they may be the remains of the roots of longago trees that did once grow on the hill said julian shining his torch up the passage hoping against hope that there would be no serious obstacle to their journey hallo whats this at my feet two feathers now how in the world did they get here it was a puzzle the children examined them earnestly by the light of their torches feathers looking quite new too how did they get there was there any other way into the passage and had the birds found it dick gave a shout of laughter that made everyone jump were idiots theyre two of the jackdales feathers they must have dropped out of his bitten wing when he went down the burrow and up this passage with snippet after him of course why on earth didnt i think of that said julian they went on upwards once more and then julian suddenly stopped again a curious humming noise had come down the dark low tunnel a throbbing that seemed to get right inside their heads whats that said anne in great alarm i dont like it they all stood there and felt like anne that the noise was indeed inside their heads they shook them put their fingers into their ears but it was no good the strange throbbing went on and on this is a bit too mysterious for me said anne scared i dont think i want to go on the noise stopped and they all felt better at once but almost immediately it started again to everyones surprise george began to laugh its all right its only those men at work on the castlesite its their drills we can hear throbbing through the hillside and down this passage right into our ears they must be back from lunch cheer up everybody they all smiled in relief though annes hands were still shaking a little as she held up her torch to shine through the black darkness theres not an awful lot of air here she said i hope we soon get into the cellars they cant be far said julian this tunnel goes in a pretty straight line just as we thought it would where it curves its probable that the longago men who made it were forced to burrow round treeroots that blocked their way anyway as we can hear the drills so loudly now we cant be far from the castlesite they were nearer than they thought julians torch suddenly shone on the remains of a great door lying on the ground before him the door that once shut off the cellars from the passage the tunnel ceased just there and the torches shone on a vast underground place silent full of shadows were there said julian in a whisper that went scurrying round in the darkness and came back as a strange echo that said theretheretheretherethere that fallen door must have been the one made all those years gone by said anne in awe she touched a corner of it with her foot and the wood crumpled into dust with a queer little sigh snippet pushed in front of them and ran into the cellars he gave a short bark as if to say come on dont be afraid ive been here before oh snippet be careful said anne half afraid that everything would crumble away at the sound of snippets pattering feet lets go on but carefully said julian everything will be ready to crumble into dust unless its made of metal its a marvel that door was preserved like that it looks good enough but im sure if any of us sneezed it would be gone dont make me laugh please ju said dick stepping carefully round the fallen door even a laugh might do damage down here soon they were all in the blackness of the underground cellars they flashed their torches around what a vast place said julian cant see any dungeons though thank goodness said harriet and anne together they had both dreaded coming across old bones of longforgotten prisoners look theres an archway said george shining her torch to the right a fine semicircular arch it is too made of stone and theres another look they must lead into a main underground chamber i should think theres nothing much to see just here except heaps of dirt it all smells so musty too well follow me carefully said julian and led the way towards the stone archways his torch shining brightly they came to one of the beautiful rounded arches and stood there all four torches shining brightly into a large underground room no cellars here but just one great underground storeroom said julian the roof was shored up with great beams see some of them have fallen and those stone arches must have borne much of the weight too not one of those has fallen they must have stood there for centuries what wonderful workmanship dick and the twins were more interested in the great mass of jumble scattered about round the walls it was covered with dust that rose lightly into the air when timmy brushed against anything snippet ran round happily sniffing everywhere and sneezing every now and again as the fine dust went up his nose any treasures do you think whispered anne and the echo came back weirdly whispering too whispers seem to echo back more than our ordinary voices said julian hallo whats this they shone their torches on to the floor where lay what looked like a heap of blackened metal julian bent down and then gave a loud exclamation do you see what this is a suit of armour almost perfect still look though it must be ages old and heres another and another were they old ones thrown out or spare ones look at this helmet grand he kicked it gently with his foot and it gave out a metallic sound and rolled away a little would that be valuable now asked harry anxiously valuable worth its weight in gold i should think said julian such excitement in his voice that everyone felt even more thrilled harriet called to him urgently julian heres a chest of some sort quick they went slowly over to where she stood for they had already learnt that any quick movement raised clouds of fine choking dust she pointed to a great dark chest its corners bound with iron and with iron strapping all round it it was made of wood as black with age as the iron itself whats inside do you think whispered harriet and at once her whisper echoed from every corner you think you think you think timmy went to sniff at the chest and to his amazement it disintegrated at once slowly softly the sides and the great lid fell into dust that settled gently on the ground around only the iron corners and strapping were left it was strange to watch something crumble away before their eyes like magic thought anne as the wooden sides of the chest crumbled something shone out brightly in the light of the torches something that moved and slid out of the chest as the sides fell away fell with a jingling clinking sound curious to hear in that silent darkness the children stared in astonishment hardly believing their eyes anne clutched julian and made him jump ju what is it is it gold julian bent to pick up one of the rolling pieces yes its gold no doubt about it gold never tarnishes it keeps bright for ever these are gold coins of some sort treasured and hidden away there couldnt have been time to take them when the lady fled with her children and no one else would be able to get them for the castle was burnt down and buried by the falling walls this hoard of gold must have lain here untouched all these long years waiting for us to come said george twins your mother and father neednt worry about their farm any more theres enough gold there to buy them all the tractors they want and that may be only the beginning of the treasures down here julian theres another chest look like this one but smaller and beginning to fall to pieces lets see whats inside that more gold i hope but the second chest did not hold gold pieces it held a different kind of treasure one side had burst open and its contents had dribbled out rings said anne picking up two from the dust in which they lay a golden belt said george and look these tarnished chains must be necklaces because theyre set with blue stones this must be where the jackdaw found that ring weve found something else too called harry his excited voice making everyone jump look racks of swords and daggers some are beautifully carved too clamped to the wall were iron racks held in place by great iron rods driven deep into the hard earth of the wall some had loosened and the racks hung crooked their knives and swords askew or lay on the floor snippet ran to pick one up just as he had done before when he and nosey first went into the cellars by themselves what wonderful swords said julian picking one up my word this ones heavy i can hardly hold it good gracious whats that something had fallen from the roof of the cellar in which they were standing a great piece of old wood that had originally been placed there as part of the roofing at the same time the continual hum of the drilling above rose to a roar that made the children jump julian gave a shout out of here quickly he yelled those men will soon be through the roof and it may suddenly fall and bury us well have to go at once he snatched a dagger from the rack and still with the sword in his hand ran back to the entrance of the secret passage pulling anne with him the twins were last of all for they had run to get a handful of the gold and two of the necklaces and rings they must show their mother a few of the treasures they must just as they reached the entrance more of the roof fell well have to stop this excavating panted julian looking back if the roof falls in it may destroy many of the old treasures there they hurried into the dark low tunnel feeling more excited than they had ever felt in their lives timmy led the way glad to think they were going out into the open air once more what will mother say the twins kept saying to one another whatever will she say chapter seventeen trapped the six children stumbled down the tunnel still hearing the faroff sound of the drills and fearing that at any moment the cellars would be discovered by mr henning who no doubt would be anxiously watching from above they came to where they thought the burrow must be that dick had dug through but instead there was nothing but a great mass of earth some of it seeping into the tunnel julian gazed at it by the light of his torch dismayed the burrows fallen in he said his voice shaking what are we to do weve no spades to dig ourselves out we can use our hands said dick and began to scrabble at the fallen earth sweeping it into the tunnel but as he scrabbled more and more earth fell into the widened burrow and julian stopped dick at once no more of that dick you might start an earthfall and wed all be buried alive oh gosh this is awful well have to go back up the passage and try to make the men hear us shouting blow that means mr henning will know what were up to i dont believe the men will be there much longer said dick looking at his watch they pack up at five and its almost that now my word weve been ages mrs philpot will wonder where we all are the drilling has just stopped said anne i havent got that awful noise inside my ears any longer in that case its certainly no good going back up the tunnel said julian theyd be gone before we got there i say you know this is serious i ought to have thought of this any idiot knows that ground entrances to passages should be strengthened if theyre newlydug well we can always go back to the cellars and wait for the men to come tomorrow said george sounding more cheerful than she felt how do we know theyll be there tomorrow said dick henning may have paid them off today if hes disappointed in his hopes dont be such a dismal jimmy said george sensing that the twins were getting panicky they certainly were worried but more because they were certain that their mother would be scared to death if they didnt come home than for their own safety timmy had been standing patiently beside george waiting to get out of the hole at last tired of waiting he trotted away but down the tunnel not up timmy where are you going cried george and shone her torch on him he turned his head and looked at her showing quite clearly by his manner that he was tired of standing about and intended to find out where the tunnel led ju look at timmy he wants us to go down the tunnel cried george why didnt we think of that i dont know im afraid i thought it would be a sort of blind alley said julian i fear it will too nobody knows where the chapel entrance to the tunnel is do they twins no they said both together its never been discovered as far as we know anyway its worth trying said george her voice sounding muffled as she went down the passage after the impatient timmy im getting suffocated in here the others followed snippet dancing along behind thinking the whole thing was a huge joke the tunnel as the children had imagined went downwards in more or less a straight line it had fallen in slightly here and there but by bending their heads and crouching low they managed to get through finally they came to a bad fall of earth from the roof and had to crawl through on hands and knees anne didnt like that part at all they came at last into a strange little place where the tunnel ended abruptly it was like a stone vault a little chamber about five feet high and seven feet square julian looked up fearfully at its low roof was it of stone if so they were trapped they would never be able to lift a heavy stone slab no not all the roof was made of stone a piece in the middle about three feet square was made of strong stout wood which rested on ledges cut in the stone it looks like a trapdoor said julian examining it by the light of his torch i wonder if we are just below the floor of the old chapel dick if you and i and harry all heave at the same time we might be able to move this trapdoor so they all heaved george too but although the door did lift a little at one corner it simply could not be moved upwards i know why we cant move it said harry red in the face with heaving there are sacks of grain and fertilizer and all kinds of stuff spread over the floor of the old chapel theyre heavy as lead wed never be able to move that trapdoor if two or three sacks are on it gosh i didnt think of that said julian his heart sinking didnt you know of this entrance into the tunnel twins of course not said harry nobody did i cant think why it wasnt known though except of course that a storehouse like this has its floor always covered with sacks of something and with the spillings out of those sacks it may not have been cleaned out or swept for hundreds of years well what are we to do now demanded dick we cant stay here in this stuffy little place listen i can hear something said george suddenly noises overhead they listened intently and through the tightlyfitting oak trapdoor above them they heard a loud voice shouting give us a hand bill will you its jamie the men are working overtime this week said harry hes come to get something out of the chapel quick lets all yell and hammer on the trapdoor with whatever weve got thatll make a noise at once there was a perfect babel of sound from the little vault yells shouts barks and the hammering of swordhandles and fists on the wooden slab overhead then the children ceased their hammering and fell silent listening they heard jamies voice lifted in wonder bill what in the name of goodness was that a ratfight do you suppose they heard us said julian excited come on once again and bark the place down timmy timmy was only too ready to oblige for he was very tired of tunnels and dark echoing places by now he barked long and fiercely frightening snippet so much that the little poodle actually ran back up the tunnel what with tims barking and everyones yelling and the constant hammering the noise was even louder than before and bill and jamie listened in amazement comes from over yonder said bill summats going on there beats me what it is though if twere nighttime id think it were ghosties having a game come on well get over yonder the place was so full of sacks that the two men had to clamber over the rows disturbing the cat and her kittens she had curled herself round them scared of the unexpected noise this corner bill said jamie standing on top of two layers of sacks he put his hand to his mouth and bellowed like a bull anyone about the six below answered frantically at the tops of their voices timmy barking too theres a dog barking down there said bill scratching his head puzzled looking down at the sacks as if he thought there might be a dog in one of them a dog theres folks as well said jamie astounded where are they cant be under these sacks maybe theyre in that little old storeplace we found one day in the floor suggested bill remember under an old trapdoor it were that were covered by a great slab of stone you remember man oh ay said jamie and then the clamour began again for the children were now getting near despair gome on bill said jamie hearing the note of urgency though he couldnt make out a word from below heave over these here sacks weve got to get to the bottom of this they heaved a dozen sacks away and then at last the trapdoor was uncovered the stone slab that had once hidden it had been taken up some years ago by the two men and now stood against the wall they had not bothered to replace it not guessing that the little old storeplace as they had thought it was really an entrance to a secret longforgotten passage it was fortunate indeed for the children that only the old wooden trapdoor was between them and the men for if the stone slab had been there too no sound of their shouting would have been heard in the old chapel above now for this here trapdoor said bill he tapped on it with his great boot whos down here he demanded wondering what the answer would be us shrieked the twins and the others joined in with timmy barking frantically again bless us all thems the twins voices i heard said jamie how did they climb into that storeroom without moving these here sacks with a great heave the two men pulled up the heavy wooden slab and looked down in the greatest astonishment at the little crowd below they couldnt believe their eyes timmy was the first out he leapt upwards and landed beside the men wagging his great tail and licking them lavishly oh thanks bill thanks jamie cried the twins as the two men pulled them up gosh im thankful you were working overtime and happened to come in here your mas been hollering for you said bill disapprovingly and didnt you say you was going to help me with them poles how did you get down there demanded jamie pulling up the others one by one julian was the last and he handed up poor scared little snippet who really felt he had had quite enough adventures for one day oh its too long a story to tell you just now said harry but thanks again most awfully bill and jamie can you put that slab back dont tell anyone we were down there till we tell you how it happened see now well have to rush and tell mother were all right and away they all went longing for tea tired out full of thankfulness at their escape from the little stone room under the chapel floor what would everyone say when they displayed the treasures they had brought back with them chapter eighteen a great story to tell the twins tore down to the farmhouse and saw their mother still looking for them they flung themselves on her and she gave them a loving shake where have you been youre an hour late for tea all of you ive been so worried mr henning told me some story about you digging up on the hillside mother were ravenous so lets have tea and well tell you some great news said the twins both together mother you will be astonished wheres dad and greatgranddad too theyre still at the teatable they were late too said mrs philpot theyve been out looking for you all greatgranddad isnt very pleased what in the world have you brought with you surely those are not swords mother lets have tea first and well tell you everything said the twins must we wash oh blow all right come on everyone lets wash and well put our treasures down in the darkest corner so that dad and greatgranddad wont see them till were ready to show them soon they were all sitting down at the teatable glad to see a wonderful spread great slices of thickly buttered bread homemade jam homemade cheese a fat ginger cake a fruit cake a dish of ripe plums and even a homecooked ham if anyone wanted something more substantial mr philpot and old greatgranddad were still at the table drinking a last cup of tea mrs philpot had told them that the children had to wash but would tell all that had happened when they came to their tea ho said greatgranddad frowning till his great bushy eyebrows almost covered his nose when i was a boy i dursent come in one minute late for my meals you twins have worried your mother thats bad were awfully sorry greatgranddad said the twins in unison but just wait till you hear our story julian you tell it and so between great munches of bread and butter ham sandwiches and slices of cake the story was told all the children joining in now and again greatgranddad already knew that mr benning had been given permission to excavate and that a cheque for ј had been given to mr philpot he had flown into a terrible temper and only when mrs philpot had sobbed and said that she would give it back though she could hardly bear to part with it had greatgranddad given in now ready to fly into another rage he listened to the childrens story he forgot to drink his cooling tea he forgot to fill his pipe he even forgot to ask a single question never had he heard such a wonderful glorious tale in his life julian told the story well and the others filled in any bits he left out mrs philpots eyes almost fell out of her head when she heard how snippet and nosey had gone into the rabbitburrow and come out with a broken sword and a ring but but where did she began and listened again to hear how dick and julian had enlarged the burrow crawled right through it and slid down into the longlost secret tunnel ha said greatgranddad getting out his great red handkerchief and dabbing his forehead with it ha wish id been there go on go on julian had stopped to drink his tea he laughed and went on describing how they had all gone up the tunnel with their torches the dogs with them it was dark and smelly and suddenly we heard a terrific noise he said it got right inside our heads put in anne what was it what was it said greatgranddad his eyes almost as big as the saucer in front of him the noise of the men drilling up on the old castlesite said julian and greatgranddad exploded in wrath he pointed his pipe at his grandson the farmer didnt i tell you i wouldnt have those men on my farm he began and then calmed down as mrs philpot patted his arm shushing him go on julian she said and then came the really exciting part the story of how they came into the actual cellars of the castle the stone archways the ageold dust and the echoes said anne when we whispered a hundred other whispers came back when julian described their finds the old armour still good but black with age the rack of swords and knives and daggers the chest of gold gold i dont believe you shouted greatgranddad youre making that up young man dont you pile up your tale too much now stick to the truth the twins promptly took some of the gold coins out of their pockets still brilliant and shining they laid them on the table in front of the three amazed grownups there you are they will tell you if we are making up all this or not these gold coins they will speak more loudly than words in awe mr philpot picked them up and passed them one by one to the old man and to his wife greatgranddad was dumbfounded and dumbstruck he simply could not say a single word he could only grunt and puff as he turned the coins over in his great horny hand are they really gold said mrs philpot quite overcome at the sudden appearance of the shining coins trevor will they belong to us does it mean does it mean that well be well enough off to buy a new tractor for you and depends how much of this stuff there is up in those old cellars said mr philpot trying to keep calm and depends on how much were allowed to keep of course might belong to the crown by now the crown roared greatgranddad standing up suddenly the crown no sir its mine ours found on my land put there by our ancestors yes and ill give old mr finniston down in the village a share so i will hes been a good friend of mine for years the children thought that was quite a good idea they then showed the jewellery they had brought and mrs philpot marvelled at it tarnished though it was but the swords and daggers brought the greatest excitement to old greatgranddad and his grandson mr philpot as soon as they heard that the children had actually brought back some of the old weapons the two men got up and went to get them greatgranddad picked up the biggest and heaviest of the swords and swung it dangerously round his head looking like a reincarnation of some fearsome old warrior with his great beard and blazing eyes no no granddad said mrs philpot in fright oh youll knock down the things on the dresser there i knew you would bang goes my meatdish and down it went crash timmy and snippet almost jumped out of their skins and began to bark frantically sit down all of you cried mrs philpot to the excited dogs and the men let julian finish his story greatgranddad sit down ha said greatgranddad a broad smile on his face sitting down in his chair ha did me good to swing that sword wheres that american i might try it out on him the children roared with delight it was great to see the old man so delighted go on with that tale of yours he said to julian you tell it well boy go on now ma dont you take my sword away im keeping it here between my legs in case i want to use it ha julian quickly finished his tale and told how they had walked back down the passage and found their burrow entrance fallen in and then gone right down the rest of the tunnel and come at last into the little stonewalled room and we couldnt get out said julian there was a great wooden trapdoor over our heads and on it lay a dozen or so sacks heavy as lead we couldnt lift it so we yelled so thats where the secret passage led to said mr philpot how did you get out we yelled and hammered and bill and jamie heard us and pulled off the sacks and lifted up the old trapdoor said julian gosh we were glad to see them we thought we might be lost for ever jamie knew about the little stone vault down under the chapel floor but he thought it was just an old storeroom ive never heard of it before said mrs philpot and old greatgranddad nodded his head in agreement no more have i he said for as long as i can remember the floor of that old chapel has been piled with sacks and what bits i could see of the floor were covered with thick dust yes even when i was a boy playing hide and seek in the old place it was full of sacks and thats every bit of eightyfive years ago now well well seems like yesterday i was playing in there with a cat and her kittens theres a cat and her kittens there now said anne ay little lass and therell be a cat and her kittens there when youre an old old woman said greatgranddad theres some things never change thanks be to the lord well well i can sleep easy of nights now i reckon you and the farm will be all right trevor with the money youll make out of those old finds and ill live to see the twins growing up and handling the finest farm in dorset so i shall with everything newfangled they want bless their bonny faces and now ill just have one more swing with that sword the children fled greatgranddad looked years younger already and goodness knows what damage he would do with that great sword what an afternoon it had been one they would never forget chapter nineteen the most exciting adventure weve ever had after all the excitement of the afternoon the children felt lazy the twins went off to feed the chickens better late than never they said together where are mr henning and mr durleston and that awful junior mrs philpot asked george getting up to help with the washing of the teathings oh mr henning came in to say he and mr durleston were going to a meal at a hotel and taking junior too said mrs philpot he seemed very pleased with himself indeed he said that they had broken through to the cellars of the old castle and expected great things and that maybe a second cheque of ј would be coming soon you wont take it though will you mrs philpot said julian quickly overhearing what was being said the things down in that cellar will be worth much more than any money mr henning is likely to offer you hed only take them to america and sell them for vast sums and make a huge profit why should you let him do that that nice old man mr finniston down in the little antique shop would know what everything was worth said george and hes a descendant of the longago finnistons of finniston castle isnt he hell be thrilled to bits when he hears whats been happening well send word for him to come up tomorrow decided mrs philpot after all mr henning has his adviser that surly mr durleston well have mr finniston for ours greatgranddad would be pleased about that theyre great friends those two there was however no need to send for mr finniston for greatgranddad had himself gone down straight away to tell the great news to his old crony what a talk they had together gold coins jewellery suits of armour swords and goodness knows what else said greatgranddad for the twentieth time and old mr finniston listened gravely nodding his head that splendid big sword went on granddad remembering just right for me william look if ever ive lived before that old sword once belonged to me i feel it thats one thing i wont sell mind ill keep it just for the sake of swinging it round my head when i lose my temper yes yes but i hope youll be sure to stand in the middle of an empty room if you do that said mr finniston a little alarmed at the fierce look in the old mans eye you wont be allowed to keep all the money im afraid theres such a thing as treasure trove you know some finds go to the crown and i fear that will be one of them but the jewellerys different and the suits of armour and the swords youll be able to make a mint of money on those enough for two new tractors said greatgranddad enough for a new landrover that one my grandson has it jolts every bone in my body look now william weve got to get men digging on that site uncovering all those cellars what say we keep on the men that fellow hennings got we shant let him excavicate or whatever its called any more ha that fellow gets under my skin and sets me itching all over now i can scratch him out and see here william youll shut up this shop of yours and be my adviser wont you i wont have that american talking me down or that fellow durleston youd better stop talking for a bit granddad youre getting too red in the face said mr finniston youll go pop if you excite yourself much more go home now and ill be up tomorrow morning ill arrange about the workmen too and dont you play about with that old sword too much you might cut off somebodys head by mistake so i might so i might said greatgranddad with a sly look in his eye now if that junior got in the way when i was swinging my sword its all right william its all right just my joke you know just my joke and chuckling deep down in his long beard greatgranddad strode off turned up the little lane and walked back to the farmhouse feeling very pleased indeed with life mr henning mr durleston and junior did not come back that night apparently they were all so excited over the excavations they had made in the drilling down through the cellar roof that they stayed too long at the hotel and decided to spend the night there much to mrs philpots relief most farmpeople like to go to bed about nine oclock said mr henning and its already gone that now well go over tomorrow morning and well get them to sign that agreement youve drawn up durleston theyre so short of money theyd sign anything and mind you cry down what we think weve found so that they wont expect any more than ј were going to make our fortunes over this so next morning the two men with an excited junior whom mr durleston found most annoying arrived at the farmhouse at about ten oclock they had telephoned to say they would be there then and would bring the agreement with them and the cheque mrs philpot the cheque purred mr henning down the phone when they arrived there was quite a company there to greet them there was old greatgranddad his grandson mr philpot and his wife the twins of course and old mr finniston sniffing a fight his dull eyes bright this morning for the first time in years he sat at the back wondering what was going to happen all the five were there too timmy wondering what the excitement was he kept as close to george as he could and growled at snippet every time the excited little poodle came near snippet didnt mind he could always growl back a car purred up the drive and in came mr henning mr durleston and junior whose face was one big grin hallo folks said junior in his usual jaunty manner hows tricks nobody answered except timmy and he gave a small growl which made junior skip out of the way quickly you shut up he said to timmy did you have your breakfast in bed at the hotel little boy suddenly said george do you remember the last time you had it in bed here and timmy pulled aw shucks said junior sulkily skip it sister he subsided after that and sat down by his father then began a short sharp and satisfactory meeting from mr philpots point of view er mr philpot its my very great pleasure to say that i have been advised by mr durleston to offer you a further cheque for ј said mr henning smoothly while we are rather disappointed in what appears to be in the cellars of the castle we feel it would only be fair to offer you the sum we suggested before is that right mr durleston absolutely said mr durleston in a businesslike voice and glared round through his hornrimmed glasses ive the agreement here mr henning is being very generous very the cellars are most disappointing im sorry about that said mr philpot i hold a different opinion and my adviser mr finniston upholds me in this we are going to excavate the site ourselves mr henning and then if any disappointment lies in wait we shall be the ones to suffer not you whats all this said mr henning glaring round durleston what do you say to that bit of doublecrossing isnt it offer him ј said mr durleston looking startled at this unexpected setback you can offer me five thousand if you like but i tell you i prefer to do the excavation myself on my own land said mr philpot what is more i will return you the cheque you gave me yesterday and as i intend to keep on the men you engaged i will pay them myself for their work so do not trouble to dismiss them they will now be working for me but this is monstrous shouted mr henning losing his temper and jumping to his feet he banged on the table and glared at mr and mrs philpot what do you expect to find in those derelict old cellars we drilled right through yesterday and theres practically nothing there i made you a very generous offer ill raise it to a thousand pounds no said mr philpot quietly but greatgranddad had had enough of mr hennings shouting and raging he stood up too and bellowed so loudly that everyone jumped and timmy began to bark snippet at once fled to the kitchen cupboard and hid there ha now you listen to me bellowed greaatgranddad this farm belongs to me and my grandson and itll go to my great grandson sitting yonder a finer farm there never was and my familys had it for hundreds of years and sad its been for me to see it go down hill for lack of money but now i see money much money down in those cellars ha all the money we want for tractors and binders and combines and the lord knows what we dont want your money no sir you keep your dollars you keep them offer me five thousand if you like and see what ill say mr henning turned swiftly and looked at mr durleston who at once nodded right said the american to greatgranddad five thousand done no bawled greatgranddad enjoying himself more than he had done for years theres gold down in those cellars jewels suits of armour swords daggers knives all of them centuries old and dont hand me stories like that said mr henning sneeringly you old fibber greatgranddad banged his clenched fist down on the table and made everyone almost fall off their chairs twins he roared fetch those things you got yesterday go on fetch them here ill show this american im no fibber and then before the astounded eyes of mr henning and mr durleston and of junior too the twins laid the gold coins the jewellery and the swords and knives on the table mr durleston stared as if he couldnt believe his eyes well what do you say to that demanded greatgranddad banging on the table again mr durleston sat back and said one word junk then it was old mr finnistons turn to stand up and say a few words mr durleston who hadnt noticed the quiet old man sitting at the back was horrified to see him there he knew he was learned and knowledgeable for he himself had tried to pick his brains about the old castlesite ladies and gentlemen said mr finniston just as if he were addressing a wellconducted meeting i regret to say that speaking as a wellknown antiquarian i do not consider that mr durleston knows what he is talking about if he calls these articles junk the things on the table are worth a small fortune to any genuine collector i could myself sell them in london tomorrow for far more than any sum mr durleston has advised mr henning to offer thank you ladies and gentlemen and he sat down bowing courteously to the assembled company anne felt as if she wanted to clap him well i dont think theres any more to say said mr philpot getting up if youll tell me what hotel youll be staying at mr henning ill have your things sent there you will certainly not wish to stay here any longer pop i dont wanna go i wanna stay here howled junior most surprisingly i wanna see the cellars excaexculpated i wanna dig down i wanna stay well we dont want you said harry fiercely you and your peeping and prying and listening and boasting and talebearing cissyboy breakfast in bed cant clean his shoes howls when he cant get his own way screams when thats enough harry said his mother sternly looking quite shocked i dont mind junior staying on if hell behave himself its not his fault that all this has happened i wanna stay wept junior and kicked out peevishly under the table he unfortunately caught timmy on the nose and the dog rose in anger growling and showing his teeth junior fled for his life do you wanna stay now shouted george as he went and the answer came back at once no well thanks timmy for helping him to make up his mind said george and patted the big dog mr henning looked as if he were about to burst if that dog bites my boy ill have him put to sleep he said ill sue you ill please go said mrs philpot suddenly looking tired out i have a lot of baking to do i shall take my time said mr henning pompously i will not be turned out suddenly as if i hadnt paid my bills seen this sword henning said old greatgranddad suddenly and snatched from the table the big sword that he so much liked beauty isnt it the men of old knew how to deal with their enemies didnt they they swung at them like this and like this and here stop youre dangerous that sword nearly cut me cried mr henning in a sudden panic will you put it down no its mine im not selling this said greatgranddad swinging the sword again it hit the lightbulb above his head and the glass fell with a clatter mr durleston deserted mr henning and fled out of the kitchen at top speed colliding violently with bill who was just coming in look out hes mad that old mans mad shouted mr durleston henning come along before he cuts off your head mr henning fled too greatgranddad pursued him to the door breathing blood and thunder and the two dogs barked in delight everyone began to laugh helplessly granddad whats got into you said mr philpot as the old fellow swung the sword again his eyes bright a broad grin on his wrinkled old face nothing i just thought that only this sword would get rid of those fellows do you know what i call them junk ha wish id thought of that when they were here junk william finniston did you hear that now you put that sword down before you damage it said mr finniston who knew how to manage greatgranddad and you and i will go down to the old inn and talk over what were going to do about all this treasure trove you just put that sword down first no granddad i am not going to take you into the inn carrying that sword mrs philpot heaved a sigh of relief when the two old fellows went off down the lane leaving the sword safely behind she sat down and to the childrens horror began to cry now now dont take any notice of me she said when the twins ran to her in dismay im crying for joy to have got rid of them and to know ive not got to pinch and scrape any more or to take in visitors to think that your dad can buy the farm machinery he wants and oh dear what a baby i am acting like this i say mrs philpot would you like us to leave too asked anne suddenly realizing that she and the others were ranked as visitors and must have been an added burden for poor mrs philpot oh no my dear no youre not really visitors youre friends said mrs philpot smiling through her tears and whats more i shant charge your mothers a single penny for having you here see what good fortune youve brought us all right well stay wed love to said anne we wouldnt miss seeing what else is down in those castle cellars for anything would we george gosh no said george we want to be in on everything this is just about the most exciting adventure weve ever had we always say that said anne but the nice part about this one is it isnt finished yet well be able to go and watch the workmen and their drills well be able to help in moving all the exciting old things out of their hiding places well hear what prices you get for them and see the new tractor honestly i really do believe the second part of this adventure will be better than the first dont you think so timmy woof said timmy and wagged his tail so hard that he knocked snippet right over well goodbye five enjoy the rest of your adventures and have a good time and do make sure that granddad is careful with that great old sword
