academy they were apparently of about the same age somewhere from fifteen to sixteen but there was a considerable difference in their attire herbert grant was neatly but coarsely dressed and his shoes were of cowhide but his face indicated a frank sincere nature and was expressive of intelligence his companion was dressed in a suit of fine cloth his linen was of the finest his shoes were calfskin and he had the indefinable air of a boy who had been reared in luxury he had not the broad open face of his friend for the two boys were close friends but his features were finely chiseled indicating a share of pride and a bold selfreliant nature he too was an attractive boy and in spite of his pride possessed a warm affectionate heart and sterling qualities likely to endear him to those who could read and understand him his name was frank courtney and he is the hero of my story have you written your latin exercises frank asked herbert yes i finished them an hour ago i was going to ask you to write them with me it is pleasanter to study in company provided you have the right sort of company rejoined frank am i the right sort of company inquired herbert with a smile you hardly need to ask that herbert are we not always together if i did not like your company i should not seek it so persistently i dont care to boast but i have plenty of offers of companionship which i dont care to accept there is bob stickney for instance who is always inviting me to his room but you know what he is a lazy fellow who cares more to have a good time than to study then there is james cameron a conceited emptyheaded fellow who is very disagreeable to me you dont mention your stepbrother mark manning for two reasons he doesnt care for my company and of all the boys i dislike him the most i dont like him myself but why do you dislike him so much because he is a sneak a crafty deceitful fellow always scheming for his own interest he hates me but he doesnt dare to show it his father is my mothers husband but the property is hers and will be mine he thinks he may some day be dependent on me and he conceals his dislike in order to stand the better chance by and by heaven grant that it may be long before my dear mother is called away how did she happen to marry again frank i can hardly tell it was a great grief to me mr manning was a penniless lawyer who ingratiated himself with my mother and persecuted her till she consented to marry him he is very softspoken and very plausible and he managed to make mother who has been an invalid for years think that it would be the best thing for her to delegate her cares to him and provide me with a second father frank did not like his stepfather he did not trust him your stepbrother mark manning enjoys the same advantages as yourself does he not inquired herbert yes then his fathers marriage proved a good thing for him that is true when he first came to the house he was poorly dressed and had evidently been used to living in a poor way he was at once provided with a complete outfit as good as my own and from that time as much has been spent on him as on me dont think that i am mean enough to grudge him any part of the money expended upon him if he were like you i could like him and enjoy his society but he is just another as his father here herberts attention was drawn to a boy who was approaching with a yellow envelope in his hand frank he said suddenly theres mark manning he looks as if he had something to say to you he has either a letter or a telegram in his hand chapter ii the telegram franks heart gave a great bound at the suggestion of a telegram a telegram could mean but one thing that his mother had become suddenly worse he hurried to meet his stepbrother is that a telegram mark he asked anxiously yes is it anything about mother tell me quick read it for yourself frank frank drew the telegram from the envelope and read it hastily my wife is very sick i wish you and frank to come home at once when does the next train start herbert asked frank pale with apprehension in an hour i shall go by that train i dont think i can get ready so soon said mark deliberately then you can come by yourself replied frank impetuously i beg your pardon mark he added i cannot expect you to feel as i do it is not your mother it is my stepmother said mark that is quite different but i must not linger here i will go at once to dr brush and tell him of my summons home goodbye herbert till we meet again i will go with you to the depot frank said his friend sympathizingly dont wait for me go ahead and make your preparation for the journey i will be at your room in a quarter of an hour you wont go by the next train mark said herbert no i dont care to rush about as frank is doing you would if it were your own mother who was so ill i am not sure it wouldnt do any good would it you would naturally feel anxious said herbert oh yes i suppose so answered mark indifferently mark manning was slender and dark with a soft voice and rather effeminate ways he didnt care for the rough sports in which most boys delight never played baseball or took part in athletic exercises but liked to walk about sprucely dressed and had even been seen on the campus on a saturday afternoon with his hands incased in kid gloves for this however he was so ridiculed and laughed at that he had to draw them off and replace them in his pocket as frank and herbert walked together to the railway station the latter said it seems to me frank that the telegram should have been sent to you rather than to mark manning you are the one who is most interested in the contents i thought of that herbert but i was too much affected by the contents to speak of it i am not surprised however it is like mr manning it jarred upon me to have him speak of mother as his wife she is so but i never could reconcile myself to the fact do you remember your father your own father frank you need not have said your own father i dont recognize mr manning as a father at all yes i remember him i was eight years old when he died he was a finelooking man always kind a man to be loved and respected there was not a particle of similarity between him and mr manning he was strong and manly how did it happen that he died so young he was the victim of a railway accident he had gone to new york on business and was expected back on a certain day the train on which he was a passenger collided with a freight train and my poor father was among the passengers who were killed the news was almost too much for my poor mother although she had not yet become an invalid it brought on a fit of sickness lasting for three months she has never been altogether well since after all frank the gifts of fortune or rather providence are not so unequally distributed as at first appears you are rich but fatherless i am poor enough but my father and mother are both spared to me i would gladly accept poverty if my father could be restored to life and my mother be spared to me for twenty years to come i am sure you would frank said herbert money is valuable but there are some things far more so they had reached the station by this time and it was nearly the time for the train to start frank bought his ticket and the two friends shook hands and bade each other goodbye in an hour frank was walking up the long avenue leading to the front door of the mansion the door was opened by his stepfather how is mother asked frank anxiously i am grieved to say that she is very sick said mr manning in a soft voice she had a copious hemorrhage this morning which has weakened her very much is she in danger asked frank anxiously i fear she is said mr manning i suppose i can see her yes but it will be better not to make her talk much i will be careful sir frank waited no longer but hurried to his mothers chamber as he entered and his glance fell on the bed and its occupant he was shocked by the pale and ghastly appearance of the mother whom he so dearly loved the thought came to him at once she cannot live he found it difficult to repress a rising sob but he did so for his mothers sake he thought that it might affect her injuriously if he should display emotion his mother smiled faintly as he approached the bed mother said frank kneeling by the bedside are you very weak yes frank she answered almost in a whisper i think i am going to leave you oh dont say that mother burst forth in anguish from franks lips try to live for my sake i should like to live my dear boy whispered his mother but if it is gods will that i should die i must be reconciled i leave you in his care here mr manning entered the room you will be kind to my boy said the dying mother can you doubt it my dear replied her husband in the soft tones frank so much disliked i will care for him as if he were my own thank you then i shall die easy dont speak any more mother it will tire you and perhaps bring on another hemorrhage frank is right my dear you had better not exert yourself any more at present didnt mark come with you asked mr manning of frank no sir i am surprised that he should not have done so i sent for him as well as you i believe he is coming by the next train said frank indifferently he thought he could not get ready in time for my train he should not have left you to come at such a time i didnt wish him to inconvenience himself mr manning if it had been his mother it would have been different mr manning did not reply he understood very well that there was no love lost between mark and his stepson chapter iii franks bereavement early in the evening mark made his appearance supper had been over for an hour and everything was cold in a house where there is sickness the regular course of things is necessarily interrupted and because he could not have his wants attended to immediately mark saw fit to grumble and scold the servants he was not a favorite with them and they did not choose to be bullied deborah who had been in the house for ten years and so assumed the independence of an old servant sharply reprimanded the spoiled boy you ought to be ashamed mr mark she said of making such a fuss when my poor mistress lies upstairs at the point of death do you know who you are talking to demanded mark imperiously for he could when speaking with those whom he regarded as inferiors exchange his soft tones for a voice of authority i ought to know by this time answered deborah contemptuously there is no other in the house like you i am glad to say you are very impertinent you forget that you are nothing but a servant a servant has the right to be decently treated mr mark if you dont look out said mark in a blustering tone i will report you to my father and have you kicked out of the house deborah was naturally incensed at this rude speech but she was spared the trouble of replying frank entered the room at this moment in time to hear marks last speech what is this about being kicked out of the house he asked looking from mark to deborah in a tone of unconscious authority which displeased his stepbrother that is my business replied mark shortly mr mark has threatened to have me kicked out of the house because he has to wait for his supper said deborah it wasnt for that it was because you were impertinent all the same i think it is shameful that i cant get anything to eat i regret mark said frank with cool sarcasm that you should be inconvenienced about your meals perhaps you will excuse it as my poor mother is so sick that she requires extra attention from the servants deborah if possible dont let mark wait much longer it seems to be very important that he should have his supper he shall have it assured deborah rather enjoying the way in which mark was put down that is if he dont get me kicked out of the house you had better not make any such threats in the future mark said frank significantly whos to hinder blustered mark i am answered frank pointedly you are nothing but a boy like me retorted mark my mother is mistress here and i represent her things may change soon muttered mark but frank had left the room and did not hear him mark did not trouble himself even to inquire for his stepmother but went out to the stable and lounged about until bedtime he seemed very much bored and so expressed himself frank wished to sit up all night with his mother but as she had a professional nurse it was thought best that he should obtain his regular rest the nurse promising to call the family if any change should be apparent in her patients condition about halfpast four in the morning there was a summons mrs manning is worse said the nurse i dont think she can last long one last glance of love though she could no longer speak assured frank that she knew him and loved him to the last the memory of that look often came back to him in the years that followed and he would not have parted with it for anything that earth could give just as the clock struck five his mother breathed her last the boy gazed upon the inanimate form but he was dazed and could not realize that his mother had left him never to return she is gone said mr manning softly dead ejaculated frank yes her sufferings are over let us hope she is better off my boy i think you had better return to your bed you can do nothing for your mother now i would rather stay here said frank sadly i can at least look at her and soon i shall lose even that comfort the thought was too much for the poor boy and he burst into tears do as you please frank assented mr manning i feel for you and i share in your grief i will go and tell mark of our sad loss he made his way to marks chamber and entered he touched mark who was in a doze and he started up whats the matter he asked crossly your poor mother is dead mark well there was no need to wake me for that said the boy irritably i cant help it can i i think my son you might speak with more feeling death is a solemn thing theres nobody here but me said mark sneering i dont catch your meaning said his father showing some annoyance for it is not pleasant to be seen through why should you care so much continued mark i suppose you will be well provided for do you know how she has left the property how much of it goes to frank i cant say said mr manning i never asked my wife do you mean to say father that you dont know how the property is left asked mark with a sharp glance at his father i may have my conjectures said mr manning softly i dont think my dear wife would leave me without some evidences of her affection probably the bulk of the estate goes to your brother and something to me doubtless we shall continue to live here as i shall naturally be your brothers guardian dont call him my brother said mark why not true he is only your stepbrother but you have lived under the same roof and been to school together and this ought to strengthen the tie between you i dont like frank said mark he puts on altogether too many airs i had not observed that said his father well i have only this evening he saw fit to speak impudently to me indeed i am really amazed to hear it said mr manning softly oh he thinks he is the master of the house or will be said mark and he presumes on that he is unwise said mr manning even if the whole property descends to him which i can hardly believe possible i as his guardian will have the right to control him i hope youll do it father at any rate dont let him boss over me for i wont stand it i dont think he will boss over you answered his father in a slow measured voice betraying however neither anger nor excitement of course i should not permit that mark regarded his father fixedly i guess the old man knows whats in the will he said to himself he knows how to feather his own nest i hope hes feathered mine too mr manning passed from his sons chamber and went softly upstairs looking thoughtful anyone who could read the impassive face would have read trouble in store for frank chapter iv mrs mannings will during the preparations for the funeral frank was left pretty much to himself mr mannings manner was so soft and to him had been so deferential that he did not understand the man it didnt occur to him that it was assumed for a purpose that manner was not yet laid aside his stepfather offered to comfort him but frank listened in silence nothing that mr manning could say had the power to lighten his load of grief so far as words could console him the sympathy of deborah and the coachman both old servants whom his mother trusted had more effect for he knew that it was sincere and that they were really attached to his mother of mr manning he felt a profound distrust which no words of his could remove meanwhile mr manning was looking from an upper window down the fine avenue and his eye ranged from left to right over the ample estate with a glance of selfcomplacent triumph all mine at last he said to himself exultingly what i have been working for has come to pass three years ago i was wellnigh penniless and now i am a rich man i shall leave mark the master of a great fortune i have played my cards well no one will suspect anything wrong my wife and i have lived in harmony there will be little wonder that she has left all to me there would be perhaps but for the manner in which i have taken care he shall be mentioned in the will i mean of course in the will i have made for her he paused and touching a spring in the wall a small door flew open revealing a shallow recess in this recess was a folded paper tied with a red ribbon mr manning opened it and his eyes glanced rapidly down the page this is the true will he said to himself i wish i could summon courage to burn it it would be best out of the way that if found out would make me amenable to the law and i must run no risk in this secret recess it will never be found i will replace it and the document which i have had prepared will take its place and no one will be the wiser on the day after the funeral the family solicitor and a few intimate friends who had been invited by mr manning assembled in the drawing room of the mansion to hear the will read mr manning himself notified frank of the gathering and its object he found our hero lying on the bed in his chamber sad and depressed i dont like to intrude upon your grief my dear boy said his stepfather softly but it is necessary the last will of your dear mother and my beloved wife is about to be read and your presence is necessary couldnt it be put off asked frank sadly it seems too soon to think of such things pardon me my dear frank but it is quite needful that there should be an immediate knowledge of the contents of the will in order that the right person may look after the business interests of the estate i assure you that it is the invariable custom to read the will immediately after the funeral if that is the custom and it is necessary i have nothing to say when is the will to be read at three oclock and it is now two very well sir i will come down in time of course there cant be much doubt as to the contents of the will pursued mr manning you are doubtless the heir and as you are a minor i am probably your guardian should such be the case i hope that the relations between us may be altogether friendly i hope so said frank gravely at three oclock the members of the family with a few outside friends gathered in the drawing room the family solicitor mr ferret held in his hand what purported to be the last will of mrs manning the widowed husband had directed the lawyer to the bureau of the deceased lady as likely to contain her will it was found without trouble in the topmost drawer deborah and the coachman had speculated as to whether they would be invited to attend at the reading of the will their doubts were set at rest by an invitation from mr manning himself you were so long in the service of my dear wife he said that it is fitting that you be present at the reading of her will in which it is quite probable that you may be personally interested he is uncommonly polite i am sure thought deborah disposed for the moment to think more favorably of the man whom she had never been able to like my friends said the lawyer after a preliminary cough you are assembled to listen to the will of mrs manning just deceased the document which i hold in my hand i believe to be such an instrument i will now open if for the first time he untied the ribbon and began reading the will it commenced with the usual formula and proceeded to a few bequests of trifling amount deborah and richard green were each left two hundred dollars as a slight acknowledgment of their faithful service one or two friends of the family were remembered but to an inconsiderable extent then came the important clause all the rest and residue of the property of which i may die possessed i leave to my beloved husband james manning whose devoted affection has made happy the last years of my life having implicit confidence in his good judgment and kindness of heart i request him to make proper provision for my dear son frank whose happiness i earnestly desire i hope that he will consent to be guided by the wisdom and experience of his stepfather who i am sure will study his interests and counsel him wisely in my sorrow at parting with my dear son it is an unspeakable comfort to me to feel that he will have such a guardian and protector frank listened with amazement which was shared by all present practically he was disinherited and left wholly dependent upon his stepfather chapter v disinherited the contents of the will created general astonishment there was not one in the room who didnt know the devotion of mrs manning to her son frank yet while speaking of him affectionately she had treated him as they considered most cruelly why should she have left such a dangerous power in her husbands hands and how was mr manning affected he summoned to his face an expression of bewilderment and surprise and feeling that all eyes were fixed upon him he turned toward the lawyer mr ferret he said i need hardly say that this will surprises me very much as i see that it does the friends who are present are you sure that there is no codicil i have been unable to discover any mr manning said the lawyer gravely as he scanned the face of the widower keenly mr manning applied his handkerchief to his eyes and seemed overcome by emotion i knew my dear wifes confidence in me he said in a tremulous voice but i was not prepared for such a striking manifestation of it nor i said mr ferret dryly knowing her strong attachment to frank paused mr manning i feel the full extent and significance of that confidence when she leaves him so unreservedly to my care and guidance i hope that i may be found worthy of the trust i hope so sir said mr ferret who sharp lawyer as he was doubted whether all was right and was willing that mr manning should be made aware of his feeling it is certainly a remarkable proviso considering the affection which your wife entertained for her son precisely mr ferret it shows how much confidence the dear departed felt in me so far as i can see the boy is left wholly dependent upon you he shall not regret it said mr manning fervently i consecrate my life to this sacred trust you acquiesce in the arrangement then mr manning i cannot do otherwise can i there is nothing to prevent your settling the property or any part of it on the natural heir mr manning you must pardon me for saying that it would have been wiser had your wife so stipulated by will i cannot consent to reverse or in any way annul the last wishes of my dear wife said mr manning hastily it was her arrangement solely and i hold it sacred she has put upon me a serious responsibility from which i shrink indeed but which i cannot decline i will do all in my power to carry out the wishes of my late wife mr ferret shrugged his shoulders i am not surprised at your decision sir he said coldly few men would resist the temptation my duty is discharged with the reading of the will and i will bid you goodafternoon mr manning was a crafty man he knew that the strange will would be discussed and he thought it best that the discussion should come at once that it might be the sooner finished deborah faithful old servant was in a blaze of indignation she went up quickly to frank and said its a shame mr frank so it is if my mother made that will it is all right said frank gravely but she didnt mr frank i know she would never do such a thing she loved you as the apple of her eye and she would not cheat you out of your rightful inheritance no more she would mr frank said the coachman chiming in i dont know what to think said frank it has surprised me very much surprised you exclaimed deborah you may well say that you might have knocked me down with a feather when i heard the property left away from you depend upon it that man knows all about it you mean mr manning to be sure i mean him oh hes managed artfully i say that for him hes got it all into his own hands and you havent a cent if it was my mothers will i wouldnt complain of that deborah it was hers to do with as she liked and i know at any rate that she loved me theres one thing surprises me said richard green if so be as the will isnt genuine how does it happen that you and i come in for a legacy deborah its meant for a blind answered deborah oh hes the artfulest man you may be right deborah i must say the will sounded all right maybe it was copied from the mistress will this conversation took place in one corner of the room it ceased as mr ferret advanced toward the disinherited boy frank said he in a tone of sympathy i am very sorry for the provisions of the will so am i sir answered our hero it isnt pleasant to be dependent on mr manning particularly when the whole estate should be yours i wouldnt have minded if half had been left to him provided i had been left independent of him i appreciate your feelings frank i knew your father and i am proud to say that he was my friend i knew your mother well and i esteemed her highly i hope you will let me regard myself as your friend also thank you mr ferret said frank i am likely to need a friend i shall remember your kind proposal i want to ask you one question ask and i shall answer did my mother consult with you about making this will no frank did she ever say anything that would lead you to think she would leave the property as it is left in this will not a word was there another will yes i wrote her will at her direction more than a year ago this will is dated only three months since and of course takes precedence of it even if the other is in existence can you tell me what were the provisions of the other will a legacy of ten thousand dollars was left to mr manning and the rest of the estate to you except the small legacies which were all larger than in the will i have read for instance deborah and richard green were each put down for five hundred dollars so they suffer as well as i yes have you any idea mr ferret of the value of the estate which falls into mr mannings hands i have some idea because i have talked with your mother on the subject this estate is worth fifty thousand dollars at least and there are fully fifty thousand dollars in money and bonds the legacies do not altogether exceed one thousand dollars and therefore it may be said that your stepfather has fallen heir to one hundred thousand dollars i suppose there is nothing i can do mr ferret not unless you can show that this will which i have read is not a genuine document that would be difficult did you notice my mothers signature yes i am not an expert but i cannot detect any difference greater than maybe existed between two signatures of the same person then i suppose there is nothing to be done at present i expect to have a hard time with mr manning mr ferret how has he treated you in the past frank asked the lawyer i have had nothing to complain of but then he was not master of the estate now it is difficult and i think his treatment of me will be different you may be right you remember what i said frank that i should regard you as a friend i wont forget it mr ferret one by one the company left the house and frank was alone left alone and unsustained by sympathy he felt more bitterly than before the totally unexpected change in his circumstances up to the last hour he had regarded himself as the heir of the estate now he was only a dependent of a man whom he heartily disliked could it be that this misfortune had come to him through the agency of his mother i will not believe it he exclaimed energetically chapter vi an unsatisfactory interview frank came to a decision the next morning a long deferred interview with his stepfather was necessary having made up his mind he entered the room in which his stepfather sat his air was manly and his bearing that of a boy who respects himself but there was none of the swagger which some boys think it necessary to exhibit when they wish to assert their rights mr manning in a flowered dressing gown sat at a table with a sheet of paper before him and a lead pencil in his hand short as had been the interval since his accession to the property he was figuring up the probable income he would derive from the estate he looked up as frank entered the room and surveyed him with cold and sarcastic eyes his soft tones were dropped mr manning said frank i wish to talk to you you may of course his stepfather replied mildly it is about the will frank advised him so you would complain of your poor mother would you said his stepfather in a tone of virtuous indignation i cannot believe that my mother made that will mr manning colored he scented danger should frank drop such hints elsewhere he might make trouble and lead to a legal investigation which mr manning had every reason to dread this is very foolish he said more mildly no doubt you are disappointed but probably your mother has provided wisely you will want for nothing and you will be prepared for the responsibilities of manhood under my auspices mr mannings face assumed a look of selfcomplacence as he uttered these last words i have no blame to cast upon my dear mother said frank if she made that will she acted under a great mistake what mistake sir she failed to understand you do you mean to imply that i shall be false to my trust not at present sir i dont wish to judge of you too hastily as the boy turned to go he said i have nothing further to say sir but i have said mr manning very well sir i demand that you treat my son mark with suitable respect and forbear to infringe upon his rights frank looked up and answered with spirit i shall treat mark as well as he treats me sir is that satisfactory i apprehend said mr manning that you may make some mistakes upon that point i will try not to do so sir frank left the room and this time was not called back his stepfather looked after him but his face expressed neither friendliness nor satisfaction that boy requires taming he said to himself he is going to make trouble i must consider what i will do with him as mr manning reviewed franks words there was one thing which especially disturbed him the doubt expressed by his stepson as to his mothers having actually made the will he saw that it would not do for him to go too far in his persecution of frank as it might drive the latter to consult a lawyer in regard to the validity of the will by which he had been disinherited frank rather gloomily made his way to the stable as he reached it richard green came out im sorry for you mr frank but your mother was a saint she was too good to suspect the badness of others mr frank she thought old manning was really all that he pretended to be and that he would be as kind to you as she was herself when she was alive he was always as soft as as silk his manner has changed now said frank gravely excuse me richard for finding fault with you but dont call him old manning why not mr frank i have no liking for mr manning in fact i dislike him but he was the husband of my mother and i prefer to speak of him respectfully i dare say you are right mr frank but all the same he dont deserve it is mr mark to ride ajax then if he asks for it you are to saddle ajax for him i dont want you to get into any trouble with mr manning on my account i dont care for that mr frank i can get another place and i dont much care to serve mr manning i would rather you would stay if you can richard i dont want to see a new face in the stable i dont think he means to keep me long mr frank deborah and i will have to go i expect and hell get some servants of his own here has he hinted anything of this richard asked frank quickly no but he will soon you may depend on it i wont lose sight of you though ive known you since you were four years old and i wont desert you if i can do any good nor deborah either i have two friends then at any rate said frank to himself that is something chapter vii a school friend early monday morning it had been the custom for frank and mark to take the train for bridgeville to enter upon a new week at the academy frank felt that it would be better for him to go back without any further vacation as occupation would serve to keep him from brooding over his loss are you ready mark he asked as he rose from the breakfast table ready for what to go back to school of course i am not going back this morning answered mark why not asked frank in some surprise i am going to stay at home to help father said mark with a glance at mr manning if i can be of any service to you sir i will stay too said frank politely thank you but mark will do all i require replied his stepfather very well sir frank appeared at the academy with a grave face and subdued manner suggestive of the great loss he had sustained from his schoolfellows with whom he was a favorite he received many words of sympathy from none more earnest or sincere than from herbert grant i know how you feel frank he said pressing the hand of his friend if i could comfort you i would but i dont know how to do it i find comfort in your sympathy said frank i look upon you as my warmest friend here i am glad of that frank to herbert alone frank spoke of his mother and her devoted affection but even to him he did not like to mention the will and his disinheritance he did not so much lament the loss of the property as that he had lost it by the direction of his mother or rather because it would generally be supposed so for himself he doubted the genuineness of the will but he felt that it was useless to speak of it as he was unprepared with any proofs so it happened that when on wednesday afternoon mark manning made his appearance franks change of position as respected the property was neither known nor suspected by his schoolfellows it was soon known however and of course through mark the boys immediately noticed a change in mark he assumed an air of consequence and actually strutted across the campus instead of being polite and attentive to frank he passed him with a careless nod such as a superior might bestow on an inferior what has come over mark asked herbert of frank as the two were walking together from recitation how do you mean he holds his head higher than he used to do he looks as if he had been elected to some important office you will soon learn herbert said frank make a pretext to join him and let the news come from him herbert looked puzzled do you wish me to do this he asked yes i have a reason for it very well i am always ready to oblige you frank but i hope mark wont think i have suddenly formed a liking for his society if he does you can soon undeceive him that is true herbert left the side of his friend and sauntered toward mark as herbert was known as franks especial friend mark was at first surprised but quickly decided that his improved position had been communicated by frank and that herbert was influenced by it that is to say he judged herbert to be as mean and mercenary as himself herberts position was too humble to entitle him to much notice from mark but the latter was pleased with the prospect of detaching from frank his favorite friend you came back rather late mark said herbert yes answered mark with an air of importance i remained at home a short time to help my father in his accounts you know the property is large and there is a good deal to do i should think that was franks place to help about the accounts why the property is his of course did he tell you that asked mark sharply he has not said a word about the property no i suppose not said mark with a sneering laugh has anything happened didnt his mother leave as much as was expected went on herbert quite in the dark yes she left a large estate but she didnt leave it to him to whom then to my father replied mark with conscious pride frank has nothing he is entirely dependent upon father did his mother leave him nothing then asked herbert in pained surprise nothing at all assured mark complacently that is very strange and unjust i dont look upon it in that light said mark nettled my father knows what is best for him he will provide for him just as his mother did before but when frank is of age doesnt he come into possession of the estate then no of course not didnt i tell you it belongs to father frank is a poor boy as poor as you said mark in a tone of evident satisfaction or you added herbert pointedly you are mistaken said mark quickly i am fathers heir suppose your father dies how will the property go i suppose something will be left to frank unless my father leaves me the property with directions to provide for him would you think that right and just demanded herbert indignantly of course i would my stepmother knew what she was about when she made her will i see you are surprised you wont be quite to thick with frank now i expect why shouldnt i be because he is just as poor as you are he never can help you mark manning i believe you are about the meanest boy i ever encountered and you judge me by yourself do you mean to insult me mind what you say blustered mark unpleasantly surprised at this outburst from a boy whom he expected would now transfer his allegiance from frank to himself i mean that you and your father have robbed frank of his inheritance and glory in it and you think that i am mean enough to desert him because he is no longer rich it makes no difference to me whether he is rich or poor i think i like him all the better because he has been so badly treated as for you i despise you and shall continue to even if you get the whole of franks money you forget that you are talking to a gentleman you lowborn mechanic said mark angrily you a gentleman replied herbert contemptuously then i never want to be one he walked away leaving mark very much incensed he is a fool muttered mark when i am a rich man he may repent having insulted me herbert went back to frank did he tell you asked frank quietly yes and he actually appeared to think i would be ready to desert you because you were poor and follow him about i am not afraid of that herbert i dont think mark will have that idea any more i gave him a piece of my mind and left him very angry but what does it all mean frank i know no more than you do herbert i cannot understand it what could have induced your mother to make such a will i cannot believe my poor mother ever made such a will but if she did i am very sure that she was overpersuaded by my stepfather who is one of the most plausible of men what shall you do about it what can i do i am only a boy i have no proof you know how are you likely to be treated i have had a little foretaste of that it looks very bad for you frank admitted herbert in a tone of sympathy i dont so much care for the loss of the property herbert said frank but i am afraid i shall have sorts of annoyances to endure from mark and his father but i wont anticipate trouble i will do my duty and trust that things will turn out better than i fear the next afternoon a letter was placed in franks hands it was in a brown envelope and directed in a cramped and evidently unpracticed hand with which frank was not familiar on opening it a glance at the signature showed that it was from richard green the coachman it commenced dear mr frank this comes hoping you are well i have no good news to tell mr manning has sold your horse ajax and he is to be taken away tonight i thought you ought to know it and that is why i take my pen in hand to write there was more but this is all that was important franks face flushed with anger he immediately went in search of mark who he felt assured knew of the sale it may be said here that ajax was one of franks dearest trophies a gift from his mother chapter viii a new plan mark was in his room where frank found him trying on a new necktie though decidedly plain mark fancied himself very goodlooking and spent no little time on personal adornment in particular he had a weakness for new neckties in which he indulged himself freely when the boys came to the academy the principal proposed that they should room together but both objected and mark had a room to himself no one caring to room with him take a seat frank said mark condescendingly is there anything i can do for you yes answered frank i hear your father has sold ajax or is intending to do so will you tell me if it is true i believe it is answered mark indifferently and what right has he to sell my horse demanded frank indignantly youd better ask him said mark with provoking coolness it is an outrage said frank indignantly as to that said his stepbrother you cant expect father to be at the expense of feeding your horse with my money the money is legally his replied mark do you know to whom your father has sold ajax to col vincent i believe i am glad at any rate that he will have a good master frank felt that there would be no advantage in prolonging the interview or carrying on further a war of words he sought out his friend herbert and communicated to him this last infraction of his rights it is too bad frank said his sympathizing friend yes it is said frank gravely but i fear it is only the beginning of annoyances i dont believe i can ever live in any place with mr manning or mark will it be necessary i suppose so i have no money as you know all has gone to him herbert i tell you frankly i envy you and your position though my father is a poor man yes for at any rate you have a peaceful home and a father and mother who love you i have a stepfather who will do all he can to make me miserable would you be willing to work for your own support frank yes far rather than remain a dependent on mr manning suppose you should run away suggested herbert frank shook his head i wouldnt do that except in case of extreme necessity i know that if my mother knows what goes on here it would grieve her for me to take such a step suppose your stepfather should consent to your leaving home then i would do so gladly i am willing to work and i think i could make a living in some way why not ask him franks face brightened thank you for the hint herbert he said i will think of it and i may act upon it frank was naturally selfreliant and energetic he was not disposed to shrink from the duties of life but was ready to go forth to meet them the idea which herbert had suggested commended itself to him the more he thought of it in spite therefore of the news which he had received about ajax he resumed his cheerfulness considerably to the surprise of mark whose natural suspicion led him to conjecture that frank had some plan in view to circumvent his father if he has hed better give it up reflected mark the old mans as sly as a fox a raw boy like frank cant get the better of him at the close of the week both the boys went home they were on board the same train and the same car but did not sit together when they reached the house mr manning was not at home frank went out to the stable at once to see richard green the coachman he found him indeed but he also found another man a stranger who appeared to be employed in the stable who is this richard asked frank my successor answered the coachman are you going to leave asked frank hastily come out with me mr frank and i will tell you said richard ive had notice to leave he said and so has deborah it came last evening mr manning got a letter from bridgeville i know that because i brought it home from the post office which appeared to make him angry he called deborah and me and told us that he should not need our services any longer did he give you any reason yes he said that he could have our places filled for a good deal less money and he had no doubt we could do as well elsewhere he has filled your place pretty soon yes this man came this morning i think mr manning had sent for him already i told you the other day we should soon be discharged i know it but i can tell you what has hastened it what then mark wrote his father that i had learned about the sale of ajax and that the information came from you or deborah i think it likely mr frank for the old gentleman seemed mighty cool i hope you wont take it too much to heart that ajax is sold i am not sure but i am glad of it said frank the coachman looked at him in surprise i thought you would be very angry he said so i was at first but he has been sold to a man who will treat him well and i shall be glad to think of that when im away from home you dont mean to run away mr frank no but i mean to get my stepfathers permission to go if i can where do you mean to go mr frank somewhere where i can earn my living without depending upon anybody you know very well richard how miserable i should be to stay here in dependence upon mr manning but to think that you to whom the property rightfully belongs should go away and work for a living while that man and his boy occupy your place i cant bear to think of it i have done a good deal of thinking within a few days and i dont shrink from the prospect i think i should rather enjoy being actively employed but you were to go to college mr frank i know it richard but i am not sure whether it would be for the best my tastes are for an active business life and i dont care for a profession do you think your stepfather will give you a start in the way of money yes i dont know if he wont i have still fifty dollars in the savings bank which i have saved from my pocket money i will take that mr frank will you promise not to be offended at what im going to say i dont think you would say anything that ought to offend me richard then i want you to take the money that comes to me by the will mr manning is to pay it to me on monday i dont need it and you may frank shook his head you are very kind richard but i will get along with fifty dollars unless mr manning supplies me with more if i really need money at any time i will think of your offer thats something at any rate said richard partly reconciled you wont forget it now mr frank no richard i promise you frank left the stable and went thoughtfully into the house chapter ix the new owner of ajax frank and mark took supper alone mr manning having left word that he would not return till later in the evening after supper frank decided to go over to call upon col vincent the new owner of ajax his estate was distant about threequarters of a mile from the cedars as frank started mark inquired where are you going frank to see ajax answered our hero do you mean to make any fuss about him i wouldnt advise you to thank you for your advice i wonder what he is going to do thought mark of course he cant do anything now he did not venture to propose to accompany frank knowing that his company would not be acceptable is col vincent at home asked frank at the door of a handsome house yes mr courtney replied the colored servant pleasantly for frank was a favorite among all classes in the neighborhood come right in sir de colonel am smoking a cigar on de back piazza frank followed the servant through the hall which intersected the house and stepped out on the back piazza a stout elderly gentleman was taking his ease in a large rustic rocking chair goodevening col vincent our hero said goodevening frank my boy said the colonel heartily glad to see you havent you gone back to school yes sir but i came home to spend sunday it doesnt seem much like home now he added as his lip quivered you have suffered a great loss my dear boy said the colonel feelingly the greatest sir my mother was all i had i suppose mr manning will keep up the establishment i suppose so sir but it is no longer home to me dont take it too hard frank i was sorry about the will so was i sir because it makes me dependent on a man whom i dislike dont be too prejudiced frank i never took any fancy to your stepfather myself but then we dont need to like everybody we associate with i hear you have bought my horse col vincent said frank desiring to change the subject was ajax your horse yes it was given to me as a birthday present by my mother i had some such idea and expressly asked mr manning whether the horse was not yours what did he answer that it was only nominally yours and that he thought it best to sell it as both you and mark were absent at school and had no time to use it i am not surprised at anything mr manning may say said frank its too bad ill tell you what i will do frank i havent paid for the horse yet i will return it to mr manning and tell him that i bought it under a misapprehension of the ownership i dont think he will make any fuss i would rather have you keep it sir you would exclaimed the colonel in surprise yes sir if you should return ajax mr manning would sell him to some one else and you i know will treat him well but you will lose the use of him no you wont though come over to my stable when you like and if he is not in use you can take him out thank you sir you are very kind while i am in the neighborhood i wont forget your kind offer but i mean to go away you mean to go away where out into the world anywhere where i can find work and make a living but surely this is not necessary your stepfather will provide for you without your working i have no reason to doubt it col vincent but i shall be happier in the world outside of course you will let mr manning know of your intention to leave home i shall ask his permission to go at the end of my school term that comes in a couple of weeks where will you go a cousin of my father is at newark new jersey i think i shall go to him first and ask his advice about getting a place either there or in new york you will need some money to start with do you think mr manning will give you any i dont know sir that wont prevent my going i have fifty dollars in a savings bank saved up from my allowance and that will be all i shall need if you have any difficulty on that score frank remember that i was your fathers friend and mean to be yours apply to me at any time when you are in a strait i will sir and thank you heartily that was a strange will frank i dont want to put any ideas into your head to disturb you but had your mother ever led you to suspect that she intended to leave you dependent on your stepfather never sir dont you think she would have done so had she had such a plan in view i do said frank quickly the colonels eye met his and each knew what the other suspected there is nothing for me to do at present sir said frank if mr manning does not interfere with my plans i shall not trouble him i will hint as much when i see him it may clear the way for you i wish you would sir come and see me again frank said the colonel as frank rose to go i certainly will sir your fathers son will always be welcome at my house when did you say your school term closes in a fortnight i will see your stepfather within a few days by the way frank wouldnt you like a gallop on ajax tonight yes sir i should enjoy it come out to the stable with me then ajax whinnied with delight when he saw his old or rather his young master and evinced satisfaction when frank stroked him caressingly sam said col vincent frank is to ride ajax whenever he pleases saddle him for his use whenever he asks you that i will sir answered sam often and often ive seen mr frank on his back doesnt he ride well though dont flatter me sam said frank laughing five minutes later he was on the back of his favorite horse galloping down the road i hope i shall meet mark thought frank i would like to give him a sensation considering the manner in which mark had treated his stepbrother frank may be excused for the wish to puzzle him a little finding himself lonely mark decided to take a walk not long after franks departure he was sauntering along the road when he heard the sound of hoofs and to his surprise saw his stepbrother on the back of ajax his first thought was that frank had gone to col vincents stable and brought away ajax without permission in defiance of mr mannings will he resolved to take him to task for it immediately frank purposely slackened the speed of his horse in order to give mark the chance he sought why are you riding ajax asked mark it is a pleasant evening answered frank and i thought i should enjoy it where did you get him from col vincents stable where he never ought to have been carried answered frank with spirit you seem to think you can do anything you like frank courtney said mark provoked deciding that his suspicions were well founded is there any particular reason why i should not ride ajax demanded frank you have made yourself liable to arrest for horse stealing said mark it would serve you right if col vincent should have you arrested and tried i dont think he will gratify your kind wishes mark just wait and see what my father has to say to you i have only done what i had a perfect right to do but i cant stop to dispute with you i must finish my ride hey ajax as he spoke the horse dashed into a gallop and mark was left looking after him in a disturbed frame of mind ill tell my father as soon as he gets home he decided and he kept his word in consequence frank by that time returned was summoned into mr mannings presence what is this i hear he began did you ride ajax this evening yes sir where did you find him in col vincents stable this is a highhanded proceeding frank courtney have you any excuse to offer none is needed sir col vincent has given me permission to ride him whenever i please it appears to me mark said mr manning sharply that you have made a fool of yourself how should i know replied mark mortified by the collapse of his sensation frank didnt tell me he had leave to use the horse and he left the room looking foolish chapter x mark yields to temptation there are some boys as well as men who cannot stand prosperity it appeared that mark manning was one of these while his stepmother was living and his fathers prospects and consequently his own were uncertain he had been circumspect in his behavior and indulged in nothing that could be considered seriously wrong when his father came into possession of a large fortune and his pocket money was doubled mark began to throw off some of the restraint which from motives of prudence he had put upon himself about the middle of the week as frank was taking a walk after school hours he was considerably surprised to see mark come out of a wellknown liquor saloon frequented by men and boys of intemperate habits the students of bridgeville academy were strictly forbidden this or any other saloon and i am sure that my boy readers will agree with mo that this rule was a very proper one mark manning appeared to have been drinking his face was flushed and his breath if one came near enough to him was redolent of the fumes of alcohol with him was james carson one of the poorest scholars and most unprincipled boys in the academy it was rather surprising that he had managed for so long to retain his position in the institution but he was crafty and took good care not to be caught to go back a little it was chiefly owing to james carsons influence that mark had entered the saloon when he learned that marks worldly prospects had improved and that he had a large supply of pocket money he determined to cultivate his acquaintance though privately he thought mark a disagreeable boy with the intention of obtaining for himself a portion of marks surplus means at the first of the term he had made similar advances to frank but they were coldly received so much so that he did not think it worth while to persevere in courting our heros intimacy he succeeded better with mark his crafty nature teaching him how to approach him mark he said with a great show of cordiality i am delighted to hear of your good fortune i always liked you and i think you deserve to be rich thank you said mark much gratified for he liked flattery i am sure i am very much obliged to you oh not at all i only say what i think shall i tell you why i am particularly glad yes if you like returned mark in some curiosity because i like you better than that young muff your stepbrother i hope you wont be offended at my plain speaking he added artfully certainly not said mark i suppose said james you will see a little life now that you are your own master and have plenty of money i dont know exactly what you mean james there isnt much life to be seen in bridgeville that is true but still there is some suppose now by this time they were in front of the saloon which besides a bar contained a billiard and pool table suppose now we go in and have a game of billiards its against the rules isnt it asked mark what do you care for the rules said james contemptuously if the old man hears of it we shall get into hot water by the old man mark meant the rev dr brush the venerable and respected principal of the bridgeville academy but such boys as he have very little respect for the constituted authorities why need he know it we will slip in when no one is looking did you ever play a game of billiards i never played over half a dozen games in my life yon ought to know how to play it is a splendid game come in mark did not make very strong opposition and the two boys first looking cautiously in different directions entered the saloon toward the entrance was a bar and in the roar of the saloon were two tables wont you have a drink mark asked james mark hesitated oh come now it wont hurt two glasses of whisky john all right mr carson said the barkeeper to whom james was well known james tossed off his glass with the air of an old drinker but mark drank his more slowly there i know you feel better mark now john give me the balls well play a game of billiards all right sir ill discount you mark said james to give you a fair chance it is about the same thing as giving you half the game or if you like i will give you seventeen points to start with and then you will only have seventeen to make while i am making thirtyfour i like that best now shall we play for the drinks we have just had a drink well have another wont that be too much i dont want to get drunk two drinks wont do you any harm very well now let us string for the lead there is no need of describing the game in detail mark was only a novice while james could really make three or four points to his one he restrained himself however so that he only beat mark by two points you did splendidly mark he said considering how little you have played you did remarkably well why you made a run of three yes i did pretty well said mark flattered by his companions praises i had hard work to beat you i can tell you that as it was you came within two points of beating dont you like the game very much i thought you would shall we have another game i dont mind answered mark he knew that he ought to be in his room writing a composition to be delivered the next day but such obligations sat easily upon mark and he did not hesitate long that time james allowed him to score sixteen so that mark was only beaten by one point you see you are improving said james i played a better game that time than before and still you came within one of beating me i think i shall become a good player in time said mark complacently yes and in a very short time now said james i have a proposal to make to you what is it well bet twentyfive cents on the next game to give a little interest to it mark had no special scruples against betting which is only one form of gambling but he decidedly objected to losing money so he answered cautiously i dont know about that you beat me both of the other games thats true but you play better now than you did at first that may be so what are twentyfive cents anyway i expect to lose it but it will increase the interest of the game so mark was persuaded and the game was played james carson managed to let mark beat him by five shots and the latter was correspondingly elated you beat me after all said james pretending to be much disappointed and by five points ill tell you what ill do ill give you the same odds and bet a dollar on the game i suppose its foolish but ill risk it done said mark eagerly his cupidity was excited and he felt sure of winning the dollar as he had the twentyfive cents but james had no idea of playing off now and he played a better game as he was well able to do the result was that mark was beaten by three points he looked quite crestfallen i had better shows than you said james i couldnt do it once in five times will you play again mark agreed to it with some hesitation and he was again beaten you had luck against you another day you will succeed better have you played enough yes answered mark annoyed he had four games to pay for and two dollars in bets and it made rather an expensive afternoon have another drink ill treat said james who could afford to be liberal mark accepted and then flushed and excited he left the saloon just as frank came up as described in the first part of the chapter on the whole he was sorry to meet his stepbrother just at this time frank stopped and his attention was drawn to marks flushed face chapter xi mark gets into trouble mark nodded slightly and was about to pass without a word when frank said quietly i am sorry to see you coming out of such a place mark what is it to you anyway returned mark rudely not much perhaps replied frank calmly but i dont like to see my acquaintances coming out of a liquor saloon it wont hurt you said mark irritably no it wont hurt me but if tho principal should hear of it it would not be pleasant for you you know students are strictly forbidden to enter any saloon i suppose you mean to tell on me said mark hastily and not altogether without uneasiness you are mistaken i am not a talebearer then there is no need to say any more about it come along james franks interference was well meant but as we shall see it did harm rather than good as mark left the saloon he had half decided not to enter it again he was three dollars out of pocket and this did not suit him at all in fact mark was rather a mean boy and it was with considerable reluctance that he had handed over to his companion the two dollars with which to pay for the games moreover he was mortified at losing the two games of billiards when so great odds had been given him james carson was no scholar but he was sharp enough to perceive the state of marks feelings and he also saw how he was affected by franks remonstrance he decided to take advantage of this and strengthen his hold on mark well mark he said i suppose youll give up playing billiards now why should i because your stepbrother doesnt approve of it you wont dare to go into the saloon after he has forbidden you he continued with a sneer what do you mean james do you suppose i care that snapping his fingers for what frank says or even thinks either i didnt know but you might stand in fear of him do you mean to insult me demanded mark hotly insult you my dear friend what can you be thinking of why i like you ten times as much as that muff frank courtney then what did you mean by what you said asked mark more calmly i will tell you i got an idea from what frank said once that he was in charge of you well not exactly that but he looked after you this was a wicked falsehood as frank had never intimated any such thing in fact he had generally kept quite aloof from james mark however fell into the trail and never thought of doubting what his companion said if frank said that ive a great mind to whip him said mark angrily oh i wouldnt notice him if i were you said james for my part i didnt believe what he said i felt sure that a fine spirited boy like you wouldnt submit to his dictation i should say not the impudent follow when he spoke to you just now continued james one would really have thought he was your uncle or guardian and that you were a little boy ill show him what i think of him and his advice i hadnt thought of going to the saloon tomorrow but now i will bravo i like your spirit said james admiringly it is just the way to treat him shall i come round with you about the same hour as today yes i wish you would when the two boys parted company james carson smiled to himself what a fool mark is he thought he thinks he is his own master but i am going to twist him round my little finger hes a sweet youth but hes got money and i mean to have some of it why he tells me his father allows him eight dollars a week for spending money if i manage well i can get more than half away from his in bets the next day james called for mark as agreed upon and again the two boys went to the billiard saloon the performance of the day before was repeated james carson while flattering marks poor play managed to beat in every game but one on which money was staked and came out the richer by a dollar and a half i am very unlucky grumbled mark in a tone of dissatisfaction so you were mark admitted his sympathizing friend you made some capital shots though and if i hadnt been so lucky you would have come out the victor in every game but i didnt no you didnt but you cant have such beastly luck all the time i guess id better give up billiards in two days i have spent five dollars it doesnt pay no doubt frank will be gratified when he hears that you have given up playing he will think it is because you are afraid of him james had touched the right chord and poor mark was once more in his toils its lucky for me that frank spoke to him thought james it makes it much easier for me to manage him one thing however james had not taken into account there were others besides frank who were liable to interfere with his management and who had the authority to make their interference effectual on the day succeeding as james and mark were in the campus herbert grant approached them now herbert was the janitor of the academy he also was employed by the principal to summon students who had incurred censure to his study where they received a suitable reprimand it was not a pleasant duty but some one must do it and herbert always discharged it in a gentlemanly manner which could not or ought not to offend the schoolfellows who were unlucky enough to receive a summons boys said he i am sorry to be the bearer of unpleasant news but dr brush would like to see you in his study both of us asked james yes are there any others summoned no mark and his companion looked at each other with perturbed glances no one cared to visit the principal on such an errand corporal punishment was never resorted to in the bridgeville academy but the doctors dignified rebuke was dreaded more than blows would have been from some men what do you think it is james asked mark uneasily i think its the saloon answered james in a low voice but how could he have found it out no one saw us go in or come out the billiard saloon was at some distance from the academy building and for that reason the two boys had felt more secure in visiting it ill tell you how it came out said james suddenly how asked mark you remember frank saw us coming out day before yesterday he said he wouldnt tell it was not very difficult for mark to believe anything against frank and he instantly adopted his companions idea the mean sneak he said ill come up with him ill tell my father not to give him any money for the next month ill ill get him to apprentice frank to a shoemaker perhaps then he wont put on so many airs good for you i admire your pluck said james slapping mark on the back you are true grit you are just teach the fellow a lesson see if i dont mark nodded his head resolutely and went into the presence of dr brush thirsting for vengeance against his stepbrother who he felt persuaded had informed against him if frank had known his suspicions he would have been very much surprised as it happened however he did not even know that his stepbrother had been summoned to the doctors study had he met herbert the later would have told him but after receiving his list it so chanced that he and his friend did not meet the fact was that a young man employed as tutor in mathematics in the academy while taking an afternoon walk had seen mark and james carson leaving the liquor saloon and as in duty bound had reported the same to the principal mr triangle however had not been observed by either of the two boys and therefore they were led off on a false scent what do you think the old man will say asked mark uneasily as they ascended the stairs to the principals study hell give us a raking down i suppose said james he will come down heavy on us i wish i were out of it oh its not worth minding we havent committed murder have we whats the harm in a game of billiards not much perhaps but the drinking and betting are certainly objectionable the boys knocked at the door and the full deep voice of dr brush was heard to say come in chapter xii suspended dr brush was seated at a table covered with papers in a large armchair he was an elderly man of dignified presence not a petty tyrant such as is sometimes found in a similar position but a man who commanded respect without an effort mark manning and james carson entered his presence a little nervously young gentlemen said the doctor gravely i am informed that you have violated one of the rules of the academy by frequenting a billiard saloon where liquor is sold who told you sir asked mark that is not to the purpose said the principal gravely but i should like to know who informed on me persisted mark whoever did so acted as your true friend manning but there is no occasion for you to know who it was is it true mark would have been glad to deny the charge and would not have felt any scruples about doing so if it would have done any good but it was clear even to him that he would not be believed and that denial would only make his position worse so he made a virtue of necessity and answered i have been in once or twice sir exactly how many times have you been to the saloon three times what did you do there we played billiards did you order anything at the bar yes sir said mark reluctantly carson you accompanied manning did you not said dr brush turning to marks companion yes sir and i suppose you also played billiards and drank well yes sir i believe i did you were aware were you not that it was against the regulations of the school i suppose it must have slipped my mind answered james trying to look as innocent as possible dr brush frowned for he saw clearly that this was but a subterfuge if this were true he continued it would be no excuse as students it is your duty to make yourselves acquainted with the rules that govern the institution in point of fact i cannot believe that either of you is ignorant of the rule forbidding students to frequent places where liquor is sold it is hardly necessary for me to defend the propriety of this rule intemperance is a fruitful source of vice and crime and i cannot allow the youth under by charge to form habits of indulgence which may blast all their prospects and lead to the most ruinous consequences we didnt drink much said mark i shall not inquire how much you drank in drinking a single glass you violated the rule of the school and i cannot pass over it what is he going to do with us i wonder thought mark he was not required to wonder long as this is your first offense so far as i know proceeded the principal i will not be severe you are both suspended from the institution for the remainder of the term and are required to leave bridgeville by the early train tomorrow morning for your respective homes i shall write to your parents explaining the cause of your suspension but a week remained of the term and the punishment was mild but both boys were mortified and left the study crestfallen mark was the first to recover his spirits it is not so bad james he said tomorrow will be saturday and i should go home anyway i dont mind staying at home next week what will your father say oh ill make it all right with him i dont mind much what he says i guess he got into scrapes himself when he was a boy my father isnt so easily managed just as likely as not hell cut off my allowance for a month and thatll be no joke my father wont do that said mark if he did i would raise a fuss would that do any good ill bet it would frank who was quite ignorant of marks trouble was surprised when the latter approached him a little later with a frown and said harshly you wont make anything by what you have done frank courtney will you be kind enough to tell me what i have done asked frank calmly youve been to dr brush and told him about our playing billiards you are entirely mistaken mark i did not suppose he knew it must have been you he told us some one had informed him and you were the only one who knew its a mean trick isnt it carson awfully mean i have already told you that the information did not come from me it may be the best thing for you that it has been found out for it was doing you no good to frequent such places i dont want to hear any of your preaching frank courtney i guess i can manage my own affairs without any advice from you i dont care to intrude any advice said frank i have not much reason to feel interested in you youd better look out how you treat me though said mark insolently i know very well you dislike me but it wont be safe for you to show it while you are a dependent on my father i dont propose to be a dependent on him long said frank quietly the truth of it is you and your father are dependent upon property which of right belongs to me the time may come when i shall be able to show this what does he mean thought mark uneasily will he contest the will it was perhaps an evidence of marks shrewdness that he had some doubts about the validity of the will under which his father inherited chapter xiii mr mannings new plan mark so represented his school difficulty to his father that he incurred but slight censure indeed mr manning was so absorbed in plans for getting the greatest enjoyment out of the estate of which he had obtained possession by doubtful means that he didnt care to be disturbed about such a trifle as his sons suspension he felt more disposed to blame frank whom mark charged with betraying him what does frank say about it asked mr manning of course he denies it said mark but it cant be any one else he is acting very unwisely said mr manning compressing his thin lips so i told him but he said he didnt mean to be a dependent on you long how is he going to avoid it i dont know i have had some intimation from col vincent who appears to be in his confidence he wants to leave us to go away yes but you wont let him i have been thinking about that mark and i may give my permission the fact is he stands in the way of some plans i have formed i am thinking of traveling not without me said mark hastily no you shall go with me but i dont care to take frank you might leave him at school i might but how do i know that he might not hatch some mischief while we are gone he might make some fuss about the property suggested mark has he hinted anything of that kind to you asked his father quickly yes only yesterday he said that the property belonged by right to him mr manning looked thoughtful and watched mark narrowly to see if from his manner he could divine the boys intentions later that same evening mark having retired early in consequence of a headache frank found himself alone with his stepfather and took advantage of the opportunity to speak of the plan he had formed mr manning he said if you are at leisure i should like to speak with you a few minutes proceed said his stepfather waving his hand but a week remains of the school term did you propose that i should return there at the end of the vacation humph i had not thought much on the subject it has all along been intended that i should go to college when prepared but i dont think i care much about it in that case said his stepfather with alacrity you would only be throwing away time and money by going he was quite ready to agree to franks surrender of the college plan for two reasons a college course would be expensive again should he turn his attention to the law he might hereafter give him trouble about the estate i dont think i should throw away my time for if i went to college i should go there to work faithfully but i have a fancy for a more stirring life it might be a good plan for you to learn a trade said mr manning reflectively learn a trade exclaimed frank in surprise yes it would always enable you to earn a living do you intend mark to learn a trade asked frank quickly no his case is very different from yours why it is different it is not necessary for me to explain answered his stepfather stiffly if there were any need of it mr manning i would not object to learn a trade said frank i have no false pride on the subject but my tastes are more for mercantile business i may be able to find you a place somewhere i have a friend in the drygoods business who would receive you at my recommendation thank you said frank hastily but if you will allow me i would prefer to look around for myself what is it you want then your permission to go out into the world and try to make a living and if you dont said mr manning i suppose you expect me to defray your expenses if i did have such an expectation i think i should be justified in view of the large property which my mother left said frank pointedly she left it to me said his stepfather so it appears at any rate but i shall not call upon you to pay my board give me your permission to go where i please with a small sum of money to start me and i shall be satisfied and what will the world say that i your stepfather to whom you have a right to look for maintenance had driven you out to earn your living it would be unjust of course but the world is ever unjust and mr manning assumed a look of wronged innocence which would have imposed on anyone who knew him but slightly i shall defend you from any such charge said frank i shall say that you were only yielding to my request i will think of it my dear boy said mr manning graciously i already feel inclined to grant it because it is your request i shall be sorry to be separated from you but i am willing to sacrifice my own feelings if it will give you pleasure this did not impose upon frank who had a correct idea of the degree of fondness which mr manning had for his society but he was too well satisfied with the prospect of obtaining the permission he desired to imply any doubts again continued his stepfather whatever you may say to the contrary i know that the world will censure me but i shall have the approval of my own conscience and with that i can defy the world mr manning certainly did look like a righteous man when he said this and he beamed upon his stepson with a glance that was actually affectionate go back to school ho said and when you return i shall be able to give you a definite answer indeed nothing could have suited mr mannings plans better he would get rid of the care and nearly the whole expense of his obnoxious stepson while with his son mark he would be spending the revenues of the estate which belonged to frank during the coming week he arranged his plans for a prolonged absence from the cedars he wrote to new york to engage passage on a steamer bound for liverpool and quietly waited for the end of franks school term to release him from a care which had grown burdensome frank returned to the bridgeville academy without mark as may be supported however he did not feel the loss of his society he at once communicated to his chosen friend herbert grant his probable departure from school i am sorry to hear it frank said herbert soberly do you think you are acting wisely i am not acting as i would have done had my mother lived answered frank but you must remember that my position in life has very much changed i am a poor boy hardly that when there is so much property in the family i know mr manning too well to believe that i shall derive much benefit from it no herbert i have my own living to make and i want to make it in my own way it is a sad change for you frank no i cant say that i dont know how it is herbert but i am rather glad to have all this thrown upon me i enjoy feeling that i have got to work i have a chance of enjoying the same feelings said herbert with a smile i wish we could start together herbert couldnt you go with me herbert shook his head father has a plan for me he said i am to learn his trade and shall commence next week i dont particularly like it but it is well to have a trade to fall back upon mr manning wanted me to learn a trade there is no occasion for your doing so i dont know about that if i had a particular fancy for any i wouldnt mind choosing it but i am better suited for something else what is your plan what will you do first my father has a cousin in the city of newark new jersey only a few miles from new york four years ago he and his family made us a visit and he was urgent then that we should return the visit i will first of all go to him and ask his advice he is a business man and he may be able to put me in the way of obtaining a position i think you will succeed frank but it will be harder than you think for you dont know what poverty is yet i have never known anything else if i do succeed herbert i may be able to find something for you i wish you might herbert replied but he was not as sanguine as frank he understood better than his friend that for a boy to set out alone into the great world to earn a living is a serious undertaking chapter xiv goodbye frank had fixed upon the tuesday morning succeeding the close of the academic term for his departure from home monday was devoted to a few necessary preparations and a few calls on old friends among them col vincent the owner of ajax my dear frank said the colonel kindly i feel a strong interest in your welfare more especially because of the wrong which i do not scruple to say has been done you what does mr manning say to your plan he makes no objection said frank suppose he had done so i would not have run away he is my stepfather and guardian and i would have endured staying at home as well as i could there you are right frank though i have a poor opinion of mr manning he is not likely to treat you in a manner to justify your going away without his permission from what i have heard within the last week i suspect that he feels relieved to have you go what have you heard sir that mr manning will shortly sail for europe taking mark with him frank was surprised having no suspicion of this now are you not sorry that you have decided to go out into the world to earn a living when you might have seen something of the old world mr manning would never have taken me along answered frank quietly nor should i have enjoyed traveling with him and mark of the two who would interfere the more with your enjoyment mark then you prefer the father to the son said the colonel the father has much more agreeable manners i dont think mark could be agreeable if he tried col vincent smiled perhaps you are right frank he said now as your fathers old friend i shall exact a promise from you what is it sir you are going out into the world to earn your own living boys of your age are apt to think it an easy thing i have seen more of life and i am sure you will find it more difficult than you suppose you may find yourself in difficulty possibly in want in that case promise to let me know and i will come to your assistance i will sir answered frank the time came for frank to say goodbye to mr manning and mark and the house which had been his home from infancy his stepfather handed him a small pocketbook frank he said in this pocketbook you will find twentyfive dollars it is not much but i am satisfied sir said frank it wont be long before i am earning something i hope your anticipations may be realized but it is possible that you may require help i think not sir i will authorize my banker to pay you the same sum twentyfive dollars every three months of course it is not enough to support you but as you say it is your intention to procure a place yes sir it will probably be enough to make up any deficiency that may exist in your income i am aware that you do not regard me as as i would like to have you but i am resigned to be misunderstood and i merely call your attention to the fact that i have given you my free permission to carry out your own plans and have given you more assistance than you asked for thats true sir should anyone in your hearing condemn me for what i have done i depend upon your defending me i will state the facts sir i will take the entire responsibility for anything that may result from the step i have taken mr manning looked well pleased things were taking the course he desired and for the paltry sum of one hundred dollars a year he was getting rid of an obnoxious stepson while appearing to confer a favor upon him perhaps you are right frank said his stepfather disguising the satisfaction he felt if however you should find that you have made a mistake you will do me the justice to remember that i gave you your choice knowing as he did that the offer was not genuine frank remained silent he could not make up his mind to express gratitude and therefore said nothing here the carriage drove up to the door to convey frank to the railway station mindful of appearance mr manning accompanied him to the cars and in presence of several neighbors bade him an effusively affectionate farewell so frank was fairly started on his campaign chapter xv erastus tarbox of newark erastus tarbox kept a drygoods store in the city of newark new jersey he was well to do not so much because of his enterprise and skill as a merchant as because of his extreme poverty some people called it parsimony he only employed two clerks to assist him in his store and they as well as the boy who carried out parcels and ran the errands were paid scarcely more than twothirds the rates paid in neighboring stores mr tarbox prided himself upon his relationship to the courtneys they were rich and riches in his eyes were a great merit he often sighed to think that there was no chance for him to benefit by a share of the large property owned by his cousins without hope of personal advantage however he had always been obsequious to them and often took occasion to mention them by way of enhancing his own social credit somewhat mr tarbox had heard of mrs courtneys death but had not heard the particulars of the will he took it for granted that frank was sole heir and it did cross his mind more than once how very agreeable it would be if he could be selected as guardian of the rich young heir of course he knew that there was no probability of it since the stepfather would undoubtedly be appointed to that position mr tarbox had just sold a calico dress pattern to a poor woman when his attention was drawn to the entrance of frank courtney who entered his store valise in hand mr tarbox was rather shortsighted and did not immediately recognize the son of his rich cousin what can i do for you young man he asked in his business tone this is mr tarbox i believe said frank who did not know his relatives very well yes that is my name i am frank courtney bless my soul ejaculated mr tarbox surprised and delighted when did you arrive in newark i have only just arrived i do hope you are going to make us a visit said mr tarbox cordially thank you answered frank cheered by this warm reception if you are sure it wont inconvenience you inconvenience me we shall be delighted to have you with us you must come up and see mrs tarbox she will be delighted to see you mr tarbox lived over his store there was a door from the street adjoining the shop front mr tarbox opened it with a passkey and conducted frank upstairs ushering him into a gloomy parlor with stiff straightbacked chairs ranged at regular intervals along the sides of the room and a marbletopped center table with two or three books lying upon it there was a framed engraving representing washington crossing the delaware over the mantel and two plaster figures and similar ornaments on the mantelpiece the whole aspect of the room chilled frank wait here and i will call my wife said mr tarbox frank sat down on a hard sofa and awaited the entrance of mrs tarbox she came in a tall thin woman about as handsome for a woman as her husband was for a man indeed they were very well matched she was quite as mean as he and between them they managed to make annually a sensible addition to their world possessions mr tarbox privately hinted his hopes respecting frank to his wife and she instantly agreed that it would be a most eligible arrangement we must make him contented my dear said her husband give him the best bedroom and i think it might be well to have something a little extra for supper i did intend to put on the rest of that cold mutton said mrs tarbox doubtfully it wont do martha there is only a little of it you know and the boy has been traveling and of course is hungry what do you say now to some nice beefsteak beefsteak is high now said mrs tarbox still if we buy round steak that is cheaper than sirloin or tenderloin and quite as good said her economical partner we can tell frank however that no sirloin was to be had so late in the day at the markets mrs tarbox nodded her head approving the suggestion this little matter being adjusted the husband and wife entered the parlor where our hero was waiting patiently this is our young cousin martha said mr tarbox smiling pleasantly welcome to newark said mrs tarbox extending her hand and how did you leave your stepfather he is well said prank coolly the two exchanged glances it was clear that frank did not like his stepfather and this was satisfactory to them there was the more chance of his leaving him and boarding with them the children will be so glad to see you said mr tarbox wont they martha delighted assured the lady pliny must be about your age how old are you by the way sixteen just plinys age do you remember him frank remembered a tall thin stripling who had accompanied his parents to the cedars and who appeared to have an inexhaustible appetite yes i remember him does he go to school no pliny is in a store answered mr tarbox your store oh no i thought it would be better for him to enter the employ of a stranger he is in a bookstore there was one great advantage in plinys entering the employ of a stranger he was paid four dollars a week whereas mr tarbox paid his boy but two here then was a clear gain of two dollars a week but you must be tired said mrs tarbox you will see the children at supper martha i think frank would like to go to his room the best bedroom was over the parlor it was rather more cheerful because lighter here said mr tarbox you must make yourself at home martha isnt one of the drawers in that bureau empty i thought so take your clothes out of the valise and put them away now is there anything you would like only a little water to wash in said frank you are both very kind we hope to make you comfortable you are our relative you know the water was brought up by mrs tarbox herself and frank was left alone on the whole well pleased with his reception chapter xvi an unpleasant discovery it never occurred to frank that his cordial reception was wholly due to his supposed wealth had he known the tarbox family better he would have had no uncertainty on this point as it was the discovery was soon made all my olive branches are for you my dear young cousin said mr tarbox waving his hand a peaceful happy family children this is our esteemed relative frank courtney you remember visiting his delightful home the cedars yes pa said julia pliny said nothing but stared at frank inwardly considering whether it would be possible to borrow some money of him i am glad to meet you all i hope we shall become better acquainted said frank politely no doubt you will said mr tarbox they are rather bashful but they long to know you how are you said pliny in a sudden burst of sociability pretty well thank you answered frank finding it rather difficult to preserve his gravity i am in a store said pliny in your fathers store no he wouldnt pay me as much as i get where i am mr tarbox looked embarrassed a smaller boy answered my purpose he said in an explanatory manner pliny is suited for higher duties but our supper is ready it is frugal compared with yours at the cedars my dear frank but you are heartily welcome to it it looks very nice mr tarbox said our hero and i have not been accustomed to luxurious living this answer pleased mr and mrs tarbox even if frank should become a boarder on liberal terms they didnt wish to spend too much on their table we couldnt get sirloin steak said mr tarbox but i hope you will find this good no doubt i shall said frank politely wont you have another piece of steak asked mrs tarbox frank saw that there was but a small piece left and though his appetite was not wholly satisfied he answered no thank you i will said pliny quickly mrs tarbox frowned at her son but did not venture to refuse in the presence of her guest she cut off a small portion of the steak and with a severe look put it on the extended plate of pliny youve got a good appetite pliny said julia so would you have if you had to work like me grumbled pliny after the steak came an apple pie which was cut into seven pieces mrs tarbox managed to make franks piece a little larger than the rest her husband observed it with approval he was very desirous that frank should be satisfied with his fare when pliny rose from the table saying that he must be getting back to the store frank rose also i will go with you he said if you have no objection i would like to take a walk come along said pliny i should like to have company you will be a great deal of company for pliny observed mr tarbox rubbing his hands with satisfaction just of an age and of congenial tastes frank hardly expected to find pliny very congenial but he wished to obtain some information which he thought the latter could give him and he also wanted to see something of newark i say your name is frank isnt it commenced pliny yes the old mans awful glad to see you i am glad of it he has received me very kindly got up an extra supper for you we dont often get steak for supper this was rather an embarrassing revelation and surprised frank somewhat the supper had not seemed to him at all extra it would do but was far from luxurious i hope youll stay with us a good while continued pliny thank you you see we shall live better while you are with us and the rest of us will be gainers i dont want to put your father to any unusual expense oh he can afford it but hes stingy father is he doesnt spend any more than he can help it is best to be economical i suppose when you dont carry it too far i say frank continued pliny lowering his voice you cant lend me five dollars can you frank regarded pliny with astonishment the proposal was very abrupt especially when the shortness of their acquaintance was considered are you particularly in need of money asked frank well you see said pliny i want it for a particular purpose why not ask your father for it oh hed never let me have it now in franks present circumstances five dollars represented a good deal of money he was the more impressed with the necessity of economy since he had found out how small were the wages paid in stores to boys of his age he did not feel at all inclined to grant plinys request especially as he had a strong suspicion that it would be a long time before the sum would be returned why do you apply to me pliny he asked seriously didnt your mother die and leave you a big property father says you must be worth more than a hundred thousand dollars your father probably has not heard of the will said frank quietly what was there in the will asked pliny the whole property was left to mr manning who is he my stepfather and nothing to you nothing to me but hes got to take care of you hasnt he it was expected but i am going to earn my own living if i can pliny stopped short in blank amazement and whistled then you havent got a lot of money no wont your stepfather give you a part of the property i havent asked him but i dont think he will and why did you come to newark i thought your father might give me some help about getting a place if this isnt the richest joke said pliny laughing uproariously where is the joke i dont see it returned frank inclined to be angry the way you have taken in the old man he thinks you are rich and has treated you accordingly got up an extra supper and all that oh its too good i certainly didnt intend to take him in as you call it said frank the sooner you tell him the better ill tell him said pliny i shall enjoy seeing how provoked hell be i think i will leave you said frank shortly i will take a walk by myself well dont lose your way oh i wish the store was shut i want to tell the old man and pliny laughed again while our hero walked off in disgust chapter xvii the way of the world frank felt like an impostor when he discovered that his cordial reception was wholly owing to the belief that he was his mothers heir the situation was unpleasant and he was impatient to have mr tarbox undeceived he was sure that pliny would lose no time in revealing his true position and decided not to return to the house of mr tarbox till nine oclock when the story would have been told he wandered about aimlessly till he heard the city clocks strike nine and then rang the bell at his relations house the family with the exception of the two younger children were assembled in the common sitting room as frank entered instead of the cordial welcome he had previously received he noticed a look of coldness and constraint on the faces of mr and mrs tarbox while pliny looked as if some stupendous joke was being perpetrated goodevening said frank politely i have been taking a walk my son pliny tells me said mr tarbox that you have not inherited your mothers property frank bowed and that it has gone to your stepfather it seems so i am amazed so was i sir your mother has practically disinherited you it was not my mother sir said frank hastily i cant explain it but im sure she would not will away everything from me do you suspect your stepfather of anything irregular asked mr tarbox briskly i would rather not answer your question sir i dont care to make any charges which i cannot prove and so mr manning has sent you out into the world to earn your own living has he no sir he has consented that i may do so it was my own plan much as frank was prejudiced against his stepfather his natural sense of justice would not allow him to accuse him unjustly did he suggest that you should come to me asked mr tarbox in a tone which frank did not like no sir so that was your idea too continued mr tarbox with a palpable sneer yes sir answered frank you are not a very near relative but the nearest i know of and i supposed you would be willing to give me some advice about the best means of earning my living i remembered he could not help adding that my mother received you all as guests for a considerable time and i thought i might take the liberty oh certainly returned mr tarbox rather abashed i am of course ready to give you advice and my first advice is to seek a lawyer and let him institute a suit against your stepfather on speculation that is he gets nothing if he fails but obtains a commission if he succeeds i could myself recommend a reliable man thank you sir but i have no present thought of contesting the will i think you make a mistake do i understand that you expect to earn your own living i shall try to do so you will find it very difficult you may expect me to take you into my own store but there is no vacancy and frank hastily assured mr tarbox that he had no such expectations he had no wish to deprive the errand boy of the two dollars a week which he probably richly earned situations in newark are not easily obtained proceeded mr tarbox i am willing that you should stay with us a day or two but i dont think you will find it worth your while to stay here mr tarbox feared that his young relative might expect to find a home free of charge in his house and such an arrangement did not suit his economical ideas there was no profit in it but on the contrary a positive loss frank read clearly the thoughts of his host with the help of what pliny had told him and expressing his thanks very briefly announced his intention to go to new york the next morning it may be the best thing you can do said mr tarbox relieved new york opens a much wider field to a boy of enterprise than newark and probably you will pick up something to do it wont be my fault if i dont said frank you have my best wishes said mr tarbox the demands of my family forbid me offering you any pecuniary assistance but i dont stand in need of it sir i have money enough to keep me till i get started in something really i am very glad to hear it and there is no doubt that mr tarbox was sincere i wonder how much money he has got thought pliny perhaps hed lend me two dollars ill ask him if i have a chance pliny proposed to borrow not because he needed the money but because he liked to levy contributions upon any available party with a very faint idea of repaying the same the money would go to swell his deposit at the savings bank it was very commendable of course to save his money but not at the expense of others as pliny too frequently did i have moved you out of the spare room said mrs tarbox when our hero asked permission to retire and put you in the same room with pliny i suppose you wont mind just as you please mrs tarbox said frank though he would have preferred to have passed the night alone could you make it convenient to lend me two dollars asked pliny as they went up to bed together not just now answered frank when i get something to do i shall not need to be so careful of my money one dollar would answer persisted pliny without a word frank drew a dollar bill from his pocketbook and handed it to pliny now he thought i shall not feel under any obligations to the family youre a good fellow even if you are poor said pliny in high good humor frank was tired and it was not long before all his anxieties for future were lost sight of in a sound and refreshing slumber chapter xviii frank arrives in new york the breakfast the next morning was very meager it was no longer an object to gratify franks palate now that he turned out to be a poor relation and the family returned to their usual plain diet so you are resolved to go to new york this morning said mr tarbox of course it would gratify us to have you remain longer but i appreciate your anxiety to go to work frank was by no means deceived by this statement he knew very well that mr tarbox would be relieved by his departure but of this knowledge he made no sign he merely said that he thought it best to go he took leave of his hosts and purchasing a ticket at the railway station found himself within an hour in new york he had been there before but it was not for a long time and he had but a vague general idea of the city frank made inquiries of a kindly man who owned a clean little store on one of the streets the latter knew of places where frank could board and lodge for five dollars a week or about that and directed frank to them they were all near university place he found the place without difficulty a slipshod servant answered the bell have you got any small rooms asked frank yes answered the girl missus is out but ill show you a hall bedroom if you like i should like to see it frank followed the girl upstairs he was not favorably impressed by the appearance of the interior he did not so much mind its being shabby but he was repelled by the evident lack of neatness the girl threw open the door of a small hall bedroom at the head of the stairs but it looked so comfortless that he felt sure he should not like it he thought it best however to inquire the price five dollars a week with board answered the girl i dont think it will suit me said our hero theres a larger room for seven dollars said the servant no i think i will look elsewhere the next house was not much better but the third was much neater and more attractive and frank agreed to take a room at five dollars per week it was a small hall bedroom but it looked clean and the lady who showed him about the house was very neat in her dress when will you come asked the lady now replied frank promptly would you mind paying the first week in advance not at all here is the money and frank drew a fivedollar bill from his portemonnaie thank you said the boardinghouse keeper i have lost so much by boarders going away owing me money that i am obliged to ask gentlemen to pay in advance till i am well acquainted with them that is quite right said frank what is your dinner hour six oclock we have lunch at halfpast twelve for the ladies but if any gentleman happens to be at home at that time he can go in frank looked at his watch it was only eleven oclock and as so much of the day remained he decided as soon as he had unpacked his valise to go downtown and look for a place without delay i shall not be here at lunch today he said you may expect me at dinner there was a small bureau in the room a piece of furniture not often found in hall bedrooms frank deposited the contents of the valise in the bureau drawers and then went downstairs and out into the street chapter xix frank seeks employment in vain it was a bright pleasant day and broadway looked very lively in spite of his being alone in a strange city with uncertain prospects frank felt in good spirits boys of his age usually like excitement and bustle and frank was quick to notice the shifting scenes of the great panorama here are thousands of people he reflected all of whom make a living in some way i dont see why i cant succeed as well as they some of the objects he saw amused him in front of him walked an elderly man with a large placard strapped to his back on which was the advertisement of a great clothing emporium i dont think i should fancy that kind of employment thought our hero as he was looking in at a shop window a boy about his own age hailed him i say johnny whats the price of turnips do you want to buy any asked frank quietly well i might have you got any with you i am sorry i cant supply you said frank coolly up our way we keep our cattle on turnips you aint so green after all said the boy laughing goodnaturedly thank you for the compliment i suppose i look countrylike thought frank but it wont last long i shall get used to city ways close by he saw in a window the sign cash boy wanted frank as not altogether certain about the duties of cash boys nor their rate of compensation but he made up his mind not to lose sight of any chances and accordingly stepped into the store it proved to be a large drygoods store near the entrance he met a tall man with black whiskers do you want any cash boys inquired frank are you inquiring for yourself yes sir you are too large besides you would not be satisfied with the wages how much do you pay sir two dollars a week no i dont think i should like to work for that said frank are those cash boys he asked pointing out some boys of apparently ten to twelve years old who were flitting about from desk to counter yes i see they are much younger than i excuse the trouble i have given you none whatever said the man politely frank left the store and continued his walk down broadway he began to feel a little serious it was evident that the boys did not receive as large compensation for their services as he had supposed the problem promised to be a perplexing one but frank was by no means discouraged in fact if he had been he would hardly have deserved to be the hero of my story though clinton place is not very far uptown it is a considerable walk from this point to the astor house there was so much to see however that frank did not become tired nor was he sensible of the distance he walked a little beyond the astor house and crossing broadway turned down fulton street on the left side of the street his attention was drawn to a restaurant and he was led by the prompting of appetite to enter the prices he found to be reasonable and the tables were already pretty well filled with clerks and business men who were partaking of their midday lunch frank found that a plate of meat with potato and a small supply of bread and butter could be obtained for fifteen cents he afterward found restaurants where the same could be gotten for ten cents but generally there was a deficiency in quality or quantity and there was less neatness in serving the articles seated at the same table with frank were two young men neither probably much over twenty one appeared to be filling a regular clerkship what are you doing now jack he asked of the other i am in the tea business how is that you know the great pekin tea company of course yes well until i can get a place i am selling for them how do you make out i cant tell you for i have only just commenced said his friend how do they pay salary or commission they are to pay me a commission twenty per cent on what i sell that is a good commission yes it is good enough if i can make a fair amount of sales there is a good deal of uncertainty about it of course i would much rather have a place like yours frank listened with interest he wondered whether the great pekin tea company would employ him if so he would have a field for his energy and every inducement to work hard since his pay would depend on the amount of his sales besides as an agent he would occupy a comparatively independent position and frank was ambitious enough to enjoy this chapter xx an adventure in wall street when the two men at his table left the restaurant frank followed them at the door the two parted the clerk going toward broadway while the agent walked in the direction of nassau street i beg your pardon said frank overtaking him but may i ask you a question half a dozen if you like said the other goodnaturedly i overheard what you said about the great pekin tea company do you think i could get a chance to sell for them oh yes therell be no trouble about that i am looking for something to do continued frank and i think i should like to try that youll find it uphill work said the agent hard work and poor pay i shall leave it as soon as i can get a regular position cant you get a place perhaps i can i havent tried very hard yet answered frank but i find boys are paid so little that i cant make enough to live on if i were a man it would be different i dont believe you can make more than a boys wages at selling tea said franks new acquaintance but you might try it would you mind giving me a note to the company asked frank i will write a line on one of my business cards said the agent that will be all you will need he drew out a card and wrote a line commending frank to the attention of the company frank thanked him and sought the direction given entering a large shop not far from the astor house he looked about his inquiringly around him were chests of tea inscribed with chinese characters a portly man addressed him well my boy what can i do for you he asked mr mason one of your agents has given me this card said frank he thinks you might be willing to employ me we are ready to employ any competent person said the gentleman but you seem very young i am sixteen sir that is young have you had any experience as an agent no sir the man questioned him further and finally accepted him frank was told that it would be well to take samples of different kinds of teas with their respective prices attached and seek orders for them at private houses and groceries noting down in a little book orders obtained small quantities he could himself deliver and large quantities should he be fortunate enough to obtain any could be sent out from the store by their general delivery what commission am i to get sir inquired frank twenty per cent on parcels sold to private houses and ten per cent when you sell to retail dealers to the first you can charge a full price but it is necessary to sell at lower rates to dealers i understand sir said frank when do you want to begin tomorrow morning sir where do you advise me to go new york has been pretty well canvassed except perhaps the upper part harlem it might be well to make a start in brooklyn very well sir i will call tomorrow and get samples as frank left the store he reflected with satisfaction i have only been a few hours in new york and i have gotten employment already this reflection raised his spirits and disposed him to regard the future with a degree of confidence he resolved to spend the rest of the afternoon in walking about in the lower part of the city and acquiring a little familiarity with the streets as this was a kind of knowledge he was likely to need he strolled down broadway admiring the massive and stately structures that lined the streets on either side very soon he came to trinity church and standing in front it looked down wall street he had heard so much of this street that he felt inclined to turn from broadway and walk down its entire length as he sauntered along a man whom he met scrutinized him sharply as if considering some plan apparently making up his mind he stepped up to frank and touching him on the shoulder said boy would you like a job now frank though he had engaged to work for the great pekin tea company was ready to accept any other proposal and answered promptly yes sir that is right said the man it is a mere trifle but i am willing to pay you a dollar what is it sir do you see that window he pointed to a basement window in which were exposed rolls of gold currency and greenbacks of different denominations and english sovereigns and french gold coins i want you to do me a little errand in there he said frank was rather surprised that the man did not do his own errand when the brokers office was so near but he had no objection to earning a dollar and signified his willingness what i want you to do said his new acquaintance is to sell some government bonds for me very well sir the man produced a large yellow envelope already open in this envelope he said are two fivetwenty governments for a hundred dollars each take them in and sell them and bring the proceeds to me all right sir frank took the envelope and entered the office of jones robinson that being the style of the firm he advanced to the counter and singling out a clerk said i want to sell these bonds the clerk took them and drew them out of the envelope then he figured a little on a slip of paper and said they are worth two hundred and twentyfive dollars and twentyfive cents all right sir will you take a check or currency frank hesitated perhaps id better ask the man i am getting them for very well you can bring them here tomorrow oh i will let you know in a minute the man is just outside this answer immediately excited suspicion frank was too little versed in business ways to understand how singular it was for his principal not to transact his own business under the circumstances but the brokers were necessarily keen shrewd men wait a minute said the clerk i will speak to mr jones mr jones came forward and addressed frank are you acquainted with the man who gave you these bonds to sell he asked no sir i met him in the street did he offer you any pay for selling them yes sir he is going to give me a dollar will you go out and ask him to come in here a moment frank obeyed when his employer saw him coming he asked eagerly have you got the money no answered frank they asked me if i wanted a check or currency either currency or gold answered the man hastily go back at once and dont keep me waiting they want to see you sir what for inquired the man looking disturbed i dont know there is no need of my going in said the man angrily i paid you to sell the bonds now go back he wont come reported frank he says i can attend to the business he will take either gold or currency no doubt said mr jones significantly thomas go out with this boy and tell the man that employed him that we do not purchase bonds unless we have a reasonable assurance that they belong to the person offering them we will take the liberty of retaining them giving him a receipt for them and if we are satisfied he can have his money tomorrow robinson who had been examining some newspaper slips here came forward and said that is unnecessary i find that these bonds are among those stolen from the house of henry percival madison avenue a week since we must manage to delay the man while we notify the police frank was very much surprised to learn that he was acting as agent for a bond robber and was fearful that he might himself be regarded with suspicion but he need not have troubled himself on this score wall street men are good judges of human nature and it was at once concluded in the office that frank was the dupe of a designing knave a boy was dispatched to the nearest police office and frank was directed to tell his principal that he would not long be delayed naturally however the man outside had become suspicious i cant wait he said meet me on the steps of the astor house at five oclock with the money i am obliged to hurry away now to a business appointment frank could think of no other pretext for delaying him and was forced to see him hurry away he hastened back to the office and gave the alarm he has taken fright said robinson i fear we have lost him where did he go frank however was too ignorant of city streets to give any accurate information the consequence was that when the policeman appeared on the scene there was no occasion for his services at any rate said the broker we have secured a little of the plunder what is your name and address my boy we may wish to communicate with you frank gave his name and added the directions of his boarding house shall i meet the man at the astor house he inquired as he was leaving the office to be sure said mr jones i came near forgetting that officer will you be on hand at the time better employ a detective sir as my uniform would keep the thief at a distance i dont think hell appear at any rate i do said the broker he wont give up the money while he thinks there is a chance of securing it chapter xxi the capture at the hour named frank repaired to the astor house and took a position on the steps he looked about him for his street acquaintance but could see no one who bore any resemblance to him finally a man dressed in a gray suit with a pair of green glasses walked carelessly up to our hero and said in a low voice have you got the money frank looked at him in surprise this man had thick black whiskers while the man who had employed him had none at all so far as he could remember besides the green glasses altered him considerably to make sure that he was not deceived he inquired what money you know very well said the man impatiently you are the boy whom i employed to sell some bonds this morning you dont look like the same man said frank because of my glasses i have to wear them at times on account of the weakness of my eyes while he was speaking a quietlooking man approached and listened to the conversation then said frank you can tell me how many bonds you handed me they were two fivetwenty government bonds of a hundred dollars each correct sir then hand me the money and be quick about it for i have no time to waste you shall have the dollar i promised you but here the quietlooking man took a part in the conversation passing his arm through that of the man with the green glasses he said i will trouble you to come with me how dare you touch me do you mean to insult me demanded the other struggling with captor i will make all clear in due time you must come with me and explain how you came in possession of the bonds you gave this boy they were put in my hands by an acquaintance if there is anything wrong i am not to blame in that case no harm will come to you but now you must come along after his experience frank walked to his boarding place he was quite ready for six oclock when he entered the dining room his hostess introduced him to all a young man sat next to him and entered into conversation what do you do mr courtney i have taken an agency to sell tea for the great pekin tea company i am to begin tomorrow i am afraid you wont like it a friend of mine tried it once and came near starving this was not encouraging but frank was not going to despair before he had fairly begun his work i find that boys receive such small wages frank continued that i preferred to try an agency quite true said mr preston condescendingly when i started i was paid a paltry sum now i am not paid what i am worth still twentyfive dollars a week is fair quite fair responded frank who could not of course know that mr preston did not receive onehalf of this sum though he chose to give that impression after dinner preston was obliged to go back to the store where he was employed by invitation frank walked with him turning into sixth avenue they passed a saloon wont you have something to drink courtney said preston no thank you i never drink answered frank it will brace you up and make you feel jolly better come in i dont need bracing up answered frank quietly well perhaps you are right said mr peter preston i dont indulge very often but sometimes i feel like it some boys might have yielded to the temptation but frank had determined that he would abstain from liquor and kept his resolution a boy who comes to the city is exposed at every step to this peril and needs a firm will to withstand it it is the fruitful source of crime and misery and does more to fill our prisons than any other cause this is my store said preston as he pointed to a modestlooking shop on the west side of the avenue i wish i could keep you company longer but business before pleasure you know before returning to his boarding house frank sat down for a short time in washington park and reviewed his plans and prospects he could not tell how he would succeed in his tea agency but if that failed he was resolved to try something else he didnt feel homesick for since his mothers death he had no longer any home ties young as he was he felt that one part of his life was at an end and that a new life and a new career were before him chapter xxii the young tea merchant the next morning at breakfast one of the gentlemen who had been running his eyes over the morning paper said suddenly ah i see they have caught one of the gang who robbed the house of mr percival on madison avenue a week ago read the paragraph mr smith said one of the boarders mr smith read as follows about noon yesterday a boy entered the banking house of jones robinson in wall street and offered for sale two onehundreddollar government bonds on inquiry he said that the bonds belonged to a man in the street whom he had never before met and who had offered him a dollar to sell them this naturally excited suspicion and a policeman was sent for before he could arrive the man had hastily departed requesting the boy to meet him at a specified hour in front of the astor house and hand him the money he came to the rendezvous but in disguise and while talking to the boy was arrested it is understood that he has agreed to turn states evidence and probably the entire sum stolen amounting to several thousand dollars will be recovered frank listened to this paragraph with interest he was glad that his name was not mentioned in the account as he didnt care for such publicity he ventured to ask a question is mr percival a rich man he asked very rich answered mr smith he is not now in the city but is expected home from europe in three or four weeks his house was left in charge of an old servant a coachman and his wife but the burglars proved too much for them i am glad they are caught said mrs fletcher it makes my blood run cold to think of having the houses entered at night by burglars preston said mr smith jokingly i hope you have your bonds locked securely up i dont believe the sharpest burglar can find them said preston i only wish i could get hold of them myself the boy who helped to capture the burglar ought to be well rewarded said one of the boarders dont you wish it had been you courtney said mr preston it was answered frank quietly there was a great sensation upon this announcement all eyes were turned upon our hero most it must be admitted with an expression of incredulity come now you are joking said preston you dont really mean it i do mean it assured frank tell us all about it said mrs fletcher who had her share of curiosity i didnt suppose we had such a hero in our house it didnt require much heroism said frank smiling tell us all about it at any rate frank told the story as simply as he could much to the satisfaction of the company youll come in for a handsome reward when mr percival gets home suggested mr smith i dont expect anything said frank i shall be satisfied if i get the dollar which was promised me i havent received that yet i wish i were in your shoes thats all ive got to say said preston nodding vigorously will you sell out for five dollars cash down asked frank smiling well ill give you my note at thirty days said the sixth avenue salesman who seldom kept five dollars in advance of his liabilities i wont sell what i havent got said frank probably i shall hear nothing from mr percival after breakfast frank went downtown and sought the store of the great pekin company after half an hours delay for there were others in advance of him he was fitted out with samples and started for brooklyn it was his first visit to that city but he had received some directions which made his expedition less embarrassing at the ferry he took a flatbush avenue car and rode up fulton street and past the city hall up fulton avenue for nearly a mile here were interesting streets lined with comfortable houses for frank had made up his mind first to try private houses he had with him a few pound parcels of tea which he thought he could perhaps succeed in disposing of at such places he selected a house at random and rang the bell a servant answered the ring frank felt rather embarrassed but there was no time to hesitate i have some samples of tea with me he began of excellent quality and at reasonable prices its no use said the girl abruptly we never buy of peddlers and she closed the door in his face not a very good beginning thought frank rather mortified so i am a peddler he said to himself and he called to mind the agents and peddlers who in past years had called at the cedars with some compunction he remembered that he had regarded them with some contempt as traveling nuisances now he had entered the ranks of this despised class and he began to see that they might be perfectly respectable and were estimable persons animated by a praiseworthy desire to make an honest living thus thinking he called at another door it was opened not by a servant but by an elderly maiden lady who had rather a weakness for bargains ive got some nice tea said frank which i should like to sell you it is put up by the great pekin company are you sure its nice asked the elderly lady weve been getting ours at the grocery store on the avenue and the last wasnt very good youd better try a pound of ours said frank i dont know but i will said the lady how much do you charge i have some at fifty cents some at sixty and some at seventy i guess ill take the sixty frank had a pound parcel ready which he delivered to her and received his money seems to me you are pretty young for a peddler said the lady regarding frank with curiosity yes maam how old be you sixteen been long in the business no maam ive only just commenced you dont say so do you make much money at it i havent made much yet i should be glad to supply you with some more tea when this is gone well you can call if you are round this way if i like it i will try you again franks spirits rose his profits on the pound of tea were twelve cents this was not much certainly but it was a beginning at the next three houses he sold nothing being rather rudely rebuffed at one at the fourth house the servant called her mistress a kind motherlylooking woman who seemed to regard frank with more interest than his merchandise i hope you are succeeding well she said kindly this is my first day said frank and i have made one sale i have a son who is an agent like you but he didnt begin so young he is now traveling in the west what is he selling asked frank with interest dry goods he travels for a wholesale house in new york i suppose he is a young man yes he is twentyfive but he began at nineteen in a small way he sometimes got quite discouraged at first that is why i feel interested in any who are passing through the same experience these pleasant words cheered frank only at the nearest house he had been called a tramp but here he found that he was regarded with consideration it is rather uphill work said frank and you seem very young i am sixteen are you entirely dependent on what you earn asked the lady sympathizingly not entirely answered the young merchant but i hope to make a living in this or some other way can i sell you any he asked hopefully i believe we have some on hand still tea will always keep and i would like to help you along the kindhearted lady took three pounds two at sixty cents and one at seventy this gave frank a profit thirtyeight cents and put him in good spirits he worked his way back to the avenue on the other side of the street and coming to a grocery store entered it occurred to him that he would try to sell some at wholesale frank was so young that the dealer did not suppose him to be an agent and asked what he would like to buy i came to sell not to buy said frank what are you dealing in asked the grocer i have several samples of tea said our hero if you will give me an order i will have it sent to you tomorrow the grocer found upon examination that his stock was getting low and gave frank an order but he was obliged to sell below the regular price and only cleared three cents a pound still on a sale of twentyfive pounds this gave him seventyfive cents which was very encouraging adding up his profits thus far frank found that his commission amounted to a dollar and a quarter which exceeded his anticipations he continued his calls but sold only one pound besides at fifty cents netting him ten cents more chapter xxiii frank meets mr manning and mark the next morning frank resumed his tea agency as on the day previous he went to brooklyn but though i should be glad to say that he was more successful than on the first day truth compels me to state that the day was a comparative failure it might be that he was unfortunate in the persons whom he visited but at all events at the close of his labors he found that his commissions amounted to less than fifty cents he contented himself therefore with a tencent lunch and crossed fulton ferry between three and four oclock this will never do thought frank seriously i shall have to be economical to make my earnings cover my incidental expenses while my board and lodging must be defrayed out of the money i have with me frank was disappointed it is easy to think of earning ones living but not quite so easy to accomplish it a boy besides being ignorant of the world is inexperienced and so disqualified for many avenues of employment which are open to men it is generally foolish for a boy to leave a good home and start out for himself unless the chances are unusually favorable for him if he does it however he should not allow himself to be easily discouraged if frank had given up the business in which he was engaged simply because he had met with one unsuccessful day i should not have been willing to make him the hero of my story this will never do thought frank i must make a greater effort tomorrow the next day his commission amounted to a dollar and the fourth day to a dollar and twelve cents you are doing well said his employer you are doing better than the majority of our agents in one way this compliment was satisfactory in another way it was not encouraging for it limited his prospects frank began to think that he would never be able to make his entire expenses as a tea agent i dont propose to speak in detail of franks daily experiences but only to make mention of any incidents that play an important part in his history he was returning from jersey city on the tenth day of his agency when in the gentlemans cabin he saw directly opposite two persons whom he had reason to remember they were mark manning and his father little reason as he had to like either they reminded him of home and he felt pleased to meet them he instantly crossed the cabin and offered his hand to his stepfather who had not yet seen him when did you arrive mr manning he asked why it is frank exclaimed mr manning with an appearance of cordiality mark do you see frank yes i see him replied mark coldly havent you anything to say to him asked his father who was much more of a gentleman than his son how are you said mark indifferently thank you for your kind inquiry said frank more amused than vexed for he cared very little for his stepbrothers friendship i am in very good health and how are you getting along asked his stepfather with an appearance of interest are you in any business yes answered frank what are you doing asked mark inspired a little by curiosity i am agent for a wholesale tea house in new york frank answered briefly you dont say so exclaimed mark rather impressed what is the name of the firm the great pekin tea company does it pay well asked his stepbrother i have met with very fair success replied frank i congratulate you frank said mr manning your energy and enterprise are creditable extremely creditable i always predicted that you would succeed didnt i mark i dont remember hearing you say so said mark mr manning shrugged his shoulders nevertheless he said i have often made the remark where do you live asked mark i board in clinton place a very respectable street said mr manning frank now thought it was his turn to become questioner how long do you remain in the city mr manning he asked not long only a day or two said his stepfather we sail for europe on saturday interposed mark on the cunard steamer indeed i wish you a pleasant voyage i am sorry you wont go with us frank said his stepfather cautiously you remember i gave you the chance to do so and you desired to devote yourself immediately to business yes sir i would rather remain in new york it might possibly be arranged now if you desire to go said mr manning hesitatingly no thank you sir well perhaps you are right said his stepfather considerably relieved what parts of europe do you expect to visit asked frank we shall visit england france the rhine switzerland and perhaps italy i hope you will enjoy it thank you i think we shall frank checked a sigh it was certainly tantalizing if he could travel with congenial friends he felt that he would very much enjoy such a trip but with mark in the party there would be little pleasure for him we are staying at the st nicholas hotel said mr manning i would invite you to come and dine with us but i have an engagement first and dont know when we shall dine thank you all the same said frank they had reached the new york side and were walking toward broadway it was necessary for frank to go to the tea store and he took leave of his stepfather and mark again wishing them a pleasant voyage i hate that boy said mark as they walked away you should not indulge in any such disagreeable feelings mark said his father dont you hate him certainly not one would think by your soft manner that you loved him said mark who was not noted for the respect with which he treated his father really mark i am shocked by your strange words what made you invite him to go to europe with us i knew he would not go he might have accepted and then we should have been in a pretty pickle mark said his father rather irritated will you be kind enough to leave me to manage my own affairs i believe i have succeeded pretty well so far yes you have mark admitted all the same wed better keep clear of frank till we get safely off on the steamer chapter xxiv a discouraging day the next day was indeed a trying one and one of many experiences for frank the first lady did not buy any tea to be sure but seemed sorry that she was already supplied and questioned frank as to what success he was meeting with when twelve oclock came frank had not sold a single pound even if he earned nothing however he had an appetite and must buy lunch he entered a small oyster saloon and went up to the proprietor can i sell you some tea he asked no i guess not i get my tea in harlem take a couple of pounds said frank and i will take part of the pay in lunch that is business said the other let me look at your tea frank showed him his samples who employs you the great pekin tea company they have a good name yes i will try a couple of pounds at fifty cents this of course came to a dollar and franks profit on the sale amounted to twenty cents this was precisely the cost of the lunch which he ordered so that he felt well satisfied with the arrangement he left the saloon in better spirits and resumed his travels from house to house i am sorry to say however that though he certainly exerted himself to the utmost in the interests of the great pekin tea company and his own he did not sell another pound of tea that day about three oclock he got on board a third avenue horse car bound downtown and sat quietly down in a corner harlem doesnt seem to be a very promising field for an agent he said to himself perhaps it isnt fair to judge it by the first day still i dont think i shall have courage to come here tomorrow i would rather go to jersey city or brooklyn frank got off the cars at the bible house and walked to his boarding house where a disagreeable surprise was in store for him the night brought perplexity to frank but not discouragement he was naturally hopeful and in a large city like new york he felt that there are always chances of obtaining employment provided he could maintain his position as he would have been able to do if he had not lost the thirtyfive dollars which his fellow boarder had stolen now however circumstances were materially changed one thing was tolerably clear to frank and this was that he must give up his agency he had tried it and been unsuccessful that is he had failed to earn money enough to support himself and this was necessary as to what he should take up next frank was quite in the dark as a boy in a counting room he would be paid not more than four dollars a week if he could gain such a situation which was by no means certain the more he thought about the matter the more perplexed he felt and it was in an uncomfortable frame of mind that he came down to breakfast the next morning chapter xxv perplexity he went out as usual after breakfast and then walked leisurely downtown he proposed to go to the shop of the great pekin tea company and resign his agency he was on the watch during his walk for any opportunities to repair his unlucky loss at one place he saw a notice boy wanted though he felt sure the compensation would not be sufficient to allow of his accepting it he thought it would do no harm to make inquiry and accordingly entered it was an extensive retail store where a large number of clerks were employed is a boy wanted here asked frank of the nearest salesman yes you may inquire at the desk he pointed to a desk some distance back and frank went up to it you advertise for a boy he said to a tall stout man who chanced to be the proprietor is the place filled no was the answer but i dont think it would suit you do you think i would not be competent sir no that is not the difficulty it would not be worth your acceptance may i inquire what are the duties sir we want a boy to open the door to customers and this would not be worth your accepting no sir thank you for explaining it to me the gentleman was favorably impressed by franks polite and gentlemanly manners i wish i had a place for you he said have you ever had any experience in our line of business no sir i have very little experience of any kind i have acted for a short time as agent for a tea company you may leave your name if you like and i will communicate with you if i have a vacancy which you can fill frank thanked the polite proprietor and walked out of the store though this is a story written for boys it may be read by some business men who will allow me to suggest that a refusal kindly and considerately expressed loses half its bitterness and often inspires hope instead of discouragement frank proceeded to the office of the tea company and formally resigned his agency he was told that he could resume it whenever he pleased leaving the store he walked down broadway in the direction of wall street he passed an elderly man with stooping shoulders and a gait which showed that he was accustomed to live in the country he was looking about him in rather an undecided way his glance happened to rest on frank and after a little hesitation he addressed him boy he said do you live around here i live in the city sir then i guess you can tell me what i want to know i will if i can sir said frank politely whereabouts is wall street close by sir i am going that way and will be happy to show you frank had no idea his compliance with the strangers request was likely to have an important effect up his fortunes chapter xxvi frank hears something to his advantage my name said the stranger is peters jonathan peters of craneville onondaga county i am a farmer and dont know much about new york ive got a few hundred dollars that i want to put into government bonds all right said frank there wont be any difficulty about it ive heerd there are a good many swindlers in new york continued mr peters the squire squire jackson of our village perhaps you may have heard of him i dont think i have mr peters well the squire told me id better take good keer of my money as there were plenty of rascals here who would try to cheat me out of it that is true mr peters only yesterday i was robbed of thirtyfive dollars by a man who boarded in the same house you dont say so he opened my trunk and took out my pocketbook while i was absent on business i wouldnt dare to live in york said the farmer whose apprehensions were increased by franks story by this time they had reached the office of jones robinson with whom it will be remembered frank had once before had dealings if you will come in here mr peters said our hero you will be sure of honorable treatment i will introduce you if you like i should be obleeged if you would said the farmer out in craneville i am to home but i aint used to york business men and dont know how to talk to them it pleased frank to find that in spite of his inexperience he was able to be of service to one more unaccustomed than himself to city scenes and city ways he walked up to the counter followed by the farmer and said this gentleman wishes to buy some government bonds i told him that he could transact his business here thank you mr benton you may attend to this gentleman frank was about to leave the office when mr robinson called him back you have been in the office before have you not he asked yes sir are you not the boy who assisted in the capture of the man who robbed mr henry percival of madison avenue yes sir i thought so i have been trying to find you for the last week naturally frank looked surprised mr henry percival was at that time in europe said mr robinson on his return a week since he called on us and expressed a desire to have you call upon him we had mislaid or lost your address and were unable to give him the information he desired franks heart beat high with hope as the broker spoke perhaps he thought mr percival may offer me a situation of some kind and i certainly am greatly in need of one did mr percival recover all his bonds he asked nearly all answered mr robinson he considered himself exceedingly fortunate and he certainly was so do you know how much he was robbed of asked frank rather over five thousand dollars of this sum all has been recovered except three bonds of a hundred dollars each mr percival is a rich man and he wont miss that small amount i wish i were rich enough not to miss three hundred dollars thought our hero if i had my rights i could say the same just now in his extremity frank thought regretfully of the fortune he had lost had he been so situated as to be earning enough to defray all his expenses he would scarcely have given a thought of it you had better go up to see mr percival this evening said the banker if you have no other engagement even if i had an engagement i would put it off said frank will you give me mr percivals number no said mr robinson frank noted it down and left the office by this time mr peters had completed his business and was ready to go out also im much obliged to you he said to frank i was afraid id get into a place where theyd cheat me i guess mr jones and robinson are pretty good folks i think you can depend upon them said frank if ever you come to craneville i should like to have you stay a few days with me on my farm said mr peters hospitably we are plain folks but will treat you about right thank you mr peters if i ever come to craneville i shall certainly call upon you frank had something to look forward to in his approaching interview with mr percival he had been able to do this gentleman a service and it was not unlikely that the capitalist would wish to make him some acknowledgment frank did not exaggerate his own merits in the matter he felt that it was largely owing to a lucky chance that he had been the means of capturing the bond robber however it is to precisely such lucky chances that men are often indebted for the advancement of their fortunes while he was in a state of suspense and uncertain what mr percival might be disposed to do for him he decided not to exert himself to obtain any employment if he should be disappointed in his hopes it would be time enough to look about him the following day what should he do in the meantime he determined to treat himself to an excursion from the end of the battery he had often looked across to staten island lying six miles away and thought it would prove a pleasant excursion now having plenty of time on his hands he decided to go on board one of the boats that start hourly from the piers adjoining the battery the expense was but trifling and low as franks purse was he ventured to spend the amount for pleasure he felt that he needed a little recreation after the weeks of patient labor he had spent in the service of the great pekin tea company chapter xxvii an incident in a street car when frank returned to the city he walked slowly up through the battery to the foot of broadway he passed the famous house no which a hundred years ago was successively the headquarters of washington and the british generals who occupied new york with their forces and soon reached the astor house then the most notable structure in the lower part of the city with his small means frank felt that it was extravagant to ride uptown when he might have walked but he felt some confidence in the success of his visit to mr percival and entered a fourth avenue horse car it so chanced that he seated himself beside a pleasantlooking young married lady who had with her a young boy about seven years old soon after the car started the conductor came around to collect the fares frank paid his and the conductor held out his hand to the lady she put her hand into her pocket to draw out her purse but her countenance changed as her hand failed to find it probably no situation is more trying than to discover that you have lost or mislaid your purse when you have an urgent use for it the lady was evidently in that predicament once more she searched for her purse but her search was unavailing i am afraid i have lost my purse she said apologetically to the conductor this official was an illmannered person and answered rudely in that case maam you will have to get off i will give you my card said the lady and will send double the fare to the office that wont do said the man rudely i am responsible for your fare if you stay on the car and i cant afford to lose the money you shall not lose it sir but i cannot walk home i think you will have to madam here frank interposed he had been trained to be polite and considerate to ladies and he could not endure to see a lady treated with rudeness take the ladys fare out of this he said and the boys too of course the lady smiled gratefully i accept your kindness my young friend she said you have saved me much annoyance i am very glad to have had the opportunity said frank politely of course i shall insist upon reimbursing you will you oblige me with your address that i may send you the amount when i return home a boy of less tact than frank would have expostulated against repayment but he knew that this would only embarrass the lady and that he had no right being a stranger to force such a favor upon her he answered therefore certainly i will do so but it will be perfectly convenient for me to call upon you if it will give you no trouble i shall be glad to have you call any evening i live at no madison avenue now it was franks turn to be surprised the number mentioned by the lady was that of the house in which mr henry percival lived i thought mr percival lived at that number said frank so he does he is my father do you know him no but i was about to call on him this morning mr robinson a broker in wall street told me that he wished to see me you are not the boy who caused the capture of the bondholder asked the lady quickly yes i am the boy but i am afraid i had less to do with it than has been represented what is your name frank courtney my father is very desirous of meeting you and thanking you for what you have done why have you not called before i did not know till today that your father had returned besides i did not like to go without an invitation i will invite you said the lady with a pleasant smile and i as well as my father will be glad to see you and now let me introduce you to my little son freddie would you like to see the boy that caught the robber yes mamma here he is his name is frank the little boy immediately began to ask questions of frank and by the time they reached the cooper institute frank and he were well acquainted dont get out frank said freddie i am going home freddie you must come and see me soon said the little boy now you have three invitations said the lady i will accept them all said frank and with a bow he left the car chapter xxviii frank makes an evening call after supper frank walked slowly up to mr percivals residence now that he knew two members of the family he looked forward with pleasure to the call he was about to make his prospects seemed much brighter than when he woke up in the morning on reaching the house of mr percival he saw at a glance that it was the residence of a wealthy man and the hall into which he was first admitted was luxurious in its appearance but frank had been brought up to the enjoyment of wealth and he felt more at home here than in the rather shabby boarding house in clinton place a colored servant opened the door is mr percival at home he asked yas sah i should like to see him what name sah frank courtney step in sah and i will form mr percival said the colored servant in a consequential tone that amused frank frank stepped into the hall but he was not left long without attention little freddie ran downstairs eagerly calling out did you come to see me frank yes answered frank smiling but i came to see your grandfather too come and i will show you where he is said the little boy taking franks hand the two went up the staircase and into a handsomely furnished room made attractive by pictures and books in a large armchair sat a pleasantlooking elderly man of about sixty grandpa said the little boy this is frank he wants to see you mr percival smiled i am glad to see you frank he said it seems my boy that you are already acquainted with my daughter and grandson yes sir i was fortunate enough to meet them today you relieved my daughter from some embarrassment i am glad to have had the opportunity sir franks manner was easy and selfpossessed and it was evident that mr percival was favorably impressed by him take a seat he said while i ask you a few questions frank bowed and obeyed let me sit in your lap frank said freddie our hero took the little boy in his lap with freddie it was certainly a case of friendship at first sight wont he trouble you asked his grandfather no sir i like young children mr percival now proceeded to interrogate frank your name is frank courtney have you been long in the city no sir only a few weeks what led you to come here i wished to earn my living what that necessary you do not look like a poor boy i was brought up to consider myself rich said frank indeed did you lose your property perhaps i had better tell you how it happened sir if you dont object i should be glad to hear frank gave a brief statement of his position and the circumstances that led him to leave his home and go out into the world mr percival listened thoughtfully it is a singular story he said after a pause your stepfathers in europe then yes sir at least he sailed for europe have you heard from him no sir do you expect to hear i think not he cant feel much interest in you i dont think he does answered frank still i cant say that he has treated me unkindly do you suspect that your stepfather has wronged you in the matter of the property i would rather not answer that question sir i might wrong mr manning and i have no proof to offer i understand you and i applaud your discretion it does you credit some time or other the mystery may be cleared up and the wrong if there is one may be righted i cant understand however how this mr manning should be willing to leave you dependent upon your own exertions with such a scanty provision as twentyfive dollars a quarter i didnt ask for any more and besides mr manning offered to take me to europe with his son mark do you think that he was sincere in the offer i dont think he expected me to accept it and i am sure that it would have been very disagreeable to mark to have me in the party have you any objections to telling me how you have succeeded in your efforts to make a living asked the old gentleman with a keen but kindly glance i have been disappointed sir was the candid reply i am not surprised to hear it a boy brought up as you have been cannot rough it like a farmers son or a street boy i think i could sir but i should not like to precisely now i am not sure that you acted wisely in undertaking a task so difficult since it was not necessary and your stepfather could hardly have refused to support you at home however as you have taken the decisive step we must consider what is best to do under the circumstances what work have you been doing i have been selling tea for the great pekin tea company how have you succeeded i have not been able to pay expenses frank admitted how have you made up the difference i brought about fifty dollars with me from home is it all used up i had thirtyfive dollars left sir but a day or two since one of my fellow boarders opened my trunk and borrowed it without leave of course you wont recover it i dont think there is much chance of it sir then probably your money is nearly exhausted frank did not like to admit his poverty but owned up that he had less than two dollars and yet you paid the car fares of this little boy and his mother i hope sir i would not refuse to assist a lady when in trouble mr percival nodded two or three times smiling as he did so he was becoming more and more favorably impressed without young hero do you mean to continue this tea agency he asked no sir i have already notified my employers that i do not care to continue it have you anything else in view frank felt that now was the time to speak i came here this evening he said intending to ask you if you knew of any situation i could fill or could recommend me to employment of any kind by which i might make a living i must consider that have you thought of any particular employment which you would like no sir i cannot afford to be particular i will do anything that is honest and at all suitable for me what would you consider unsuitable i should not wish to black boots for instance sir it is honest work but i ought to be suited to something better of course what education have you had good i suppose i am nearly ready for college then you are already fairly well educated i will put you to a test sit up to the table and take paper and pen i will dictate to you a paragraph from the evening paper which i should like to have you write down frank obeyed though in doing so he was obliged to set freddie down rather to the little fellows dissatisfaction mr percival selected a short letter written by some public man which chanced to have found a place in the evening journal frank wrote rapidly and when his copy was finished submitted it to mr percival the old gentleman took it and running his eye over it noticed that it was plainly written correctly spelled and properly punctuated this discovery evidently gave him satisfaction very creditably written he said i have known boys nearly ready for college who could not copy such a letter without blundering i am glad that your english education has not been neglected while you have been studying the classics frank was gratified by mr percivals commendation though he could not see in what manner his education was likely to bring him employment it was desirable however to produce a favorable impression on mr percival and he could not help hoping something would result to his advantage at this moment freddies mother entered the room and greeted frank with a cordial smile freddie she said it is time for you to go to bed i dont want to leave frank said freddie frank will come and see you again will you frank frank made the promise and mrs gordon for that was her name left the room promising to return before frank went away he was now left alone with the old gentleman chapter xxix frank is offered a position mr percival engaged frank in conversation on general topics while mrs gordon was out of the room his young visitor had been an extensive reader and displayed a good deal of general information moreover he expressed himself intelligently and modestly and deepened the favorable impression which he had already succeeded in making i should like to call the attention of my young readers to the fact that frank was now reaping the advantage of the time he had devoted to study and the cultivation of his mind a boy who starts in life with a fair education always stands a better chance than one who is poorly provided in that respect it is true that many of our prominent public men have started with a very scanty supply of booklearning but in most cases it has only transferred the labor of study to their maturer years president andrew johnson did not learn to read and write until after he had attained his majority but he made up his early deficiencies later abraham lincoln when nearly thirty devoted his leisure hours to mastering the problems in euclid and thus trained and strengthened his mental faculties so that he was enabled to grapple with the difficult problems of statesmanship in after years henry wilson commenced attending an academy after he had reached the age of twentyone the fact is no boy or man can be too well equipped for his lifework i hope my boy readers will not skip the paragraphs above for they can learn from them a useful lesson when mrs gordon returned she placed in franks hands a small sum of money saying allow me to repay my debt with many thanks you are quite welcome answered our hero he had too much tact to refuse the money but quietly put it into his pocket helen said mr percival i would like a word with you we will leave our young friend here alone for five minutes certainly father the two went into an adjoining room and mr percival commenced by asking how do you like this boy helen very much he seems to have been brought up as a gentleman he has till a short time since he supposed himself the heir to a fortune indeed said mrs gordon with curiosity briefly mr percival rehearsed the story which frank had told him what a shame exclaimed mrs gordon indignantly his stepfather ought to be punished that may come in time wickedness does not always prosper but as regards our young friend i have a plan in view what is it father i find he has an excellent education having been nearly ready for college when the crisis in his fortunes came i have been thinking whether we could not find a place for him in this house my eyes you know are so weak that they are often strained by attention to my correspondence and reading i have an idea of engaging frank courtney as a sort of private secretary upon whom i can at any time call of course he would have his home in the house there will be no difficulty about that our family is small and we have plenty of vacant rooms but father will he be qualified to undertake the duties you have designed for him he is very young that is true my dear but he is remarkably well educated i have tested his capacity by dictating a letter for him to copy did he do the work satisfactorily asked mrs gordon without a single mistake then father i would not hesitate to engage him freddie likes him and will be delighted to have him in the house another idea helen it is time freddie began to study suppose we make him freddies private tutor say for an hour daily that is really an excellent idea father said mrs gordon in a tone of satisfaction it will please and benefit freddie and be a relief to me do you think frank will have patience enough i watched him with the little fellow and i could see that he liked children i am sure he will succeed in this as well as in the duties which he will undertake for me i suppose he will have no objection to the plan i think he will accept gladly he has had a hard struggle thus far in maintaining himself and i can relieve him from all anxiety on that score i am indebted to him for helping me to recover my bonds and this will be an excuse for offering him a larger salary than the services of so young a secretary could be expected to command very well father your plan pleases me very much and i shall be glad to have frank commence tomorrow if he chooses now let us return to the library while father and daughter were absent frank had taken from the table a volume of macaulays history and had become interested in it he laid it down upon their return mr percival resumed his easychair and said with a smile my daughter and i have been consulting about you frank bowed and his hopes rose i suppose you are open to an offer of employment i am not only open to it mr percival but i shall be grateful for it he could not help wondering what sort of employment mr percival was about to offer him he concluded that it might be a place in some business house the fact is said the old gentleman i have a great mind to offer you the situation of my private secretary frank was astonished this was something he had not thought of do you think i am qualified to fill such a position mr percival he asked hesitatingly the duties would not be difficult returned the old gentleman though not in active business the care of my property and looking after my scattered investments involves me in considerable correspondence my eyes are not as strong as they once were and i find them at times taxed by letterwriting not to mention reading you can relieve me very materially i shall be very glad to do so sir the duties will be very agreeable to me but that is not all my daughter proposes to employ you as private tutor for freddie frank smiled i think my scholarship will be sufficient for that he said frank was to receive a month and board this was wonderful news to him mr percival with great forethought paid him a months salary in advance frank went home happy chapter xxx frank as private secretary the next day frank transferred his residence to madison avenue he was assigned to a pleasant room decidedly superior it need hardly be said to his room at clinton place it seemed agreeable to him once more to enjoy the comforts of a liberal home frank had had some doubts as to how he would satisfy mr percival in his capacity of private secretary he was determined to do his best but thought it possible that the old gentleman might require more than he could do well he looked forward therefore with some apprehension to his first mornings work mr percival though not engaged in active business was a wealthy man and his capital was invested in a great variety of enterprises naturally therefore he received a large number of business letters which required to be answered the first day he dictated several replies which frank put upon paper he wished however to put franks ability to a severe test here are two letters he said which you may answer i have noted on each instructions which you will follow the wording of the letters i leave to you i will try to satisfy you sir said frank our hero was a good writer for his age moreover he had been well trained at school and did not shrink from the task assigned him he read carefully the instruction of his employer and composed the letters in strict accordance with them mr percival awaited with some interest the result of his experiment if frank proved competent to the task assigned him his own daily labor would be considerably abridged here are the letters sir said our hero passing the drafts to mr percival the old gentleman examined them carefully as he did so his face expressed his satisfaction upon my word frank he said familiarly you have done your work exceedingly well they are brief concise and yet comprehensive i feared that you would use too many words i am glad you are pleased sir dr brush trained us to write letters and he cut down our essays when they were too diffuse then i feel indebted to dr brush for providing me with so competent a young secretary you will be able to assist me even more than i anticipated i shall of course read over your letters before they are sent to make sure that you have fully comprehended and carried out my instructions but i dont expect they will need much correction frank was much gratified by these words this was the only point on which he had felt at all doubtful as to his ability to please his employer sometimes when his eyes pained him more than usual mr percival also employed him to read to him from the daily papers or from some book in which he was interested but this did not occur regularly every day however frank was occupied with freddie the little boy knew his alphabet but nothing more so that his young teacher had to begin with him at the beginning of the primer he succeeded in interesting his little pupil and did not protract his term of study so as to weary him finding that the little fellow was fond of hearing stories he read to him every day a story or two from hans christian andersen or from a collection of german fairy stories and sometimes went out to walk with him freddie was delighted with his teacher and freely expressed his approval to his mother and grandfather really frank said mrs gordon i shall begin to be jealous of your hold upon freddie i am not sure but he likes your company better than mine i dont think freddie will prefer anyone to his mother said frank but i am glad he likes to be with me you have certainly proved very successful as a private tutor frank said mrs gordon and my father tells me you succeeded equally well as a secretary it is partly because you both treat me so indulgently answered frank gracefully this answer pleased mr percival and mrs gordon who more than ever congratulated themselves upon the lucky chance that had thrown frank in their way assuredly he made himself very useful in the small household contributing to the comfort and pleasure of freddie his mother and grandfather in nearly equal measure while franks monthly salary was of great value and importance to him it was nothing to mr percival in comparison with the pleasure and relief afforded by his presence in the house it must not be supposed however that franks time was wholly occupied by the duties of his two positions usually he had several hours daily at his disposal and these he was allowed to spend as he pleased part of this he occupied in visiting different localities of the city and points of interest in the neighborhood and part in reading and study mr percival had a large and wellselected library which to a boy of franks studious tastes was a great attraction he entered upon a course of solid reading embracing some of the standard histories and devoted some hours every week to keeping up his acquaintance with the greek and latin authors which he had read at school in this way his time was well and usefully employed and the weeks slipped by till almost before he was aware six months had passed one afternoon frank walked down broadway enjoying the bright sunshine just in front of the st nicholas hotel he heard his name called and looking up he recognized with some surprise pliny tarbox his cousin from newark pliny asked many questions as to what frank was doing and how much money he was making frank told him of his good fortune in obtaining the position he held with mr percival and the two parted frank the much happier of the two pliny urgently invited frank to visit them but frank would rather remain in new york i hope i shall never think so much of money as pliny and his father thought frank money is a good thing to have but there are some things that are better chapter xxxi a letter from mr tarbox frank did not speak to mr percivals family of his meeting with pliny it was not pleasant to him to think that he was valued only for his good fortune he had seen but little of the tarbox family but he understood very well what their professions of friendship amounted to and that they were not to be relied upon in an emergency he was not much surprised on monday afternoon to receive the following letter from erastus tarbox my dear young cousin we have been wondering what has become of you and mrs t and myself have often wished to invite you to pass a sabbath at our humble home not knowing your address i could not write to you or i should have done so you can imagine therefore the pleasure we felt when pliny told us that he had met you and gave us tidings of your remarkable success which i am sure does you great credit he tells me that you fill a very responsible position and receive a very liberal salary i could wish that pliny might be equally fortunate and shall esteem it a great favor if you will mention him to your respected employer and recommend him for any lucrative position which he may bestow upon him pliny is a very capable boy and has been carefully trained to habits of frugality and industry can you not soon come out and pass a sabbath with us the esteem which we have for your late lamented mother alone would secure you a cordial welcome not to speak of the friendship for yourself pliny often says that you seem to him like a brother and he would truly enjoy your companionship your sincere friend and cousin erastus tarbox the time was when frank would have put confidence in the friendly expressions used by mr tarbox but his eyes had been opened and he understood that if misfortune should come to him it would not do to lean upon his cousins at newark frank wrote a civil reply to mr tarbox thanking him for his invitation but saying that at present it would not be convenient for him to accept it he added that should an opportunity offer he would be glad to assist pliny to a better position than he now held in spite of his wish to be cordial his letter was felt by the tarbox family to be cold and they regretted that they had not treated him better during his brief visit to them but then how could they suppose he would be so successful if the time should ever come when he recovered his property they would be prepared to make a determined effort to convince him that they had always been his affectionate friends about this time frank received another letter which afforded him greater satisfaction than the one from newark this letter was from col vincent who it will be remembered had purchased ajax when mr manning persisted in selling him it was as follows my dear frank i learned incidentally from one of our townsmen who recently met you in new york that you have been very successful in obtaining employment and that of an honorable and responsible character it relieved my mind for knowing how hard it is for a boy to make his own way in a large city i feared that you might be suffering privation or living poorly i hope however you would in that case have applied to me for such help as your fathers old friend would have been glad to offer your stepfather has not been heard from directly i learn however from some friends who have met him abroad that he is having trouble with mark who is proving difficult to manage and has contracted a dangerous taste for gaming mr manning was obliged to leave badenbaden on account of this unfortunate tendency and is even thinking of returning to the cedars where his son will be removed from temptation to this however mark will be likely to make strenuous opposition he will find it dull to settle down here after having tasted the gayety of europe here followed a little local gossip which the writer thought might prove interesting to frank and the letter concluded with a cordial invitation to our hero to spend a sunday with him or a longer time if he could be spared from his duties frank was disposed to accept the invitation but his acceptance was postponed by an unusual service which he was called upon to render to mr percival of this the reader will hear everything in the next chapter chapter xxxii mr percivals proposal one morning after writing several letters for his employer the young secretary asked mr percival if he had any further commands the old gentleman answered thoughtfully i have been thinking of asking you to do me an unusual service i shall be very glad to serve you in any way mr percival said frank promptly i have no doubt of it said the old gentleman kindly i have observed your willingness to undertake any duty and still more your disposition to perform it thoroughly in this particular case however i have been considering whether a boy of your age would be competent to do what i desire frank was not selfdistrustful neither was he overconfident he was naturally energetic and ambitious to distinguish himself and not afraid to undertake any difficult task will you try me mr percival he said i will do my best to succeed i am quite inclined to try you frank said mr percival the more so because i know of no one else in whom i could confide but i must give you an idea of what i have in view it would require you to make a journey frank listened to this gladly to a boy of his age who had seen but little of the world a journey offered attractions i should like to travel he said i have no doubt about that said mr percival smiling at your age i am sure i should have been equally willing to see something of the world though traveling involved at that time far more hardships than at present now however i like best to stay by the fireside and should dread very much a journey to minnesota to minnesota exclaimed frank with sparkling eyes he had not thought of a journey so extended yes it would be necessary for you to go out to minnesota ordinarily a man can best look after his own affairs but in the present instance i suspect that you could do better than myself i dont mean this as a compliment but a boy like you would not be suspected and so could discover more than i from whom facts would be studiously concealed but of course you dont understand my meaning i will explain and then you can comprehend me frank was all attention you must know that i own a good deal of property in a certain township in southern minnesota when a young man i bought three hundred and twenty acres of land in the township of jackson obtaining it at a slight advance on government rates some improvements had been made and i was induced to visit the place i found but three families in residence but i saw also that the place had large natural advantages waterpower etc and presented an unusually favorable site for a village i had considerable means and started the village by erecting a dozen houses a store a sawmill gristmill and so on this formed a nucleus and soon quite a village sprang up the sawmill and gristmill proved profitable all my houses were tenanted and i erected more securing also additional land in course of time i was induced to sell some of my houses but i still own two stores a dozen houses the saw and gristmills besides two outlying farms living so far away i could not attend personally to the business connected with my investment and was compelled to appoint an agent up to four years since i was fortunate enough to possess the services of a capable and trustworthy man named sampson he died after a few weeks illness and i was compelled to look out for a successor now i had a distant cousin who had never succeeded very well in life and was at that time seeking for employment of some kind he heard of the vacancy and importuned me to appoint him as my agent in jackson i had no reason to doubt his honesty though his repeated failures might well have led me to suspect his capacity i was weak enough as i now consider it to yield to his importunities and give him the post he sought the result was that during the first year of his incumbency the amount turned over to me was only threefourths as much as in the last year of his predecessor the second year there was a further falling off the same happened the third year until at the present time my rents amount to less than half what they were in mr sampsons time of course my suspicions that my cousin was at least inefficient were aroused long since i have repeatedly asked an explanation of the diminished revenues and plenty of excuses have been made but they do not seem to me satisfactory moreover i have heard a rumor that mr fairfield is intemperate in his habits and i have considerable reason to believe that the story is correct i have made up my mind that something must be done a regard for my own interests requires that if my agent is unfaithful he should be displaced and i wish to find out from some reliable source the true state of the case now i will tell you what i have in view i propose to send you out to jackson to investigate and report to me your impressions of the manner in which mr fairfield discharges his duties and whether you think a change should be made in the agency frank listened to mr percival with a flushed face and a feeling of gratification and pride that he should be thought of in connection with a responsible duty i am very much obliged to you mr percival he said for thinking of me in such a connection you may feel that i am presumptuous for thinking i have any chance of successfully accomplishing what you desire but if you are willing to trust me i am willing to undertake it and by following your instructions closely and doing my best i think i can succeed i am willing to trust you frank said mr percival you are a boy to be sure but you have unusually good judgment and i know you will be faithful to my interests i understand then that you are willing to go out as my accredited representative yes sir when do you want me to start said frank promptly as soon as you can get ready i will start tomorrow if you desire it sir let it be tomorrow then we will now discuss some of the details connected with the mission chapter xxxiii preparing for a journey after receiving certain instructions from mr percival in regard to the manner of carrying on his inquiries frank said there is one thing i have thought of mr percival that may interfere with my success what is it frank i shall be glad to receive any suggestion from you i have been thinking sir that it may excite surprise that i should come to jackson and remain there without any apparent motive perhaps mr fairfield might suspect that i came from you i hardly think so frank he would not suppose that i would select so young a messenger still it will be well to think of some pretext for your stay can you help me i have been thinking sir that i might fit myself out as an agent or peddler or something of the kind it would not only give me an excuse for my journey but enable me to call from house to house and pick up information about mr fairfield a capital idea frank i see that you are better fitted for the task than i supposed i give you authority to fit yourself out in any way you choose i shall have to leave a great deal to your own judgment then sir i think i might lay in a stock of stationery pens and articles of that nature probably this is so common that i would be thought to be nothing more than i seemed that strikes me rather favorably frank i could fit myself out in the city and take the articles along with me in an extra valise or carpetbag let me suggest an amendment to your plan said mr percival wait till you get to chicago and lay in your stock there the advantage of that arrangement will be that you will be saved the care of your merchandise up to that point and as you may be asked where you obtained your stock it will create less surprise if you mention chicago than new york it would be considered hardly worth while for a new york boy to go so far on such a business this seemed to frank an excellent suggestion and he instantly adopted it the next day frank started on his long journey he carried with him a supply of money provided by mr percival and he was authorized to draw for more if he should require it he divided this money into two portions keeping a small sum in his pocketbook but the greater part of it in an inside vest pocket where it would not be likely to be looked for by pickpockets this arrangement was suggested by mr percival i once experienced he said the disadvantage of carrying all my money in one pocket i was in a southern city or rather on my way to it when an adroit pickpocket on the car relieved me of my wallet containing all my available funds i did not find out my loss till i had arrived at the hotel and registered my name you can imagine my embarrassment it was my first visit to that particular city and i had no acquaintances there so far as i was aware had i mentioned my position to the landlord he might very probably have taken me for an adventurer traveling on false pretenses what did you do sir asked frank interested i took a walk about the city my thoughts occupied in devising a way out of my trouble to my great relief i had the good fortune during the walk to meet a new york acquaintance who knew very well my financial standing i told him of my difficulty and he immediately introduced me at a bank where i raised money on a new york draft i resolved however at that time never again to carry all my money in one pocketbook as boats and railroad trains on the long routes are generally infested by pickpockets and sharpers frank at once set about preparing for his journey he bought a readymade suit of blue cloth not unlike that worn by the district telegraph boys of today which he judged would look more suitable than his ordinary attire for the character he was about to assume of a traveling peddler he bought a through ticket to the railroad point nearest jackson and then bidding goodbye to mr percival and his family started on his trip little freddie made strenuous opposition to parting with his favorite but frank promised to bring him home a present and this diverted the little fellows thoughts chapter xxxiv frank reaches jackson it was four oclock in the afternoon when frank courtney left the cars and set foot on the platform before the station at prescott five miles distant from the town of jackson in southern minnesota he looked about him but could see no village prescott was a stopping place for the cars but there was no settlement of any account there as he afterward found he had supposed he would find a stage in waiting to convey him to jackson but it was clear that the business was not large enough to warrant such a conveyance looking about him frank saw a farm wagon the driver of which had evidently come to receive some freight which had come by rail approaching the driver who seemed to be though roughly dressed an intelligent man frank inquired how far is jackson from here sir five miles was the answer is there any stage running there from this depot oh no if there were it wouldnt average two passengers a day then i suppose i must walk said frank looking rather doubtfully at the two heavy valises which constituted his baggage then you are going to jackson yes sir i come from jackson myself and in fifteen minutes shall start on my way back you may ride and welcome thank you sir said our hero quite relieved i hope you will allow me to pay you as much as i should have to pay in a stage no no my lad said the farmer heartily the horse can draw you as well as not and i shall be glad to have your company thank you sir just climb up here then ill take your baggage and put it on the wagon behind when the farmer had loaded up he started up the team then finding himself at leisure he proceeded to satisfy his curiosity by crossexamining his young passenger do you come from the east he asked i am last from chicago answered frank cautiously i suppose youve got some friend in jackson ventured the farmer interrogatively frank smiled you are the only man living in jackson that i ever met he said indeed said the driver puzzled are you calculating to make a long stay in our village he asked again after a minutes pause that depends on business answered the young traveler are you in business i have a stock of stationery which i shall offer for sale in jackson answered frank i am afraid youll find it rather a poor market if thats all you have to depend upon i am afraid youll get discouraged i am also agent for an illustrated book said frank i may be able to dispose of a few perhaps so answered the farmer dubiously but our people havent much money to spend on articles of luxury and books are a luxury with us i always heard that jackson was a flourishing place said frank who felt that now was his time to obtain a little information it ought to be said the farmer but theres one thing prevents what is that a good deal of our village is owned by a new york man to whom we have to pay rent he has a rascally agent a mr fairfield who grinds us down by his exactions and does what he can to keep us in debt has he always been agent no before he came there was an excellent man a mr sampson who treated us fairly contented himself with exacting rents which we could pay and if a man were unlucky would wait a reasonable time for him to pay then we got along comfortably but he died and this man was sent out in his place then commenced a new state of things he immediately raised the rents demanded that they should be paid on the day they were due and made himself harsh and tyrannical do you think the man who employs him knows how he is conducting his agency frank inquired no there is no one to tell him i suppose mr fairfield tells him a smooth story and he believes it i am afraid we can hope for no relief what would he say thought frank if he knew i were a messenger from mr percival what sort of a man is this mr fairfield in private life he asked he drinks like a fish was the unexpected reply frequently he appears on the street under the influence of liquor he spends a good deal of money lives in a large house and his wife dresses expensively he must get a much larger salary than mr sampson did or he could not spend money as he does though frank had not much worldly experience he could not help coming to the conclusion that mr fairfield was acting dishonestly he put together the two circumstances that this new agent had increased the rents and yet that he had returned to mr percival only about half as much as his predecessor had done clearly he must retain in his own hands much more than he had a right to do i shall have to report unfavorably on this man he thought one point must be considered where he was to find a boarding place on his arrival in jackson is there a hotel in jackson he asked there is a tavern but its a low place answered the farmer a good deal of liquor is sold there and mr fairfield our agent is one of the most constant patrons of the bar i dont think i should like to stop there said frank isnt there any private family where i can get board for a week or two if you dont object to plain fare said the farmer i might agree to board you myself this was precisely what frank wanted and he replied that nothing would suit him better we live humbly continued mr hamlin for this frank learned was his drivers name but we will try to make you comfortable i feel sure of that sir and i am much obliged to you for receiving me as to terms you can pay whatever you can afford my wife and children will be glad to see you its pretty quiet out here and it breaks the monotony to meet any person from the east how long have you lived in jackson mr hamlin about eight years i was not brought up as a farmer but became one from necessity i was a bookkeeper in chicago for a good many years until i found the confinement and close work were injuring my health then i came here and set up as a farmer i got along pretty well at first at any rate i made a living for my family but when mr fairfield became agent he raised my rent and in other ways made it hard for me now i have a hard struggle i thought you were not always a farmer said frank what made you think so you dont talk like a farmer you have the appearance of a man who has lived in cities seems to me you are a close observer for a boy of your years said mr hamlin shrewdly frank smiled i should be glad if your compliment were deserved he answered its a pity you were not agent instead of mr fairfield suggested frank pointedly i wish i were answered hamlin i believe i should make a good one though i might not turn over as much money to my employer i should first of all lower the rents and make it as easy for the tenants as i could in justice to my new york principal do you know how much mr fairfield receives how large a salary i mean i know what mr sampson got twelve hundred dollars a year but mr fairfield lives at the rate of more than twice that sum if i can judge from appearances i suppose you would be contented with the salary which mr sampson received contented i should feel like a rich man it would not interfere with my carrying on my farm and i should be able to make something from that why it is as much as i received as a bookkeeper and here the expenses of living are small compared with what they were in chicago i could save money and educate my children as i cannot do now i have a boy who wants a classical education but of course there are no schools here which can afford it and i am too poor to send him away from home i suppose i shall have to bring him up as a farmer though it is a great pity for he is not fitted for it mr hamlin sighed but frank felt in unusually good spirits he saw his way clear already not only to recommend mr fairfields displacement but to urge mr hamlins appointment in his stead that is if his favorable impressions were confirmed on further acquaintance it seems to me said the driver changing the subject you might find something better to do than to peddle stationery i dont mean to follow the business long answered frank it cant pay much i am not wholly dependent upon it said our hero there is one advantage about it it enables me to travel about and pay my expenses and you know traveling is agreeable to a boy of my age that is true well your expenses wont amount to much while you are in jackson i shall only charge you just enough to cover expenses say three dollars a week frank was about to insist on paying a larger sum but it occurred to him that he must keep up appearances and he therefore only thanked his kind acquaintance by this time they had entered the village of jackson theres mr fairfield now said mr hamlin suddenly pointing with his whip to a rather tall stout man with a red nose and inflamed countenance who was walking unsteadily along the sidewalk frank carefully scrutinized the agent and mentally decided that such a man was unfit for the responsible position he held chapter xxxv dick hamlin mr hamlin stopped his horse a quarter of a mile from the village in front of a plain farmhouse an intelligentlooking boy of perhaps fifteen coarsely but neatly dressed approached and greeted his father not without a glance of surprise and curiosity at frank you may unharness the horses dick said mr hamlin when you come back i will introduce you to a boy friend who will stay with us a while dick obeyed and frank followed his host into the house here he was introduced to mrs hamlin a motherlylooking woman and annie and grace younger sisters of dick i am glad to see you said mrs hamlin to our hero after a brief explanation from her husband we will try to make you comfortable thank you said frank i am sure i shall feel at home the house was better furnished than might have been anticipated when mr hamlin left chicago he had some money saved up and he furnished his house in a comfortable manner it was not however the furniture that attracted franks attention so much as the books papers and pictures that gave the rooms a homelike appearance i shall be much better off here than i would have been at the tavern he thought this seems like home i see said mr hamlin that you are surprised to see so many books and pictures i admit that my house does not look like the house of a poor man who has to struggle for the mere necessaries of life but books and periodicals we have always classed among the necessities and i am sure we would all rather limit ourselves to dry bread for two out of the three meals than to give up this food for the mind i think you are a very sensible man mr hamlin said frank i couldnt get along without something to read not in this outoftheway place at any rate said mr hamlin nothing can be more dismal than the homes of some of my neighbors who spend as much or more than i do every year yet they consider me extravagant because i buy books and subscribe for periodicals by this time dick came in from the barn dick said his father this is frank courtney who comes from chicago on a business errand he is a traveling merchant in other words a peddler said frank with a smile ready to give the good people in jackson a chance to buy stationery at reasonable prices he will board with us while he is canvassing the neighborhood and i expect you and he will become great friends i think we shall said frank dick was a little shy but a few minutes set him quite at ease with his new acquaintance after supper frank said dick if you are at leisure i wish you would take a walk about the village with me i want to see how it looks all right said dick when the two left the house the country boy began to ask questions how do you like your business he asked not very well answered frank i do not think i shall stay in it very long do you sell enough to make your expenses asked dick no but i am not wholly dependent on my sales i have a little income a hundred dollars a year paid me by my stepfather i wish i had as much it seems a good deal to me it doesnt go very far what are you intending to be dick i suppose i shall have to be a farmer though i dont like it what would you like to be i should like to get an education said dick his eyes lighting up i should like to study latin and greek and go to college then i could be a teacher or a lawyer but there is no chance of that he added his voice falling dont be too sure of that dick said frank frank hopefully something may turn up in your favor nothing ever does turn up in jackson said the boy in a tone of discouragement father is a poor man and has hard work to get along he can give me no help isnt the farm productive there is no trouble about that but he has to pay too high a rent its all the fault of fairfield the agent yes your father was telling me about him now if your father were in his place i suppose he could give you the advantages you wish oh yes there would be no trouble then i am sure he would make a better and more popular agent than mr fairfield but there is no use thinking about that i expected myself to go to college said frank in fact i have studied latin and greek and in less than a year i could be ready to enter why dont you asked dick you forget that i am a poor peddler then how were you able to get so good an education asked dick in surprise because i was once better off than i am now the fact is dick he added i have seen better days but when i was reduced to poverty i gave up hopes of college education and became what i am wasnt it hard not so much as you might suppose my home was not happy i have a stepfather and stepbrother neither of whom i like in fact there is no love lost between us i was not obliged to leave home but under the circumstances i preferred to where are your stepfather and your stepbrother now they are traveling in europe while you are working hard for a living that does not seem to be just we must make the best of circumstances dick whose is that large house on the left that belongs to mr fairfield he seems to live nicely yes he has improved and enlarged the house a good deal since he moved into it at mrs percivals expense i suppose he seems to have pretty much his own way here said frank yes mr percival never comes to jackson and i suppose he believes all that the agent tells him he may get found out some time i wish he might it would be a great blessing to jackson if he were removed and a good man were put in his place that may happen some day not very likely i am afraid at this moment mr fairfield himself came out of his front gate hello hamlin he said roughly to dick is your father at home yes sir i have something to say to him i think i will call round you will find him at home sir dick said frank when the agent had passed on do you mind going back what you tell me makes me rather curious about mr fairfield at your house i may get a chance to see something of him let us go back then said dick but i dont think frank that you will care much about keeping up the acquaintance perhaps not but i shall gratify my curiosity the two boys turned and followed the agent closely they reached the house about five minutes after mr fairfield chapter xxxvi mr fairfield the agent the two boys found mr fairfield already seated in the most comfortable chair in the sitting room he looked inquiringly at frank when he entered with dick who is that boy hamlin inquired the agent nephew of yours no sir it is a young man who has come to jackson on business what kind of business i sell stationery frank answered for himself oh a peddler said the agent contemptuously many of our most successful men began in that way said mr hamlin fearing lest franks feelings might be hurt i never encourage peddlers myself said mr fairfield pompously then i suppose it will be of no use for me to call at your door said frank who in place of being mortified was amused by the agents arrogance i should say not unless your back is proof against a broomstick answered fairfield coarsely i tell my servant to treat all who call in that way i wont put her to the trouble of using it said frank disgusted at the mans ill manners thats where you are wise yes wise and prudent young man and now hamlin said the agent i may as well come to business to business repeated the farmer rather surprised for there was no rent due for a month yes to business said fairfield i came to give you notice that after the next payment i shall feel obliged to raise your rent raise my rent exclaimed the farmer in genuine dismay i am already paying a considerably higher rent than i paid to your predecessor cant help it old sampson was a slowgoing old fogy he didnt do his duty by his employer when i came in i turned over a new leaf i certainly got along better in his time no doubt he was a great deal too easy with you didnt do his duty sir wasnt sharp enough thats all you certainly cannot be in earnest in raising my rent mr fairfield said the farmer uneasily i certainly am i cant live at all if you increase my rent which is already larger than i can afford to pay mr fairfield then i must find a tenant who can and will said the agent emphatically i am sure mr percival cant understand the true state of the case or the circumstances of his tenants will you give me his address and i will take the liberty of writing to him and respectfully remonstrate against any increase mr fairfield looked uneasy this appeal would not at all suit him yet how could he object without leading to the suspicion that he was acting in this matter wholly on his own responsibility and not by the express orders of his principal how could he refuse to furnish mr percivals address a middle course occurred to him you may write your appeal if you like hamlin he said and hand it to me i will forward it though i dont believe it will do any good the fact is that mr percival has made up his mind to have more income from his property in jackson chapter xxxvii frank receives a letter from mr percival while frank was waiting for an answer to a letter to mr percival he devoted part of his time to the business which was supposed to be his only reason for remaining in jackson i am bound to say that as regards this business his trip might be pronounced a failure there was little ready money in jackson many of the people were tenants of mr percival and found it difficult to pay the excessive rents demanded by his agent of course they had no money to spare for extras even if they had been better off there was little demand for stationery in the village the people were chiefly farmers and did not indulge in much correspondence when frank returned to his boarding place on the afternoon of the first day mr hamlin asked him not without solicitude with what luck he had met i have sold twentyfive cents worth of note paper answered frank with a smile mr hamlin looked troubled how many places did you call at he inquired about a dozen i am afraid you will get discouraged if you dont do better you wont begin to pay expenses that is true but perhaps you may do better tomorrow i hope so i wish you could find something in jackson that would induce you to remain here permanently and make your home with us i would charge you only the bare cost of board thank you very much mr hamlin i should enjoy being with you but i dont believe i shall find any opening here besides i like a more stirring life no doubt no doubt boys like a lively place well i am glad you feel independent of your business for a little time i am afraid it wouldnt do for me to earn so little for any length of time frank enjoyed the society of dick hamlin together they went fishing and hunting and a mutual liking sprang up between them i wish you were going to stay longer frank said dick i shall feel very lonely when you are gone we may meet again under different circumstances said frank while i am here we will enjoy ourselves as well as we can so the days passed and at length a letter came from mr percival i append the most important passages your report is clear and i have perfect confidence in your statement mr fairfield has abused my confidence and oppressed my tenants and i shall dismiss him i am glad you have found in jackson a man who is capable of succeeding him solely upon your recommendation i shall appoint mr hamlin my resident agent and representative for the term of six months should he acquit himself to my satisfaction he will be continued in the position i am prepared to offer him one hundred dollars a month if that will content him upon receipt of this letter and the accompanying legal authority you may call upon mr fairfield and require him to transfer his office and the papers and accounts connected with it to mr hamlin i inclose a check for three hundred dollars payable to your order which you may make payable to him in lieu of three months notice provided he immediately surrenders his office should he not i shall dismiss him summarily and proceed against him for the moneys he has misappropriated to his own use and you may so inform him with this letter was a letter to mr fairfield of the same purport and a paper appointing mr hamlin agent when this letter was received frank was overjoyed knowing how much pleasure he was about to give his new friends with this appointment and salary mr hamlin would consider himself a rich man and dicks hope for a liberal education might be realized the letter came just before supper and at the close of the evening meal frank determined to inform his friends of their good fortune mr hamlin said he i have some good news for you indeed said the farmer surprised your rent will not be increased but how do you know this has mr fairfield told you so no answered frank i have a question to ask would you be willing to take mr fairfields place at a hundred dollars a month willing i should be delighted to do so but why do you say this because answered frank quietly i am authorized to offer it to you at that salary the whole family looked at frank in bewildered surprise it occurred to them that he might have become crazy you exclaimed the farmer what can you have to do with the agency frank explained to a very happy family group and then he and mr hamlin set out for the house of the agent chapter xxxviii the agent is notified it was still early in the evening when frank and mr hamlin reached the house of the agent had they come five minutes later they would have found him absent usually soon after supper he made his way to the tavern where he spent his time and money in a very unprofitable way the agent was surprised when his two visitors made their appearance what brings you here hamlin he asked with scant ceremony i come on a little matter of business answered mr hamlin gravely mr fairfield concluded that the farmer had come to make an appeal to have his rent continued at the old rates and answered impatiently i dont think it will be of much use my mind is made up have you come on business also he asked turning to frank with a sneer yes sir answered our hero quietly that will be of no use either said the agent i am not in want of stationery and if i were i should not buy of a peddler i have not come here to sell stationery mr fairfield said frank then may i take the liberty of asking what is your business here i come on the same business as mr hamlin answered frank who preferred that his companion should introduce the subject look here i have no time for trifling said mr fairfield angrily i am going out and can only spare you five minutes mr fairfield i would advise you not to go out till you have heard what i have to say said the farmer in a meaning tone i certainly shall you can call some other time another time will not do look here sir do you know to whom you are talking how dare you use such a tone to mr percivals representative i suppose you dont always expect to be mr percivals representative i suppose i shall die sometime if thats what you mean but i am not dead yet as you will find to pay you for your impertinence i shall increase your rent more than i intended ill drive you out of town thats what ill do this was accompanied by an angry stamp of the foot which however did not frighten mr hamlin much i shall not pay a dollar more rent nor shall i leave the farm i occupy returned mr hamlin whose patience was exhausted by the rough insolence of the man before him so you defy me do you demanded fairfield furiously i shall resist your injustice sir or rather i would do so if you were able to carry out your threat luckily you have not the power have not the power you will see if i have not the power roared the angry agent i give you notice that at the end of the quarter you must go at any rate after your insolence i wont let you stay on any terms i wouldnt let you stay if you would pay double the rent do you hear me hamlin yes i hear you mr fairfield looked at the farmer in surprise the latter seemed perfectly calm and undisturbed by his threat though it was of the most serious nature he had expected to see him humbled and to hear him entreat a reversal of the sentence but his tenant was thoroughly selfpossessed and appeared to care nothing for the agents threats you need not expect that i will change my mind he added out of jackson you must go i know there is no other farm which you can hire and while i am mr percivals agent you need expect no favors from me i dont expect any while you are mr percivals agent said mr hamlin there was something in the farmers tone that arrested the agents attention and excited his curiosity though it did not awaken his alarm and he could not help saying then what do you expect do you think i am going to die i dont expect that you will die or resign mr fairfield you may be removed have you been writing to mr percival exclaimed fairfield in mingled anger and apprehension no sir i have not communicated with him in any way you would not give me his address of course i would not said the agent feeling relieved it would be mere impertinence for you to write to him fortunately there is no immediate occasion for me to do so as he has sent a representative here to investigate your official conduct a representative exclaimed fairfield now thoroughly startled where is he i have not seen him he is present said mr hamlin indicating frank the agent broke into a scornful laugh you why you are a peddler only in appearance mr fairfield i assumed that business in order not to attract attention or excite suspicion i am really mr percivals private secretary as i can prove to your satisfaction is this true he asked in a changed voice yes sir quite true have you written to mr percival yes sir and this afternoon i received a letter from him what did he write asked fairfield in a husky voice for he was convinced now that frank spoke the truth he removes you inclosing a check of three hundred dollars in place of notice and appoints mr hamlin in your place will you read this letter sir it was enough fairfield knew that his management would not stand investigation and he yielded with a bad grace mr hamlin the next day to the great joy of the villagers made known his appointment fairfield left town and drifted to california where he became an adventurer living in a miserable and precarious manner mr hamlin moved into his fine house and dick was sent to a school to prepare for college the next day frank started on his return to new york chapter xxxix an important discovery on his return to new york frank had no reason to be dissatisfied with his reception from mr percival to freddie all the family seemed delighted to see him you mustnt go away again frank said little freddie i wanted to see you ever so much and i wanted to see you freddie said our hero his heart warming to the little boy you wont go away again will you frank not if i can help it freddie we are all glad to see you back frank said his employer but you have justified my opinion of you by your success some of my friends ridiculed me for sending a boy on such an important mission but i dont believe any of them would have succeeded any better than you if as well i am glad you are satisfied with me sir said frank very much gratified by the commendation of his employer i feel that you have done a great service and indeed i dont know whom i could have sent in your place however i am glad to see you back again i have missed you about my letters and have postponed answering some till my young secretary returned frank resumed his regular employment and three months passed without anything that needs to be recorded at the end of that time frank received an important letter from col vincent which gave him much food for thought the letter was as follows dear frank for some time past i have been intending to write to you but i have delayed for no good reason now however i am led to write by a surprising discovery which has just been made in your old home which may be of material importance to you when your stepfather went away he requested me to have an eye to the estate and order whatever i might think necessary to be done i am not as you know a very cordial friend of mr mannings but i have always regarded the property as of right belonging to you that is since your mothers death and so accepted the commission a few days since i went over the house and found that it was quite dirty where the dirt could come from in an unoccupied house i cant tell but at all events i felt justified in engaging a woman to clean the paint so if any of you should return unexpectedly you would find the house fit to receive you this was a very simple matter you will think and scarcely needs mentioning but my dear frank events of importance often hinge on trifles and so it has proved in the present instance on the evening of the second day i received a call from mrs noonan whom i had employed to scrub the house she had in her hand a folded paper which she gave to me here is something i found sir while i was scrubbing she said i opened it indifferently but conceive of my amazement when i found it to be your mothers will properly signed sealed and witnessed of course it was not the will which mr manning presented for probate this will gave mr manning ten thousand dollars and the residue of the property to you except a small amount bestowed upon richard green the coachman and deborah sums larger by the way than those mentioned in the will which was read after your mothers death there was more to colonel vincents letter frank showed it to mr percival and readily obtained permission to take a few days vacation i hope you will get back the estate frank said mr percival though i dont know what i shall do without my secretary that need not separate us mr percival said our hero i have no home but this chapter xl jonas barton frank started for his old home on saturday afternoon he would arrive in time for supper at the house of his fathers friend the train was well filled and he was obliged to share his seat with a shabbily dressed young man with whom a single glance showed him he was not likely to sympathize the shabby suit did not repel him at all he was too sensible for that but there was a furtive look in the mans face which seemed to indicate that he was not frank and straightforward but had something to conceal half the journey passed without a word between the two then his companion glancing at frank opened a conversation by remarking that it was a fine day very answered frank laconically a pleasant day to travel yes do you go far frank mentioned his destination his companion seemed to have his interest awakened do you know a mr manning living in your town he asked he is my stepfather said frank then you are frank courtney said his new acquaintance quickly i am pardon me but i think your mother died recently yes and the property was left chiefly to mr manning yes of course you were surprised and probably very disappointed excuse me said frank coldly but i am not in the habit of discussing my affairs with strangers quite right but i think you will find it for your interest to discuss them with me not in a public car of course but i have something of importance to communicate where can i have a private interview with you it at once occurred to frank that there was an opportunity perhaps to solve the mystery concerning the will this man might know nothing about it but on the other hand he might know everything it would be foolish to repulse him if you have anything important to tell me i shall be glad to hear it he said i am going to the house of my friend col vincent to pass a few days do you know where he lives yes i know if you will call this evening after supper i shall be glad to see you i will do so i will be there at eight oclock sharp on arriving at his destination frank found the colonels carriage waiting for him at the station col vincent was inside welcome frank he said grasping heartily the hand of our young hero i am delighted to see you you are looking well and bless me how you have grown thank you col vincent do you expect me to return the compliment about having grown no frank i hope not i am six feet one and dont care to grow any taller well what do you think of the news i have some for you colonel and frank mentioned what his new acquaintance had told him the missing link exclaimed the colonel excited do you know what i think what that this man either forged the will which gives the property to your stepfather or is cognizant of it i thought of that i shall be impatient to see him at eight oclock the man called and gave his name as jonas barton whether it was the right name might be a question but this did not matter i understand said col vincent that you have some information to give us i have and that of a very important nature is it of a nature to restore to my young friend here his property now in the possession of mr manning if it were said jonas barton with a cunning glance of his left eye how much would it be worth i supposed it was for sale said the colonel quietly what is your own idea i will take two thousand dollars suppose we say one thousand it is not enough were you aware that the genuine will had been found asked the colonel quietly jonas barton started i thought mr manning destroyed it he said hastily no he concealed it is this true yes you see that a part of your information has been forestalled he was a fool then and still more a fool to refuse my last demand for money i accept your offer of a thousand dollars and will tell all go on i wrote the will which mr manning presented for probate it was copied in part from the genuine will good and you betray him because he will not pay what you consider the service worth yes sir jonas barton here gave a full account of mr manning whom he had formerly known in new york seeking him out and proposing to him a job for which he was willing to pay five hundred dollars barton was not scrupulous and readily agreed to do the work he was skillful with the pen and did his work so well that all were deceived you will be willing to swear to this in court yes sir if you will guarantee the sum you proposed i will i shall wish you to find a boarding place in the village and remain here for the present so as to be ready when needed i will be responsible for your board as jonas barton was leaving the house one of the servants came in with important news in which frank was strongly interested chapter xli conclusion the news was that mr manning and mark had just arrived at the cedars they had come by the last evening train why they had come back so unexpectedly no one knew but the servant had heard that mark was in poor health this was true mark in europe had proved uncontrollable he had given way to his natural love of drink had kept late hours and had seriously injured his constitution in consequence of these excesses he had contracted a fever which alarmed him father and induced him to take the first steamer home we wont call upon your stepfather this evening frank said col vincent but early monday morning we will bring matters to a crisis mr manning did not hear of franks presence in the village he was fatigued with his rapid travel and kept at home besides mark was prostrated by his journey and didnt wish to be left alone it was therefore a surprise to mr manning when on monday morning col vincent was ushered into his presence accompanied by frank really colonel he said recovering his composure you are very kind to call so soon i hope you are well frank are you staying with the colonel you must come back to your old home thank you mr manning but i am living in new york i am only passing a day or two with the colonel it is very friendly in you to call col vincent mr manning said col vincent gravely i am not willing to receive undeserved credit let me say therefore that this is a business not a friendly call indeed said manning uneasily the business is connected with my young friend frank i am ready to listen said mr manning if frank wants a larger allowance i am ready to give it i venture to say for him that he will not be satisfied with that let me come to the point at once mr manning mrs mannings will has been found mr manning started perceptibly and his glance involuntarily wandered to that part of the wall behind which the will was discovered for they were sitting in the very apartment where mrs noonan had stumbled upon it what do you mean sir a will has been found leaving the bulk of the property to frank indeed i am surprised is it a later will than the one which bequeathed the estate to me asked mr manning pointedly it is mrs mannings latest genuine will said col vincent emphatically mr manning started to his feet he could not help understanding the colonels meaning it would have been idle to pretend it what do you mean col vincent he asked in a tone which he tried to make one of dignified resentment i mean that mrs manning made but one will and that this bequeaths the property to frank how then do you account for the later will which was admitted to probate in this way it was not what it purported to be mr mannings sallow face flushed what do you mean to insinuate he asked that the last will was forged said col vincent bluntly this is a very serious charge said mr manning unable to repress his agitation you must allow me to say that i shall pay no attention to it when you furnish proof of what you assert it will be time enough to meet it and now gentlemen if you have nothing further to say i will bid you goodmorning i think you will find it best not to be in a hurry mr manning said col vincent the charge must be met here and now i charge you with instigating and being cognizant of the fraud that has been perpetrated on what grounds sir do you know i can sue you for libel you are welcome to do so mr manning i have a witness who will clear me who is he jonas barton if a bombshell had exploded in the room mr manning could not have looked paler or more thoroughly dismayed yet he tried to keep up a little longer i dont know any man of that name he answered faintly your looks show that you do i may as well tell you mr manning that resistance is useless we can overwhelm you with proof if we take the matter before the courts but we do not care to do so we have something to propose what is it said mr manning faintly the genuine will must be substituted for the fraudulent one by it you will receive ten thousand dollars and frank will consent that you shall receive it he will not ask you to account for the sums you have wrongfully spent during the last year and will promise not to prosecute you provided you leave this neighborhood and never return to it or in any way interfere with him to insure this we shall have jonas bartons written confession attested before a justice of the peace ready for use if needful do you accept i must said mr manning despondently but i shall be a poor man no man who has health and the use of his facilities is poor with ten thousand dollars answered the colonel mark alone will spend more than the interest of this sum then you must prevent him he will be better off if he has to earn his living as frank has done for the last year in less than a week the transfer was made and frank recovered his patrimony mr manning and mark went to chicago and perhaps further west but nothing has been heard from them for years frank didnt return to the cedars the place was let until he should wish to return to it by the advice of col vincent he resumed his preparation for college and graduating in due time commenced the study of law though rich enough to do without a profession he felt that he should not be content to lead an aimless life he obtained for his school friend herbert grant the post of private secretary to mr percival and herbert became nearly as great a favorite as himself through mr percivals kindness herbert was enabled while still living at his house and attending to his duties as secretary to enter columbia college and complete his course there graduating with honor herbert selected the medical profession and when he has completed his studies will go abroad for a year with frank at the latters expense and returning open an office in new york while he is waiting for the patients and frank for clients the two will live together and their common expenses will be defrayed by frank if i didnt like you so well frank said herbert i would not accept this great favor at your hands but since we are dear friends interrupts frank with a smile i know that you enjoy giving even more than i do the receiving enough herbert we understand each other i have no brother herbert and if i had i could not care more for him than i do for you without you i should feel alone in the world frank does not regret the year in which he was thrown upon his own resources it gave him strength and selfreliance and however long he may live he will not cease to remember with pleasure the year in which he was making his way the end
