 part one sherlock holmes did not like aimless physical exercise but one spring day i persuaded him to go for a walk with me in the park we walked for two hours and it was almost five when we returned to baker street i beg your pardon sir said our pageboy as we entered there was a man waiting for you he was a very restless gentleman he walked all around the room saying isnt mr holmes going to return finally he left you see holmes said to me i needed a case and now i have lost this one because we went for a walk in the park hullo thats not your pipe on the table well that man must have a very big problem because he left his pipe it is obvious that he likes this particular pipe very much how do you know that he likes it very much i asked well explained holmes i think this pipe costs around sevenandsixpence now look it has been mended twice with silver bands that probably cost more than the pipe itself so this man must like his pipe very much if he prefers to mend it instead of buying a new one with the same money just then as holmes was talking we heard someone walking up the stairs and then a man walked into the room without knocking i beg your pardon said the man i should have knocked but i am very upset and i need help the man then took off his hat and sat down on a chair my dear mr grant munro began holmes our visitor jumped from his chair what he cried you know my name if you want to preserve your incognito said holmes smiling then you should not write your name on the inside of your hat or else you should turn the inside of your hat away from the person whom you are addressing anyway my friend and i have heard many strange secrets in this room and we have had the fortune to help many people please tell us the facts of your case the facts are these mr holmes he said i have been married for three years and my wife and i were very happy until last monday suddenly a barrier appeared between us and she has become like a stranger to me i want to know why but mr holmes i am sure that my wife loves me please let me have the facts mr munro said holmes with some impatience effie my wife was a young widow only twentyfive years old when i met her her name then was mrs hebron she went to america when she was very young and lived in the town of atlanta where she married a man called hebron who was a lawyer they had one child but there was a yellow fever epidemic there and both her husband and child died of it i have seen his death certificate after this tragedy she decided to leave america and come back to england to live with her aunt i should also mention that her husband left her a large amount of money this money was invested and she can live very well with the income from it she met me after six months in england we fell in love with each other and we married a few weeks afterwards i am a hop merchant and i too have a good income we rented a nice house in the country near norbury there is an inn and two houses near our house and a single cottage across the field in front of our house until this recent incident my wife and i lived very happily there there is one more thing i should tell you when we married my wife put all her money in my name i did not think this was a good idea but she insisted well about six weeks ago she came and asked me for some jack she said when you took my money you said that if i ever wanted some i should just ask you certainly i said its your money how much do you want one hundred pounds i she said what for i asked very surprised by the large amount oh she said playfully you said that you were only my banker and bankers never ask questions you know i was not happy about this because this was the first time that there was a secret between us i gave her the cheque and forgot about the matter it may have nothing to do with what happened afterwards but i thought that i should mention it anyway i told you that there is a cottage near our house well i like walking past that cottage and last monday as i walked past the cott age i saw an empty van going away from the cottage and furniture in front of the cottage someone was finally going to live there i was looking at the cottage when suddenly i saw a face watching me from an upper window there was something strange about the face mr holmes that frightened me i was not very near but there was something unnatural and inhuman about the face it was yellow and rigid i walked closer to the house but the face suddenly disappeared then i went to the door and knocked a tall woman answered the door i told her that i was her neighbour and asked her if she needed any help if we need any help well call you she said and shut the door in my face that night i did not tell my wife about the strange face and the rude woman but i did tell her that people were now living in the cottage that same night something strange happened in the middle of the night when i was not completely asleep i became aware that my wife was dressed and was leaving the room she looked very frightened and nervous i waited for about twenty minutes and then she returned where have you been effie i asked as she entered she moved back quickly with fright are you awake jack she cried with a nervous laugh she told me that she had wanted some fresh air but i did not believe her what was my wife hiding from me the next day i had to go to the city but i was so worried about my wife that i returned early to norbury at about one oclock walking home i went past the cottage i stopped for a minute in front of it to look for that strange face as i stood there imagine my surprise mr holmes when the door suddenly opened and my wife walked out oh jack she said i came here to see if our new neighbours needed anything why are you looking at me like that are you angry with me so i said this is where you went during the night what do you mean she cried you came here i am sure of it who are these people i have not been here before i know you are not telling me the truth i am going to enter the cottage and discover the truth please dont go in jack she cried i promise that i will tell you everything some day but if you enter now you will cause great sadness then she held me tightly and i tried to push her off trust me jack she cried you will not be sorry if you come home with me all will be well if you force your way into that cottage our marriage is finished i will trust you i said if you promise never to come here again she was greatly relieved then as we started to leave i looked up and there was that yellow face watching us out of the upper window what link could there be between that creature and my wife after that everything went well but one day i returned home early i discovered that my wife had been to the cottage again so i went to the cottage i walked into the house and found no one but upstairs i found a comfortable room and on the mantelpiece stood a fulllength photograph of my wife i am sure that our maid had warned them that i was arriving and they all went away that is why i didnt find anyone there when i saw my wife again i told her that there could be no peace between us until she told me the truth that was yesterday mr holmes and then i decided to come and see you for help after hearing this strange story holmes sat silent for a few minutes thinking then he said are you sure that the yellow face was a mans face each time i saw it he replied i saw it from a distance so i am not sure when did your wife ask you for the money asked holmes almost two months ago have you ever seen a photograph of her first husband no there was a great fire in atlanta after her husbands death and all her papers were destroyed and yet she had a death certificate have you ever seen it yes she got a duplicate after the fire have you ever met anyone who knew your wife in america no has she ever talked about visiting america again no has she ever received letters from there no i dont think so thank you concluded holmes now go back to norbury and when you see that those people have returned to the cottage call us it will be easy to solve this mystery part two then mr grant munro left and holmes and i discussed the case i am afraid that this is a case of blackmail said holmes and who is the blackmailer i asked well it must be that creature with the yellow face upon my word watson there is something very attractive about that yellow face at the window and i would not miss this case for worlds have you got a theory i asked yes holmes replied i think her first husband is in the cottage this is what i think happened this woman was married in america her husband got a terrible disease that is why he has that horrible yellow face she ran away from him at last and came back to england where she changed her name and started a new life after three years of marriage she feels safe again but her first husband or some unscrupulous woman attached to him discovers where she lives they write to her and tell her to send them a hundred pounds or they will tell her new husband everything when her husband tells her that someone is living in the cottage she knows that they are her blackmailers in the middle of the night while her husband is sleeping she decides to go to the cottage that night she is not able to convince her blackmailers to leave her alone so she returns ihe next day that was when her husband saw her coming out of the house she then promises her husband that she will not return but she wants to get rid of her blackmailers she decides to go again and this time she brings a photograph which they probably asked her for fortunately for her her maid warns her that her husband is coming and she and her blackmailers leave the house in time now we can do nothing except wait for mr munro to call us and then we will see if my theory is correct we did not have to wait long after tea we received a message from mr munro saying there are people in the house that night holmes and i took a train to norbury mr munro was waiting for us at the station and he took us to the cottage when we arrived there holmes asked mr munro if he was sure he wanted to enter the cottage mr munro said he was sure and we went to the door of the cottage as we approached the door a woman suddenly appeared it was effie for gods sake dont jack she cried trust me i have trusted you too long effie he cried sternly let go of me my friends and i are going to solve this mystery we rushed up the stairs to the lighted room in one corner there was a desk and at that desk there was a desk and at that desk there appeared to be a little girl her face was turned away from us when we entered the room but we could see she was wearing a red dress and long white gloves she turned around to us and i gave a cry of surprise and horror her face was the strangest yellow colour and it had absolutely no expression a moment later the mystery was explained holmes with a laugh put his hand behind the ear of the little girl and pulled off the mask and there was a little coalblack girl she laughed and i laughed too but grant munro stood staring with his hand holding his throat my god he cried what does this mean i will tell you everything cried his wife with a proud face you have forced me and now we must both accept the situation my husband died at atlanta my child survived your child cried grant munro she pulled out a locket and inside the locket was the picture of a very handsome and intelligent man but a man who was obviously of african descent this is john hebron of atlanta said mrs munro and he was a very noble man i cut myself off from my race to marry him but i never regretted it for a moment unfortunately our only child took after his people rather than mine she is very dark but she is my dear little girl when the little girl heard these words she ran to her mother i left her in america with a trusted servant mrs munro continued because she was not very healthy but i never considered abandoning her when i met you by chance and learned to love you i was afraid to tell you about my child i was afraid to lose you i kept her existence a secret from you for three years but finally i had to see my little girl i sent the servant a hundred pounds and told her to come to this cottage i took every possible precaution so that there would not be gossip about a little black girl that is why she wore that yellow mask you told me about her arrival in the cottage and that night i had to see her and that was the beginning of my troubles and now tonight you know everything what are you going to do about me and my child mr grant munro did not say anything for two minutes and his answer was one of which i love to think he lifted the little child kissed her and with the little girl in his arms he gave his other hand to his wife we can talk it over more comfortably at home he said i am not a very good man effie but i think that i am better than you thought we all left the cottage together and then holmes and i returned to london we did not say another word about the case until late that night at holmes house in baker street just before holmes went to bed watson he said if you should ever think that i am becoming too confident in my powers or that i am not working hard enough on a particular case please whisper norbury in my ear and i will be infinitely obliged to you the end
