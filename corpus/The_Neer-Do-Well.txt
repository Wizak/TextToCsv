neerdowell i victory it was a crisp november night the artificial brilliance of broadway was rivalled by a glorious moonlit sky the first autumn frost was in the air and on the sidestreets long rows of taxicabs were standing their motors blanketed their chauffeurs threshing their arms to rout the cold a few wellbundled cabbies perched upon oldstyle hansoms were barking at the stream of hurrying pedestrians against a background of lesser lights myriad points of electric signs flashed into everchanging shapes winking like huge distorted eyes fanciful designs of liquid fire ran up and down the walls or blazed forth in lurid colors from the citys canons came an incessant clanging roar as if a great river of brass and steel were grinding its way toward the sea crowds began to issue from the theatres and the lines of waiting vehicles broke up filling the streets with the whir of machinery and the clatter of hoofs a horde of shrillvoiced urchins pierced the confusion waving their papers and screaming the football scores at the tops of their lusty lungs while above it all rose the hoarse tones of carriage callers the commands of traffic officers and the din of streetcar gongs in the lobby of one of the playhouses a woman paused to adjust her wraps and hearing the cries of the newsboys petulantly exclaimed im absolutely sick of football that performance during the third act was enough to disgust one her escort smiled oh you take it too seriously he said those boys dont mean anything that was merely youth irrepressible youth on a tear you wouldnt spoil the fun it may have been youth returned his companion but it sounded more like the end of the world it was a little too much a bevy of shopgirls came bustling forth from a gallery exit rah rah rah they mimicked whereupon the cry was answered by a hundred throats as the doors belched forth the football players and their friends out they came tumbling pushing jostling greeting scowls and smiles with grins of insolent goodhumor in their hands were decorated walkingsticks and flags ragged and tattered as if from long use in a heavy gale dignified old gentlemen dived among them in pursuit of tophats hysterical matrons hustled daughters into carriages and slammed the doors wuxtry wuxtry shrilled the newsboys full account of the big game a youth with a ridiculous little hat and heliotrope socks dashed into the street where facing the crowd he led a battle song of his university policemen set their shoulders to the mob but though they met with no open resistance they might as well have tried to dislodge a thicket of saplings tonight football was king out through the crowd came a score of deepchested young men moving together as if to resist an attack whereupon a mighty roar went up the cheerleader increased his antics and the barking yell changed to a measured chant to the time of which the army marched down the street until the twenty athletes dodged in through the revolving doors of a cafe leaving broadway rocking with the tumult all the city was footballmad it seemed for no sooner had the newcomers entered the restaurant than the diners rose to wave napkins or to cheer men stepped upon chairs and craned for a better sight of them women raised their voices in eager questioning a gentleman in evening dress pointed out the leader of the squad to his companions explaining that is anthony the big chap hes darwin k anthonys son youve heard about the anthony bill at albany yes and i saw this fellow play football four years ago say that was a game hes a worthless sort of chap isnt he remarked one of the women when the squad had disappeared up the stairs just a rich mans son thats all but he certainly could play football didnt i read that he had been sent to jail recently no doubt he was given thirty days what in prison questioned another in a shocked voice only for speeding it was his third offence and his father let him take his medicine how cruel old man anthony doesnt care for this sort of thing hes right too all this young fellow is good for is to spend money up in the banquethall however it was evident that kirk anthony was more highly esteemed by his mates than by the public at large he was their hero in fact and in a way he deserved it for three years before his graduation he had been the heart and sinew of the university team and for the four years following he had coached them preferring the life of an athletic trainer to the career his father had offered him and he had done his chosen work well only three weeks prior to the hard gruel of the great game the eleven had received a blow that had left its supporters dazed and despairing there had been a scandal of which the public had heard little and the students scarcely more resulting in the expulsion of the five best players of the team the crisis might have daunted the most resourceful of men yet anthony had proved equal to it for twentyone days he had labored like a real general spending his nights alone with diagrams and little dummies on a miniature gridiron his days in careful coaching he had taken a huge ungainly nova scotian lad named ringold for centre he had placed a squarejawed towheaded boy from duluth in the line he had selected a highstrung unseasoned chap who for two years had been eating his heart out on the sidelines and made him into a quarterback then he had driven them all with the cruelty of a cossack captain and when at last the dusk of this november day had settled new football history had been made the world had seen a strange team snatch victory from defeat and not one of all the thirty thousand onlookers but knew to whom the credit belonged it had been a tremendous spectacle and when the final whistle blew for the multitude to come roaring down across the field the cohorts had paid homage to kirk anthony the weary coach to whom they knew the honor belonged of course this fervid enthusiasm and heroworship was all very immature very foolish as the general public acknowledged after it had taken time to cool off yet there was something appealing about it after all at any rate the press deemed the public sufficiently interested in the subject to warrant giving it considerable prominence and the name of darwin k anthonys son was published far and wide naturally the newspapers gave the young mans story as well as a history of the game they told of his disagreement with his father of the anthony antifootball bill which the old man in his rage had driven through the legislature and up to the governor himself some of them even printed a rehash of the railroad mans famous magazine attack on the modern college in which he all but cited his own son as an example of the havoc wrought by presentday university methods the elder anthonys wealth and position made it good copy the yellow journals liked it immensely and strangely enough notwithstanding the positiveness with which the newspapers spoke the facts agreed essentially with their statements darwin k anthony and his son had quarrelled they were estranged the young man did prefer idleness to industry exactly as the published narratives related he toiled not at all he spun nothing but excuses he arrayed himself in sartorial glory and drove a yellow racingcar beyond the speed limit it was all true only incomplete kirk anthonys father had even better reasons for his disapproval of the young mans behavior than appeared the fact was that kirks associates were of a sort to worry any observant parent and moreover he had acquired a renown in that part of new york lying immediately west of broadway and north of twentysixth street which in his fathers opinion added not at all to the lustre of the family name in particular anthony sr was prejudiced against a certain higgins who of course was his sons boon companion aid and abettor this young gentleman was a lean horsefaced senior whose unbroken solemnity of manner had more than once led strangers to mistake him for a divinity student though closer acquaintance proved him wholly unmoral and rattlebrained mr higgins possessed a distorted sense of humor and a crooked outlook upon life while so far as had been discovered he owned but two ambitions one to whip a policeman the other to write a musical comedy neither seemed likely of realization as for the first he was narrowchested and gangling while a brief disastrous experience on the college paper had furnished a sad commentary upon the second not to exaggerate darwin k anthony the father saw in the person of adelbert higgins a budding criminal of rare precocity and a menace to his son while to the object of his solicitude the aforesaid criminal was nothing more than an entertaining companion whose bizarre disregard of all established rules of right and wrong matched well with his own careless temper higgins moreover was an ardent follower of athletics revolving like a satellite about the football stars and attaching himself especially to kirk who was too goodnatured to find fault with an honest admirer it was higgins this evening who after the cripples had deserted and the supper party had dwindled to perhaps a dozen proposed to make a night of it it was always higgins who proposed to make a night of it and now as usual his words were greeted with enthusiasm having obtained the floor he gazed owlishly over the flushed faces around the table and said i wish to announce that in our little journey to the underworld we will visit some places of rare interest and educational value first we will go to the house of seven turnings no poetry hig some one cried what is it it is merely a rendezvous of pickpockets and thieves accessible only to a chosen few i feel sure you will enjoy yourselves there for the bartender has the secret of a remarkable gin fizz sweeter than a maidens smile more intoxicating than a kiss piffle it is a place where the student of sociology can obtain a world of valuable information how do we get in leave that to old doctor higgins anthony laughed to get out is the difficulty oh i guess well get out said the bulky ringold after we have concluded our investigations at the house of seven turnings continued the ceremonious higgins we will go to the palace of ebony where a full negro orchestra the police closed that a week ago but it has reopened on a scale larger and grander than ever lets take in the austrian village offered ringold patiently patiently behemoth well take em all in however i wish to request one favor if by any chance i should become embroiled with a minion of the law please oh please let me finish him remember the last time cautioned anthony youve never come home a winner enough away with painful memories all in favor aye yelled the diners whereupon a stampede ensued that caused the waiters in the main diningroom below to cease piling chairs upon the tables and hastily weight their napkins with saltcellars but the crowd was not combative they poured out upon the street in the best possible humor and even at the house of seven turnings as higgins had dubbed the hideaway on thirtysecond street they made no disturbance on the contrary it was altogether too quiet for most of them and they soon sought another scene but there were deserters en route to the palace of ebony and when in turn the joys of a full negro orchestra had palled and a course was set for the austrian village the number of investigators had dwindled to a choice halfdozen these however were kindred spirits veterans of many a midnight escapade composing a flying squadron of exactly the right proportions for the utmost efficiency and mobility combined the hour was now past a respectable bedtime and the tenderloin had awakened the roar of commerce had dwindled away and the comparative silence was broken only by the clang of an infrequent trolley the streets were empty of vehicles except for a few cabs that followed the little group persistently as yet there was no need of them the crowd was made up for the most part of healthy fullblooded boys fresh from weeks of training strong of body and with stomachs like galvanized iron they showed scant evidence of intoxication as for the weakest member of the party it had long been known that one drink made higgins drunk and all further libations merely served to maintain him in status quo exhaustive experiments had proved that he was able to retain consciousness and the power of locomotion until the first streak of dawn appeared after which he usually became a burden for the present he was amply able to take care of himself and now although his speech was slightly thick his demeanor was as didactic and severe as ever and save for the vagrant workings of his mind he might have passed for a curate as a whole the crowd was in fine fettle the austrian village is a saloon dancehall and allnight restaurant flourishing brazenly within a stones throw of broadway and it is counted one of the sights of the city upon entering one may pass through a saloon where whiteaproned waiters load trays and wrangle over checks then into a ballroom filled with the flotsam and jetsam of midnight manhattan above and around this room runs a whiteandgold balcony partitioned into boxes beneath it are many tables separated from the waxed floor by a railing inside the enclosure men in streetclothes and smartly gowned girls with enormous hats revolve nightly to the strains of an orchestra which nearly succeeds in drowning their voices from the tables come laughter and snatches of song waiters dash hither and yon it is all very animated and gay on the surface and none but the closely observant would note the weariness beneath the womens smiles the laughter notes that occasionally jar or perceive that the tailored gowns are imitations the ermines mainly rabbitskins but the eyes of youth are not analytical and seen through a rosy haze the sight was inspiriting the college men selected a table and shouldering the occupants aside without ceremony seated themselves and pounded for a waiter padden the proprietor came toward them and after greeting anthony and higgins by a shake of his left hand ducked his round gray head in acknowledgment of an introduction to the others excuse my right said he displaying a swollen hand crisscrossed with surgeons plaster a fellow got noisy last night djou hit him queried higgins gazing with interest at the proprietors knuckles yes i swung for his jaw and went high teeth mr padden said vaguely he turned a shrewd eye upon anthony i heard about the game today that was all right kirk grinned boyishly i didnt have much to do with it these are the fellows dont believe him interrupted ringold sure hes too modest higgins chimed in fine fellow an all that understand but hes got two faults hes modest and hes lazy hes caused a lot of uneasiness to his father and me fathers a fine man too he nodded his long narrow head solemnly we know who did the trick for us added anderson the strawhaired halfback glad you dropped in mr padden assured them anything you boys want and cant get let me know when he had gone higgins averred theres a fine man peaceful refined got a lovely character too lets be gentlemen while were in his place ringold rose im going to dance fellows he announced and his companions followed him with the exception of the cadaverous higgins who maintained that dancing was a pastime for the frivolous and weak when they returned to their table they found a stranger was seated with him who rose as higgins made him known boys meet my old friend mr jefferson locke of st louis hes all right the college men treated this new recruit with a hilarious cordiality to which he responded with the air of one quite accustomed to such reunions i was at the game this afternoon he explained when the greetings were over and recognized you chaps when you came in im a football fan myself you look as if you might have played said anthony sizing up the broad frame of the missourian with the critical eye of a coach yes i used to play where mr locke avoided answer by calling loudly for a waiter but when the orders had been taken kirk repeated where did you play mr locke left tackle what university oh one of the southern colleges it was a freshwater school you wouldnt know the name he changed the subject quickly by adding i just got into town this morning and im sailing tomorrow i couldnt catch a boat today so im having a little blowout on my own account when i recognized you all i just butted in new york is a lonesome place for a stranger hope you dont mind my joining you not at all he was assured when he came to pay the waiter he displayed a roll of yellowbacked bills that caused anthony to caution him if i were you id put that in my shoe i know this place locke only laughed theres more where this came from however thats one reason id like to stick around with you fellows i have an idea ive been followed and i dont care to be tapped on the head if you will let me trail along ill foot the bills thats a fair proposition it certainly sounds engaging cried higgins joyously the sight of that money awakens a feeling of loyalty in our breasts i speak for all when i say we will guard you like a lily as long as your money lasts mr locke as long as we last ringold amended its a bargain locke agreed hereafter i foot the bills youre my guests for the evening understand if youll agree to keep me company until my ship sails ill do the entertaining oh come now anthony struck in the fellows are just fooling youre more than welcome to stay with us if you like but we cant let you put up for it why not well make a night of it ill show you how we spend money in st louis im too nervous to go to bed anthony protested insisting that the other should regard himself as the guest of the crowd but as locke proved obdurate the question was allowed to drop until later when kirk found himself promoted by tacit consent to the position of host for the whole company this was a little more than he had bargained for but the sense of having triumphed in a contest of goodfellowship consoled him meanwhile the stranger despite his avowedly festive spirit showed a certain reserve when the music again struck up he declined to dance preferring to remain with higgins in their inconspicuous corner theres a fine fellow the latter remarked following his best friends figure with his eyes when he and locke were once more alone sweet nature anthony yes he looks it hes got just two faults i always say hes too modest by far and hes lazy wont work he doesnt have to work his old man has plenty of coin hasnt he yes and hell keep it too heartless old wretch mr whats your name again locke mr locke the speaker stared mournfully at his companion dyou know what that unnatural parent did no he let his only son and heir go to jail mr jefferson locke of st louis started his wandering watchful eyes flew back to the speaker what jail thats what i remarked he allowed his own flesh and blood to languish in a loathsome cell what for what did they get him for queried the other quickly speeding oh locke let himself back in his chair yes sir hes a branded felon nonsense thats nothing but we love him just the same criminal though he is said higgins showing a disposition to weep if he were not such a strong patient soul it might have ruined his whole life mr locke grunted strue youve no idea the disgrace it is to go to jail the missourian stirred uneasily say it gets on my nerves to sit still said he lets move around patiently patiently somebodys sure to start something before long well i dont care to get mixed up in a row higgins laid a long white hand upon the speakers arm then stay with us mr locke if you incline to peace be one of us were a flock of sucking doves the dancers came crowding up to the table at the moment and ringold suggested loudly im hungry lets eat again his proposal met with eager response where shall we go asked anderson i just fixed it with padden for a private room upstairs anthony said all the cafes are closed now and this is the best place in town for chicken creole anyhow accordingly he led the way and the rest filed out after him but as they left the ballroom a mediumsized man who had recently entered from the street caught a glimpse of them craned his neck for a better view then idled along behind ii the trail divides inspired by his recent rivalry with mr jefferson locke anthony played the part of host more lavishly than even the present occasion required he ordered elaborately and it was not long before corks were popping and dishes rattling quite as if the young men were really hungry mr locke however insisted that his friends should partake of a kind of drink previously unheard of and with this in view had a confidential chat with the waiter to whom he unostentatiously handed a fivedollar retainer no one witnessed this unusual generosity except higgins who commended it fondly but his remarks went unheeded in the general clamor the meal was at its noisiest when the man whom locke had so generously tipped spoke to him quietly whatever his words they affected the listener strongly lockes face whitened then grew muddy and yellow his hands trembled his lips went dry he half arose from his chair then cast a swift look about the room his companions were too well occupied however to notice this byplay even when the waiter continued in a low tone he slipped me a tenspot so i thought it must be something worth while he hes alone you say seems to be what shall i do sir locke took something from his pocket and thrust it into the fellows hand while the look in his eyes changed to one of desperation step outside and wait dont let him come up ill call you in a minute ringold was recounting his version of the first touchdown how he had been forced inch by inch across the goal line to the tune of thirty thousand yelling throats and his companions were hanging upon his words when their new friend interrupted in such a tone that anthony inquired in surprise whats wrong old man are you sick locke shook his head i told you fellows id been followed this evening remember well theres a man downstairs who has given the waiter ten dollars to let him have his coat and apron so he can come in here what for who is he the men stared at the speaker with a sudden new interest im not sure i think its part of a plan to rob me he let his gaze roam from one face to another you see i just came into a big piece of coin and ive got it with me im im alone in new york understand theyve followed me from st louis now i want you boys to help me dodge this kirk anthony rose suddenly moving as lightly upon his feet as a dancer you say hes below locke nodded it was plain that he was quite unnerved ringold rose in turn and lurched ponderously toward the door but kirk stepped in front of him with a sharp word wait ill manage this lemme go expostulated the centrerush lockes a good fellow and this man wants to trim him no no sit down ringold obeyed if he wants to join us well have him come up what cried locke leaping nervously from his chair dont do that i want to get out of here not a bit like it kirks eyes were sparkling well give this fellow the third degree and find out who his pals are grand idea higgins seconded with enthusiasm grand hold on i cant do that ive got to sail at ten oclock i dont dare get into trouble dont you understand its important locke seemed in an extraordinary panic oh well see that you catch your boat all right kirk assured him and then before the other could interfere he rang for the waiter give that chap your coat and apron he ordered when the attendant answered and when i ring next send him up pass the word to padden and the others not to notice any little disturbance ill answer for results im going to get out cried the man from st louis he mustnt see me hell see you sure if you leave now youll have to pass him stick here well have some fun the whitefaced man sank back into his chair while anthony directed sharply now gentlemen be seated here locke your back to the door your face looks like a chalkmine there now dont be so nervous well cure this fellows ambition as a ginslinger ill change names with you for a minute now ringold go ahead with your story then as the giant took up his tale again listen to him fellows look pleasant please remember youre not sitting up with a corpse a little more ginger ringie good he pushed the button twice and a moment later the door opened quietly to admit a mediumsized man in white coat and apron had the young men been a little less exhilarated they might have suspected that lockes story of having been dogged from st louis was a trifle exaggerated for instead of singling him out at first glance the newcomer paused at a respectful distance inside the door and allowed his eyes to shift uncertainly from one to another as if in doubt as to which was his quarry anthony did not dream that it was his own resemblance to the missourian that led to this confusion but in fact while he and locke were totally unlike when closely compared they were of a similar size and coloring and the same general description would have fitted both having allowed the intruder a moment in which to take in the room kirk leaned back in his chair and nodded for him to approach cigars he ordered bring a box of carolinas yes sir are you mr locke sir inquired the new waiter yes said kirk telephone message for you mr locke the waiter muttered whats that anthony queried loud enough for the others to hear somebody calling you by phone theyre holding the wire outside ill show you the booth oh will you kirk anthonys hands suddenly shot out and seized the masquerader by the throat the man uttered a startled gasp but simultaneously the iron grip of marty ringold fell upon his arms and doubled them behind him while kirk gibed youll get me outside and into a telephone booth eh my dear sir that is old stuff the rest of the party were on their feet instantly watching the struggle and crowding forward with angry exclamations ringold with the mans two wrists locked securely in his own huge paw was growling smooth way to do up a fellow i call it all the way from st louis for a telephone call eh anthony sank his thumbs into the strangers throat then as the mans face grew black and his contortions diminished added were going to make a good waiter out of you jefferson locke broke in excitedly choke him good choke him thats right put him out for keeps for gods sake dont let him go but it was not kirks idea to strangle his victim beyond a certain point he relaxed his grip after a moment and nodding to ringold to do likewise took the fellows wrists himself then swung him about until he faced the others the mans lungs filled with fresh air he began to struggle once more and when his voice had returned he gasped ill get you for this youll do a trick he mumbled a name that did not sound at all like jefferson locke whereupon the missourian made a rush at him that required the full strength of anthonys free hand to thwart here stand back ive got him ill kill him chattered the other let me go the stranger gasped ill take you all in im an officer its a lie shouted locke hes a thief i tell you im an officer i arrest this the words were cut off abruptly by a loud exclamation from higgins and a crash of glass kirk anthonys face was drenched his eyes were filled with a stinging liquid he felt his prisoner sink limply back into his arms and beheld higgins struggling in the grasp of big marty ringold the foilcovered neck of a wine bottle in his fingers the foolish fellow had been hovering uncertainly round the edges of the crowd longing to help his friends and crazily anxious to win glory by some deed of valor at the first opening he had darted wildly into the fray not realizing that the enemy was already helpless in the hands of his captors ive got him he cried joyously hes out higgins anthony exclaimed sharply what the devil then the dead weight in his arms the lolling head and sagging jaw of the stranger sobered him like a deluge of icewater youve done it this time he muttered good god locke cried lets get away hes hurt here you anthony shot a command at the speaker that checked him halfway across the room ringold take the door and dont let anybody in or out to higgins he exclaimed you idiot didnt you see i had his hands no had to get him returned higgins with vinous dignity wanted to rob my old friend mr whats his name weve got to leave quick before we get in bad locke reiterated nervously but anthony retorted were in bad now i want padden he stepped to the door and signaled a passing waiter a moment later the proprietor knocked and ringold admitted him whats the padden started at sight of the motionless figure on the floor and kneeling beside it made a quick examination while anthony explained the circumstances leading up to the assault thief eh i see is he badly hurt queried locke bending a pale face upon them huh i guess hes due for the hospital the owner of the austrian village announced he had his nerve trying to turn a trick in my place i thought i knew all the dips but hes a stranger with nimble fingers he ran through the fellows pockets then continued im glad you got him but youd better get together and rehearse before the police he stopped abruptly once more then looked up curiously what is it questioned the man from missouri padden pointed silently to the lapel of the fellows vest which he had turned back a nickeled badge was pinned upon it hes no thief hes a detective a plainclothes man whad i tell you higgins exulted i can smell em the crowd looked nonplussed with the exception of jefferson locke who became calmer than at any time since the waiter had first whispered into his ear we didnt know who he was he began hurriedly you must square it for us padden i dont care what it costs he extended a bulky roll of banknotes toward the grayhaired man these boys cant stand this sort of thing and neither can i ive got to sail at ten oclock this morning looks to me like youve croaked him said the proprietor ignoring the proffered money its worth a thousand dollars to me not to miss my boat wait a minute padden emptied the unconscious mans pockets among other things of some telegrams and a legally folded paper the latter he opened and scanned swiftly then turned his little eyes upon locke without a word whereupon that gentleman with equal silence took from his inside pocket a wallet and selected a bill the denomination of which he displayed to the proprietor before folding it inside the bundle he held here it may cost you something padden nodded and accepted the money saying oh i guess i can fix it i know the right doctor he regained his feet then warned the onlookers but youll have to keep your traps closed understand will he die asked ringold fearfully his back still against the door not a chance but if he does hell never know who hit him you see we picked him up in the alley and brought him in padden winked meaningly it happens right along in this part of town do you get me ill keep these he indicated the badge and papers in his hand now go out as if nothing had come off drop in again the next time youre in town ill take care of the supper checks as the partly sobered visitors struggled into their overcoats padden drew locke aside and nodding toward higgins who was still talkative said if you want to catch that ten oclock boat youd better stick close to your friend i know him thanks locke glanced at the prostrate figure then inquired in a low tone on the level will he make it hard to tell just the same if i was you id change my sailing he might come to you chaps have done me a big favor tonight said locke a little later when he and his companions were safely out of the austrian village and i wont forget it either now lets finish the evening the way we began it anderson rankin and burroughs to conceal their nervousness pleaded bodily fatigue while anthony also declared that he had enjoyed himself sufficiently for one night and intended to go home and to bed that episode rather got on my nerves he acknowledged mine too assented locke thats why you mustnt leave me i just wont let you remember you agreed to see me off sright fellows higgins joined in we agreed to put him aboard and we must do it dont break up the party kirk i dont want to go home ringold muttered its a breach of hospitality to go home higgins insisted besides after my bloody ncounter with that limb of the law i need a stimulant you must look after me i shall tuck you in your little bed kirk told him but higgins would hear to nothing of the sort protesting that he was in honor bound to conduct his old friend locke to the steamer and anthony feared that without his protection some harm might befall his irresponsible and impulsive companion candor requires it to be said that he did hesitate arguing long with the limplegged higgins but locke was insistent the others grew impatient of the delay and in the end he allowed himself to be persuaded it is often through just such sudden inconsequent decisions influenced perhaps by the merest trifles that a mans life is made great or small just such narrow forkings of the trail may divert him into strange adventurings or into worlds undreamed of kirk anthony twentysix years old with a heritage at hand and with an average capacity for good or evil chose the turning that led him swiftly from the world he knew into an alien land numbed as they were by the excesses of the evening it did not take the young men long to lose all clear and vivid remembrance of this recent experience for the time had come when nature was offering her last resistance and their brains were badly awhirl of all the four jefferson locke was the only one who retained his wits to the fullest a circumstance that would have proved him the owner of a remarkably steady head had it not been for the fact that he had cunningly substituted water for gin each time it came his turn to drink it was a commentary upon the state of his companions that they did not notice the limpid clearness of his beverage dawn found them in an east side basement drinkingplace frequented by the lowest classes ringold was slumbering peacefully half overflowing the wet surface of a table anthony had discovered musical talent in the bartender and was seated at a battered piano laboriously experimenting with the accompaniment to an irish ballad higgins and locke were talking earnestly it was the slackest blackest hour in an allnight dive the nocturnal habitues had slunk away and the days trade had not yet begun higgins drawn and haggard beneath his drunken flush was babbling incessantly locke as usual sat facing the entrance his eyes watchful his countenance alert in spite of the fact that he had constantly plied his companion with liquor in the hope of stilling his tongue higgins seemed incapable of silence and kept breaking forth into loud garbled recitals of the scene at paddens which caused the missourian to shiver with apprehension to a sober eye it would have been patent that locke was laboring under some strong excitement for every door that opened caused him to start every stranger that entered made him quake he consulted his watch repeatedly he flushed and paled and fidgeted then lost himself in frowning meditation grandes fellow i ever met higgins was saying for the hundredth time got two faults thas all hes modesht an hes lazy he wont work anthony yes locke stirred himself and leaning forward said you and he are good friends eh best ever would you like to play a joke on him joke cant be done hes wises guy ever ive tried it an always get the wors of it yes sir hes wise guy jus got two faults he wont work an look here why dont you make him work huh higgins turned a pair of bleared unfocusable eyes upon the speaker why dont somebody make him work the leanfaced youth laughed moistly thas good joke i mean it got too much money s old man puts up reglar listen its a shame for a fine fellow like him to go to the dogs higgins nodded heavily in agreement why dont you send him away where hell have to rustle thats the joke i meant huh again the listeners mind failed to follow and locke repeated his words concluding it would make a new man of him oh he wouldnt work too lazy hed have to if he were broke but he aint broke didnt i tell you s old man puts up reglar fine man too misser anthony owns railroads ill tell you how we can work it ive got a ticket for central america in my pocket the boat sails at ten lets send him down there wha for locke kept his temper with an effort to make a man of him well go through his clothes and when he lands hell be broke hell have to work dont you see no anthonys friend did not see he dont want to go to central america he argued hes got a new autombile but suppose we got him soused went through his pockets and then put him aboard the boat hed be at sea by the time he woke up he couldnt get back hed have to work dont you see hed be broke when he landed and have to rustle money to get back with i think its an awful funny idea the undeniable humor of such a situation finally dawned upon higginss mind and he burst into a loud guffaw hey there shut up anthony called from the piano listen here ive found the lost chord he bore down with his huge hands upon the yellow keyboard bringing forth a metallic crash that blended fearfully with the bartenders voice its a great discovery ill get him full if youll help manage him locke went on and heres the ticket he tapped his pocket whered you get it bought it yesterday its first class and better and hell fit my description were about the same size aint you goin no ive changed my mind i may jump over to paris come are you on higgins giggled darn funny idea if you can get him full wait locke rose and went to the bar where he called loudly for the singer then when the bartender had deserted the piano he spoke to anthony keep it up old man youre doing fine for some moments he talked earnestly to the man behind the bar but his back was to higgins anthony was occupied and ringold still slumbered hence no one observed the transfer of another of those yellow bills of which he seemed to have an unlimited store strangely enough mr jefferson lockes plan worked without a hitch within ten minutes after kirk anthony had taken the drink handed him he declared himself sleepy and rose from the piano only to seek a chair into which he flung himself heavily its all right locke told his drunken companion ive got a taxi waiting well leave ringold where he is twentyfour hours later adelbert higgins undertook to recall what had happened to him after he left mullers place on east fourteenth street but his memory was tricky he recollected a vaguely humorous discussion of some sort with a stranger the details of which were almost entirely missing he remembered that dawn had broken when he came out of the saloon but beyond that he could not go with any degree of certainty there was a hazy memory of an interminable ride in a closed vehicle of some sort a dizzy panorama of moving buildings bleak windswept trees frosty meadows and landlocked lakes backed by what were either distant mountain ranges or apartment houses this last however was all very blurred and indistinct as to who was with him on the ride or what took place thereafter he had no memory and no opportunity of learning owing to certain unexpected and alarming occurrences which made it imperative for him to terminate his connection with his college as big marty ringold had done earlier in the day and begin to pack his belongings partly out of deference to the frantic appeals of his widowed mother partly owing to the telephoned advice of mr michael padden of sixth avenue who said the injured man had recognized one of his assailants he booked passage to japan by the next steamer out of vancouver he left new york that afternoon by the twentieth century limited taking with him only one suitcase and a determination to see the world iii a gap strictly speaking kirk anthony did not awake to a realization of his surroundings but became conscious of them through a long process of dull dreamy speculation he never knew the precise moment when his eyes opened and sleep left him but at cost of considerable mental effort he finally brought himself to the conviction that hours had passed and another day had arrived more than once after long white nights in new york city he had awakened amid strange surroundings and had been forced to wait upon his lagging memory but this time his mind refused to work even after he knew himself to be fully roused so he closed his eyes with the admonition now begin all over again kirk when you left paddens place you went to maxims and listened to the fat quartette then to the place where the waiter held out a dollar after the trouble at that point you tried to get into tonys rathskeller and couldnt so you started for the east side ringold was very drunk good everything is clear so far next you were playing a piano with yellow teeth while somebody sang something about a little brown cot after that lord you must have been drinking well lets run through it again but his efforts were vain he could recall nothing beyond the piano so fell to wondering what hotel this could be some east side joint he decided and a cheap one too from the size of this stall he noted another brass bed close at hand and reasoned that ringold or higgins must have risen early leaving him to finish his sleep that was considerate of course but good heavens it must be late and he was due to motor to new haven at noon he raised himself suddenly and was half out of bed when he fell back with a cry as if an unseen hand had smitten him he clapped both palms to his head realizing that he was very sick indeed the sensation was unlike anything he had ever felt before his head was splitting he felt a frightful nausea the whole room was rocking and reeling as if to pitch him out of bed it was terrible so he arose blindly and felt his way toward the telephone failing to find it he pushed a button instead then tumbled back to bed reviling the luck that had brought him to such a miserable place he closed his eyes tightly and calmed his stomach by an effort of will at last he heard the door open and a voice inquire did you ring sir an hour ago havent you more than one bellhop in this place im sorry sir and im sick mighty sick im going to die i think not sir the others are sick too thats good i was afraid theyd dressed and gone it was some consolation to know that ringold and higgins had not escaped their share of suffering how is hig the bony fellow do you mean the gentleman in thirtytwo how should i know his number thats not higs description however even you could tell that he is no gentle oh lord can i get you something sir a little champagne perhaps to settle your stomach no no get me a taxicab i want to go uptown rather a long drive isnt it snickered the bellboy never mind the comedy anthony opened his eyes hello are you the clerk instead of the bellhop he had expected he beheld a man in white jacket and black trousers no sir im the steward the invalid shook his head faintly funny place ive got into whats the name of it this oh the santa cruz never heard of it why didnt they give me a good room this is fierce suite a is considered very good sir it is one of the best on the line line kirk grunted so this is some deadline dump well im going to get out understand hand me my trousers and ill slip you a quarter the steward did as desired but a blind search showed the pockets to be empty give me the coat and vest but here again kirk found nothing and was forced to apologize sorry old man but i must have left it at the office now be a good fellow and hustle up that taxi im getting sicker every minute perhaps you had better have the doctor is there a good one handy yes sir here in the hotel the steward seemed undecided whether to treat the occupant of suite a as a humorist or a lunatic but finally he observed this isnt a hotel sir thats what i thoughtmore like a roadhouse this is a ship a what anthony raised himself and stared at the whiteclad figure over the foot of his little brass bed this is a ship sir you get out of here yelled the infuriated young man he cast his eyes about for some missile to hurl at this insolent menial and spying a heavy glass pitcher upon a stand beside him reached for it whereat the steward retreated hastily to the door i beg pardon sir i will send the doctor at once must think im still drunk mumbled anthony dazedly as he once more laid his head upon his pillow with a groan when his dizziness had diminished sufficiently to permit him to open his eyes he scanned his surroundings more carefully but his vision was unreliable his head too continued to feel as if his skull were being forcibly spread apart by some fiendish instrument concealed within it his mouth was parched his stomach violently rebellious in spite of these distractions he began to note certain unfamiliar features about this place the wallpaper for instance which at first glance he had taken for the work of some cheap decorator turned out to be tapestry as he proved by extending a shaky hand the low ceiling the little windows with wooden blinds the furniture itself were all out of keeping with hotel usages he discovered by rolling his head that there was a mahogany dresser over by the door and a padded couch covered with chintz there were folding brass clotheshooks on the wall moreover and an electric fan while a narrow door gave him a glimpse of a tiny whiteenamelled bathroom he took in these details laboriously deciding finally that he was too intoxicated to see aright for while the place was quite unlike an ordinary hotel room neither did it resemble any steamship stateroom he had ever seen it was more like a ladys boudoir to be sure he felt a sickening surge and roll now and then but at other times the whole room made a complete revolution which was manifestly contrary to the law of gravitation and therefore not to be trusted as evidence there were plenty of reasons moreover why this could not be a ship the mere supposition was absurd no this must be a room in some uptown club or perhaps a bachelor hotel kirk had many friends with quarters decorated to suit their own peculiar fancies and he decided that in all probability one of these had met him on the street and taken him home for safekeeping he had barely settled this in his mind when the door opened for a second time and a man in uniform entered the steward said you wanted me he began no i want a doctor i am the doctor i thought you were the elevator man im sick awful sick can you vomit certainly anybody can do that the stranger pulled up a stool seated himself beside the bed then felt of anthonys cheek you have a fever that explains everything kirk sighed thankfully and closed his eyes once more for the doctor had begun to revolve slowly with the bed as an axis how are the other boys coming on everybody is laid out its a bad night night it must be nearly daylight by this time oh no it is not midnight yet not midnight why i didnt turn in until anthony raised himself suddenly good lord have i slept all day you certainly have whose room is this your room of course here take one of these capsules it will settle your stomach better give me something to settle my bill if ive been here that long im broke again youre not fully awake yet said the doctor people have funny ideas when theyre sick well i know im broke anyhow thats no idea its a condition i went through my clothes just now and im all in i must get back to the astor too for i had arranged to motor up to new haven at noon let me feel your pulse said the doctor quietly the boys will think im lost i never did such a thing before where do you think you are inquired the physician i dont know its a nice little hotel but this isnt a hotel this is a ship anthony was silent for a moment then he sighed feebly and said doctor you shouldnt make fun of a man at the point of death it isnt professional fact said the doctor abstractedly gazing at his watch while he held anthonys wrist between his fingers we are one hundred and fifty miles out of new york the first officer told me you were considerably intoxicated when you came aboard but he continued brusquely rising and closing his watch with a snap you will remember it all in a little while mr locke what did you call me locke you havent forgotten your name too wait again anthony pressed his throbbing temples with both hot hands and strove to collect his whirling wits at last he began to speak measuring his words with care now i know you are wrong doctor and ill tell you why you see my name isnt locke its anthony locke went away on a ship but i stayed in new york understand well hes the fellow youre talking to and im asleep somewhere down around the bowery im not here at all i didnt want to go anywhere on a ship i couldnt go i didnt have the price that supper was a hundred and seventy nevertheless this is a ship the physician patiently explained and youre on it and im talking to you what is more you have not exchanged identities with your friend anthony for your ticket reads jefferson locke youll be all right if you will just go to sleep and give that capsule a chance to operate ask higgins or ringold who i am theres no one aboard by either of those names say anthony raised himself excitedly on one arm but was forced to lie down again without delay if this is a ship i must have come aboard how did i do it when where you came on with two men or rather between two men about eightthirty this morning they put you in here gave your ticket to the purser and went ashore the slim fellow was crying and one of the deckhands had to help him down the gangway that was higgins all right now doctor granting just for the sake of argument that this is a ship and that i am jefferson locke when is your next stop one week what kirks eyes opened wide with horror i cant stay here a week you will have to but i tell you i cant i just cant i bought a new car the other day and its standing in front of the new york theatre yes and i have two rooms and a bath at the astor at fifteen dollars a day the physician smiled heartlessly you must have been drinking pretty heavily but i guess you will remember everything byandby i cant understand it groaned the bewildered invalid what ship is this if it is really a ship the santa cruz belongs to the united fruit company this is one of the bridal suites it is pm november st we are bound for colon where is that panama panama is in central america or mexico or somewhere isnt it it is now do you remember anything more not a thing well then go to sleep youll be all right in the morning mr locke anthony very well mr anthony if you prefer is there anything more you would like to ask me no of course there may have been some mistake the medical man observed doubtfully as he opened the door maybe you intended to take some other ship no mistake at all the sick man assured him im beginning to remember now you see i lost my hat and decided id run down to panama and get another goodnight goodnight that capsule will make you sleep when the officer had gone kirk mumbled to himself if it turns out that i am in new york after all when i wake up ill lick that doctor then he turned over and fell asleep but morning showed him the truth of the doctors information he awoke early and although his head still behaved queerly and he had moments of nausea he dressed himself and went on deck the shock he had received on the evening before was as nothing to what he felt now upon stepping out into the light of day in spite of his growing conviction he had cherished a lingering hope that it was all a dream and the feeling did not entirely vanish until he had really seen for himself then his dismay was overwhelming a broad deck still wet from its morning scrubbing and lined with steamer chairs lay in front of him a limitless oily sea stretched out before his bewildered eyes he touched the rail with his hands to verify his vision the strangeness of it was uncanny he felt as if he were walking in his sleep he realized that a great fragment had suddenly dropped out of his lifes pattern and it was intensely disquieting to think of all it might have carried with it he began to pace the deck mechanically falling in with the other early risers who were out for a breath of morning air striving to adjust himself to this new state of affairs but even though the solid reality of his surroundings soon brought him back more nearly to a normal state of mind he felt an everpresent expectancy of some new shock some new and abrupt transition that might yet bring him back to his startingpoint but this obsession gradually left him as the brisk sea breeze brought him to a proper perspective and braced him to face the full consequences of his long restless nights orgy no man is so systematic none is so well ordered in his affairs that he can cut out a slice of his life at a moments notice without suffering many kinds of loss and inconvenience although anthony was a youth of few responsibilities he awoke suddenly to the fact that there were a thousand things that needed doing a thousand people who needed to know his whereabouts a thousand things that were bound to go wrong for instance there was his brandnew french car standing with motor blanketed beside the fortyfifth street curb what had happened to it and to the urchin he had left in charge of it he owed a thousand dollars on its purchase which he had promised to pay yesterday then too he had neglected his house account at the university club and it was long overdue that remittance from his father had come just in the nick of time suddenly he recalled placing the check in his billcase and he searched himself diligently but found nothing that reminded him that he had won a bet or two on the football game and the money needed collecting there was the shooting trip to cape cod as well he was due there today for a weekend among the geese and brant what would benny glover think when he failed to show up or even telegraph bennys sister was coming down from boston with some friends and oh it was simply imperative that he get some word ashore he let his eyes rove over the ship in desperation then a happy thought came to him the wireless he said aloud bonehead why didnt you think of that long ago a glance at the rigging showed him that the santa cruz was equipped with a plant and a moment later he was hammering at the operators door i want to send a message right away he cried excitedly but the wireless shook his head with a smile im sorry but its important awfully important ill pay you anything kirk rammed a hand mechanically into his empty pocket were installing a new system said the operator the old apparatus wasnt satisfactory and its being changed throughout then youyou cant send a message possibly nothing doing until the next trip kirk strode forward and stared disconsolately down upon the freight deck in a vain endeavor to collect his thoughts how in the devil had he managed to get into this mess could it be one of higginss senseless pranks or was there something deeper more sinister behind it he recalled the incidents of that wild night and began to have a disquieting doubt did that chance meeting with the chap from st louis have anything to do with his presence here or had he really decided in some foolish drunken whim to take a trip to central america he hardly knew what to think or where to begin his reasoning he recollected that jefferson locke had not impressed him very favorably at the start and that his behavior upon the appearance of the plainclothes man had not improved that first impression it seemed certain that he must have had his hand in this affair else how would anthony now find himself in possession of his ticket what had become of the rightful occupant of suite a what had become of higginss unfortunate victim with the cracked head what did it all signify kirk sighed disconsolately and gave it up in five days more he would learn the answer anyhow for there must be a cable from panama to the states meanwhile he supposed he must reconcile himself to his condition but it was tough to have two weeks of valuable time snatched out of his eventful life it was maddening iv new acquaintances the sound of a bugle which kirk interpreted as an invitation to breakfast reminded him that he was famished and he lost no time in going below upon his appearance the steward made it plain to him in some subtle manner that the occupant of suite a needed nothing beyond the mere possession of those magnificent quarters to insure the most considerate treatment kirk was placed at the captains table where his hunger was soon appeased and his outlook grew more cheerful with the complete restoration of bodily comfort feeling somewhat less dissatisfied with his surroundings he began to study the faces of his fellowpassengers getting your sea legs mr locke inquired the man at his right my name is anthony i beg your pardon the passenger list said that was a mistake my name is stein may i ask where you are bound for i think the place is panama going to work on the canal what canal oh of course now i remember hearing something about a panama canal is that where it is thats the place stein replied dryly im not going to work i dont work dont know how i see pleasure trip purely a pleasure trip im having a great time bytheway this canal affair is something new isnt it it was begun about thirty years ago mr stein regarded the speaker with puzzled inquiry as if undecided in what spirit to take him whats the idea why dont they finish it up i thought you were an american returned the other politely you have no accent i am an american im the fellow who was born in albany new york if you look on the map youll find the town has a little ring around it and really dont you know anything about the panama canal oh ive heard it mentioned well you wont hear anything else mentioned down here its the one and only subject of conversation nobody thinks or talks or dreams about anything except the canal everybody works on it or else works for somebody who does for instance that whitehaired man at the other end of the table is colonel bland one of the commissioners the man over there with the black beard is one of the engineers at gatun stein who seemed a gossipy person ran on glibly for a time pointing out the passengers of note and giving brief details about them suddenly he laid his hand on anthonys arm and said see this fellow coming down the stairs anthony beheld a slender baldheaded man of youthful appearance that is stephen cortlandt youve heard of the cortlandts sure one of them pitched for the cubs i mean the cortlandts of washington theyre swell people society folks and all that he broke off to bow effusively to the late comer who seated himself opposite then he introduced kirk mr cortlandt impressed anthony as a coldblooded highly schooled person absolutely devoid of sentiment his face was stony his eyes were cool even his linen partook of his own unruffled calm he seemed by no means effeminate yet he was one of those immaculate beings upon whom one can scarcely imagine a speck of dust or a bead of perspiration his hair what was left of it was parted to a nicety his clothes were faultless and he had an air of quiet assurance bytheway were getting up a pool on the ships run stein told his new acquaintance would you like to join yes indeed im for anything in the line of chance very well ill see you in the smokingroom later it will cost you only five dollars kirk suddenly recalled his financial condition and hastened to say a trifle lamely come to think about it i believe ill stay out i never gamble chancing to glance up at the moment he found mr cortlandts eyes fixed upon him with a peculiarly amused look and a few minutes later he followed mr stein to the deck above once in his own stateroom the young man began a thorough exploration realizing more keenly than before that without baggage or money his plight might prove distressing but look as he would he could find no trace of either and an inadvertent glance in the mirror betrayed the further fact that his linen was long since past a presentable stage another despairing search showed that even his watch was gone and that his only asset evidently overlooked by the hilarious higgins and his copartner in crime was a modest threestone finger ring he was regarding this speculatively when the purser knocked then entered at his call ive just heard that theres a mistake about your ticket the newcomer began it is made out to mr jefferson locke but the doctor says you insist your name is something else thats right my name is anthony then how did i get this ticket im sure i dont know have you any baggage i dont know what is your destination i dont know youll pardon my limited vocabulary are you joking do i look as if i were but i dont understand neither do i but i must have some luggage a fellow wouldnt make a trip like this without baggage would he i should think not ill look it up for you if you wish but about this ticket my dear man dont bother me with that i have worries enough as it is what i want now is a clean shirt and collar yes but this ticket says please look at my linen ill create a scandal this way mr locke anthony very well mr anthony i must straighten out this ticket affair really i must all right straighten away if you are not mr locke it is no good hurrah put me off you dont understand the ticket is good but see here theres something mighty strange about this you say your name isnt locke you have no baggage you even thought this ship was a hotel i did it was a great disappointment and now i want a shirt anthony began to laugh funny isnt it you will have to buy another ticket said the purser with dignity a bright idea kirk smiled grimly then turning his pockets wrong side out continued lightly you look me over and if you can find the price of a ticket ill give you half then you have lost your money as well as your baggage and your identity so it would seem impossible it was plain that the officer was growing angry so kirk made haste to say now lets be friends at least bytheway pardon the personal nature of the question but what size shirt do you wear seventeen saved let me have about six will you certainly not returned the other i need all i have miser then you must help me find some one my size the purser however seemed in no mood to go shirthunting and backed out of the door saying ill have a look for your baggage mr anthony and ill see the captain about this ticket also i dont know whether youre making fun of me or not but ill look you up later he departed shaking his head as if this were a form of insanity he had never before encountered a moment later kirk followed him and made a round of the deck staring at each man he met and mentally estimating the girth of his neck but it seemed that the male passengers of the santa cruz were all of medium size and he saw no one whose appearance held out the slightest hope he did observe one fellow whose neck seemed as large as his own but the man looked surly and not too cleanly and kirk was not yet desperate enough to bring himself to the point of approaching such a fellow for such a favor he thought of appealing directly to the captain but promptly remembered that he was a small wiry man whose wardrobe could by no possible chance afford him relief at last he made his way toward the smokingroom determined to enlist the help of his new acquaintance stein midway aft he paused a girl had emerged from the deckhouse ahead of him whose appearance was sufficiently striking to divert him momentarily at least from his quest she was well above the usual height quite slender yet of an exquisite rounded fulness while her snugfitting tailormade gown showed the marks of a redfern or a paquin he noted also that her stride was springy and athletic and her head well carried feeling that friendly approval with which one recognizes a member of his own kind kirk let his eyes follow her then retraced his way around the deck in the hope of meeting her face to face a woman frequently betrays her beauty by the poise of her head by the turn of her neck or the lines of her figure just as truly as by a full glimpse of her features hence it was that anthony felt a certain pleasurable expectancy as he crossed in front of the deckhouse realizing that she was approaching but when they had met and passed he went his way vaguely disappointed instead of a girl as the first sight of her youthful figure had led him to expect he had seen a woman of perhaps forty there was little in her countenance to reveal her age except a certain settled look that does not go with girlhood and while no one could have thought her plain she was certainly not so handsome as he had imagined from a distance yet the face was attractive the eyes were wideset gray and very clear the mouth large enough to be expressive her hair shone in the morning sun with a delicate bronze lustre like that of a turkeys wing it did not add to the young mans comfort to realize that her one straight casual glance in passing had taken him in from his soiled collar to his somewhat extreme patent leathers with the tan tops and pearl buttons being very young himself and of limited social experience he classed all women as either young or old there was no middle ground so he dismissed her from his thoughts and continued his search for a number seventeen shirt and collar to match but he did not fare well he found mr stein in the smokingroom but discovered that his size was fifteen and a half and there was no one else to whom he could apply for a second time stein importuned him to buy a chance on the ships run and failing in this suggested that they have a drink together had not kirk realized in time his inability to reciprocate he would have accepted eagerly for his recent dissipation had left him curiously weak and nervous at the cost of an effort however he refused it was a rare experience for him to refuse anything being like many indolent youths an accomplished guest in fact he was usually as ready to accept favors as he was carelessly generous when he happened to be in funds the technique of receiving comes to some people naturally others cannot assume an obligation without giving offence kirk was one of the former yet now he felt a sudden strange hesitancy and a selfconsciousness that made graceful acquiescence impossible he continued firm therefore even when stein gibed at him goodhumoredly i suppose its against your principles to drink as well as to gamble exactly thats good after the way you came aboard how did i come aboard oh i didnt see you but i heard about it kirk flushed uncomfortably muttering the acoustics of this ship are great a man cant fall asleep but what somebody hears it stein laughed dont get sore all ships are alike we have to talk about something sorry i cant help you with the shirt question deuced careless of them to lose your luggage yes it makes one feel about as comfortable as a man with a broken arm and the prickly heat somethings got to be done about it thats all he glared enviously at the welldressed men about the room over in a corner propped against the leather upholstery was mr cortlandt as pale as reserved and as saturnine as at breakfast he was sipping scotchandsoda and in all the time that anthony remained he did not speak to a soul save the waiter did not shift his position save to beckon for another drink something about his sour introspective aloofness displeased the onlooker who shortly returned to the deck the day was warming up and on the sunny side of the ship the steamer chairs were filling two old men were casting quoits a noisy quartette was playing shuffleboard after idling back and forth for a time kirk selected a chair and stretched himself out but he was scarcely seated before the deck steward approached him and said do you wish this chair for the voyage sir yes i think so ill put your name on it anthony suite a third floor front very well sir the man wrote out a card and fitted it to the back of the chair saying one dollar if you please what the price of the chair is one dollar i havent got a dollar the steward laughed as if to humor his passenger im afraid then you cant have the chair so i must stand up all the way to panama eh you are joking sir ill have to pay it myself if you dont thats right make me as uncomfortable as possible bytheway what size collar do you wear sixteen kirk sighed send the purser to me will you ill fix up the chair matter with him while he was talking he heard the rustle of skirts close by and saw the woman he had met earlier seating herself next to him with her was a french maid bearing a rug in her hands it annoyed the young man to realize that out of all the chairs on deck he had selected the one nearest hers and he would have changed his position had he not been too indolent as it was he lay idly listening to her words of direction to the maid but as she spoke in french he was undecided whether she was telling her companion that bad weather was imminent or that the laundry needed counting his mind it seemed ran to laundry then the purser appeared did you send for me he inquired yes there was a strange man around just now and he wanted a dollar for this chair well i want to establish a line of credit the purser grunted and say kirk ran on seriously ive been all over your little ship but the passengers are boys size i cant wear this collar any longer and i cant find any baggage of yours then there isnt any i never really expected there was come now be a good fellow this is my case shirt if you really wish some clothes ill see what i can find among the stewards no no kirk hastily interposed i cant wear a shirt with soup stains on it let me have one of yours were twin brothers i have no more than i need said the purser coldly he opened a cigarette case at which anthony gazed longingly it seemed ages since he had had a smoke but the other seemed disinclined for small courtesies ive seen the captain about that ticket matter he went on and he says you must buy another kirk shook his head languidly once more i tell you there is nothing doing the officer broke out with some heat if you are joking youve carried this thing far enough if you are really strapped as you say you are how does it happen that you are occupying the best suite on the ship it is a long story humph you will have to give up those quarters and go forward why you have your money for that ticket yes but youre not mr locke kirk smiled meditatively how do you know he queried good heavens youve told me so a dozen ah then you have nothing except my word well sir now that i come to think it over i believe my name is locke after all he grinned anyhow i love my little room and i think ill keep it please dont be peevish i want you to do me a favor he removed the ring from his finger and handing it to the purser said i want you to get me two diamonds and a rubys worth of shirts and collars and also a safety razor my mind has stopped working but my whiskers continue to grow the officer managed to say with dignity you wish to raise money on this i presume very well ill see what can be done for you mr locke as he turned away kirk became conscious that the woman in the next chair had let her book fall and was watching him with amused curiosity feeling a sudden desire to confide in some one he turned his eyes upon her with such a natural boyish smile that she could not take offence and began quite as if he had known her for some time these people are moneymad arent they worst bunch of golddiggers i ever saw surprised she half raised her book but kirk ran on anybody would think i was trying to find a missing will instead of a shirt that purser is the only man on the ship my size and he distrusts me the woman murmured something unintelligible i hope you dont mind my speaking to you he added im awfully lonesome my name is anthony kirk anthony evidently the occupant of the next chair was not a football enthusiast for although she bowed her acknowledgment her face showed that the name carried no significance i understood you to tell the purser your name was locke said she in a very lowpitched wellmodulated voice i couldnt help overhearing but it isnt really its anthony im the undignified heir to the stocks and bonds of an old party by that name who lives in albany darwin k anthony questioned she quickly is he your father her face lighted with a flash of genuine interest kirk nodded hes my prodigal father and im the fatted son do you know the governor yes slightly well what do you think of that hes a great old party isnt he he chuckled irrepressibly did you ever hear him swear the woman shook her head with a smile i hardly know him well enough for that oh hes a free performer he swears naturally cant help it everybody knows he doesnt mean anything its funny isnt it with all his credit that i cant get a shirt until i put up a diamond ring he could buy a railroad with half that security you are joking are you not no indeed i never needed a shirt so badly in my life you see i didnt intend to take this trip i didnt even know i had sailed when i woke up i thought this was a hotel ive got no more baggage than a robin really the woman by now had closed her book and was giving him her full attention responding to some respectful quality in his tone that robbed his frankness of offence how did it happen well to be perfectly honest i got drunk just plain drunk i didnt think so at the time understand for id never been the least bit that way before hope i dont shock you his new acquaintance shrugged her shoulders i have seen something of the world im not easily shocked well i was perfectly sober the last i remember and then i woke up on the santa cruz id never even heard the name before and hadnt you intended taking an ocean trip good lord no i had just bought a new french car and was going to drive it up to new haven yesterday its standing out on fortyfifth street now if somebody hasnt stolen it gee i can see the newsboys cutting their monograms in those tires how remarkable you see it was a big night football game supper and all that i remember everything up to a certain point then curtain i was out for twelve hours and sick thats the funny part im still sick he shook his head as if at a loss what to make of this phenomenon he noted how the womans countenance lighted at even a passing interest as he continued what i cant understand is this it took all my money to pay for the supper and yet i wake up with a firstclass ticket to panama and in possession of one of the best suites on the ship its a problem play you say you were sick afterward was i kirk turned his eyes upon the speaker mournfully my head isnt right yet you were drugged said the woman by jove he straightened up in his chair knockouts exactly some one drugged you and bought a ticket wait im beginning to see it was locke thats how i got his name this is his ticket oh theres going to be something doing when i get back what i dont know yet but im going to sit right here and brood upon some fitting revenge after that chap gets out of the hospital you did not impress me as a college student said the stranger im not i graduated four years ago i barely made it but i did get through and you have never been to the tropics not since i had my last row with the governor have you many times it will prove an interesting trip for you at least you have that consolation what is it like evidently the artless effrontery of the young man had not offended for his neighbor talked freely and in a short time the two were conversing as easily as old acquaintances this was due perhaps to the fact that he had appealed to her with the same frankness he would have used toward a man and thus far at least had quite ignored her sex she was sufficiently quick to appreciate the footing thus established and allowed herself to meet him halfway had he presumed in the slightest she would have chilled him instantly but as it was she seemed to feel the innate courtesy back of his boldness seeing in him only a big unaffected boy who needed an outlet for his feelings in the same way had a fine st bernard dog thrust a friendly head beneath her hand she would have petted it when at last she rose after an hour that had swiftly sped she was gratified at the look of concern that came into his eyes she looked at him with genuine approval as he bowed and said thank you for the pointers about panama i hope i may have the pleasure of talking to you again when she had disappeared he murmured admiringly jove shes a corker and shes not so old after all i wonder who she he leaned over and read the card on the back of her steamer chair mrs stephen cortlandt suite b it was lettered straightening up he grumbled with genuine disappointment just my blamed luck shes married v a remedy is proposed by pledging his one article of jewelry kirk became possessed that afternoon of several shirts collars and handkerchiefs likewise a razor over which he exercised a sort of leasehold privilege the purser made it plain however that he had not sold these articles but merely loaned them holding the ring as security for their return and this arrangement allowed kirk no spare cash whatever even with all his necessities paid for it surprised him to find how many channels remained for spending money for instance the most agreeable loafing spot on the ship was the smokingroom but whenever he entered it he was invited to drink smoke or play cards and as he was fond of all these diversions it required such an effort of will to refuse that it destroyed all the pleasure of good company it was very hard always to be saying no and in addition it excited his disgust to learn that he had inadvertently founded a reputation for abstemiousness before long he discovered that the passengers considered him an exceptionally sober steady youth of economical habits and this enraged him beyond measure every tinkle of ice or hiss of seltzer made his mouth water the click of poker chips drew him with magnetic power he longed mightily to break over and have a good time it was his first effort at selfrestraint and the warfare became so intense that he finally gave up the smokingroom almost entirely and spent his hours on deck away from temptation he suffered most perhaps from the lack of tobacco but even in the matter of cigarettes he could not bring himself to accept favors that he could not return in the solitude of his richly appointed suite he collected a few corkbound stumps which he impaled on a toothpick in order to light them meanwhile he amused himself by baiting the purser he dogged that seriousminded gentleman through all his waking hours finding a rare delight in playing upon his suspicion and lack of humor to him kirk was always mr locke while he insisted upon being called mr anthony by the others and the officer never quite got the hang of it moreover the latter was full of dignity and did not relish being connected with a certainly dubious and possibly criminal character yet dared not resort to rudeness as a means of riddance the situation was trying enough to the young man at best for the ships hirelings began to show a lack of interest in his comfort once it became known that he did not tip and he experienced difficulty in obtaining even the customary attentions it was annoying to one who had never known an unsatisfied whim but kirk was of a peculiarly sanguine temperament that required much to ruffle and looked upon the whole matter as a huge joke it was this perhaps that enabled him to make friends in spite of his unsociable habits for the men liked him as for the women he avoided them religiously with the exception of mrs cortlandt whom he saw for an hour or two morning and afternoon as well as at mealtimes with her he got on famously finding her nearly as entertaining as a male chum though he never quite lost his dislike for her husband had she been unmarried and nearer his own age their daily intimacy might have caused him to become selfconscious but under the circumstances no such thought occurred to him and he began to look forward with pleasure to their hours on deck the santa cruz was four days out before cortlandt joined them and when he did he merely nodded casually to kirk then after exchanging a polite word or two with his wife lapsed into his customary silence while mrs cortlandt continued her conversation without a second glance in her husbands direction thats what i call an ideal married couple kirk reflected complete understanding absolute confidence and the more he saw of them the stronger this impression grew cortlandt was always attentive and courteous without being demonstrative while his wife showed a charming graciousness that was plainly unassumed their perfect goodbreeding made the young man feel at ease but though he endeavored to cultivate the husband on several occasions he made little headway the man evidently possessed a wide knowledge of current events a keen understanding of men and things yet he never opened up he listened smiled spoke rarely and continued to spend ninetenths of his time in that isolated corner of the smokingroom with no other company than a long glass and a siphon one day when kirk had begun to feel that his acquaintance with mrs cortlandt was well established he said to her stein told me today that your husband is in the diplomatic service yes said she he was consulgeneral to colombia several years ago and since then he has been to france and to germany i thought you were tourists you have travelled so much most of our journeys have been made at the expense of the government are you diplomatting now in a way we shall be in panama for some time this stein seems to be a nice fellow hes taken quite a liking to me mrs cortlandt laughed lightly that is part of his business how so he is one of colonel jolsons secret agents who is colonel jolson chairman of the isthmian canal commission your father knows him do you mean that stein is a detective kirk looked uncomfortable i do does he know you are the son of darwin k anthony why yes i suppose so colonel jolson will be interested again i dont see the point your father is one of the most powerful and aggressive railroad men in the country perhaps you know something about the railroad opposition to the canal kirk smiled well to tell you the truth said he the governor doesnt consult me about his business as much as he ought to he seems to think he can run it all right without me and weve only been speaking over the telephone lately one of the strongest forces the government had to combat in putting through the canal appropriations was the railroads colonel jolson has no reason to love your father yes but i dont object to this canal i think it must be a rather good idea mrs cortlandt laughed for a second time the colonels dislike for your father will not affect you inasmuch as you are returning so soon but if you intended to stay it might be different in what way oh in many ways there are two classes of people who are not welcomed on the canal zone magazine writers and applicants for positions who have political influence back of them the former are regarded as muckrakers the latter as spies thats rather rough on them isnt it you must understand that there is a great big human machine behind the digging of this canal and while it is more wonderful by far than the actual machinery of iron and steel it is subject to human weaknesses men like colonel jolson who form a part of it are down here to make reputations for themselves they are handicapped and vexed by constant interference constant jealousy it is a survival of the fittest and i suppose they feel that they must protect themselves even if they use underhand means to do so it is so in all big work of this character where the individual is made small you would find the same condition in your fathers railroad organization oh now my old man is a pretty tough citizen to get along with but he wouldnt hire detectives to spy on his employees mrs cortlandt smiled bytheway when are you going into business with him she said i oh not for a long time you see im so busy i never seem to have time to work work doesnt really appeal to me anyway i suppose if i had to hustle i could but whats the use what is it that keeps you so busy what are you going to do when you get back for instance well im going to ormond for the auto races and i may enter my new car if i dont get hurt in the races ill take a hunting trip or two then i want to try out an iceboat on the hudson and ill have to be back in new haven by the time the baseball squad limbers up oh i have plenty of work ahead mrs cortlandt let her eyes dwell upon him curiously for a moment then she said have you no ambition certainly what is it why kirk hesitated i cant say right off the reel but ive got it lots of it is there no girl for instance have you never been in love oh see here now anthony blushed in a manner to excite the envy of any woman i dont like em id rather play football that explains something when the time comes you will cease wasting your life and im not wasting my life the young man denied hotly im having a great time simply immense i remember reading an article once by a man who attacked american colleges with bitter personal feeling on the ground that they fostered exactly the attitude toward life which you have just expressed anthony looked sober that was my father he said really how stupid of me to forget the name but i dont agree with him she continued gently you merely lack stimulus if you should meet the right woman then seeing the amusement in his face believe me i know what i am talking about i know what a woman can do your life has been too easy and placid you need some disturbing element to make it ferment but i dont want to ferment why dont you stay in panama and go to work work hideous word for one thing i havent time i must get back you will find great opportunities there but how about the girl who is to sour the syrup of my being and make it ferment oh she may appear at any moment but joking aside you had better think over what i have said she left him with an admonitory shake of her head the santa cruz was now rapidly drawing out of the cold northern winter and into a tropic warmth already the raw chill of higher latitudes was giving way to a balmy springlike temperature while the glittering sunshine transformed the sea into a lively gleaming expanse of sapphire the nights were perfect the days divine the passengers responded as if to a magic draught and kirk found his blood filled with a new vigor a brief sight of columbus landfall served to break the monotony then followed a swift flight past low tropical islands ringed with coral sand upon which broke a lazy milkwhite surf through the glasses villages were spied backed by palm groves and guarded by tall sentinel lighthouses but the santa cruz pushed steadily southward her decks as level as a dancing floor the melancholy voice of her bell tolling the leagues as they slipped past the eastern tongue of cuba rose out of the horizon then dropped astern and the gentle trades began to fan the travellers now that they were in the caribbean schools of flying fish whisked out from under the ships prow and away like tiny silversheathed arrows new constellations rose into the evening sky it became impossible to rest indoors with the tradewinds calling and the passengers spent long lazy hours basking in the breath of the tropics and grudging the pleasure of which sleep deprived them it was the last night of the voyage and the thrill of approaching land was felt by all as usual the monotony of the first day or two had given way to an idle contentment and a vague regret at leaving the ship and severing the ties so newly made home instead of looming close and overshadowing had become a memory rather indistinct and blurred clouded by the proximity of the new and unknown kirk anthony acknowledged to a reluctant enjoyment of the change and found himself less eager to go back as he paced the deck after dinner he felt a lurking desire to defer his return until he had absorbed something more of this warmth and languor he even reflected that he might welcome a stay of some length in the tropics if it were not for the fact that he had so much to do mrs cortlandt joined him as usual and they did a mile around the promenade chatting idly of many things the evening was too glorious to permit of early retiring and a late hour found them leaning over the rail side by side while anthony bewailed the fact that he knew nothing of the country just beyond the dark horizon ahead of them you are quite right his companion agreed you will miss its best flavor if you dont know the history back of it for instance we are now on the spanish main the traditional home of romance and adventure i always wanted to be a pirate he acknowledged gravely up to fifteen then i thought id rather run a candy store the ships of sir henry morgan and the galleons of his catholic majesty philip of spain sailed these waters over yonder she waved a graceful hand to the north and east are the haunts where the adventurers of old england used to lie in wait for their prey ahead of us is the land that pizarro soaked with blood were coming into the oldest country on this side of the globe mr anthony where men lived in peace and plenty when most of europe was a wilderness i suppose such things appeal more to a womans fancy than to a mans but to me theyre mightily alluring kirk wagged his head admiringly as he said i wish i could make language behave like that and edith cortlandt laughed like a young girl oh im not a perfervid poet she disclaimed but everything down here is so full of association i cant help feeling it im beginning to notice it myself maybe its the climate perhaps anyhow it is all very vivid to me did you ever stop to think how brave those men must have been who first went venturing into unknown seas in their little wooden boats they were looking for a short cut to the east indies werent they yes to cathay and then the people they found and conquered the spoils they exacted they were men those conquistadores whatever else they were big cruel heroic fellows like bastida nicuesa balboa pedrarias the assassin and the rest they oppressed the natives terribly yet they paved the way for civilization after all the spaniards did try to uplift the indians you know and the life in the colonies was like that in old spain only more romantic and picturesque why whenever i pass through these latinamerican cities i see in place of the crumbling ruins grand cathedrals and palaces in place of the squalid beggars idling about the marketplaces i see velvetclad dons and highborn ladies arent there any beautiful ladies left a few perhaps what happened to the cathedrals and the velvet fellows and all that oh the old state of affairs couldnt last forever the spanish administration wasnt so bad as is generally supposed yet of course there was too much rapacity and not enough industry central america broadly speaking was known as the treasurechest of the world and there were constant wars and disturbances the colonies as a whole did not progress like those in the north and in course of time deteriorated the old cathedrals decayed and were not rebuilt the old spanish stock died out and in its stead grew up a motley race given to revolt revolution and corruption even when the provinces became free they werent able to unite and form a strong nation the isthmus of panama became a pesthole where the scum of the four seas settled the people became mean and unhealthy in mind and body and morals preserving nothing except the cruelty of their forefathers here and there to be sure one comes across the old castilian breed like a silver thread running through a rotting altarcloth but only here and there and most of those silver threads have become tarnished from contact with the fabric it must be a nice place kirk observed with gentle sarcasm it affords one a great chance to moralize at any rate take the building of this canal for instance first the french came led by a dreamer and poured in the wealth of an empire in order that they might exact toll from the world you see they were all lured by the love of gain the spaniards who pillaged the natives to begin with and the french who set out to squeeze profit from all the other nations but it seems as if the spot were infected the french lost an army in their project corruption gnawed through and the thing ended in disgrace and disaster spain and france have come and gone and at last we yankees have arrived it seems to be the will of god that the youngest lustiest people on the earth should finally be sent to clean this augean stable by jove i never thought of it that way it is a big task mr anthony and the mere digging of the ditch is the smallest part there is a great deal more to be done you see as men attain culture they require more than mere food and drink and bedding and in the same way as nations attain to greatness they require more than mere territory they reach out and absorb power and prestige our decision to build the panama canal is like the landing of another columbus the conquest is to follow after that will come who knows what perhaps more wars more pillage more injustice you talk like a man anthony said admiringly i had no idea you looked at things in such a big way you are laughing at me no indeed you see it is part of my husbands profession as to the romance well all women are romantic and imaginative i suppose and youve been an inspiring listener i dont know about that but youre a corking good talker excuse my archaic english mrs cortlandt turned her eyes upon the speaker and he saw that they were very bright ive been thinking about what you told me the other day he ran on about myself remember im glad i have the knack of making something besides football signals stick in your memory said she have you been thinking about that girl i spoke of yes he replied ingenuously ive been making up my mind to ask you if you happen to have a sister an unmarried sister i mean mrs cortlandt laughed appreciatively no i have no sister but i thank you for the compliment i suppose you meant it for one yes i hope you dont mind not at all im quite sure now that my notion about you was right it will take a woman to make a man of you it used to be my wind that troubled me said the athlete mournfully now it seems to be my heart it doesnt seem to be seriously affected as yet but its remarkable the number of ways in which the heart of man may be reached i remember once having breakfast in a queer little restaurant in the french quarter of new orleans famous for its cooking and for the wellknown people who had eaten there there was a sort of register which the guests were asked to sign and in looking it over i read the inscription of one particularly enthusiastic diner it ran oh madame begue your liver has touched my heart and the story is that the writer made desperate love to the proprietors wife oh come thats rather hard on me i have some emotions besides a hearty appreciation of food no doubt i only mentioned that as one of the ways and seriously i am convinced that however your awakening may come you will be the better for it i do hope the cook will prove to be unmarried he mused imagine having to do away with a husband who can handle a cleaver oh i dont mean you should necessarily marry the woman it would be quite as good for you if she refused even to look at you however let us hope that you meet some nice american girl why not a senorita you have inspired me with spanish romance but mrs cortlandt shook her head wait until you have seen them already i imagine myself under some moonlit balcony teasing chords out of a guitar i have rather a good singing voice you know it is not done that way nowadays panama is americanized you will need a pianola and an automobile and all the romance is gone oh there is romance everywhere there is quite as much in pittsburg as in andalusia but to speak of more practical things mrs cortlandt hesitated slightly i heard you tell the purser the other day about your financial troubles and it occurred to me that mr cortlandt might assist you thanks awfully kirk hastened to say feeling himself flush uncomfortably but i shant need anything the old gentleman will wire me whatever i ask for does mr cortlandt know how i am fixed no please dont tell him i im a little bit ashamed of myself youre not going yes it is getting late and my maid is looking for me oh im sorry its lonesome around here without somebody to talk to he took her hand and shook it as if she were a man youve been mighty good to me and i wish you had a sister thats all she left him the memory of a very bright and very girlish smile and he found himself thinking that she could not be so much older than he after all mr cortlandt was awaiting his wife and rose courteously as she entered their suite did you send annette for me she inquired yes i thought you had forgotten the hour we rise at six my dear she returned coolly i was quite aware of the time i was talking to mr anthony do you find him so amusing very much so hes such a boy bytheway some of the passengers are remarking about your friendship for him mrs cortlandt shrugged i expected that does it interest you the man favored her with his wintry smile not at all if he should need assistance while in panama i should be obliged if you would accommodate him money yes or anything else he left new york unexpectedly dont you think that is going a bit too far you know i dont fancy him mrs cortlandt frowned slightly we wont discuss it she said i assured him he was at liberty to call on us for anything and naturally that ends the matter naturally he agreed but his colorless cheeks flushed dully vi in which kirk anthony is greatly surprised when kirk came on deck early the following morning he found the santa cruz nosing her way into colony harbor a land fog obscured his view somewhat but through it he beheld a low irregular line of mountains in the background and close at hand a town the ship came to anchor abreast of a point upon which he descried a squat little spiderlegged lighthouse and long rows of frame dwellings half hidden behind slender palmtrees beyond were warehouses and docks and the funnels of many ships on either side of the bay was a dense tropic wilderness as the sun dissipated the morning haze he saw that the hills were matted with a marvellous vivid green there were no clearings on the slopes no open spaces dotted with farmhouses or herds the jungle flowed down to the waters edge in an unbroken sweep and the town was cut out of it a launch came plunging through the swells and the deck steward made his rounds requesting the passengers to assemble for medical examination kirk found the cortlandts ahead of him whats coming off he inquired vaccination cortlandt explained briefly they are very particular about disease his wife added this used to be the worst feverspot in the world you know when we were here five years ago we saw carloads of dead people nearly every day a funeral train was a familiar sight what a pleasant place to spend my vacation exclaimed kirk now if i can rent a room over the morgue and board with the village undertaker ill have a nice time oh theres no more yellow fever no sickness at all in fact said mr cortlandt will you go over to panama city or will you stay in colon i think ill remain on the ship then she cant get away without me kirk answered but when after taking his turn before the doctors he explained his desire to the purser that worthy replied im sorry but youll have to arrange that with the agent we make a charge you know just like a hotel im going to cable my old man for money the officer shook his head with finality nothing doing mr locke anthony ill take no chances if you dont pay ill have to look here do you want to know what i think of you mr anthony locke i havent any special yearnings in that direction but what do you think about me well i dont think your name is either locke or anthony marvellous and i dont think you have any money coming to you either mighty intellect i think you are no good youre not alone in that belief but what has all that to do with my sleeping aboard the santa cruz if you want to stay aboard youll have to pay in advance youre not so foolish as you try to make out those are glorious words of praise kirk acknowledged but ill make a bet with you what that you change your mind i am just as foolish as i appear and ill prove it ill bet my ring against your shirts that my name is anthony and if i dont come through with the price of a ticket to new york you can keep the ring very well but meanwhile i dont intend to be stuck for your bill the purser was a man of admirable caution all right then i shall throw myself upon the mercy of strangers and take your belongings with me by this time the ship was being warped into her berth and the dock was crowded there were little brown customs inspectors in khaki little brown policemen in blue little brown merchants in white and huge black jamaicans in all colors of rags here and there moved a bronzed businesslike american and anthony noticed that for the most part these were cleancut aggressivelooking young fellows he was delayed but an instant by the customs officials then made his way out through a barnlike structure to the street reflecting that after all there are advantages in travelling light he came into a blazinghot glaring white street jammed with all sorts of vehicles the drivers of which seemed perpetually upon the point of riot before him stretched a shadeless brick pavement with a railroad track on one side and on the other a line of naked frame buildings hideous in their sameness the sun beat down fiercely kirk mopped his face with the pursers handkerchief and wondered if this were really december clumsy twowheeled carts came bumping past some with prehensilefooted negroes perched upon them others driven by turbancrowned hindoos a fleet of dilapidated surreys and coaches each equipped with a musical chime and drawn by a fleabitten ratlike horse thronged the square kirk noticed with amusement that the steeds were of stronger mentality than the drivers judging from the way they dominated the place kicking biting squealing ramming one another locking wheels and blocking traffic the while their futile owners merely jerked the reins after the fashion of a streetcar conductor ringing up fares or swore softly in spanish silentfooted coolies drifted past sullenfaced negroes jostled him stately martinique women stalked through the confusion with queenly dignity these last were especially qualified to take the strangers eye being tall and slender and wearing gaudy headdresses the tips of which stood up like rabbits ears unlike the fat and noisy jamaicans they were neat and clean their skirts snowwhite and stiffly starched and they held themselves as proudly erect as if pacing a stage the indescribable confusion of races reminded the young american of a red sea port where the myriad peoples of the far east intermingle he heard a dozen different dialects even the negroes used an accent that was difficult to understand one thing only struck a familiar note and that with peculiar force and sharpness down the railroad track toward him came a locomotive with the letters p r r upon it at which he said aloud hurrah im in jersey city ill take the twentythird street ferry and be at the astor in no time he made his way slowly through the turmoil to the cable office where he wrote a message only to have it refused we dont send c o d the operator told him must have coin in advance eh yes sir i left my goldpurse on the dresser kirk said cheerfully ill be back later then he wandered forth again bearing his bundle of shirts beneath his arm he thought of appealing to the cortlandts before they left for panama city but could not bring himself to ask a favor from that slim agateeyed man for whom he felt such an instinctive distaste instead he resolved to enlist the services of the american consul he began to feel the heat now and his borrowed collar drooped but as he neared the seaward side of town there was a remarkable transformation a delightful cooling breeze swept in from the ocean and when he finally came out upon a palmguarded road along the breakers he paused in silent enjoyment the tradewinds were drawing inward as steadily as if forced by a great electric fan piling the green waters upon the rocks in a ceaseless soothing murmur making the palm fronds overhead rustle like the silken skirts of an aerial ballet the effect was wonderful for while the air was balmy and soft it was also deliciously refreshing and seemed to have magic properties after some further wandering he found the consuls house and knocked at the door whereupon a highpitched querulous voice from inside cried come in dammit dont stand there hammering kirk entered to find a huge globular man clad in soiled linens sprawled in a musty morris chair and sipping a highball the mans face and neck were of a purplish apoplectic hue he seemed to radiate heatwaves like a baseburner is this mr weeks kirk inquired thats me my name is anthony glad to meet you wheezed the fat man extending a limp moist hand without rising when kirk had grasped it he felt like wiping his own palm have a seat the speaker indicated a brokenbacked rocker encumbered with damp clothes newspapers and books just dump that rubbish on the floor it dont matter where then he piped at the top of his thin little voice zeelah hey zeelah bring some more ice one glance showed anthony that the place was indescribably disordered a rickety desk was half concealed beneath a litter of papers books breakfast dishes and what not a typewriter occupied a chair and all about the floor were scattered documents where the wind had blown them shoes and articles of clothing were piled in the corners there was not a sound piece of furniture in the place and through an open door leading to another room at the rear could be seen a cheap iron bed sagging hammocklike its head and foot posts slanting like tepee poles doubtless from the weight of its owner in answer to mr weekss shout a slatternly negress with dragging skirts and overrun shoes entered carrying a washbowl partly filled with ice just get in mr anthony yes sir on the santa cruz fine ship mr weeks rose ponderously and wiped out a glass with a bath towel while kirk noticed that two damp halfmoons had come through his stiffly starched linen trousers where his dripping knees had pressed he walked with a peculiar springy roll as if pads of fat had grown between his joints and once an impulse had been given his massive frame it required time in which to become effective the sound of his breathing was plainly audible as he prepared his guests beverage youll like that he predicted theres one good thing we get in colon and thats whiskey with a palsied hand he presented the glass his cuffs were limp and tight his red wrists were ringed like those of a baby as he rolled back toward the morris chair his stomach surged up and down as if about to break from its moorings i came in to ask a favor anthony announced i suppose every tourist does the same thats part of a consuls duty mr weeks panted while his soft cheeks swelled with every exhalation thats what im here for i want to cable home for money a little poker game on the way down eh he began to shake ponderously im broke and they wont take a collect message at the cable office you see i didnt know i was coming some of my friends gave me a knockout and shipped me off on the santa cruz the wireless wasnt working we didnt stop at jamaica so this is my first chance to get word home what do you wish me to do cable for me and see that i have a place to stop until i get an answer a look of distrust crept slowly into the consuls little eyes are you absolutely broke i havent got a jingle how long will it take to hear from your people if my father is at home ill hear instantly and if he isnt ill have to wait what makes you think hell wire you money hes never failed yet you see im something like a comet he knows ill be around every so often mr weeks began to complain i dont know you mr whats the name again anthony im a poor man and ive been an easy mark for every tropical tramp from vera cruz to guayaquil your father may not be able to help you and then ill be holding the bag i think you dont understand who he is did you ever hear of darwin k anthony of albany new york mr weekss thick lids opened this time to display a far different emotion certainly well hes the goat slowly grandly the american consul set his frame in motion whereat kirk said quickly dont get up i understand but mr weeks had gone too far to check himself so he lurched resiliently into an upright position then across the floor and reaching out past his undulating front as a man reaches forth from the midst of a crowd shook his guest heartily by the hand why didnt you say so he bubbled im here to accommodate folks like you darwin k anthony well rather thanks the young man wiped his hand surreptitiously if you will fix it so i can cable him and sleep aboard the ship ill be greatly obliged nothing of the sort mr weeks blew through his wet lips ill cable him myself and youll stay right here as my guest delighted to have the privilege kirk cast another glance over the place and demurred hastily really i couldnt think of putting you out i can stay on the santa cruz as well as not i couldnt hear to such a thing youre tired of ship life everybody is and i have lots of room too much room its a pleasure to meet real people this damn country is so full of crooks and deadbeats no sir youll stay right here where it is cool and comfortable with a pudgy forefinger he stripped his purple brow of a row of glistening sweatdrops ill have zeelah fix up a bed where this glorious breeze will play on you mr anthony that tradewind blows just like that all the time never dies down its the only thing that makes life bearable here that and the whiskey have another highball no i thank you darwin say ill send a cart for your baggage right now i have it with me six shirts all guilty then ill send your father a message this minute im delighted at the privilege of being the first to advise him of your safety and to relieve his mental anguish mr weeks rocked toward the desk adjusted a chair behind him spread his legs apart and sat down sidewise so that he could reach the inkwell he overhung his chair so generously that from the front he appeared to be perched precariously upon its edge or to be holding some one in his lap where are those cable blanks he cried irritably stirring up the confusion in front of him here they are anthony picked one up from the floor its that damn wind again i cant keep anything in place unless i sit on it thats the trouble with this country theres always a breeze blowing thanks im getting a trifle heavy to stoop makes me dizzy in a moment he read what he had written darwin k anthony albany new york your son well and safe here as my guest asks you cable him money for return weeks american consul that tells the story itll please him to know im looking after you my boy you are very kind dont speak of it im glad to get in touch with your father we need capital in this country hes a hard man in money matters said darwin k anthonys son i believe i enjoy the distinction of being the only person who ever made him loosen all successful men are cautious weeks declared but if he knew the wonderful opportunities this country presents the speaker leaned forward while his chair creaked dangerously and said with impressiveness my dear sir do you realize that a cocoa palm after it is seven years old drops a nut worth five cents every day in the year and requires no care whatever except to gather the fruit no fact and we grow the best ones in the world right here but the demand is increasing so rapidly that in ten years there will be a famine think of it a famine of cocoanuts mr weeks paused to lend dramatic effect thats fierce kirk acknowledged what are they good for eating people make cakes out of them and oil and candy good cocoanut land can be bought for fifty cents an acre selected seeds for five cents each labor is sixty cents a day no frosts no worms no bugs you sit still and they drop in your lap the bugs no no the cocoanuts fine but thats nothing do you realize that this soil will raise sugarcane the size of your of my thigh and once you plant it you cant keep it cut out its all news to me you can buy sugarcane land for a dollar an acre it costs im no good at figures mr weeks and rubber theres the chance for a man with capital rubber i will i mean is that so ever see any rubbertrees only in brooklyn i mean wild rubber this country is full of it the natives bring it in all you have to do is buy timber land you can get it for a song plant your rubberseed and let er go gallagher in ten years you go back cut off your timber sell it for enough to make you rich and there is your rubber velvet he concluded triumphantly rubber velvet yes its velvet all clear you cant lose my boy theres a thousand ways to get rich down here and i know em all what i need is capital if i had your fathers backing say its a mighty good thing you came to see me i can do your old man a lot of good im conservative i am and what he needs is a good conservative man to manage his investments why talk about quick money the speaker thrust forth a finger that looked like a peeled banana ive got a goldmine not a bit like it kirk shook his head they dont behave this one will its an old spanish mine and hasnt been worked for three centuries its rich rich ill take you in as my partner and well get your father to open it up what do you say if he doesnt like that well get him a streetrailway franchise im close to the government and there isnt a steel rail in any city of the republic i know all the spiggoty politicians the what the spiggoties thats what we call the panamanians they no spiggoty english understand its a funny name now my boy theres one thing i want you to be careful of dont let some of these fellows around here get you excited this country is full of promoters cheap skates and that sort and theyll try to stampede you into some investment you trust to me im conservative ill put you up at the club and when you get straightened around well talk business meanwhile ill send this cable mr weeks was even better than his word he took kirk with him and went heaving down the street his body quivering at every step as if hung upon a whalebone framework the breath wheezing noisily in and out of his chest the perspiration streaming from his purple face in rivulets he put up his guest at the club and invited some of his friends to join them for dinner that evening on the wide balcony then noting anthonys heavy clothing he said you need some linens kirk that suit looks like a dog bed you dont mind my calling you kirk do you im flattered however i cant get readymade clothes large enough and besides its hardly worth while for the length of time nonsense now youre here we wont let you go right back theres a chinese tailor on bottle alley wholl have you a suit to measure by noon tomorrow and he only charges seven dollars goods and all accordingly the two journeyed to bottle alley and selected some linen whereupon instead of one suit the consul ordered three having them charged to his account kirk really enjoyed that evening at the wayfarers club for once the cool of evening had come the place filled up rapidly with as fine a crowd of men as he had ever met there were young fellows from the railroad offices merchants from the town engineers from the big job the proximity of which made itself felt like a mysterious presence there was a trader from down the san blas coast a benevolent whitehaired judge with a fund of excellent stories a lieutenant in the zone police who impressed kirk as a real remington trooper come to life and many another they all welcomed the yale man with that freedom which one finds only on the frontier and as he listened to them he began to gain some idea of the tremendous task that occupied their minds they were all men with work to do there were no idlers there was no class distinction one topic of conversation prevailed and although the talk drifted away from it at times it invariably came back to the job in the end weeks did himself credit as a host his table spread on the latticed balcony where the neverfailing tradewinds fanned it was decorated tastefully with flowers redshaded candles white linen and gleaming silver gave it a metropolitan air both the food and the wine were well served and the consuls halfdozen guests soon became mellowed and friendly kirk felt he had fallen among kindred spirits for it was almost like a fraternity dinner when finally they arose some one proposed a game of draw poker and insisted upon kirks joining he was about to refuse when weeks drew him aside to say dont let the money question stand in your way kirk youre my guest and your iou is as good as a government bond so go as far as you like a considerable portion of anthonys time in college had been devoted to a course in draw poker recitations so to speak being conducted in the upper rooms of a greek letter frat and he cherished the belief that he had at least learned to distinguish a spade flush from an arkansas blaze but he soon found that these men had forgotten more about the game than he could ever hope to learn at any university and when the crowd broke up at midnight he signed his name to a tab for forty dollars early the next day the following cablegram was left at the american consulate weeks consul colon anthony absent returns friday copley copley is the governors secretary kirk explained that means that ill miss the santa cruz and have to wait another week im delighted the consul said heartily perhaps you could stake me to a ticket ill remit when i get to new york my pay isnt due for a fortnight weeks explained after an instants hesitation you see im interested in so many ventures it keeps me well broke anyhow you cant go until we have arranged an investment for your father kirk could not help thinking that a man of the consuls wide acquaintance and business capacity could have raised the necessary funds without much trouble but not wishing to embarrass his host he refrained from pressing the matter and resigned himself as best he could to an extension of his exile meanwhile he decided to visit the canal for on every side he heard nothing but echoes of the great work and he began to feel that he owed it to himself to view it but his plans were upset by the weather on the following day it began to rain and it continued to rain day and night thereafter until colon became a sodden dripping horror the soil melted into a quagmire the streets became sluices the heavens closed down like a leaden pall and the very air became saturated it was hot also and sticky indoors a mould began to form rust grew like a fungus outdoors the waving palm tops spilled a deluge upon roof and sidewalk at every gust their trunks streamed like hydrants kirk had never seen such a rain it kept up hour after hour day after day until the monotony became maddening the instant he stepped out from shelter he was drenched and even in his rooms he could discover no means of drying his clothes his garments hanging beside his bed at night were clammy and overlaid with moisture in the morning things began to smell musty leather objects grew long hoary whiskers of green mould to his amazement the inhabitants seemed quite oblivious to the change however and while they agreed that the weather was a trifle misty they pursued their duties as usual assuring him that the rain might continue for a month it was too much for kirk however and he deferred his trip over the line spending his time instead at the wayfarers club in his daylight hours he listened to weekss unending dissertations upon the riches of the tropics at night he played poker with such uniform bad luck that his opponents developed for him an increasing affection but all things have an end and friday morning broke clear and hot well hear from the old gentleman today sure he told weeks at breakfast hes regularity itself the train despatchers set their watches by him now that it has cleared off we must look into the cocoanut business the consul announced ill make you a rich man kirk im rich anyhow or i will be money doesnt mean much to me your father is many times a millionaire isnt he weeks little red eyes were very bright and curious kirk had seen that look many times before and knew its meaning hence he replied rather brusquely so i believe and a moment later declared his determination to avail himself of the good weather and see something of the town the prospect of squaring his account with this fawning fat man filled him with relief and once away from the consulate he stayed until late in the afternoon it was nearly dark when he strolled in to inquire well did you get an answer yes weeks fumbled excitedly through the papers on his desk how much did he send heres the message read it yourself kirk read as follows weeks consul colon your guest an impostor have no son anthony well ill be damned he ejaculated this is a joke weeks was beginning to pant a joke hey i suppose it was a joke to impose on me dont you believe im kirk anthony no i do not i just discovered today that your name is jefferson locke stein told me anthony laughed lightly oh laugh if you want to youre a smooth article with your talk about football and automobiles and millionaire fathers but you happened to select the wrong millionaire for a father this time and im going to give you a taste of our spiggoty jails you cant arrest me you offered to take me in the fat man grew redder than ever he seemed upon the point of exploding his whole body shook and quivered as if a head of steam were steadily gathering inside him you cant get out of it that way he cried at the top of his little voice ive fed you for a week i put you up at my club that very suit of clothes you have on is mine well dont burst a seam over the matter my governor doesnt know the facts ill cable him myself this time and live off me for another week i suppose not if i know it he says he has no son isnt that enough he doesnt understand and how about those gambling debts chattered the mountain of flesh you thought youd fool me for a week while you won enough money from my friends to get away now ill have to pay them oh ill fix you you go slow about having me pinched kirk said darkly or ill make you jump through a hoop ill pay my debts youre a rich man eh money doesnt mean much to you hey mocked the infuriated consul i suppose this is an old game of yours well you stuck me all right because you knew i couldnt have you arrested id be a laughingstock forever but ive had your card cancelled and ive left word for the waiters to throw you out if you show up at the wayfarers will you lend me enough money to cable again asked anthony with an effort more money no fairly screamed the other you get out of my house mr kirk anthony and dont you show yourself around here again ill keep the rest of your wardrobe his erstwhile guest underwent an abrupt reversal of emotion to the indignant amazement of mr weeks he burst into a genuine laugh saying all right landlord keep my baggage i believe thats the custom but oh gee this is funny he was still laughing when he reached the public square for at last he had begun to see the full humor of adelbert higgins joke vii the reward of merit facing for the first time in his life an instant and absolute need of money kirk found himself singularly lacking in resource and a period of sober contemplation brought him no helpful thought perhaps after all he decided his best course would be to seek relief from the cortlandts accordingly he strolled into the offices of the steamship company near by and asked leave to telephone but on calling up the hotel tivoli he was told that his friends were out nor could he learn the probable hour of their return as he hung up the receiver he noticed that the office was closing and seeing the agent about to quit the place addressed him id like to ask a favor what is it will you introduce me to the best hotel in town i have friends in panama city but theyre out and its getting late there isnt a good hotel here but you dont need an introduction just walk in theyre not full im broke and i have no baggage dont you know anybody i know the american consul been stopping at his house for a week but he threw me out a great light seemed suddenly to dawn upon the agent oh youre locke said he with the air of one who detects a fraud too obvious to be taken seriously now i understand the purser on the santa cruz told me about you sorry i cant help you but im a salaried man ive got to sleep stoutly maintained the other somebody will have to take care of me i cant sit up all night see here my friend i dont know what your game is but you cant sting me the agent finished locking up then walked away leaving his visitor to reflect anew upon the average human beings ignoble lack of faith in his fellows it was growing dark from farther down the waterfront the lights of the wayfarers club shone invitingly and kirk decided to appeal there for assistance in spite of weekss warning he felt sure he could prevail upon some of the members to tide him over for the night but as he neared the place he underwent a sudden change of heart slowly mounting the stairs ahead of him like a trained hippopotamus was the colossal panting figure of the american consul at sight of which kirks pride rose up in arms and forbade him to follow doubtless weeks had spread his story broadcast it was manifestly impossible for him to appeal to his recent card partners they would believe he had deliberately imposed upon them it was humiliating yet there seemed nothing to do except to await the cortlandts return and if he failed to reach them by telephone to spend the night in the open it occurred to him that he might try to locate stein or some other of his late fellowpassengers but they were probably scattered across the isthmus by this time a band was playing in the plaza when he came back a very good band too and finding a bench he allowed his mind the relief of idly listening to the music the square was filling with spanish people who soon caught and held his attention recalling mrs cortlandts words regarding the intermixture of bloods in this country for every imaginable variety of mongrel breed looked out from the loitering crowd but no matter what the racial blend black was the fundamental tone undeniably the castilian strain was running out not one passerby in ten seemed really white naturally there was no color line welldressed girls evidently white or nearly so went arm and arm with wenches as black as night men of every shade fraternized freely it was a picturesque and everchanging scene kirk saw darkfaced girls wearing their unfailing badge of maidenhood a white mantilla followed invariably at a distance by respectful admirers who never presumed to walk beside them wives whom marriage had forced to exchange the white shawl for the black escorted by their husbands huge slouching jamaican negroes of both sexes silentfooted stately barbadians who gave a touch of savagery to the procession some of the women wore giant firebugs whose glowing eyes lent a ghostly radiance to hair or lace at once weird and beautiful round and round the people walked to the strains of their national music among them dozens upon dozens of the everpresent little blackandtan policemen who constitute the republics standing army as the evening drew on kirk became conscious of an unwonted sensation once before he had had the same feeling while on a moosetrail in maine but now there was no guide with a packful of food to come to his relief and he could not muster up the spirit that enables men to bear vacation hardships with cheerfulness he began to wonder whether a fast of twentyfour hours would seriously weaken a man and rather than make the experiment he again called up the tivoli rejoicing anew in the fact that there was no toll on isthmian messages but again he was disappointed this time he was told that the cortlandts were doubtless spending the night out of town with friends soon after his second return to the park the concert ended the crowd melted away and he found himself occupying a bench with a negro of about the same age as himself for perhaps an hour the two sat there hearkening to the dying noises of the city then kirk unable to endure the monotony longer turned sharply on his companion and said why dont you go home the negro started his eyes flew open then he laughed oh boss i got no home really no sar kirk reflected that he had found not only the right place but also fitting company for his vigil what does a person do in that case he asked oh he goes to work sar for the night i mean are you going to stay here until morning yes sar if the policeman will hadmit of it the fellows dialect was so strange that kirk inquired where did you come from jamaica sar i was barn on the narth coast of the hisland sar did you just arrive here oh lard no i ave been a liver here for two year a liver kirk could not help smiling yes sar sometimes i labor on the docks again in the hoffice lahst week lose i my position and today my room halso landladies is bad females sar very common youve been shooting craps said kirk accusingly crops sar what is crops you dont know what craps is i mean youve been gambling oh boss i hinvest my money indeed lahst sunday nearly won i the big prize i ad hall but three numbers lottery ticket eh height height chawnces in all the negro sighed but dreams is false sar so ive heard well it seems were in the same boat this beautiful evening i have no place to sleep either you are humbugging me no im flat broke oh chot me true mon i am chatting you true im an outcast of fortune like yourself such talk you make i laugh this house what you make i laugh repeated the other in a broad devonshire dialect praise god you happear like a gentleman i trust this little experience will not permanently affect my social standing bytheway what is your name hallan hallan no sar hallan is that your first or last name both sar hallan hallan mr allan allan youre unusually dark for a scotchman said kirk gravely now speaking as one gentleman to another do you happen to know where we can get a handout andout inquired the puzzled negro yes a lunch cant you lead me to a banana vine or a breadfruit bakery im starving they grow the finest cocoanuts in the world right here worth five cents apiece they require no care have no worms no bugs you sit still and they drop in your lap cant you show me a tree where we can sit and wait for something to drop allan replied seriously but when the cocoanut falls it is no good for heating sar the milk is hacid i see you have a sense of humor you should be in the consular service but hacid or sweet heating or cooling i must get something into my stomach its as flat as a wet envelope the jamaican rose saying step this way please i know the place where a very good female is peraps she will make us a present how far is it oh not too far allan replied optimistically and kirk hopefully followed him but at the opposite side of the square they were halted by a sudden commotion which drove all thoughts of food out of their minds from a building across the street issued a buglecall upon which an indescribable confusion broke forth men began running to and fro a voice in authority shouted orders each of which was the signal for another buglecall through the wideopen doors the panamanians could be seen scurrying around a hosecart apparently in search of clothes some were struggling into red shirts others were stamping their feet into short boots or girding themselves with wide canvas belts meanwhile the chief issued more orders and the bugle continued to blow oh look boss allan cried quickly there must be a flagration its a spiggoty hose company as i live come on already a glare could be seen above the crowded portion of the city and the two set off in that direction at a run leaving the bugle sounding in the rear and the gallant firemen still wrestling with their uniforms they had nearly reached the fire when around a corner back of them with frightful speed and clangor came a modern automobile firetruck clinging to which was a swarm of little brown men in red shirts and helmets they reminded the american of monkeys on a circus horse and although he had been counted a reckless driver he exclaimed in astonishment at the daring way in which the chauffeur took the turn it was truly amazing for the machine which was the latest improvement in imported firefighting machinery skidded the full width of the street threatening to rip its tires off and turn turtle then leaped upon the curb before its driver could straighten it up and in a magnificent sweep carried away the wooden supports of an overhanging balcony the timbers parted like straws there came a shrill uproar from inside the building as the sleeping occupants poured forth but without a pause the yankee machine whizzed on up the street its gong clanging its occupants holding on for dear life the peaceful inhabitants of colon fleeing from its path like quail before the hoofs of a runaway horse hit her up kirk yelled delightedly then leaned against a lamppost and laughed until he was weak in the midst of his merriment appeared the company he had just seen making up they had found their uniforms at last it seemed down to the final belt and shoelace and now came charging gallantly along in the tracks of the more speedy motor they were drawing their handreel each brave lad tugging lustily and panting with fatigue kirk and his guide fell in behind and jogged to the scene of the conflagration a threestoried building was already half gutted out of its windows roared long fiery tongues the structure snapped and volleyed a chorus to the sullen monotone of destruction the street was littered with the household belongings of the neighborhood and from the galleries and windows near by came such a flight of miscellaneous articles as to menace the safety of those below men shouted women screamed children shrieked figures appeared upon the firelit balconies hurling forth armfuls of cooking utensils bedding lamps food and furniture utterly careless of where they fell or of the damage they suffered kirk saw one man fling a graphophone from a top window then lower a mattress with a rope on all sides was a bedlam which the arrival of the firemen only augmented the fire captains shouted orders to the buglers the buglers blew feebly upon their horns the companies deployed in obedience to the bugles then everybody waited for further directions again the trumpet sounded whereupon each fireman began to interfere with his neighbor a series of quarrels arose as couplings were made or broken then after an interminable delay water began to flow as if by a miracle but except in rare instances it failed to reach the flames a laddertruck drawn by another excited company now rumbled upon the scene its arrival adding to the general disorder meanwhile the steady tradewind fanned the blaze to evergrowing proportions why the devil dont they get closer kirk inquired of his jamaican companion allans eyes were wide and ringed with white his teeth gleamed in a grin of ecstasy as he replied oh lard my god it is too ot sar greatly too ot it would take a stout eart to do such a thing nonsense theyll never put it out this way hey kirk attracted the attention of a nearby nozzleman walk up to it it wont bite you but the valiant firefighter held stubbornly to his post while the stream he directed continued to describe a graceful curve and spatter upon the sidewalk in front of the burning building youre spoiling that old womans bed anthony warned him at which a policeman with drawn club forced him back as if resentful of criticism other peace officers compelled the crowd to give way then fell upon the distracted property holders and beat them off their piles of furniture for perhaps ten minutes there was no further change in the situation then a great shout arose as it was seen that the roof of the adjoining building had burst into flame at this the fanfare of trumpets sounded again firemen rushed down the street dragging a line of hose and drenching the onlookers but despite their hurry they halted too soon and their stream just failed to reach the blazing roof by now the heat had grown really intense and the more hardy heroes in the vanguard retreated to less trying positions the voice of the crowd had arisen to a roar rivalling that of the flames they must intend to let the whole town burn cried anthony yes sar very probably sar kirk pointed to the nearest fireman if hed get up under that wall he could save the roof and be out of the heat he undertook to convey this suggestion to the fellow but without result i cant stand this he exclaimed at last lets give him a hand allan very well sar here help me get a kink in this hose there now you hold it until you feel me pull kirk forced his way out through the crowd to find the fireman holding the nozzle from which a feeble stream was dribbling and mechanically directing it at the fire kirk laid hold of the canvas and with a heave dragged it along with its rightful guardian ten feet forward but there had been no bugleblown order for this and the uniformed man pulled backward with all his might chattering at kirk in spanish well then let go anthony shook the panamannikin loose then ran forward across the street until he brought up at the end of the slack and felt the hose behind him writhe and swell as allan released his hold the next instant the negro was at his side and the two found themselves half blistered by the heat that rolled out upon them but the newly ignited roof was within range and the stream they played upon it made the shingles fly oh lard allan was crying oh lard i shall hexpire pull down your hat and shield your face the fireman they had despoiled began to drag at the hose from a safe distance but when kirk made as if to turn the nozzle upon him he scampered away amid the jeers of the crowd a few moments later the american felt a hand upon his arm and saw an angry policeman who was evidently ordering him back behind him stood the excited nozzleman with two companions he says you should return the ose where you found it allan translated leave us alone kirk replied you fellows help the others well attend to this more rapid words and gesticulations followed in the midst of which a dapper young man in a uniform somewhat more impressive than the others dashed up flung himself upon anthony and endeavored to wrench the hose from his hands meanwhile he uttered epithets in broken english which the other had no difficulty in understanding kirk promptly turned the nozzle upon him and the full force of colons waterpressure struck him squarely in the stomach doubling him up like the kick of a mule down the newcomer went then half rolled half slid across the street as the stream continued to play upon him he scrambled to his feet a sorry spectacle of waving arms and dripping garments his cries of rage drowned in the delighted clamor of the beholders i guess theyll keep away now laughed kirk as he turned back to his selfappointed task but allan exclaimed fearfully oh boss i fear he is some igh hofficer never mind were having a lot of fun its medals for us gold medals for bravery allan tomorrow the board of aldermen will thank us but this prediction seemed illfounded an instant later a halfdozen policemen advanced in a businesslike manner and their leader announced come you are arrest pinched what for were doing a lot of good here come queeck oh lard my god allan mumbled i shall die and kill myself they wont do anything to us kirk assured him ive been pinched lots of times well have to quit though and thats a pity it was just getting good he surrendered the hose to a fireman who promptly retreated with it to a discreet position then followed his captors who were now buzzing like bees dont get excited he said to allan noting his frightened look theyll turn us loose all right but a moment after they were clear of the town he was surprised to see that the negros captors had snapped comealongs upon him in spite of his repeated promises to go quietly these handcuffs kirk saw were of the type used upon desperate criminals consisting of chains fitted with handles so contrived that a mere twist of the officers hand would cut the prisoners flesh to the bone you dont need to do that he assured the fellow who had made the arrest but instead of heeding his words the men on each side of the jamaican twisted stoutly forcing the black boy to cry out in pain he hung back protesting all right sar ill come ill come but again they tightened their instruments of torture and their victim began to struggle at this an evilfaced man in blue struck him brutally upon the head with his club then upon the shoulders as if to silence his groans the boy flung up his manacled hands to shield himself and the light from a street lamp showed blood flowing where the chains had cut the whole proceeding wat so unprovoked so sickening in its cruelty that kirk who until this instant had looked upon the affair as a rather enjoyable lark flew into a fury and disregarding his own captors leaped forward before the policeman could strike a third time he swung his fist and the man with the club hurtled across the street as if shot from a bow then lay still in the gutter with another blow he felled one of the handcuffmen but at the same time other hands grasped at him and he was forced to lay about vigorously on all sides they rushed him with the ferocity of mad dogs and he knocked them spinning one after another a whistle blew shrilly other uniforms came running more whistles piped and almost before he realized it he found himself in the centre of a pack of leanfaced brown men who were struggling to pull him down and striking at him with their clubs with a sudden wild thrill he realized that this was no ordinary street fight this was deadly he must beat off these fellows or be killed but as fast as he cleared them away others appeared as if by magic until a dozen or more were swarming upon him like hungry ants they clung to his arms his legs his clothing with a desperate courage wholly admirable in itself while strokes were aimed at him from every quarter time and again they dragged him off his feet only to have him shake them loose but though most of their blows went wild or found a mark among their own numbers he was felled at last and a moment later with head reeling and wits flickering he was dragged to his knees by handcuffs like those on allans wrists the pain as the chains bit into his flesh brought him to his feet despite the blows and kicks that were rained upon him crying hoarsely let me go damn you let me go but a wrench at the gyves took the fight out of him for he felt that the bones in his wrists must surely be crushed one side of his head was strangely big and numb a warm stream trickled down his cheek but he had no time to think of his condition for his assailants fell upon him with fresh fury and he reeled about striving to shield himself every movement however was construed as resistance and his punishment continued until at last he must have fainted from pain or had his wits scattered by a blow on the head for when he recovered consciousness he found himself in a filthy illlighted room flung upon a wooden platform that ran along the wall evidently serving as a bed near him allan was huddled his black face distorted with pain and ashen with apprehension viii el comandante takes a hand where are we queried anthony as he took in the surroundings this is the prison sar gee im sick kirk lay back upon the platform and closed his eyes did they hurt you much oh yes very considerably sorry i got you into it allan i never thought theyd be so cranky again he groaned i want a drink let me get it those spiggoties will not give it to you allan went to the door and called to the guard an instant later he returned with a tin cup i guess they knocked me out kirk said dazedly i never was hit like that before and jailed say we must get out of her call the chief or the man in charge will you i cant speak the language please sar if you hanger them they will beat us again beat not here oh yes they might kill us they wouldnt do that a white man they killed lahst hautumn and several of my people have passed away in this prison nobody can ear nothing nobody knows what appens ere oh well they wouldnt dare touch us im an american citizen ill notify the consul roused at the mere suggestion kirk staggered to the door and shouted lustily when no one answered he shook the iron grating whereupon a guard leisurely approached and after listening stolidly to his request went back to his post at the other end of the hall this time the american sent forth such an uproar that a man evidently corresponding in authority to a sergeant appeared with the command to be quiet let me out of here loudly demanded the prisoner i want the chief or the alcalde or somebody in charge i want to know what im booked for i want to telephone telephone dont you understand and arrange bail quick now but the officer merely frowned at him obviously threatening a resort to force if this outburst did not cease at once i tell you i want to get out insisted kirk i want to know what im charged with and have my friends get bail the man nodded his understanding and went away but an hour passed and he did not return then another hour followed and anthony who had now begun to feel the effect of his drubbing more keenly renewed his clamor with the result that a halfdozen policemen appeared causing allan to retreat to a corner and mumble prayers from their demeanor it looked as though they were really bent upon mischief but kirk soon saw that an official had come in answer to his call he felt less reassured when he perceived that the person in uniform who now stepped forward was the same upon whom he had turned the hose earlier in the evening this was a blackhaired blackeyed young fellow of perhaps thirty while his skin was swarthy even in this poor light it could be seen that he was of the real castilian type and of a much better class than the others he was slender and straight his mouth small and decorated by a carefully pencilled little mustache which was groomed to a needle sharpness his hands and feet were as dainty as those of a woman he was undeniably striking in appearance and might have passed for handsome had it not been for the scowl that distorted his features eh ere you are he began angrily yes i want to get out too what does this treatment mean the newcomer stepped toward the other occupant of the cell at which allan broke out in terror dont you touch me im a british object but it was evidently not the mans intention to offer any further indignity to his prisoners at that time after scanning the jamaican carefully he issued an order to one of his men who left the room and im an american anthony declared youll have to answer for this peraps you don know who i am i am ramon alfarez comandante of police an you dare to trow the water of the osewagon upon my person your goverment will settle for those insolt his white teeth showed in a furious snarl i dont give a damn who you are ill get bail or do whatever your law requires but i want to get out and i want to get out now the commandants eyes flashed as he asked shortly wat is your name anthony your men tried to kill that boy and when i wouldnt stand for it they beat me up you strock me wit the water of the osecarriage repeated the other you ave assault the dignity of my country i didnt know who you were i was helping to stop that fire when you butted in now are you going to let me out or do you want my people to pull this jail down around your ears at this threat senor alfarez restrained his rage with an obvious effort you will reply to those outrage senor sure ill reply but in the mean time i want to telephone to the american consul look at this the young man held out his shaking swollen wrists upon which the blood was scarcely dry look at it those runts of yours got handcuffs on me and then beat me up im sick sos that boy we need a doctor alfarez shook his head you resis the police even in your country one mus not do that ave i been there i would keel you both but i am aving a cheel at the moment from those stream of col water will you take me to a telephone it is not permit will you notify mr weeks receiving no reply to this request kirk broke out well then what are you going to do let us stay here all night wat is your bizness i havent any you don work on the canal no im a tourist my father is a big railroad man in the states im telling you this so youll know how to act were do you leeve wat otel ive been stopping with mr weeks senor alfarezs attitude became somewhat less overbearing in due time he will be notify of your outrage to my person he announced the fellow who had left the room a moment before now reappeared carrying a bucket of water and some towels with which he directed allan to remove the blood from his face and hands when it came kirks turn however he objected i think ill wait until weeks sees me he said but alfarez retorted sharply it is not permit and seeing that resistance would be useless kirk acquiesced as gracefully as he could remarking as he did so youll have hard work washing off this and this he indicated the traces of the handcuffs and the gash in his scalp the commandant turned to his men and addressed them at some length calling them to task as allan later informed his companion for using their clubs in a manner to mark their prisoners so conspicuously then he followed them into the corridor closing the grating behind him the hours passed and daylight came with no word from the american consul by this time the two prisoners were really in need of medical attention their contusions pained them severely kirk felt as if one or more of his ribs were broken and his suffering combined with hunger prevented sleep he became feverish and fretful but his demands for communication with the outside world were calmly ignored although he felt certain that his wishes were fully understood when the morning had passed without his being arraigned for a hearing he grew alarmed evidently he had been flung into confinement and forgotten eventually kirk and allan were given food but still no one came to their relief apparently no message had been delivered this treatment was so atrocious so at variance with anthonys ideas of his own importance that he felt he must be suffering from nightmare how dared they treat an american so no matter what the charge why didnt they try him or give him a hearing these insolent overbearing panamaniacs had no regard for law or humanity and this was no longer a question of petty injustice it was a grave infraction of civilized equity but the afternoon wore on without an encouraging sign till kirk began to think that weeks had refused to intercede for him and intended to leave him to the mercies of his enemies with difficulty he managed to convey to a guard his desire to notify some of the other americans in the city but as usual no heed was paid to his request it was considerably after dark when a visitor was at last admitted he proved to be the english consul whom anthony had never met what are you doing here the newcomer inquired then when the facts had been laid before him he exclaimed why i heard that a jamaican negro had been arrested but i heard nothing about mistreatment of a white man doesnt anybody know im here im sure no one does those heathens lied to you they never communicated with weeks or anybody theyre afraid this is an old trick of theirs manhandling a prisoner then keeping him hidden until he recovers if he doesnt recover they get out of it on some excuse or other as best they can why they killed a white sailor not long ago just plain clubbed him to death without excuse then asserted that he resisted arrest they did the same to one of our negroes he died in the jail before i got wind of it and when i started an investigation they showed his signed statement declaring that he had not been abused at all and had been given the kindest treatment the matter isnt settled yet its infamous why i had hard work to get in at all just now but ill have allan here out in two hours or ill know the reason england protects her subjects mr anthony and these people know it if they dont come to time ill have a gunboat in the harbor in twentyfour hours color doesnt amount to a damn with us sir its the flag i guess uncle sam is strong enough to command respect said anthony well i know the circumstances now and ill go straight to weeks he can arrange your release without trouble if you were an englishman id have you out in no time and youd collect handsome damages too this boy will true to the consuls prediction a little later the jamaican was led out of the cell and from the fact that he was not brought back kirk judged that the british intervention had been effectual but it was not until the next morning the second of his imprisonment that the cell door opened once more this time to admit the portly figure of john weeks and the spruce person of senor ramon alfarez whats all this trouble about inquired the former in none too amiable a tone kirk told his story as briefly and convincingly as he could but when he had finished the consul shook his head i dont see what i can do for you he said according to your own declaration you resisted a police officer youll have to take your medicine alfarez nodded agreement quite right said he he did terrible avoc with my men tree of which is now on the ospital but why dont they try me or let me get bail i want to get out youll be tried as soon as they get around to it look here kirk showed the marks his assailants had left upon him will you stand for that ive been here two nights now without medical attention how about that alfarez the commandant shrugged his shoulders if he require a doctor one shall be secure but he is not severely injure i ave explain the frightful indignity to the honor of my person yes as for me pooh it is forget he waved his hand gracefully and smiled sweetly upon his fat visitor it does not exist but the brave soldiers of mine ah senor wick they lofe me they cannot forget the honor of el comandante so when the prisoner is decide to insurrect who can say those gallant soldier don be too strong who can blame for making roffouse i guess you aint hurt much said weeks eying his countryman coldly you didnt get any more than was coming to you i wont stand for this cried the prisoner hotly the english consul got that nigger boy out and i want you to do the same for me you dont understand ive got business interests in this country and i cant dash about creating international issues every time an american gets locked up for disorderly conduct how long do you think id last with these people if i did that are you really afraid to do anything kirk inquired slowly or is it because of our row oh theres nothing personal about it i cant afford personal feelings in my position really i dont see where youre so much abused you assaulted a government officer and resisted arrest if you got hurt its your own fault of course ill see that you have a fair trial the commandant spoke up with ingratiating politeness the prisoner say he is reech mans son now of course it is too bad he is injure wit the clob of the policeman but those officer is ver polite senor and if he is explain biffore weeks snorted indignantly he gave you that fairy tale eh he said his name was anthony and his father was a railroad president didnt he well he imposed on me too but his name is locke and as near as i can learn he practically stowed away on the santa cruz ahh the officers eyes widened as he turned them upon his prisoner he is then a wat you call tramp all i know is he stuck me for a lot of bills ill have to see that he gets fair treatment i suppose because hes an american but that ends my duty is this the best youll do for me kirk inquired as weeks made ready to go yes will you tell some of the men at the wayfarers that im here oh that wont do any good youre in for it locke so dont holler ill be on hand at your hearing will you cable my father at twentyfive cents a word hardly the speaker mopped his face exclaiming theres no use of talking ive got to get out in the air its too hot in here for me then he waddled out ahead of senor alfarez who slammed the door behind him as he followed to escort his caller to the street but a halfhour later the commandant returned to the cell and this time he brought with him a number of his little policemen each armed with a club feeling some menace in their coming kirk who had seated himself dejectedly arose to ask whats coming off alfarez merely issued some directions in spanish and chain handcuffs were once more snapped upon the prisoners wrists so youre going to hold my trial eh cried kirk but the other snarled senor locke you ave force the water of the osewagon upon my body for making the people laugh bueno now i shall laugh he seated himself then nodded at his men to begin ix spanish law mrs cortlandt answered her telephone for the second time repeating with some impatience tell the man i cant see him but he refuses to leave says he must see you at once its important came the voice of the clerk oh very well ill come down she hung up the receiver with a snap why dont they send him up queried her husband from the sittingroom its a negro and the clerk says hed rather not allow him upstairs another sick family i suppose theyre beginning to impose on you its usually that way with charities said cortlandt with unfeminine neglect of the chance for petty discussion his wife left the room without replying and descended to the hotel lobby here she was directed toward a very ragged very woebegone young black on the rear porch who at sight of her began to fumble his hat and run his words together so excitedly that she was forced to calm him now now i cant understand a word who are you hallan mistress you say some one is ill oh yes he is very hill hindeed mistress hall covered with blood and his poor ands hall cut who and his ead oh lard his ead is cut too and he suffers a fever who is it mr hauntony anthony mrs cortlandt started what has happened quick seeing that at last he had found a friend the jamaican began to sob with relief wailing extravagant praises to god and apparently endeavoring to kiss mrs cortlandts hand whereat she seized him by the shoulders and shook him crying stop that behave yourself and tell me what is the trouble quickly now from the beginning without drying his tears allan launched himself into the full violence of his recital stumbling recklessly over his figures of speech lapsing into idioms that it taxed his hearer to follow had she been less acquainted with the caribbean dialects she would have missed much of the story but as it was she followed him closely urging him on with sharp expressions of amazement and nods of understanding rapidly she gathered the facts of the case while her cheeks whitened and her eyes grew dark with indignation the sight renewed allans emotion his voice broke his black hands shook he began to sob once more and great tears stole down his ebony cheeks but he managed to answer her terse shocked questions with some degree of intelligence calling upon his vivid imagination for such details as his memory had lost i wait an wait for him to hemerge but he does not come perhaps they ave killed the poor mon once more how did you get here with my feet mistress sometimes rode i on the train but the train people are very common they haddressed me rudely and threw me by the wayside couldnt you telephone i do not hunderstand ow why didnt he notify me at once if i had only known those eartless spiggoties would not hallow it oh you will hassist the poor mon say it praise be to god he is bleeding in the prison yes yes certainly allan reached clumsily this time to kiss the hem of her skirt but she stepped aside quickly fumbling meanwhile in her purse for a banknote while he exclaimed god bless you good mistress he told me to find you and present his recital here take this money and go back to colon by the first train we may need you now go ill be there ahead of you she picked up her white skirts and ran up the hotel stairs as if pursued bursting in upon her husband so impetuously that he rose in surprise inquiring what is it young anthony is in jail in colon she panted hes been locked up for three days and they wont let him out the devil you said hed gone back to new york what is it about i thought he had they arrested him for some silly thing and hes hurt she hurriedly recounted allans story adding in conclusion that black boy came all the way across the isthmus to tell us ill get the american consul by phone but mrs cortlandt interrupted weeks is a fool he wouldnt do anything wait she stepped to the instrument and rang violently give me colonel jolsons office quickly if he is not there find him i dont care where he is find him it is important this is mrs cortlandt speaking what do you mean to do said cortlandt go to colon at once this is young alfarezs doing the whippersnapper you must lay him out for this how dare he better go carefully remember general alfarez is his father i understand but we are bound to come to a breach sooner or later i hardly think so i believe we can bring him around all right anyhow i havent lost hope then as his wife made an impatient gesture well if we precipitate a quarrel now that will end it he paced the room feverishly good heavens edith anthony chose the worst possible time for this escapade i suppose it will mean diplomatic difficulties and all that and once we lose old alfarez we will lose him anyhow snapped the woman ive seen it coming although you could not ill break ramon for this then youll break us cortlandt stared gloomily at his wife who met his gaze squarely do you think anthony is worth it my dear stephen they nearly killed that poor boy and i shant allow it don anibal alfarez is not the only presidential timber in the republic if he breaks with us it will cost him dearly you think he is friendly but i know that deep down in his crafty old heart he despises all us americans and is only waiting a chance to gratify his spleen the moment he dares hell turn against us cortlandts frosty countenance showed signs of unusual agitation as he answered youre mad you threaten to ruin everything you understand perfectly theres no use of my explaining let me call on him this afternoon he will instruct his son no he would procrastinate as usual there would be the customary delays and excuses and meanwhile anthony would be in jail at colon they would have a defence all prepared besides if its to be a fight we must have all the weapons possible and this affair may prove a good one anyhow you mustnt ask a favor of him at this time he must ask not you the telephone rang and the speaker snatched the receiver from its hook hello colonel jolson im very glad i caught you this is mrs cortlandt colonel jolson young ramon alfarez has arrested kirk anthony of whom i spoke to you they have maltreated him as usual and have hidden him for three days yes yes i discovered it quite by accident while mr cortlandt was downtown oh this is serious and im furious that will do no good i have reasons for preferring to handle it myself thank you for the compliment we must go to colon at once and i thought you might give us a special there was a slight pause then good that will do quite as well in fifteen minutes thank you goodbye turning to her husband she explained swiftly the colonels automobile will be waiting at the station in fifteen minutes are you ready i think you are going about this in the wrong way he said coldly when will you learn she checked her crisp words at the flush that leaped to his cheeks i beg your pardon stephen please do as colonel jolson has done and trust me to manage this affair he bowed and left her saying i will have a coach waiting at the door fifteen minutes later a gasoline railroad motorcar with two passengers in addition to its driver and flagman rolled out of the yards at panama city and took the main line running under orders like a special train as it clanked over the switches with everincreasing speed mrs cortlandt leaned forward and spoke to the driver we will have a clear track and you may go as fast as you like the next moment the machine was reeling drunkenly around curves and a fiftymile gale was roaring past senor ramen alfarez was considerably nonplussed when his two distinguished visitors made known the nature of their errand cortlandt did most of the talking his cold hauteur serving a good purpose and contrasting strongly with the suppressed excitement of his wife pardon me there is no necessity for delay he said as the commandant endeavored to formulate an excuse i trust i need not insist upon seeing the prisoner he raised his brows with a stare of inquiry that caused the other to reply hastily of a certainty not senor then take us to him i will spare your lady the painful sight of the prisonhouse the prisoner shall be fetch with all despatch we will see him alone again the commandant hesitated while his bright eyes searched their faces with a sudden uneasy curiosity i am fear soch ting is not permit nonsense exclaimed mrs cortlandt unable longer to restrain herself we know the law quite as well or perhaps better than you senor alfarez if you wish mr cortlandt will get permission from the president you have a telephone oh soch is farthes remove from my thoughts quickly interposed the commandant with his most graceful bow if it is in my power to oblige wat matter the law pouf wat i mean is this our prisoner is not what you call seeck nor is he ver well he is resis the officer by force an he is injure oh but only a leetle it is noting one is truly foolish for resis the policemans yes he shook his dark head sadly i am desolate to ear of soch ting it is so useless to stroggle wit the officer in disbursement of duty but you americans are so brave i am force to admire this prisoner he is soch a strong fellow i think we understand the circumstances instead of ringing for an orderly the commandant excused himself then after a seemingly interminable delay returned with anthony and several policemen at sight of his friends the young man made for them eagerly crying jove im glad you came id about given you up allan only found us today mrs cortlandt replied did he tell the truth have you been abused the young man turned a pair of smouldering eyes upon his enemies he looked ill and haggard although except for the wound half concealed beneath his hair he showed no marks then he held out his hands with a grim smile and the woman uttered a low cry at what she saw they gave me another good beating yesterday he said while you were in jail cortlandt queried incredulously god thats the fellow yonder kirk pointed to alfarez whose smile had disappeared oh the man is mistake the latter hastened to aver he is crazee i gave you a wetting in public and si si that is correc senor cortlan he insolt my person an fight my soldiers he is ver toff person did you know he had been maltreated in prison cortlandt demanded oh senor alfarez raised his hands in horrified disclaimer of the very thought but his victim said quietly hes a liar he ordered it then sat there and enjoyed it the panamanians face was yellow as he managed to enunciate eempossible it is terrible to conceive kirk made a threatening movement in the spaniards direction despite the halfdozen soldiers but edith cortlandt checked him wait please she said then to the commandant this is a serious matter and if what he says is true your government will find itself in trouble but we ave no idea he is frien of yours if he should only spik your osbans name all would be different for my part i can prove he is treat with the ighes courtesy an kindness in my presence every man in the prison will testify to those fac if soch indignity ave be shown there shall be investigations the unhappy officers excitement was increasing and he turned upon his men as if to make good his word when cortlandt interposed why did you keep him locked up so long why didnt you try him ah for that i shall inquire also i shall conduct investigations in that respect as well i am inform owever that the wat you call jodge is seeck well look into that later were here now to arrange for mr anthonys release the alcalde will be please to accommodate at the earlies i myself shall see to it tomorrow there will be no tomorrow about it mrs cortlandt exclaimed positively if you cannot arrange the bail yourself my husband will take up the matter with the zone government and colonel jolson will call upon the president of the republic within an hour he is waiting word from us now senor ramon alfarez became suddenly galvanized he broke into effusive apologies for even so small a delay as had already occurred he had not understood the matter to be so urgent it seemed but the wishes of his distinguished guests were his law and perhaps he might hasten the wheels of progress if he tried while to be sure no power was vested in him and his willing hands were most miserably tied nevertheless he would so far exceed his authority as to promise instant freedom to the prisoner there were of course certain details to be observed the necessity of which filled him with unspeakable regret but if he might be excused he hastened forth to set in motion the proper machinery and while he was absent kirk told his story it left the woman whitelipped and incoherent and roused even the icy cortlandt to genuine wrath of course the latter said alfarez will prove by his men that its all imagination on your part and that your injuries were sustained at the time of your arrest hell assume a righteous indignation and start a spiggoty investigation you see his father is the governor of panama province and one of the strongest men in the republic so ramon will probably make good his position even so you may recover damages i dont want damages kirk replied i want to get that dago out alone some time for heavens sake dont think of it mrs cortlandt exclaimed all the american influence on the isthmus wouldnt help you then fifty men would perjure themselves to convict you and if you succeeded in getting our government to interfere in time ramen has fifty other men who would lie to any extent to injure an american no that method doesnt work here her husband agreed youre lucky to escape so easily he will arrange bail never fear and you will probably not come to trial i doubt if you will ever hear anything more of the matter provided you keep from further trouble hell never forgive you of course but that wont matter to you the first part of mr cortlandts prediction was soon proved true for the sick alcalde recovered sufficiently to appear on the scene within half an hour then after much signing of official documents and certain other formalities kirk anthony walked out of the colon jail in company with his friends allan was waiting at a safe distance from the municipal building and on seeing his late companion at large he broke into the wildest rejoicing he conjured a flow of tears he fondled kirks hand in his own he laughed he sobbed he sang praise be to god he cried loudly free mon you master hauntony glory glory my soul was in ell sar on my knees i himplored that faast wretch to release you his emotion appeared so genuine his service had been so great that the object of his adoration felt himself choke up of all the people kirk had met since leaving home this one had most occasion to blame him yet the boy was in perfect transports of delight at his delivery dont carry on so kirk laughed awkwardly oh boss i feared they would hassassinate you again anthony nodded grimly they did oh oh allan gave himself over to a shrill frenzy and shook his clenched fists at the jail in a splendidly tragic attitude wretches murderers ellcaats shh dont make a scene on the street mrs cortlandt cautioned but the jamaican would not allow the fine effect of his rage to be lost he clashed his white teeth he rolled his eyes fearfully and twisted his black features into the wildest expressions of ferocity crying hallan will best them for that let im tear hout theirearts by his fingers so he made an eloquent gesture blood blood not so loud a little pianissimo on the blood smiled kirk hallan would die and kill himself for you the excited negro ran on in an excess of loyalty master hauntony fought those wretches for i i shall fight them for he when he had finally been prevailed upon to exchange his martial threats for a fresh paean of rejoicing he fell in behind declaring firmly that he intended to follow his newfound hero wherever he might go though the course laid were straight for those infernal regions that played so large a part in his fancy in the midst of kirks expressions of gratitude for the timely intercession of cortlandt and his wife the former surprised him by saying in a genuinely hearty tone my wife has told me all about you anthony and i want you to come over to panama as my guest until you hear from your father when kirk informed him of the cablegram that had cast him adrift in panama leading indirectly to his entanglement with the dignity of ramon alfarez and the spanish law cortlandt replied reassuringly oh well your father doesnt understand the facts in the case thats all you sit down like a sensible person and write him fully it will be a great pleasure for us to have you at the tivoli in the mean time seeing a warm second to this invitation in mrs cortlandts eyes kirk accepted gracefully explaining you know this is the first time i was ever up against hard luck and i dont know just how to act weve missed the fourthirtyfive so we will have to return the way we came said cortlandt id like to stop at gatun on a business matter of some importance and if you dont mind a halfhours delay well do so kirk expressed entire acquiescence in any plans that suited the convenience of his rescuers and the three pursued their way to the station but here an unexpected embarrassment arose as they made ready to board colonel jolsons motorcar they were annoyed to find that allan insisted on going too he insisted moreover in such extravagant fashion that mrs cortlandt at last was moved to say for heavens sake let the poor thing come along and thereafter the jamaican boy sat on the step of the machine his hat in hand his eyes rolled worshipfully upon the person of his hero his shining face ever ready to break into a grin at a glance from kirk once more the little automobile took on the dignity of a regular train and sped out of the network of tracks behind colon as it gained speed mrs cortlandt to divert her guests mind from his recent ordeal began to explain the points of interest as they passed she showed him the old french workings where a nations hopes lay buried the mechanical ruins that had cost a kings ransom the mount hope cemetery whither daily trains had borne the sacrifice before science had robbed the fever of its terrors she told him also something of the railroads history how it had been built to bridge the gap in the route to the golden west the manifold difficulties overcome in its construction and the stupendous profits it had made having the blood of a railroadbuilder in his veins anthony could not but feel the interest of all this though it failed to take his attention wholly from the wonders of the landscape that slipped by on either side it was his first glimpse of tropic vegetation and he used his eyes to good advantage while he listened politely to his informant the matted thickets interlaced with vine and creeper were all ablaze with blossoms for this was the wet season in which nature runs riot great trees of strange character rose out of the tangle their branches looped with giant cables and burdened with flowering orchids or half hidden beneath other parasites on every hand a vegetable warfare was in progress a struggle for existence in which the strong overbore the weak and every trunk was distorted by the scars of the battle birds of bright plumage flashed in the glades giant fivefoot lizards scuttled away into the marshes or stared down from the overhanging branches a vivid odor of growing blooming herbage reached the nostrils just as kirk had made up his mind that he could sit and watch this brilliant panorama forever the jungle suddenly fell away and the car sped up through low grassclad hills into a scattered city flung against the side of a wide valley there was no sign here of latin america this was yankeeland through and through the houses hundreds upon hundreds of them were of the typical canal zone architecture doublegalleried and screened from foundation to eaves and they rambled over the undulating pasture land in a magnificent disregard of distance smooth macadam roads wound back and forth over which government wagons rolled drawn by sleek army mules flower gardens blazed forth in gorgeous colors women and children all clean and white and american were sitting upon the porches or playing in the yards everywhere was a military neatness the town was like the officers quarters of a fort the whole place spick and span and neatly groomed colon had been surprisingly clean but it was an unnatural cleanliness as if the municipality had been scrubbed against its will gatun was to the manner born yonder are the locks cortlandt pointed to the west and kirk saw below him an impressive array of pyramidal steel towers from the pinnacles of which stretched a spiders web of cables beneath this he had a glimpse of some great activity but his view was quickly cut off as the motorcar rumbled into a modem railway station id like to have a look at whats going on over yonder he said you will have time cortlandt answered edith will show you about while i run in on colonel bland out through the stationshed kirks hostess led him then across a level sward pausing at length upon the brink of a mighty chasm it took him a moment to grasp the sheer magnitude of the thing then he broke into his first real expression of wonder why i had no idea really this is tremendous at his feet the earth opened in a giant manmade canon running from the valley above through the low ridge and out below within it an army was at work along the margins of the excavation ran steel tracks upon which were mounted the movable towers he had seen from a distance these tapering structures bore aloft long tautly drawn wire cables spanning the gorge and supporting great buckets which soared at regular intervals back and forth bearing concrete for the work below up and out of the depths tremendous walls were growing like the massive ramparts of a mediaeval city tremendous steel forms braced and trussed and reinforced to withstand the weight of the countless tons stood in regular patterns in the floor of the chasm were mysterious pits black tunnel mouths in and out of which men crept like ants far across on the opposite lip of the hill little electric trains sped to and fro apparently without the aid of human hands everywhere was a steady feverish activity from the commanding eminence where the sightseers stood the spectacle was aweinspiring for though the whole vast work lay spread out beneath them in what looked like a hopeless confusion yet as their eyes followed it a great and magic system became manifest the whole organism seemed animate with some slow intricate intelligence the metal skips careening across those dizzy heights regulated their courses to a handsbreadth deposited their burdens carefully then hurried back for more the shuttle trains that dodged about so feverishly untended and unguided performed each some vital function the great conglomerate body was dead yet it pulsated with a life of its own its effect of being governed by a single indwelling mind of superhuman capacity was overpowering kirk heard mrs cortlandt explaining the ships will steam up from the sea through the dredged channel you see over yonder then they will be raised to the level of the lake what lake that valley she indicated the tropical plain between the hills wherein floating dredges were at work will be an inland sea those forests will be under water where is the gatun dam ive heard so much about she pointed out a low broad ridge or hogback linking the hills together that is it it doesnt look much like a dam does it but it is all handmade those are rock trains out there from culebra oh now i understand gee whiz but this job is a whopper say this is great mrs cortlandt smiled it does wake up your patriotism doesnt it im glad to have a hand in building it are you helping to dig this canal anthony regarded the woman curiously she seemed very cool and welldressed and independent for one engaged in actual work of course even though i dont happen to run a steamshovel will they really finish it wont something happen it is already dug the rest is merely a matter of excavation and concrete the engineering difficulties have all been solved and the big human machine has been built up what is more important the country is livable at last over at ancon hospital there is a quiet hardworking medical man who has made this thing possible when the two oceans are joined together and the job is finished his will be the name most highly honored it must be nice to do something worth while anthony mused vaguely to do anything his companion observed with a shade of meaning then it is amusing to look back on the old spanish statement that it would be impious to unite two oceans which the creator of the world had separated noting that the sun was setting beyond the distant jungles and the canon at his feet was filling with shadows kirk remarked it must be nearly time they quit work this work doesnt stop when it grows dark the whole place is lit by electricity and the concrete continues to pour in just the same it is wonderful then like the mouth of a volcano batteries of searchlights play upon the men the whole sky is like a furnace you can see it for miles now i think we had better go back to the car in spite of his bodily misery that night ride impressed itself strongly upon anthonys mind the black mystery of the jungles the halfsuggested glimpses of river and hill the towns that flashed past in an incandescent blaze and were buried again in the velvet blackness the strange odors of a new land riotous in its time of growth all combined to excite his curiosity and desire for closer knowledge and then the crowning luxury of a bath clean clothes and a good meal on white linen and china as he dropped asleep that night he reflected contentedly that after all things have a way of coming right in this world for those who accept them cheerfully as they come x a change of plan on the following morning kirk despatched a long letter to his father explaining as well as he could how he came to be in panama and giving a detailed account of the events that had befallen him since his arrival he would have preferred to cable this message collect but mrs cortlandt convinced him that he owed a fuller explanation than could well be sent over the wires although he took this means of relieving his fathers anxiety he was far from resigning himself to a further delay of his return on the contrary he at once began an inquiry as to sailing dates discovering to his intense disgust that no ship was scheduled to leave for new york within several days he planned to borrow the passage money from his friends when the time came and accompany his letter northward meanwhile he devoted his time to sightseeing with his hostess the city was old there were many places of historic interest and although kirk cared little for such things he found it easy to assume the virtue he did not possess moreover there was something contagious in his companions enthusiasm almost against his will he felt his appreciation growing as he listened to her casual comments on the scenes they visited her husband who seemed busily engaged in work that barely allowed him time for his meals seldom accompanied them on their excursions and the two were thrown much into each others society edith cortlandt was a woman very sure of herself in most things a situation that might have proved embarrassing to one less tactful she accepted quite as a matter of course rather enjoying the exercise of her influence and never doubting her power to keep the friendship on any footing she chose kirks frank boyish gratitude for the favors he had received made it easy for her to encourage the growth of an intimacy that she acknowledged charming while she sincerely believed that he would be helped by it finding him responsive she deliberately set herself to please him she studied him covertly and set her moods to match his not a difficult task since he was merely a normal healthy young man always faultless in her attire she took even more than ordinary pains with her appearance and it was not long before kirk was naively surprised to find that she no longer seemed older than he that she was in fact an exceedingly handsome woman this gradual metamorphosis depended more than anything else perhaps upon the girlish humor that now possessed her she was no longer brilliant and chilly but gay smiling and unaffected daytimes they rambled about the crooked streets bargainhunting in the chinese shops or drove beneath the stately royal palms of ancon evenings they loitered about the cool verandas of the tivoli or strolled down into the town to watch the crowds in the plazas once in a while cortlandt went with them but he was usually uncommunicative and they scarcely felt his presence on the few occasions when he gave himself rein kirk was compelled to feel for him a surprised and halfgrudging respect unlike most silent men when he did talk he talked easily and well several days passed thus during which anthony fully recovered from his experience at colon then a ship arrived from new york but before he had summoned courage to ask his friends for a loan he received a letter forwarded from colon by the american consul a perusal of which not only dumfounded him but entirely altered his plans it was typewritten on plain stationery there was neither heading nor signature yet he knew quite well from whom it came it read as follows dont cable again or the stupidity of the police may fail to protect you the others got away safely and you would be mad to return alone i cant and wont help you now this time you went too far you have made your bed now lie in it i dont believe in miracles but if you can straighten up and make a man of yourself ill help you face this trouble otherwise dont call on me for anything im through kirk reread this amazing epistle several times before its full significance struck him then when he realized what it meant he felt himself break into a sweat of apprehension that plainclothes man had died the police were looking for him there could be no other explanation else why had higgins and the rest fled the country why had his father been so cautious in communicating with him if it came to a trial undoubtedly a jury would find him equally guilty with higgins for he had held the poor fellows hands it was he who had engineered the whole episode perhaps he was already indicted kirk saw himself accused of manslaughter arrested and tried what could he do if his father refused to help with money almost anything could be achieved without it and particularly without his fathers influence what would happen evidently the governor believed him guilty in that case the young man knew that explanations would be futile even the letter he had sent would do no good when darwin k anthony said he was through he was through finding a secluded corner of the veranda he sat down to think this matter out but the more he reflected on it the more serious it appeared of one thing he became quickly convinced new york at present was no place for him a moment ago it seemed far away and extremely desirable now it was altogether too close at hand and most undesirable his fathers reference to the stupidity of the police persuaded him finally that his whereabouts were unknown but how long they would remain so was of course a question it was useless to attempt further concealment in the first place he lacked means of moving nor could he conceal his identity under an assumed name while he remained in panama for he had already advertised himself too well for that besides the idea of hiding did not appeal to him he decided to face it out therefore hoping sometime to get to the bottom of the affair if he were arrested meanwhile he would have to locate ringold or higgins or some of the others and prove that he had not run away from punishment it would be difficult to verify the extravagant story of his kidnapping of course but there was nothing else to do he rose quickly and entered the hotel where he bought all the latest new york papers it was not long before he found the thing he was seeking there it was a story headed saloonkeeper to lose license owner of notorious austrian village in trouble there followed an account of mr paddens efforts to disprove his connection with an assault upon the person of a detective named williams who had come from st louis but nowhere was there a word about the present condition of the plainclothes man nor the slightest hint toward explaining the conduct of the mysterious jefferson locke for whom he had been searching who the devil was locke anyhow the article did not even state the charge upon which he was to be arrested in another paper kirk found something that relieved his mind a bit evidently williams had not died prior to the time of going to press although he was reported in a critical condition kirk was interested to read that the police had a clew to the identity of the criminals and were confident of soon rounding them up what mystified him most was the lack of detail evidently much had been printed previously but he had no means of ascertaining what it was he spent an hour in serious thought perhaps the first full hour he had ever passed so profitably at the end of that time he had arrived at little save a vague feeling of offence toward the father who had been so ready to condemn him in one way he did not blame the old gentleman for refusing aid this episode was the culmination of a long series of reckless exploits mr anthony had argued threatened even implored with tears in his eyes all to no purpose just the same it hurt to have ones father so willing to believe the worst the two had never understood each other they did not understand each other now and they might have been such good pals darwin k did not believe in miracles well perhaps kirk was hopelessly bad the young man did not care much one way or the other but he shut his teeth grimly and wagered he could make good if he really chose to try he half decided to make the experiment just to show what he could do but he was at a loss where to begin anybody could be successful who really wanted to every book said that the hard part was to get started one thing was clear at least he could stay here no longer as the cortlandts guest he had already incurred an obligation which he would have difficulty in discharging yet how could he explain his change of front mrs cortlandt he felt sure would understand and come to his assistance with good advice but he shrank instinctively from laying the facts before her husband it was a deuced unpleasant necessity and he detested unpleasant necessities necessities of any sort in fact still there was nothing else for it so conquering his sense of humiliation as best he could he called up the cortlandts suite edith answered saying that her husband was out then in response to his request she came down herself what has gone wrong why this face of tragedy she inquired as she seated herself beside him ive received my declaration of independence ive heard from my dad a look of quick understanding drove away the smile she had brought him and her manner was one of grave sympathy as she took the letter he handed her she was clad in a crisp morning gown he had never seen and he thought it became her extremely well she looked very cool very fresh very much the fine lady all in all she seemed a person whose friendly interest might compensate for many woes well she remarked you do seem to be in trouble what does it mean kirk told her everything without reserve then showed her the newspapers in his hand she scrutinized them with a quiet seriousness that seemed to make his trouble her own after all she said at last if worse comes to worst you can prove your innocence im not so sure nonsense those boys can be found what puzzles me is that locke person who is he why was he followed what has become of him i wish i knew i can have inquiries made but it will take time meanwhile it seems you are safe so the one important fact for the moment is that you are cast off turning her bright eyes upon him she inquired how does it feel to be disinherited blamed uncomfortable i must tell mr cortlandt at once let me she offered quickly i would not show any one that letter if i were you nor advertise the fact that you are in danger of arrest it will be quite enough if i tell him that you have quarrelled with your father he is a peculiar man kirk signified his agreement now what do you intend doing she asked him im going to work good good she clapped her hands gleefully oh i dont want to he protested but the old gentleman thinks im no good and id like to show him hes wrong after ive done that i intend to loaf again yes and ill know how to loaf by that time of course ill have to pay my debts too poor mr weeks why poor he is terribly agitated to learn that we came to your rescue he knows now that he really entertained an angel unaware and his grief of soul is comical weeks isnt such a bad sort but her eyes showed a sudden flash of anger as she returned he deserves to be forced out of the service that wouldnt do any good his successor might be worse havent you any resentment i dislike placid people plenty if i get a crack at alfarez now dont allow your mind to dwell on that she cautioned i think he is riding to a fall as it is what do you want to do anything im going to hunt a job this afternoon what sort something with big pay and no responsibility those positions are taken by the army she laughed what can you do i can take an automobile apart and put it together again oh no i can sail a boat i shoot pretty well i waltz nicely i row swim and box indifferently and i play an atrocious hand at poker mrs cortlandt nodded gravely you are also good company you dress well and you are an ornament to any hotel porch naturally i refrained from mentioning those things but in addition i smoke drink and swear i am unsteady in my habits and require a great deal of sleep i think that completes the inventory of course you will live beyond your salary undoubtedly seriously now dont you really go ahead say it dont i know anything no i am too highly educated you see i took the full college course she drew her sharply pencilled brows together and pursed her lips in meditation regarding him meanwhile with a look that was not all disapproval am i hopeless he inquired at length dear no experience is a good thing of course and ability is even better but neither is absolutely necessary in government work oh provided what you have influence i was merely trying to think of the niche into which you would best fit when a fellow hasnt any of those qualifications then what take me for instance you have at least one which one influence he shook his head my father wouldnt help well have no difficulty in finding you a position jove thats good news he beamed at her with gratified surprise i had an idea id be going from door to door how ridiculous this is a government job therefore it is saturated with politics there are a great many good men on it but there are also a large number of somebodys relatives do you understand anything is possible here for a man with influence if he has ability with it he can go to the top if he lacks ability well even then he can go to the top it depends entirely upon the influence but i havent any kirk began then catching her look he exclaimed oh say will you help me really thats too good to be true he shook her hand warmly that being the natural outlet for his gratitude and she smiled at him i wonder where id better start in he said theres not the slightest choice all paths lead up the mountain and if you go far enough you will reach the top it would be quite easy if you knew something about the railroad business for instance oh i do ive had that drilled into me ever since i was a child i grew up with it was soaked in it my father made me learn telegraphy before he gave me a motorboat why in the world didnt you say so well i have forgotten most of it he confessed i had a railroad of my own too when i was twelve years old i was president indeed i suppose it was in my blood we kids stole the lumber for a track and i got a handcar from dad we formed a close corporation and when another boy wanted to join we made him go forth and steal enough boards to extend the line we finally had nearly two miles altogether with switches sidings yards and everything then the fences in that neighborhood gave out it was a gravity road yes there was extreme gravity in every department wed push the car up and ride down we had a telephone system and semaphores and ran on orders just like a real train grown people heard about it and paid us five cents a ride so we began to declare dividends every saturday oh it was a great success we had a complete organization too president directors conductors sectionhands the sectionhands did all the work and rode between times what happened to it one day we ran into a cow and broke the vicepresidents leg the board of directors also had his ear cut and the indignant neighbors began to reclaim their fences we lost a mile of track in one afternoon and father decided it would be better for me to go to boardingschool it was safer ill warrant you learned the rudiments of railroading just the same i learned everything kirk announced decisively unfortunately the prr has a president so we cant start you in where you left off he might need an assistant mrs cortlandt laughed lightly while we are finding that out she said i think you had better go over the line in daylight and really see what this work is like that glimpse you had at gatun is only a small part now will you trust me to manage this for you mr anthony i should say i would and i cant begin to tell you oh its nothing she rose to put her plans promptly into operation this time extending her hands with the words let me congratulate you i really believe you are waking up and without the womans aid but the woman is aiding me he replied warmly shes doing it all you have started me moving and ill never be able to thank you then as her eyes flashed to his with a look he had never seen before he added understand though i am going to work only because i must i detest it xi the truth about mrs cortlandt edith cortlandt was not the sort to permit delay at lunch she introduced kirk to the master of transportation of the panama railroad saying mr runnels has offered to take you out through the cut this afternoon and explain the work to you runnels a straight wellsetup serious young man bent a searching look upon kirk as he said mrs cortlandt tells me youre going to be one of us yes the master of transportation took in the applicant fully then nodded his head as if pleased with his inspection thats good anthony was drawn to the speaker instantly for there was no affectation about him he was straightforward and open little given to the kind of small talk that serves in so many cases to conceal character he produced the effect of a busy and forceful man one could feel energy radiating from him and his voice had a ring of authority like every one down here who was doing something he talked of little besides the big job even when mr cortlandt joined the trio as the two younger men rose to leave edith playfully admonished him to teach his protege the entire detail of the railroad business and have him back in time for dinner to which he agreed shes wonderful he remarked a moment later as he and kirk descended the hotel steps together she told colonel jolson hed just have to find you a position and i have been delegated to show you about you dont say i supposed there were plenty of openings not good ones however she usually gets what she wants if im not a good guide you must put it down to inexperience the cortlandts seem to have considerable influence for outsiders i thought id have to begin at the bottom runnels glanced at his companion quickly outsiders you dont call them outsiders i never quite figured out who they are funny bytheway how everybody says they in referring to them oh shes the whole team cortlandts a nice fellow but did you really think that shed let you start at the bottom why yes i guess you dont know her youre right i do not well she knows everybody and everything in this country shes the whole diplomatic service take the colombian trouble for instance what trouble when panama seceded she manipulated that or at least steve cortlandt did under her direction she was the brains of the whole affair however and those new york lawyers merely did what she told them it was one of the cleverest exploits on record colombia wouldnt let us build the canal so panama seceded war was declared but the united states interfered in time to prevent bloodshed one chinaman was killed i believe by dropping a flatiron on his toe or something and by the time the excitement had died out we had begun digging she knows central america like the palm of her hand when she says kirk anthony wants a position we hirelings jump about and see that he gets it oh youll have any job you want well the recipient of this good news congratulated himself silently i wish youd tell me something more about her there isnt time just now our motor is waiting but we have the whole afternoon ahead of us the two passed through the railroad gates and took their places in the little car when they were under way runnels went on im supposed to show you this end of the work and tell you what it all means then please start at the beginning you see i probably know less about it than anybody living of course you know the general layout i tell you i dont know a thing theres no use fourflushing runnels smiled at this candor well the ditch will be about fifty miles long and roughly speaking the work is in three parts the dredging and harborbuilding at sealevel on each end of the canal the lockwork and the excavations on the upper levels that dam you saw building at gatun will form a lake about thirty miles long quite a fishpond eh when a westbound ship arrives for instance it will be raised through the gatun locks three of them and then sail along eightyfive feet above the ocean across the lake and into a channel dug right through the hills until it reaches the locks at pedro miguel then it will be lowered to a smaller lake five miles long then down again to the level of the pacific an eastbound ship will reverse the process get the idea sure it sounds easy oh its simple enough thats what makes it so big weve been working at it five years and it will take five years more to complete it before we began the french had spent about twenty years on the job now a word so you will have the general scheme of operation in your head the whole thing is run by the isthmian canal commission six men most of whom are at war with one another there are really two railroad systems the i c c built to haul dirt and rock and to handle materials in and out of the workings and the panama railroad which was built years ago during the california gold rush and bought by our government at the time of that terrible revolution i told you about the latter is a regular system hauls passengers and freight but the two work together you will start in with the p r r mr anthony under my despotic sway i know a little about railroading so much the better theres a big railroad man by your name in the states are you related i believe so kirk answered quietly go ahead with the lesson the canal zone is a strip of land ten miles wide running across the isthmus really an american colony you know for we govern it police it and all that as for the work itself well the fellows at the two ends of the canal are dredging night and day to complete their part the lockbuilders are laying concrete like mad to get their share done first the chaps in the big cut are boring through the hills like moles and breaking steamshovel records every week while we railroad men take care of the whole shootingmatch of course there are other departments sanitary engineering commissary and so forth all doing their share but that is the general scheme everybody is trying to break records we dont think of anything except our own business each fellow believes the fate of the canal depends upon him weve lost interest in everything except this ditch and while we realize that there is such a place as home it has become merely a spot where we spend our vacations they have wars and politics and theatres and divorces out there somewhere but we dont care weve lost step with the world weve dropped out when the newspapers come the first thing we look for is the panama news were obsessed by this job even the women and the children feel it youll feel it as soon as you become a cog in the machine polite conversation at dinner is limited to tons of rock and yards of concrete oh but im tired of this concrete talk try the abstract for a change its interesting at first then it gets tiresome lord its fierce the work too everything every day you do the same thing every day you see the same faces hear the same talk even the breeze blows from the same direction all the time and the temperature stays at the same mark winter and summer every time you go out you see the same coachdrivers the same spiggoty policemen leaning against the same things every time you come in you eat the same food drink the same liquor sit in the same chair and talk about the same topics everything runs too smoothly the weather is too damned nice the thermometer lacks originality were too comfortable climate like that gets on a white mans nerves he needs physical discomfort to make him contented id give a fortydollar dog to be good and cold and freeze my nose why doctor gorgas has made us so sanitary that we cant even get sick id hail an epidemic as a friend its even harder on the women folks for they cant find anything to kick about so they fuss with one another and with us they have clubs you know to improve things but theres nothing to improve we had a social war recently over a button one clique wanted a club emblem that would cost a dollar and a half while the other faction were in favor of a dollar button i tell you it was serious then too were all tagged and labelled like cans of salmon with the pricemark on we cant fourflush you can tell a mans salary by the number of rockingchairs in his house and the wife of a fellow who draws eighteen hundred a year cant associate with a woman whose husband makes twentyfive hundred they are very careful about such things we go to the same dances on the same dates we dance with the same people to the same tunes by the same band and when we get off in some corner of the same veranda in search of the same old breeze which we know is blowing at precisely the same velocity from the usual quarter our partners tell us that colonel soandso laid four hundred twentyseven more cubic yards of concrete this week than last or that steam shovel number twentythree broke the record again by eighty yards its hell he stopped breathless why dont you quit suggested anthony quit what for good lord we like it here we are at pedro miguel bytheway well be into the cut shortly to his left anthony beheld another scene somewhat similar to the one at gatun other movable steel cranes with huge wideflung arms rose out of another chasm in which were extensive concrete workings from a distance the towers resembled parts of a halfconstructed cantilever bridge of tremendous height another army was toiling at the bottom of the pit more cars shunted back and forth more rockcrushers rumbled but before kirks eye had photographed more than a small part the motorcar had sped past and was rolling out upon a bridge spanning the canal itself to the northward appeared an opening cut through the hills and runnels said simply culebra a moment later he announced we leave the p r r tracks here and switch in on the i c c now youll begin to see something down into the cut the little car went and at last anthony saw the active pulsating heart of this stupendous undertaking the low range was severed by a gorge blasted out by human hands it was a mountain valley in the making high up on its sides were dirt and rock trains dozens of compressedair drills their spars resembling the masts of a fleet of catboats at anchor behind these grimy powerful steam shovels which rooted and grunted quite like iron hogs along the tracks at various levels flowed a constant current of traffic long lines of empty cars crept past the shovels then filled to overflowing sped away northward up the valley to return again and again nowhere was there any idleness nowhere a cold machine or a man at rest on every hand was smoke and steam and sweat the drills chugged steadily the hungry iron hogs gouged out the trails the drills had loosened the trains rolled past at intervals of a moment or so lines of electric wire carried upon low wooden shears paralleled the tracks bearing the whitehot sparks that rent the mountain at every switch a negro flagman crouched beneath a slanting sheet of corrugated iron seeking shelter alike from flying fragments and the blazing sun from beneath the drills came occasional subterranean explosions then geysers of muddy water rose in the air under the snouts of the steam shovels dobe shots went off as bowlders were riven into smaller fragments now and then an excited tooting of whistles gave warning of a bigger blast as the flagmen checked the flow of traffic indicating with arms upraised that the ground was coming up thereupon a brief lull occurred men hid themselves the work held its breath as it were but while the detonations still echoed and before the flying missiles had ceased to shower the human ants were moiling at their hills once more the wheels were turning again the jaws of the iron hogs were clanking through this upheaval the motorcar penetrated dodging trains of flats which moved sluggishly to afford them passage up and down over the volcanic furrows at the bottom of the gorge or along some shelf beneath which the foundations were being dug at times a shovel reached out its fiveyard steel jaw and gently cleared the rails of debris or boosted some bowlder from the path with all the skill of a giant hand and fingers up and down the canon rolled spasmodic rumblings like broadsides from a fleet of battleships somebody with a head for figures has estimated what it costs the government to send a motorcar like this through the cut in working hours runnels said i dont remember the exact amount but it was some thousands of dollars delays to trains i suppose yes a minute here thirty seconds there every second means a certain number of cubic yards unremoved and holds back the opening of the canal just so much you have postponed a great event several minutes mr anthony its the first important thing i ever did our little ninemile trip will cost uncle sam more than a brace of tickets from new york to frisco and back again including pullmans and travelling expenses mile after mile the sightseers rolled on past scenes of nevervarying activity past more shovels more groups of drills more dirt trains more regiments of men runnels explaining kirk marvelling until he was forced to exclaim i had no idea it was so big it doesnt seem as if theyd ever finish it oh well finish it if were let alone every year you know we receive a batch of senators and congressmen who come down to inspect and report sometimes they spend as much as a week on the job and frequently learn to distinguish which is the gatun dam and which the culebra cut but not always some of them dont know yet nevertheless they return to washington and tell us how to proceed having discovered that the panama climate is good and the wages high they send down all their relatives its too bad colonel gorgas did away with the yellow fever you see there is too much politics in it we never know how long our jobs will last if some senator whose vote is needed on an administration matter wanted my position for his wifes brother he could get it suppose the president of the clockwinders union wanted to place his halfsisters husband with the p r r hed call at the white house and make his request if he were refused hed threaten to call a strike of his union and stop every clock on the isthmus hed get the job all right of course that is an exaggeration not at all it has been done is being done right along the halfsisters husband comes down here and takes a job away from some fellow who may be entitled to promotion i suppose im an example runnels looked at him squarely before answering you are said he although i wasnt thinking of you when i spoke its something we all feel however anthony flushed as he answered i dont remember ever taking anything i wasnt entitled to and i didnt think when i was shoved in here that id shove some other fellow out thats about what will happen the good positions are filled by good men for the most part but mrs cortlandt has asked it and youre elected you dont mind my frankness i hope certainly not i just didnt happen to look at it in this light kirk felt a vivid sense of discomfort as the keen eyes of his companion dwelt upon him as a matter of fact i dare say i dont need a good job half as badly as some of these married fellows i suppose there is room at the bottom and a fellow can work up if he has it in him i think ill start there oh come now laughed the master of transportation that sort of thing isnt done you have the chance and youd be foolish to let it slip i dont blame you id do the same under the circumstances its merely a condition weve all got to face just the same i dont like the idea id feel uncomfortable if i met some capable fellow whom id robbed of his chance its hard work to be uncomfortable and i dont like hard work you know runnels shook his head doubtfully as if questioning the genuineness of this attitude im afraid youre a poor business man he said rotten kirk admitted but ive an idea i can make good if i try if you feel that way i certainly will help you said the other warmly of course ill try to help you anyhow but i like your spirit with mrs cortlandt to back me up ill see you go forward as fast as you deserve by now they were out of the cut and once more upon the main line at bas obsipo heading back toward the pacific you asked me to tell you something about her runnels continued yes im not sure my information is entirely correct but knowing who she is i think i understand why she is in panama it is politics big politics the spiggoties have an election next year and it is necessary to get our wires well laid before it comes off general alfarez will probably be the next president alfarez not ramon his father you know we americans occupy a peculiar position here set down as we are in the midst of an alien people who hate us oh they hate us all right all except a few of the better class why there are a good many reasons for one thing theres a sort of racial antipathy you dont like them do you well they dont like you either and the same feeling exists from mexico to patagonia although it is strongest in these regions it is partly the resentment of an inferior race i suppose then too when we stole panama we made the colombians sore and all central america besides for they realized that once we yankees got a foothold here wed hang on and not only dominate this country but all the neighboring republics as well thats just what were beginning to do thats why the cortlandts are here the stage is clearing for a big political drama mr anthony which may mean the end of latin central america i had gathered something of the sort but i had no idea there was so much in it the united states must protect its canal and to that end it is building stone quarries on ancon hill which are really fortifications american capital is coming in here too and in order to protect the whole thing we must dominate panama itself once that is done all the countries between here and the texas border will begin to feel our influence why costa rica is already nothing but a fruit farm owned by a boston corporation of course nobody can forecast the final result but the mexicans the hondurans the guatemalans and the others have begun to feel it and thats why the antiamerican sentiment is constantly growing you dont read much about it in the papers but just live here for a while and youll find out oh i have kirk acknowledged dryly but we dont want these jungle countries thats where youre wrong byandby well need room to expand and when that time comes well move south not north or west tropical america is richer than all our great northwest and well grab it sooner or later meanwhile our farsighted government is smoothing the way and theres nobody better fitted for the preliminary work than mr stephen cortlandt of washington d c husband and clerk of the smartest woman in the business of chaperoning administrations oh see here now cortlandt is more than a clerk hes an errandboy he knows it she knows it and a few other people know it hes the figurehead behind which she works shes a rich woman she loves the game her father was the greatest diplomat of his time you know and she married cortlandt so she could play it any other man would have served as well though ive heard that he showed promise before she blotted him out and absorbed him but now hes merely her power of attorney anthony pursed his lips into a whistle of astonishment as usual he reflected his judgment had been strictly collegemade its been a good thing for him runnels ran on evidently warmed to his subject shes made his reputation he has money and position for my part id rather remain insignificant and have a real wife even if she does have hysterics over a club button dont they love each other nobody knows shes carved out of ice and as for him well gratitude is a good deal like rust in time it destroys the thing it clings to i suppose im talking too much but others would tell you the same things i consider her the smartest woman i ever met and i admire her immensely you are mighty fortunate to be her friend shell force you to the top in spite of yourself im not sure i like that it doesnt sound good oh dont misconstrue what ive said runnels hastened to add she isnt that sort i didnt mean that said kirk briefly and lapsed into a silence from which he roused only to discuss the details of his coming work it was with quite a different eye that he looked upon his host and hostess that evening to his genuine liking for the latter was now added a worshipful admiration and a boyish gratification at her regard which rather put her at a distance when she questioned him on their way to the plaza for the band concert later in the evening he told her of his trip and of runnels kindness its all settled said he im going to work in a few days as train collector what mrs cortlandt turned upon him sharply runnels didnt offer you that sort of position her eyes were dark with indignation kirk promptly came to the defence of his new friend no i asked for it oh i see well he will do much better by you than that i dont want anything better to start with but my dear boy a collector is merely a conductor he takes tickets sure i can do that i might fail at something hard no no no ill see that you dont fail dont you understand i understand a lot more than i did mrs cortlandt thats why i dont want to rob some chap of a job hes entitled to and i shant theres a collector quitting shortly she stared at him curiously for a moment before inquiring is that really the reason or do you think the work will be easier kirk stirred uncomfortably oh im not trying to dodge anything he maintained on the contrary the most amazing thing has happened something i cant quite understand i i really want to work funny isnt it i didnt know people ever got that way but id like to help build this canal but a conductor why youre a gentleman my dad was a brakeman dont be foolish runnels talks too much hell offer you something better than that the highsalaried positions are well filled now and most of the fellows are married a new position will be created but kirk was obdurate id prefer to start in as confidential adviser to the canal commission of course but id be a frost and my father would say i told you so i must make good for his sake even if its only counting cars or licking postagestamps besides it isnt exactly the square thing to take money for work that somebody else does for you when a man tried for the yale team he had to play football no matter who his people were if some capable chap were displaced to put in an incapable fellow like me hed be sore and so would his friends then id have to lick them wed have a fine scrap because i couldnt stand being pointed out as a dub no ill go in through the gate and pay my admission do you realize that you cant live at the tivoli i hadnt thought about that but ill live where the other fellows do no more good dinners no drives and little parties like this oh now you wont cut me out just because i pull bellcords and you pull diplomatic wires remember one of our champion pugilists was once a sailor mrs cortlandt laughed with a touch of annoyance it is utterly ridiculous and i cant believe you are in earnest i am though if i learn to be a good conductor id like to step up im young i cant go back to new york theres plenty of time for promotion oh youll have every chance she declared but i think a few weeks in cap and buttons will cure you of this quixotic sentiment meanwhile i must admit it is refreshing she stared unseeingly at the street lights for a moment then broke out as a new thought occurred to her but see here kirk dont the collectors live in colon i dont know he replied startled and nattered by her first use of his given name ill look it up tomorrow you know i mr cortlandt and i will be in panama and i prefer to have you here you see we can do more for you a little later she broke into a low laugh it seems strange to go driving with a conductor as they reclined against the padded seat of their coach lulled by the strains of music that came to them across the crowded plaza and argued their first difference it struck the young man that edith cortlandt was surprisingly warm and human for a woman of ice he fully felt her superiority yet he almost forgot it in the sense of cordial companionship she gave him xii a night at taboga despite his great contentment in mrs cortlandts society kirk found himself waiting with growing impatience for his active duties to begin there was a restlessness in his mood moreover which his desire to escape from a situation of rather humiliating dependence could not wholly explain curiously enough this feeling was somehow connected with the thought of edith herself why this should be so he did not trouble to inquire they had become the best of good friends he told himself a consummation for which he had devoutly wished yet for some indefinable reason he was dissatisfied he did not know that their moment of perfect unspoiled companionship had come and gone that evening in the plaza every relation into which sentiment enters at all has its crisis or turningpoint though it may pass unobserved perhaps they are happiest who heed it least certainly morbid selfanalysis was the last fault of which kirk could be accused if he had a rule of action it was simply to behave naturally and so far experience had justified him in the belief that behaving naturally always brought him out right in the end he decided that he needed exercise and determined to take a tramp through the country but on the evening before the day he had set for his excursion his plans were upset by a note from mrs cortlandt which the clerk handed him it ran dear kirk stephen has arranged an outing for all three of us and we are counting on you for tomorrow it will be a really truly picnic with all the delightful discomforts of such affairs you are not to know where we are going until we call for you at eight faithfully and mysteriously yours edith cortlandt the recipient of this kind invitation tossed it aside with a gesture of impatience for the moment he experienced a kind of boyish resentment at having his intentions thwarted that seemed out of proportion to the cause whether he would have felt the same if ediths husband were not to be one of the party was a question that did not occur to him at all events the emotion soon passed and he rose the next morning feeling that an outing with the cortlandts would be as pleasant a diversion for the day as any other promptly at eight edith appeared upon the hotel porch she was alone wheres mr cortlandt he inquired oh some men arrived last night from bocas del toro and telephoned that they must see him today on a matter of importance then hes coming later i hardly think so i was terribly disappointed so he told me to go without him now i shall have to make up to you for his absence if i am able thats the sort of speech kirk laughed that doesnt leave a fellow any nice answer im sorry he couldnt come of course and awfully glad you did now where is to be the scene of our revel taboga she said with eyes sparkling youve never been there but its perfectly gorgeous please call a coach our boat is waiting and dont sit on the lunch kirk obeyed and they went clattering down the deserted brick street edith leaned back with a sigh im so glad to get away from that hotel for a day youve no idea how hard it is to be forever entertaining a lot of people you care nothing about or being entertained by people you detest ive smiled and smirked and cooed until im sick i want to scowl and grind my teeth and roar still politics i suppose yes indeed we dont dare talk about it if you only knew it kirk youve capsized the political calculations of the panama conservative party i didnt know i had ever even rocked the boat it runs back to your affair with ramen she glanced toward the coach driver suggesting the need of reticence really did that effect it rather at any rate it gave an excuse for setting things in motion there had been some doubt about the matter for a long time and i was only too glad to exert my influence in the right direction but this is a picnic to an enchanted island and here we are talking politics we mustnt be so serious school is out and its vacation i want to romp and play and get my face dirty kirk readily fell in with her mood and by the time they reached the waterfront they were laughing like two children down through a stone arch they went and out upon a landing beneath the sea wall in front of them the placid waters of the bay were shimmering a myriad of small boats thronged the harbor there were coasting steamers launches sailboats skiffs and canoes along the shore above the tideline were rows of schooners fashioned from gigantic treetrunks and capable of carrying many tons all squatting upon the mud their white sails raised to dry like the outstretched wings of resting seagulls the landing was thronged and at sight of the newcomers loiterers gathered from all sides a pirate throng shouting a dozen dialects and forcing kirk to battle lustily for his luggage stepping into a skiff they were rowed to a launch and a few moments later were gliding swiftly around the long rockrib that guards the harbor a copperhued bandit at the wheel a nubian giant at the engine and an evil yellowfaced desperado sprawling upon the forward deck looking back they saw the city spread out in brilliant panorama clear and beautiful in the morning radiance packed and dense it lay buttressed by the weatherstained ramparts which legend says were built by the women while their husbands were at war and backed by the green heights of ancon against which the foreign houses nestled set in the foreground like an ivory carving was the government theatre while away beyond it loomed the tivoli noting armed sentinels pacing the sea wall at a certain spot kirk called his companions attention to them thats chiriqui prison isnt it he asked yes they say some of the dungeons are almost under the sea it must be a terrible place ive developed a morbid interest in jails he remarked im quite an authority on them i think however i wont experiment with this one i dont like the view yes its an unhealthy spot according to all accounts im sure youd get rheumatism at least bytheway do you notice the thickness of those walls they say that a king of spain was seen standing at his palace window one day staring anxiously toward the west when a courtier presumed to ask him what he was looking at he said i am searching for those costly walls of panama they ought to be visible even from here they cost ten million dollars you know when dollars were worth a good deal more than they are now look theres taboga following her gaze kirk beheld a mountain of amethyst rising out of the bay behind them the shores stretched away into misty distances while low mountains softened by a delicate purple rolled up from the jungle plain ahead of them the turquoise waters were dotted by islets whose heights were densely overgrown while sands of coral whiteness ringed their shore lines here and there a fleet of fishingboats drifted far out in the roadstead lay two cruisers slategray and grim the waters overside purled soothingly the heavens beamed the breeze was like a gentle caress the excursionists lost themselves in silent enjoyment even before they had come to anchor a dozen boatmen were racing for them and crying for their patronage at the waters edge they saw a tiny village nestled close against the mountains its tiled roofs rustred and grown to moss its walls faded by wind and weather to delicate mauves and dove colors and greens impossible to describe up against the slope a squat dobe chapel sat while just beyond reach of the tide was a funny little pocketsize plaza boasting a decrepit fountain and an iron fence eaten by the salt backing it all was a marvellous verdure tipped up on edge or so it seemed and cleared in spots for pineapples the launch when it came to rest seemed suspended in air and beneath it lay an entrancing seagarden once the engine had stopped its clatter a sleepy peaceful silence settled over the harbor unbroken by wheel or whistle for in taboga no one works and there are no vehicles what a wonderful place exclaimed the young man fervently why its like a dream it cant be real then as the boatmen renewed their begging i wonder which barge gentleman i had better hire take the little boy please edith called to an urchin who was manfully struggling with a pair of oars twice his own length whereupon the older boatmen began to shove off with many scowls and much grumbling our choice has offended these genial bandits kirk observed as he helped her to a seat when shall we tell the lad to bring us off four oclock answered mrs cortlandt i arranged with the captain to be ready at that hour so you see we have the whole day ahead of us across the limpid shallows they glided bravely propelled by their nineyearold oarsman but when the bow of their skiff grated upon the bottom they were still some yards from the shore looks as if wed have to wade said kirk then called to one of the nearby boatmen to lend the child a hand but the fellow replied gruffly in some unintelligible jargon he says he carries his passengers ashore in his arms edith translated really competition is spirited even on this heavenly isle well thats easy anthony untied his low shoes kicked them off and rolled up his trousers permit me to help you he said without embarrassing our pilot oh i want to wade too the woman exclaimed enviously as he stepped out but its too pebbly she stood up and allowed him to gather her in his arms then for the first time she felt his strength as her body leaned to his slowly he picked his way ashore while she reclined in his embrace her arms about his neck her smooth cheek brushing his a faint intoxicating perfume she used affected him strangely increasing the poignant sense of her nearness a lock of her hair caressed him when he deposited her gently upon her feet he saw her face had gone white and that she was trembling did i hurt you he queried quickly oh no she answered but as she turned away he saw her breathe as if for the first time since he had taken her up his own face was glowing as he waded back to fetch the lunchbasket and his footgear under the circumstances he had done the only natural the only possible thing yet it had queerly perturbed them both there was an artificial note in their voices as they mounted to the village and unconsciously they avoided each others glances a narrow crooked street fronted by old stone houses opened before them and the many tints they had seen from a distance became more pronounced even the rough flags and cobbles under foot were of a faint lichen gray chrome yellow or pink as if painted at cost of infinite labor out of dark open doorways peered swarthy faces naked bronze children scampered away on fat legs at their approach and in one house were a number of cassocked priests droning in spanish everywhere was the same slumberous content the same peaceful buzz of bees and birds and softtoned human voices the two visitors explored the village even to the quaint tawdry chapel with its impossible blues and rusted gilt and noon found them eager to investigate the contents of their lunchbasket taking a random path up the hill they came at last to a spring of cool water and here they spread their meal under a mangotree bent beneath tons of fruit oh its intoxicating cried edith as she sank to a seat feasting her eyes upon the scene below after lunch shall we climb the mountain im ready for anything kirk assured her maybe well go swimming that seems to be the main occupation of the inhabitants up the path toward them came two timid children one bearing a pineapple half as large as himself the other lugging an armful of strange fruit kirk bought their entire burden and they scuttled away in high glee by now the spirit of the woods was in the picnickers the gladness of the day possessed them wholly and the afternoon sped quickly if at times kirk found his companion regarding him with a strangely timid halfdefiant look he refused to connect it with the episode of their landing it was a fleeting look at most gone almost before he surprised it and for the most part edith showed a seemingly quite natural gayety that helped him to forget his recent selfconsciousness promptly at four they came down the drunken little main street and out upon the beach but no launch was in sight hello wheres our boat exclaimed kirk the captain told me hed be ready at four perhaps he has run over to taboguilla or she hesitated with a troubled frown you told him to wait distinctly seeing an idler in the square above she questioned him in spanish this man says the launch left for panama two hours ago she turned tragic eyes upon kirk do you think they intend to leave us i dont know these people are liable to do any thing once more she questioned the loiterer it is just as i suspected she explained they went on a sunday spree he says they came ashore and bought a lot of liquor and he heard them quarrelling later that means well have to get another boat i dont know where we shall find one neither do i but there must be some sort of craft that plies back and forth regularly only once or twice a week i believe and it belongs to the sanitarium she nodded toward some buildings perched upon a point farther around the bay mr cortlandt looked it up before leaving and found the boat doesnt run on sundays so he hired that launch perhaps wed better wait awhile our men may come back they found seats in the square and were grateful for the rest but an hour passed and the sun was getting low while no sign of their truant craft appeared there must be sailboats to be had said kirk but on inquiry they learned that although a few belonged to the island they all happened to be away he suggested that they hire a man to row them across its twelve miles edith demurred do you think it would be safe he scanned the twilit sea and gave up the idea for the afternoon trades balmy and soothing as they were had lifted a swell that would prove difficult for a skiff to navigate uneasily they settled themselves for a further wait at last as the sun was dipping into a bed of gold kirk broke out gee whiz weve got to do something mr cortlandt will be getting worried in all probability he wont know anything about it until too late to come for us he is dining with these people from bocas and may not get back to the tivoli before midnight nice fix were in remarked anthony id like to lay hands on that captain we may have to stay here all night well at least we have a haven of refuge theyll take us in at the hospital i dont care to ask them theres some one up there i dont wish to see thats why i didnt go near the place today you know best of course but see here dont you think youd better go up there not for worlds we must find some other way she began to pace back and forth in the dusk how unfortunate it is is it because im with you questioned the young man with an effort is that why you dont want to apply there no no stephens particular enemy is in charge up there i detest the man and the feeling is mutual i believe she sighed and her glance fell we cant spend the night outdoors of course not but what he laughed to hide his embarrassment im wondering what people will say oh you mustnt be troubled about that it isnt your fault you know anyhow besides people wont say anything because they wont know anything about it if we stay away from that sanitarium in the effort to put him at his ease her own distress seemed to vanish and kirk immediately felt more cheerful its getting along toward dinnertime he said so lets see what we can find in the way of food you can be sheltered in one of these houses i suppose though from the looks id almost prefer the night air they stumbled out into the unlighted street and began their search but seen close at hand the cooking arrangements of taboga proved most unattractive outside the sanitarium it seemed there was not a stove on the island charcoal braziers set upon the floors or in the dirt yards served all culinary purposes and the process of preparing meals was conducted with an indifference that promised no savory results about the glowing points of light wrinkled hags appeared irregularly as if brewing some witchs broth but they could not understand the phenomenon of americans being hungry and signified no readiness to relieve them in several instances kirk and mrs cortlandt were treated with open suspicion but eventually they found a more pretentiouslooking place where they were taken in and after an interminable wait food was set before them chicken boiled with rice and cocoanut black beans and cocoanut fresh warm milk and a wondrous assortment of hothouse fruits they would have enjoyed the meal had it not been for the curious faces that blocked every aperture in the room and the many bright eyes that peered at them from each shadow but in spite of their equivocal situation edith seemed fully to have regained her spirits even the prospect of spending the night in this place apparently did not dismay her we have created quite a sensation she said laughingly i wonder if it makes the animals in the zoo as nervous to be stared at kirk was half puzzled half relieved by the lightness of her mood if you have finished this healthfood he remarked well go back to the plaza and wait for the launch im as full of cocoanut as a shell they descended to the square again stared at all the way through open doors and followed by a subdued murmur of comment then they sat for a long time watching the stars half minded not to regret the circumstance that had left them stranded together in such pleasant surroundings as if in despair over their impossible predicament edith gave way to a spirit of reckless vivacity and kirk with a mans somewhat exaggerated sympathy for a womans sensitive feelings loyally strove to help her make the best of things in her own way it was like a woman he reflected to follow her mood to the last extreme and being a man he was not displeased the change in her manner was too elusive for him to analyze there was no real concession of her reserve no sacrifice of the feminine privilege of prompt and complete withdrawal if he had struck a false note he knew that she would have turned frigid in an instant but he could not help feeling that some barrier which had existed between them had been magically removed her apparent obliviousness to all that under the circumstances might have troubled her was a subtle compliment to himself and soon he too forgot that there was anything in the world beyond their present relation to each other it was on their return to the house that the climax came leaving him strangely shaken their course took them past a tiny cantina it was open in front and brightly lighted although at this hour most of the houses were dark and the village lay wrapped in the inky shadow of the mountain behind within several men were carousing darkhaired swarthy fellows who seemed to be fishermen drawn by the sound of argument the strangers paused a moment to watch them the quarrel seemed a harmless affair and they were about to pass on when suddenly one of the disputants lunged at his antagonist with a knife conjured from nowhere and the two came tumbling out into the street nearly colliding with the onlookers without a sound mrs cortlandt picked up her skirts and fled into the darkness kirk stumbling along behind her both guiding themselves by instinct rather than sight at last she stopped out of breath and he overtook her you mustnt run through these dark alleys he cried sharply youll break your neck half impatient at this hysterical behavior he seized her by the arm oh im so frightened she breathed and he felt her tremble a drunken man frightens me involuntarily she hid her face against his breast then laughed nervously dont mind me please its the one thing i cant stand ill be all right in a moment she lifted her white face and her eyes were luminous in the gloom im very glad you dont drink her hand crept up to the lapel of his coat what will you think of me she said tremulously before he realized what he was doing his arms had closed around her and his lips had met hers it may have been the romance of the night the solitude the intoxicating warmth of her breath at any rate he lost his head and knew nothing save that she was a woman and he a man as for her she offered no resistance made no sign beyond a startled sigh as their lips came together but impulsive as his action had been it was no more sudden than his recoil he released her and stepped back crying oh my god i i didnt mean that forgive me please she said nothing and he stammered desperately again youll hate me now of course but i dont know what ails me i forgot myself you everything it was unpardonable and i ought to be shot he started off down the blind street his whole body cold with apprehension and selfdisgust where are you going she called after him i dont know i cant stay here now oh mrs cortlandt what can i say do you intend to leave me here in the middle of this no no of course not im rattled thats all ive just got a cowardly desire to flee and butt my head against the nearest wall thats what i ought to do i dont know what possessed me i dont know what youll think of me we wont speak of it now try to compose yourself and find our lodgingplace why yes of course ill see that youre fixed up comfortably and then ill get out oh you mustnt leave me she cried in a panic i couldnt stay in that awful place alone she drew a little nearer to him as if demanding his protection a wave of tenderness swept over him she was just a girl after all he reflected and if it were not for what had happened a moment before the most natural thing in the world would be to take her in his arms and comfort her i i wont leave you ill stay near you he stammered but as they trudged along together through the dark his chagrin returned in full force mrs cortlandt maintained a distressing silence and he could not see her face presently he began to plead brokenly for forgiveness stumbling in the effort not to offend her further and feeling that he was making matters worse with every word he uttered for a long time she made no reply but at last she said do you think i ought ever to see you again after this i suppose not said kirk miserably i wont believe she went on that you could have taken me for the kind of woman who no no he cried in an anguish of selfreproach i was a fool no she said i dont i couldnt bear to think that perhaps i was partly to blame but i didnt think i ought to have known that no man can really be trusted but i thought our friendship was so beautiful and now youve spoiled it dont say that exclaimed kirk say youll forgive me some time but instead of answering him directly she proceeded in the same strain probing his wounded selfrespect to the quick making his offence seem blacker every moment although he assured her over and over that he had simply followed the irresponsible unaccountable impulse of a moment that he had regarded her only as the best of friends and respected her more than he could say she showed him no mercy the melancholy regretful tone she adopted was ten times worse than anger and by the time they reached the inn where they had dined he was sunk in the depths of selfabasement if he had been less preoccupied with his own remorse he might have reflected that ediths attitude especially as she did not expressly withhold the prospect of ultimate pardon established a closer bond between them than ever before but there was no room in his mind for such a thought in reply to his knock an old woman came to the door and sleepily admitted them edith stood for a moment on the threshold then seeing that he made no motion to accompany her she said goodnight and quietly entering closed the door behind her kirk experienced a sudden desire to escape to remain where he was simply prolonged his humiliation instinctively he felt that if he could only get away where he could view the matter in an everyday light it would cease to trouble him but evidently he could not desert edith he sat down upon the doorstep and gave himself up to bitter thoughts she was such a wonderful woman he told himself she had been such a true friend to him that he had been worse than criminal to lose her respect and cortlandt had been so decent to him it was significant that this gave him the most discomfort of all he had betrayed a mans friendship and the thought was unbearable no punishment could be too severe for that he was still sitting there cramped and stiff when the first faint flush of dawn stole over the hillcrest behind him then he rose to wander toward the waterfront as the harbor assumed definite form he beheld a launch stealing in toward the village and ten minutes later greeted stephen cortlandt as that gentleman stepped out of the tender wheres edith eagerly demanded her husband shes asleep i found a place for her not at the sanitarium no no one of these houses lord im glad to see you wed begun to feel like real castaways ive been up all night what happened it was plain that mr cortlandt was deeply agitated our boatmen evidently got drunk and pulled out i tried to get a sailboat but there werent any and it was too rough to try crossing with a skiff it took them but a moment to reach the house and soon the three were back at the waterfront what a miserable night mrs cortlandt complained stifling a yawn i thought youd never come stephen i didnt get back to the tivoli until midnight and then i had trouble in finding a boat to bring me over i suppose they were alarmed at the hotel i said nothing about it he returned quietly at which his wifes face flushed seizing the first occasion he exclaimed in a low voice god how unfortunate at this time were you mad she looked at him and her eyes burned but she said nothing xiii chiquita the next day kirk borrowed a shotgun and went hunting the events of the night before seemed like a dream could it be that he had really blundered irretrievably was it possible that he had offended his best friend past forgiveness he wanted to get away somewhere and collect his thoughts for the present at least he wished to avoid an interview with mrs cortlandt a mile or two beyond the railroad track to the north and east began what appeared to be an unbroken wilderness and thither he turned his steps low rolling hills lay before him densely overgrown and leading upward to a mountain range which paralleled the coast until the distant haze swallowed it up these mountains he reflected with a thrill of interest led on to south america the land of the incas hidden in mystery as the forests close at hand were veiled in faint purple the very thought was romantic balboa had strained his eyes along these selfsame placid shores pizarro the swineherd had followed them in search of dabaiba that fabled temple of gold leaving behind him a trail of blood it was only yonder five miles away that pedrarias with the murder of a million victims on his soul had founded the ancient city which later fell to morgans buccaneers even now a league back from the ocean the land seemed as wild as then anthony suspected that there were houses perhaps villages hidden from his view but vast stretches of enchanted jungle intervened which he determined to explore letting his feet stray whither they would if game of which he had heard great stories fell to his hand so much the better heeding a warning not to bear arms through the streets of panama without a permit from the alcalde he struck off across the fields in a beeline for the woods it was a vast relief to be out in the open air with a gun upon his arm once more and he felt his blood coursing vigorously the burden upon his spirits insensibly began to lighten after all he had done nothing for which he needed to be ashamed the rest of his life edith of course was right in being deeply offended that was to be expected yet his conduct regrettable as it was had been only natural under the circumstances now that the first tumult of feeling had subsided he found that his conscience did not accuse him very severely and somehow he was unable to believe that the breach with edith would prove irreparable she was a sensible woman of the world not a mere schoolgirl perhaps when the immediate shock of the occurrence had passed she would consent to take a different view of it and they might return to their old friendly footing if not well he would be his own man soon anyhow their lives would part and the incident would be forgotten he was sorry that in his momentary madness he had behaved improperly toward a woman to whom he owed so much yet it was not as if he had shown meanness or ingratitude across the meadows deep in grass he went skirting little ponds and marshy spots growing more cheerful with every step in one place he had the goodluck to raise a flock of water birds which he took for purple gallinule and spurwing plover although they were unlike any he had ever seen in some scattered groves beyond he bagged a pigeon and missed a quail which unexpectedly whirred out of a thicket then he continued past herds of grazing cattle to another patch of woodland where he came upon something that looked like a path through rankly growing bananapatches yamfields and groves of mangotrees he followed it penetrating ever deeper into the rolling country until at last he reached the real forest he had come several miles and realized that he could not retrace his steps for the trail had branched many times he had crossed other pathways and made many devours he rejoiced in the thought that he had successfully lost himself at midday he paused in an open glade against a hillside to eat his lunch back of him the rising ground was heavily timbered beneath him a confusion of thickets and groves and cleared fields led out to a green plain as clean as any golf links upon which were scattered dwellings evidently this was the savannas of which he had heard so much and these foreignlooking bungalows were the country homes of the rich panamanians beyond the bay stretched in unruffled calm like a sheet of quicksilver its bosom dotted with rocky islets while hidden in the haze to the southward as he knew were the historic pearl islands where the early spaniards had enriched themselves gazing at this view in lazy enjoyment kirk found himself thinking how good it was to be young and free and to be set down in such a splendidly romantic country above all it was good to be heartwhole and unfettered by any womans spell men in love were unhappy persons harassed by a thousand worries and indecisions utterly lacking in poise it was a lamentable condition of hysteria with which he decided to have nothing to do he did not care for women anyhow one could scarcely have any dealings with them without becoming involved in some affair that unduly harrowed ones feelings how much better it was to know the clean spirit of adventure and the joy of living undisturbed by feverish emotions as he reclined there busied with these thoughts two vivid little paroquets alighted near him to quarrel noisily then make up and kiss each other like any pair of lovers it was disgusting a toucan peered at him with an appearance of exaggerated curiosity due to its huge grotesquely proportioned beak now and then came the harsh notes of parrots as they fluttered high above the treetops meanwhile the young mans ears became attuned to the jungle noises his eyes observant of the many kinds of life about him the wood was crowded with plantlife utterly strange to him on the hill above towered a giant ceibatree its trunk as smooth as if polished by hand and bare of branches except at the very top where instead of tapering it ended abruptly in a tuft of foliage here and there stood tremendous cottontrees their limbs so burdened with airplants as to form a series of aerial gardens their twigs bearing pods filled with down beside them palmtrees raised their heads heavy with clusters of nuts resembling dates in size and form but fit only for wild pigs clumps of bamboo were scattered about their shoots springing from a common centre like the streams from a fountain and sweeping through graceful curves to a spray of shimmering green he had never seen such varieties of growth there were thick trees with bulbous swellings tall trees with buttressed roots that ran high up the trunks slender trees propped up headhigh above the earth on tripodlike roots or clusters of legs trees with bark that shone like a mirror trees guarded with an impregnable armor of sixinch bony spikes kirk did not know the names of half of them nor did he care to learn vines and creepers abounded from the tiny honeysuckle that reared itself with feeble filaments to the giant liana creeping through the forest like a python throttling fullgrown trees in its embrace on every side was the neverceasing battle for light and the struggle of the weak against the strong the air was heavy with the breath of triumphant blooms and the odor of defeated decaying life a thousand voiceless tragedies were being enacted the wood was peopled by distorted shapes that spoke of forgotten encounters rich riotous parasitic growths flourished upon starved limbs or rotting trunks it was weird and beautiful and pitiless unlike the peaceful order of our northern forests here was a savage riot an unending treacherous warfare without light or room or mercy there was something terrible in it all tiring of the scene at last kirk continued his wanderings bearing gradually toward the right that he might eventually emerge upon the savannas below where he knew there was a good paved road leading to the city but the trails were devious and seemed to lead nowhere so at last he struck out through the jungle itself having no machete with which to clear a way his progress was slow but he took his time keeping a wary outlook for game twisting back and forth to avoid the densest thickets until he finally came out upon the margin of a stream through the verdure beyond it he saw the open sunlit meadows and he followed the bank in the hope of finding a footlog or a bridge upon which to cross he had gone perhaps a hundred yards when he stumbled out into a cleared space where he paused with an exclamation of surprise the brook had been dammed and widened into a deep limpid pool to which the clean white sand of its bottom lent a golden hue at the lower end it overflowed in a waterfall the purling music of which rilled the glade overhead the great trees were arched together and interlaced their lower branches set with flowering orchids like hothouse plants upon a windowledge the dense foliage allowed only a random beam of sunlight to pass through and pierce the pool like a brilliant quivering javelin long vines depended from the limbs above falling sheer and straight as plumblines a giant liana the size of a mans body twined up and up until lost in the tangle overhead although set just within the border of the untouched forest it was evident that this spot had been carefully cut away and artfully cultivated but if mans hand had aided nature by a few deft touches here and there and a careful pruning of her lavish riches it could be seen that no human artist had designed the wondrous stage effect to step suddenly out of an uncut wilderness into such a scene as this was bewildering and made the american gasp with delight the place had an air of strictest privacy a springboard mirrored in the depths below invited one to plunge a pair of iron gymnasium rings were swung by chains to a massive limb a flight of stone steps led up the bank and into a hut artistically thatched and walled with palmleaves to harmonize with its setting kirk thanked his fortune that he had not blundered in while the place was in use for it had almost the sacred air of a ladys boudoir instead of promptly withdrawing he allowed his admiration full play and stood staring for a long time what a delightful nook in which to dream away the days it was dim and cool and still although outside its walls of green the afternoon sun was beating down fiercely a stranger might pass and never guess its presence it had been cunningly shaped by fairies that was evident doubtless it was peopled by them also and his mistake had been in coming upon it so suddenly if he had approached with caution he would surely have surprised them at their play for yonder was the music of their dances that chuckling singing waterfall could serve no other purpose perhaps one was hidden under it at present kirk was half tempted to conceal himself and wait for them to reappear though he knew that it requires extraordinary cunning to deceive woodsprites once they have been alarmed but undoubtedly they were somewhere close by probably watching him from behind the leaves and if they were not such timid bodies he might try to search them out as it was he took a lingering farewell look and turned to retrace his steps whereupon the queen fairy laughed at him softly he paused abruptly then turned around with care so as not to frighten her but of course she was invisible then she spoke again with the sweetest foreign accent imaginable you had better cross upon the waterfall sir there is no bridge above after an instant during which he strained his eyes to find her she laughed again here i am in the tree across the pond oh looking over the fork of a treetrunk perhaps twice the height of his head above the ground anthony beheld a ravishing face and two very bright eyes without removing his gaze he leaned his gun carefully against a bush firearms have an abominable effect upon hamadryads and said i knew you were here all the time indeed the eyes opened in astonishment you did not see me at all of course but i knew you were somewhere close by just the same how did you get up there i climbed up why didnt you hide under the waterfall i did not hide senor i am trying to reach my orchid a little hand appeared beside the face and a finger pointed to one of the big air plants above her kirk beheld a marvellous white doveshaped flower nodding upon a slender stalk i climbed up on the big vine it is just like a ladder then you cant be the queen two very large very dark eyes looked at him questioningly queens dont pick flowers he explained they hide in em the queen some of them live in trees and some preside over lakes and fountains which kind are you oh i am neither i live in my fathers house she tossed her head in the direction of the savannas behind her do you wish to cross the stream if you please wait the face disappeared there was a sound from behind the twisted treetrunk a twig fell then a piece of bark and the next instant the girl herself stepped into view i was afraid youd gone for good acknowledged the young man gravely he took up his gun and stepped out upon the crest of the dam you must look where you go she admonished or you will fall splash she laughed delightedly at the thought and he saw that her eyes had a way of wrinkling almost shut in the merriest fashion he balanced upon the slippery surface of the waterway with the stream up to his ankles will you promise not to whisk yourself away if i look down he asked yes but even with this assurance he found it difficult to remove his eyes from her even for the brief instant necessary for a safe passage and when at last he stood beside her he felt an irresistible desire to seize her gently so that she could not escape well she said at length and he found he had been standing stockstill staring at her for several seconds excuse me i really took you for a woodnymph im not sure yet you see the place is so well suited it it was a natural mistake she dropped her eyes shyly and turned away at his look it is only our swimmingpool there have been no fairies here since i was a very little girl but once upon a time there were many oh a great many it was impossible to describe the odd sweet sound her tongue gave to the english words it was not a dialect hardly an accent just a delicious hesitating mannerism born of unfamiliarity did you ever see them nno i arrived always a little too late but there are such things he nodded everybody knows that since peter pan another shy glance told her that he was still regarding her with his look of wondering admiration she pointed to a path saying this way will bring you to the road sir if you wish but i dont wish not yet he sought wildly for an excuse to stay and exclaimed oh the orchid i must get it for you that will be very nice of you sir for two years i have awaited its blooming if you had not arrived i would have got it anyhow girls shouldnt climb trees he said severely it tears their dresses oh one cannot tear a dress like this she glanced down at her skirt allowing his eyes to leave her face for a moment kirk saw that she was clad oddly enough in a suit of denim which was buttoned snugly clear to her neck it struck him as most inappropriate yet it was extremely well made and he could not complain of the effect he broke his gun and removed the shells then leaving it beside the bathhouse went to the tree where he had first seen her with one hand resting upon the trunk he turned to say promise you wont disappear while im up there or change into a squirrel or a bird or anything like that what a funny man you are do you promise yes yes do you live around here of course why do you want this orchid to put it in the house instead of beginning his climb the young man lounged idly against the tree funny how i found you wasnt it he remarked i mean its funny i should have stumbled right on you this way theres only one of you and one of me and er this country is so big i might have gone some other way and then perhaps wed never have met he contemplated this contingency for an instant and if you hadnt spoken id never have seen you either but i had to speak you could not cross above awfully nice of you some people would have let me go away but the orchid senor do you fear to climb so high she inquired with the faintest gleam of amusement at his obvious effort to prolong the conversation oh no he cast about for something further to talk about but failing to find it began slowly to clamber upward supporting himself upon the natural steps afforded by the twining vine and the protuberances of the trunk itself when he had reached the first fork he turned and seated himself comfortably peering downward through the leaves for a sight of her not gone yet he exclaimed thats good are you out of breath that you stop so soon he nodded i need to rest a minute say my name is anthony kirk anthony then after a pause im an american so am i at least i am almost my mother was an american you dont say the young mans face lighted up with interest and he started eagerly down the treetrunk but she checked him promptly the orchid oh yes he reseated himself well well i suppose your mother taught you to speak english i also attended school in baltimore anthony dangled his legs from his perch and brushed aside a troublesome prickly pod that depended in such a position as to tickle his neck im from yale ever been to new haven what are you laughing at at you do you know what it is which you are fighting from your neck this kirk succeeded in locating the nettle that had annoyed him yes it is coweetch wait byandby you will scratch like everything the young lady laughed with the most mischievous elflike enjoyment of this prospect all right just for that i will wait now that the first surprise of meeting was over kirk began a really attentive scrutiny of this delightful young person so far he had been conscious of little except her eyes which had exercised a most remarkable effect upon him from the first he had never cared for black eyes they were too hard and sparkling as a rule but these well he had never seen anything quite like them they were large and soft and velvety like like black pansies that was precisely what they were saucy wideawake black pansies the most beautiful flower in all creation and while they were shadowed by the intangible melancholy of the tropics they were also capable of twinkling in the most roguish manner imaginable as at the present moment her hair was soft and fine entirely free from the harsh lustre so common to that shade and it grew down upon her temples in a way that completed the perfect oval of her face his first glimpse had told him she was ravishingly pretty but it had failed to show how dainty and small she was he saw now that she was considerably below the usual height but so perfectly proportioned that one utterly lost perspective even her thick coarse dress could not conceal the exquisite mould in which she was cast but her chief charm lay in a certain winsome vivacity a willful waywardness an everchanging expression which showed her keenly alive and appreciative even now pure mischief looked out of her eyes as she asked have you rested enough to attack the orchid yes he roused himself from his trance and with a strangely leaping heart proceeded carefully to detach the big air plant from its restingplace the wonderful flower nodding to his touch was no more perfect than this dryad whom he had surprised dont break it she cautioned as he came gingerly down the tree it is what we call espiritu santa the holy spirit flower see it is like a white bird first one ive seen he said noting how the purity of the bloom enhanced the olive of her cheek then he began another fruitless search for a topic of conversation fearing that if he allowed the slightest pause she would send him away but all his thoughts were of her it seemed his tongue would frame nothing but eager questions all about herself at last in desperation he volunteered to get another orchid but the suggestion met with no approval there were no more she told him of that kind maybe we can find one he said hopefully thank you i know them all she was looking at him now as if wondering why he did not make a start but wild horses could not have dragged him away instead of picking up his gun he inquired may i rest a moment im awfully tired certainly you may stay as long as you wish when you are rested the little path will bring you out but you mustnt go he exclaimed in a panic as she turned away oh i say please you wouldnt do a thing like that i cannot speak to you this way sir the young lady blushed prettily why not id like to know oh she raised her hand and shook her head to express the absolute impossibility of such a thing already i have been terrible what will stephanie say youve been nothing of the sort and who is stephanie she is a big black woman very fierce it is because of stephanie that the fairies have gone away from here if we wait a minute maybe theyll come out no i have waited many times and i never saw them somehow i feel sure well see em this time he urged then as she shook her head doubtfully good heavens dont you want to see em im so tired that i must sit down the corners of her eyes wrinkled as she said you are not very strong senor have you been ill yes no not exactly he led her to a bamboo bench beside the palm hut ive been hunting now wont you please tell me how you chanced to be here i thought these country places were unoccupied at this season so they are but you see i am doing a penance penance you oh yes and it is nothing to laugh about either she chided as he smiled incredulously i am a bad girl i am disobedient otherwise i would not allow you to speak to me alone like this you are the first gentleman i have ever been so long in the company with senor antonio really now i will have to do more penance she sighed sadly but her eyes were dancing i dont understand this penance affair what do you do she lifted a fold of her coarse denim dress for six months i must wear these garments no pretty ones i must not go out in public also and i have been sent here away from the city for a time to cure my rebellious spirit those dresses must be hot oh very uncomfortable but you see i was bad not very bad indeed i disobeyed my father my uncle everybody for the first time her eyes grew bright with anger but i did not wish to be married now i see they wanted you to marry some fellow you dont like i do like him you did exactly right to refuse by all means stand pat and dont stand pat i have not heard that word since i was in baltimore its awful to marry somebody you dont like he declared with such earnest conviction that she inquired quickly ah then are you married no but everybody says its positively criminal to marry without love the gentleman is very handsome he shuddered beware of handsome men if you have any idea of marriage select a large plain man with blue eyes and light hair i do not know such a person not yet of course that is not well enough to marry him it is not nice to speak of such things said the young lady primly and it is not nice also to speak with strange gentlemen who come out of the forest when one is doing penance but i am a half american you know perhaps that is what makes me so bad will you catch it for talking to me oh yes it is not allowed it is most improper then i suppose id better leave anthony settled himself more comfortably upon the bench and yet there is nothing really wrong about it is there why its done every day in my country besides whos going to know the padre i tell him everything you girls down here have a pretty tough time of it you are guarded pretty closely arent you she gave him a puzzled look i mean you dont have any liberty you dont go out alone or let fellows take you to lunch or to the matinee or anything like that evidently the mere mention of such things was shocking oh senor she cried incredulously such terrible actions cannot be permitted even in your country it is awful to think of nonsense its done every day here it would not do at all ones people know best about such things one must be careful at all times but you americans are so wicked how does a fellow ever get acquainted with a girl down here how does he get a chance to propose but this frank questioning on so sacred a topic was a little more than the young lady was prepared to meet and for the moment confusion held her tonguetied ones people attend to that of course she managed to say at length then changed the subject quickly do you live in panama she asked yes i work on the railroad or will in a few days you are so young for such authority it must be very difficult to manage railroads well i wont have to run the whole works at first im beginning gradually you know one train at a time that will be easier of course what did you say is your whole name kirk anthony keerk it has a fonny sound has it not i never noticed it and yours do you speak spanish she regarded him curiously not a word my name is chiquita he repeated it after her its pretty what is your last name that is it if i told you my first name you could not use it it would not be proper it ought to be something like ariel that means spirit of the air and water i believe ariel chiquita no they dont go together what are you laughing at to see you scratch your neck anthony became conscious of a growing sensation where the strange pod had dangled against his skin and realized that he had been rubbing the spot for some time you did not know it was the cownettle eh you enjoy seeing me suffer he said patiently you do not soffer she retorted mimicking his tone you only eetch you wish me to sympathize see here miss chiquita may i call on you oh she lifted her brows in amazement such ideas of a certainly not why you do not onderstand our young men do not do those things then ill do whatever is customary really i will but im awfully anxious to see you again and i do not know you my father ill look up mr chiquita and be introduced at this the young lady began to rock back and forth in an abandon of merriment the idea it seemed was too utterly ridiculous for words her silvery laughter filled the glade and caused the jealous waterfall to cease its music no no she said finally it is impossible besides i am doing penance i can see no one in the city i cannot even sit upon the balcony she fetched a palpably counterfeit sigh which ended in a titter never had kirk beheld such a quaintly mischievous such a madly tantalizing creature say youre not really going to marry that fellow he exclaimed with considerable fervor she shrugged her shoulders wearily i suppose so one cannot forever say no and there are many reasons oh thats the limit youll go nutty married to a chap you dont care for but i am naughty now not naughty nutty youll be perfectly miserable there ought to be a law against it let me call and talk it over at least i know all about marriage ive been around so many married people promise i cannot let you call as you say besides for two weeks yet i must remain here alone with stephanie she regarded him mournfully every day i must do my penance and think of my sins and perhaps look for orchids he saw the light that flickered in the depths of her velvet eyes and his heart pounded violently at the unspoken invitation tomorrow he inquired breathlessly do you intend to hunt orchids tomorrow instead of answering she started to her feet with a little cry and he did likewise back of them had sounded an exclamation it was more like the snort of a wild animal than a spoken word and there ten feet away stood a tall coppercolored negress her eyes blazing her nostrils dilated a look of utmost fury upon her face she was fully as tall as kirk gaunt hooknosed and ferocious about her head was bound a gaudy barbadian headdress its tips erect like startled ears increasing the wildness of her appearance stephanie exclaimed the girl you frightened me the negress strode to her speaking rapidly in spanish then turned upon kirk what do you want here she cried menacingly she had thrust her charge behind her and now pierced him with her eyes miss chiquita he began at which that young lady broke into another peal of silvery laughter and chattered to her servant but her words instead of placating the black woman only added to her fury she pointed with quivering hand to the path along the creekbank and cried go go quick you man then to her charge you bad bad go to the house miss chiquita hasnt done anything to make you huffy i came out of the woods yonder and she was good enough to direct me to the road but stephanie was not to be appeased she stamped her flat foot and repeated her command in so savage a tone that kirk perceived the uselessness of trying to explain he looked appealingly at the girl but she merely nodded her head and motioned him to be gone very well he said regretfully thank you for your assistance miss he bowed to the little figure in blue with his best manner and took up his gun this way out no crowding please adios senor antonio came the girls mischievous voice and as he strode down the path he carried with him the memory of a perfect oval face smiling at him past the tragic figure of the bajan woman he went blindly scarcely aware of the sunmottled trail his feet were following for his wits were aflutter and his heart was leaping to some strange intoxication that grew with every instant it threatened to suffuse him choke him rob him of his senses he wanted to cry out her name was chiquita he repeated it over and over in time to his steps was there ever such a beautiful name was there ever such a ravishing little woodsprite and her sweet hesitating accent that rang in his ears how could human tongue make such caressing music of the harshest language on the globe she had called him senor antonio and invited him to come again tomorrow would he come he doubted his ability to wait so long knowing that she agreed to the tryst no power on earth could deter him what a day it had been he had started out in the morning vaguely hoping to divert his mind with some of those trite little happenings that for lack of a better term we call adventures in this humdrum world and then with the miraculous unbelievable luck of youth he had stumbled plump into the middle of the most wondrous adventure it was possible to conceive and yet this wasnt adventure after all it was something bigger finer more precious with a suddenness that was blinding he realized that he was in love yes that was it beyond the shadow of a doubt this mischiefridden foreignborn little creature was the one and only woman in the world for whom the fates had made him and brought him across two oceans that evening he sat for a long time alone on the gallery of his hotel his spirit uplifted with the joy of it a thousand whispering voices in his ears and when at last he fell asleep it was to dream of an olive oval face with eyes like black pansies xiv the path that led nowhere when senor antonio awoke the next morning he lay for an instant striving to recall what it was that had haunted his sleeping hours what great event awaited him then as it rushed through his mind he leaped out of bed and dashed headlong into the bathroom this was tomorrow it had been ages in coming he recalled how even his slumbers had dragged but it was here at last and he would see chiquita he sang as he stepped under his shower and whistled blithely as he dressed himself what a glorious country this panama was anyhow how good it was to be young and to be in love he never had been so happy a man must be in love to sing before breakfast but the afternoon was still a long way off and he must be content to dream until the hour came he was too early for the cortlandts and he breakfasted alone when he strolled out upon the veranda for his smoke he found allan waiting for him as usual the jamaican had not missed a morning so far and it was only by a show of downright firmness that kirk had been able to get rid of him at any time during the day the black boy seemed bent upon devoting his every waking hour to his hero and now finding himself regarded with friendly eyes he expanded joyously got you some games yesterday he inquired yes and im going again today plenty games over yonder is but it is very fatiguing to get them today i go along for showing you the way not a bit like it im going alone oh no boss oh yes boss i accidentally shot the last man i hunted with killed him kirk stared tragically at his companion but allan was not to be so easily deterred i shall pahss behind you boss id love to have you of course but im too careless praise god you must not go halone in that case or something will befall you i shall himitate the birds and call them out before you to fire at fire at i dont fire at things i hit em yes sar in that case we shall procure plenty of games see here im going alone understand i have an engagement with a naiad ow much a month will you be getting for such hengagements naiads dont pay in money they give you smiles and kind words better you continue then as train collector there is great hopportunity for stealing my job wont be ready for a few days and meanwhile i have become a huntsman i intend to go out every afternoon hafternoons is no good for wild hanimals they are sleeping walk they in the hearly morning for the most part very quietly thats true of some wood creatures but the kind i hunt dance along the edges of pools in the afternoon say did you ever feel like dancing no sar come around on the back porch and ill teach you a buckstep i feel too good to sit still but allan refused this proffer firmly such frivolous conduct was beneath his dignity i ave himportant things to disclose he said mysteriously indeed yes sar last night i dreamed youve got nothing on me so did i i am walking on the hedge of the hocean when i hencountered a whale a uge whale swam ashore to rest i suppose no sar he was dead it was very vivid well what has a vivid dead whale to do with me this allan brought forth a sheet of paper which he unfolded carefully there is the number the fish number sar why this is a chinese lottery advertisement i got it for the very purpose it would pay us to hinvest some money on the fish number nonsense i dont believe in dreams you say yourself they are false never such a dream as this boss it was very vivid ive got no money allan folded the paper disconsolately and thrust it into his pocket it is fartunate hindeed said he that you will be working soon master hauntony and those p r r was very fartunate also for getting you to haccept a position very fartunate hindeed do you think i will raise the standard of efficiency most of those railroad persons are vile people they threw me hoff the train with such violence that my joints are very stiff and hinflamed i should henjoy being boss over them for a while why dont you ask for a job i have decided to do so and i am asking you now for an hengagement as brakesman i cant hire you go to the office probably there are halready brakesmen on your train i have no doubt in that case i shall ride with you as private person ride back and forth every day those are my hexpectations sar that costs money you will be collector remarked the negro calmly i should like to see those train people hexpel me in that case well i can see trouble ahead for one of us laughed anthony they dont allow deadheads but allan replied with unshaken confidence then you should secure for me a pahss kirk found it extremely difficult to escape from his persistent shadow that afternoon and he succeeded only after a display of armed resistance it was the hottest part of the day when he set out gun on arm yet he never thought of the discomfort after skirting the city he swung into the fine macadam road that had brought him home the night before and much sooner than he expected he arrived at the little path that led into the forest he knew that he was trespassing again and the knowledge added to his delight as quickly as possible he lost himself in the grateful shade and followed the streambank with beating heart his head was full of vague hopes and plans he meant to learn the true story of miss chiquitas penance and find some means of winning her away from that other lover of whom he had already thought more than once he determined to make his love known without delay and establish himself as a regular suitor as upon the previous day he broke into the glade before he suspected its presence to find the same golden lightbeams flickering in the shadowed depths and to hear the little waterfall chuckling at his surprise there was the tree from which she had called to him yonder the bench where they had sat together of course he was too early he wanted to be in order not to miss an instant of her company so he seated himself and dreamed about her the minutes dragged the jungle drowsed an hour passed a thousand fresh earthy odors breathed around him and he began to see all sorts of flowers hidden away in unsuspected places from the sunlit meadows outside came a sound of grazing herds the deep woods faintly echoed the harsh calls of tropic birds but at the pool itself a sleepy silence brooded once a chattering squirrel came bravely rustling through the branches to the very edge of the enchanted bower but he only sat and stared a moment in seeming admiration then retreated quietly a yellowbeaked toucan in a flash of red and black and gold settled upon a mirrored limb but it too stilled its raucous tongue and flitted away on noiseless pinions as if the naiads were asleep in the moist earth beside the bench anthony saw the print of a dainty boot no longer than his palm and he promptly fell into a rhapsody what tiny hands and feet she had to be sure and such a sweetly melancholy face yet she was anything but grave and gloomy why the sunlight dancing on that waterfall was no more mischievous and merry than she the slight suggestion of sadness she conveyed was but the shadow of the tropic mystery or the afterglow of the tragedy that had played so large a part in this countrys history the fact that she was half american perhaps accounted for her daring yet whatever the other strain it could not be ignoble mrs cortlandts figure of the silver threads in a rotting altarcloth recurred to him with peculiar force but why didnt she come a sudden apprehension overtook him which grew and grew as the afternoon wore away it was a very miserable young man who wandered out through the fragrant path as the first evening shadows settled and bent his dejected steps toward the city evidently something had occurred to prevent her keeping her tryst but he determined to return on the morrow and then if she did not come to follow that other path right up to the house where he would risk everything for a word with her he wondered if she had stayed away purposely to test him and the thought gave him a thrill if so she would soon learn that he was in earnest she would find him waiting there every afternoon and after all why confine himself to the afternoon when she was just as likely to appear in the morning he resolved to go hunting earlier hereafter and give the whole day to it meanwhile he would make cautious inquiries it was considerably after dark when he reached the hotel and his friends had dined but he encountered mr cortlandt later if ediths husband suspected anything of what had occurred a night or two ago his countenance gave no sign of it for some reason or other kirk had not been troubled in the slightest by the thought that cortlandt might be told he could not imagine edith making him the confidant of her outraged feelings besides would such a strangely impassive person resent any little indiscretion in which his wife might choose to indulge kirk did not know the man was a puzzle to him cortlandts voice was thoroughly noncommittal as he inquired where have you been keeping yourself ive been hunting to kill time any luck no none at all i started too late i guess bytheway continued the other your friend allan has been besieging edith imploring her to use her influence to get him a position he has set his heart upon going to work with you he is becoming a positive nuisance i cant get rid of him i never saw such heroworship oh all niggers are hysterical let me give you a bit of advice anthony remember there are no niggers and whites in this country they are both about equal the president of the republic is a black man and a very good one too that reminds me i hear he is to be succeeded by the father of my friend alfarez cortlandt hesitated general alfarez is a candidate he is a very strong man but i am glad there is a but it isnt settled by any means the successful candidate will need the support of our government i suppose the alfarez family is one of the first settlers mayflower stock oh worse than that the name runs back to balboas time general alfarez is very rich and very proud of his ancestry that is one thing that makes him so strong with the people what are some of the other leading families kirk artfully inquired there are a number the martinezes the moras the garavels i couldnt name them all they are very fine people too do you know the chiquitas cortlandts face relaxed in an involuntary smile there is no such family who has been teaching you spanish really isnt there chiquita means very small little one little girl or something like that its not a family name its a term of endearment usually kirk remembered now how the girls eyes had danced when she asked him if he spoke her language it was just like her to tease him and yet what a pretty way to conceal her identity what made you take it for a proper name aa little girl told me oh naturally all children are chiquitas or chiquitos everything in fact that is a pet kirk felt somewhat uncomfortable under the older mans gaze of quiet amusement but these other families he went on in some confusion i mean the ones like those you just mentioned they sometimes intermarry with americans dont they no not the better class there have been a few instances i believe but for the most part they keep to themselves how would a fellow set about meeting the nice people he wouldnt he would probably live here indefinitely and never see the inside of a panamanian house but there must be some way the young man exclaimed in desperation there must be dances parties of course but americans are not invited the men are easy to get acquainted with charming courteous gentlemanly but i dare say you will leave panama without so much as meeting their wives or sisters but why this consuming curiosity has some senorita struck your fancy in spite of his effort to appear unconcerned kirk felt that he looked abominably selfconscious without waiting for a reply cortlandt continued to give him information as if he enjoyed it i suppose one reason why so few americans marry panamanians is that our men like at least to get acquainted with their brides before marriage and that is impossible in this country a man never sees a girl alone you know when he calls to court her he wooes the whole family who vote on him so to speak that doesnt appeal to us who originated the motherinlaw joke there arent many northern chaps who would consent to select a wife by pointing her out like a bolt of calico on a top shelf kirk suddenly realized to the full how egregious his request to call must have appeared to the spanish girl what a fool he had been to be sure for a moment he lost himself in a contemplation of the difficulties so unexpectedly presented he was brought to himself by the words tomorrow you will go to work whats that he broke forth in a panic i cant go to work tomorrow im going hunting cortlandt eyed him curiously i didnt say tomorrow i said runnells phoned that he would be ready for you day after tomorrow what is the matter with you have you lost your head over shooting or dont you care to work oh neither he said hastily i merely misunderstood you of course the sooner the better yes as you say the sooner the better said cortlandt with a shade of meaning well goodnight and goodluck to you in your shooting it was with much less selfassurance that kirk set out again on the next morning for this was his last day of grace and he realized that unless he accomplished something definite it might be a considerable time before he could continue his quest in view of what the girl had said regarding her engagement delays seemed particularly dangerous he haunted the vicinity of the meetingplace all the morning but no one came and a heavy shower at midday drove him into the palmthatched hut for shelter when it had passed he put an end to his indecision and boldly took the other path at least he would find out where she lived and who she was but once again he was disappointed the trail led out through the grove to the raindrenched pasture where it disappeared and instead of one house he saw three half hidden in foliage and all facing in the opposite direction they stood upon the crest of a hill fronting the road and he realized that the pool might be the bathingplace for the inmates of one or all of them up past the grazing stock he went and around to the front of the nearest residence which proved to be a low rambling bungalow affair with many outhouses smothered in a profusion of vines and fruittrees evidently it was unoccupied for heavy wooden shutters barricaded the windows and no one answered his knock although some pigeons perched upon the tile roof cooed at him in a friendly manner he struck across lots to the next house but met with no better success and he approached the third dwelling with a certain hesitation for it was his last chance it was more pretentious than the rest and stood proudly upon the highest point of the ridge up which ran a private road guarded by twin rows of stately royal palms whose perfectly rounded trunks seemed to have been turned upon some giant lathe the house itself was large square and doublegalleried it was shaded by lofty hardwood trees and overlooked a sort of formal garden now badly in need of care the road was of shell and where it entered the grounds passed through a huge iron gate suspended upon concrete pillars the whole place had an air of wealth and exclusiveness here too the windows stared at him blindly and he saw no evidence of occupation yet he advanced and pounded vigorously on the door failing to rouse any one he paused to take a general view of the surroundings scattered upon every side were other winter homes some bleaching nakedly in the open others peeping out from luxuriant groves some mean and poor others really beautiful and impressive he knew that he was in the heart of panamas exclusive winter colony where her wealthy residents came to avoid the heat unwilling to acknowledge himself beaten he plodded from one place to another calling at all the nearest houses finding most of them locked and begging a glass of water where he chanced to be more fortunate nowhere did he see the girl or the barbadian woman nowhere did he receive an intelligible answer to his questions the caretakers looked upon him with suspicion and made it known that he was unwelcome while their women retreated at sight of him even the children were unfriendly once indeed he heard the name that had been ringing so steadily in his ears and it gave him a wild thrill until he discovered that it was only a negress calling to her child afterward it seemed that he heard it everywhere on his disconsolate journey home it was spoken twenty times being applied indifferently to dogs cats parrots and naked youngsters each mention causing him to start and listen whether the girl had been playing with him or whether she had been prevented from keeping her word was of little moment now he loved her and he intended to have her he shut his teeth grimly and made a vow to find her if he had to invade every home in las savannas or pull apart the walls of panama xv alias jefferson locke it was fortunate for kirk on the whole that his last expedition had proved a failure for his methods were none of the most discreet and it was as well perhaps that his work on the railroad intervened to prevent further wild incursions he was detailed to ride no which left panama at returning on no which arrived at pm for a few days he made the run in company with the train collector whose position he was destined to fill and as the duties were by no means difficult he quickly mastered them he had quarters assigned to him and regretfully took leave of his luxurious room and bath at the tivoli he also donned cap and linen uniform and became an insignificant brasstagged unit in the army of canal workers ordinarily he would have resented this loss of individuality but the novelty of the thing appealed to him and he brought a great goodnature to his work deriving sufficient amusement from it to prevent it from growing tiresome for a time it offended his fastidious taste to be forced to elbow his way through superheated coaches jammed with shrieking cackling incoherent negroes they were all utterly hysterical and apparently possessed but one stubborn idea to refuse payments of fares but in time he grew to enjoy even this he was glad of his newfound independence moreover for though it did not cancel his obligation to the cortlandts it made him feel it less keenly as for his quarters they were quite tolerable about the same as he had had at boardingschool he reflected and the meals were better they were not quite up to sherrys or martins it was true but they cost only thirty cents and that had advantages certainly he could not complain of a lack of incident in his new life on his first trip to colon and back he had nine disputes and two fights and threw one man off a record achievement he was told for a beginner a further diversion was furnished by allan who appeared early in the morning and all but assaulted the gateman who refused to let him pass without a ticket it took the entire station force to prevent him from starting for colon as kirks guest he considered it a matter of course that his friend should offer him the courtesies of the road and he went away at last wofully disappointed but not discouraged on the evening of that eventful day instead of returning to his new quarters kirk proceeded to walk the streets in search of a certain face he strolled through the plazas he idled in front of the most pretentious residences he tramped wearily back and forth through dimlit narrow streets gazing up at windows and balconies harkening for the tone of a voice or the sound of a girls laughter but he was without the slightest success and it was very late when he finally retired to dream as usual of chiquita several days passed and he began to feel a little dull he was making no progress in his quest and he did feel the lack of congenial society then one evening there came a note from edith cortlandt briefly requesting him to come and see her he was a little surprised yet he was conscious of a certain relief he had not felt like intruding upon her with further explanations and apologies but since she wished him to come perhaps they could meet after all in a natural way he wanted to get rid of the wretched misunderstanding that lay between them if he were to leave the country that night never to return he would want to feel that he had parted on good terms with the woman who had befriended him promptly at eight oclock he presented himself im a laboring man now he said as he stood before her and i usually hold my cap in my hand and shuffle my feet when talking to ladies pray excuse my embarrassment she did not respond to the lightness of his tone her glance seemed intended to warn him that she meant to be serious i suppose you are wondering why i sent for you she remarked after a perceptible interval and kirk felt instantly that their old relations could not at once be resumed i have discovered something very important and i felt that you ought to know thank you said kirk humbly it was very kind you see she went on with a certain hesitancy you confided your story to me so frankly i felt under a certain obligation she made a little dramatic pause ive discovered who jefferson locke is no who is he kirk was instantly all attention for the announcement came as something of a shock he had almost forgotten locke his real name is frank wellar and he is an absconder he was a brokers clerk in st louis and he made off with something like eighty thousand dollars in cash good heavens said anthony how did you find out a bundle of new york papers they came today where did they catch him they havent caught him he has disappeared completely thats the strangest part of it your detective didnt die after all he recovered did he im mighty glad of that yes but you arent out of the woods yet i cant understand why the police havent discovered your whereabouts you left new york openly under the name of locke perhaps it was so easy they overlooked it he smiled ruefully id hate to be arrested just now when im getting to be such a good conductor dont worry about that until the time comes ill get you the papers later she showed no immediate intention of rising however but sat regarding her visitor with slightly heightened color he began to feel embarrassed it seemed to be his fate to receive benefits at this womans hand whether he willed it or not he got to his feet with an effort and said looking down upon her i must go now but first i want to make you feel how grateful i am for your kindness and for your continued trust in me i havent deserved it i know but he turned as if to leave but faced her again as he heard her pronounce his name he was surprised to see that there were tears in her eyes kirk she said youre an awfully good sort and i cant stay angry with you do you know youve made it rather hard for me staying away all this time i thought you never wanted to see me again you shouldnt take so seriously what a woman says under such circumstances its embarrassing it makes things seem worse than they are she hesitated as if to emphasize the difficulty of such candor kirk said gently does that mean that we can forget all about it and be good friends again does it mean that youll forgive me i cant quite promise that she answered but there is no need of your avoiding me and its absurd for you to feel as you do that you cant accept any little services from me that might help you in your work im still interested in your success youre tremendously good he answered really touched i cant say anything except that ill try to be worthy of your kindness she gave him a halfdistressed look then smiled brightly we wont talk of it any more she said ever now do sit down and tell me what you have been doing all this time how have you been getting along with your work all right except one morning when i overslept overslept oh kirk she said reproachfully you see i never got up so early before except to go duckhunting and this is different did you ever try rising at fivethirty in the morning i mean youve no idea how it feels why its hardly light you cant see to brush your teeth i suggested to runnels that we send no out at eightthirty instead of sixthirty thats early enough for anybody but he didnt seem to take kindly to the thought what did he say when you reported i didnt consider it proper to listen to all he said so i retired gracefully from what i did hear however i gathered that he was vaguely offended at something i tried to explain that i had been out late but it didnt go edith laughed perhaps id better telephone him oh no you neednt do that but surely you were called in time please dont thats the first thing runnels yodelled at me when i showed up hes a nice fellow but hes too serious he lets little things bother him hell cool off eventually time passed quickly in such an interchange of pleasant trivialities and although kirk felt that he was making an unconscionably long call he could not well leave while his hostess seemed bent on detaining him it was late when he said goodnight and after returning to his quarters with characteristic perversity he proceeded to sit up smoking cigarette after cigarette while he tried to set his thoughts in order he was grateful to mrs cortlandt and immensely pleased to learn that the man injured in the affair in new york had not died but something must be done about chiquita that was the important thing now he wrestled with the problem for a long time in vain he was afraid to go to bed for fear of oversleeping again and decided to stay up until traintime but at length drowsiness overcame him and for the few remaining hours he dreamed lonesomely of an oval face and big black velvet eyes he did not really miss his rest until the next afternoon when the heat and the monotonous rumble of the train together with its restful swaying sent him off into a delicious doze from which he was awakened by a brakeman barely in time to escape discovery thereafter he maintained more regular habits and while no one but the luxuryloving youth himself knew what effort it required to cut short his slumbers in their sweetest part he never missed his train and in time the early hours ceased to be a hardship in the days that followed he tried his very best to make good every evening he had to himself he spent in search of the spanish girl aside from his inability to find her and an occasional moment of misgiving at the thought of frank wellar alias jefferson locke kirk had but one worry and that was caused by allan never a day passed that the worshipful black boy did not fairly hound him with his attentions never a nightly journey down into the city that allan did not either accompany him or failing permission to do so follow him at a safe distance for a time anthony rebelled at this espionage but the constant effort of refusal grew tiresome after a while especially as the jamaican did just as he pleased anyhow and kirk ended by letting him have his way but this was not all allan insisted upon accompanying his friend upon his daily runs back and forth across the isthmus at first he succeeded in slipping past the gateman in some miraculous manner and once aboard the train behaved as if free from all further responsibility he made it plain in fact that he was anthonys guest and boon companion and considered the exchange of money quite unnecessary if not even insulting day after day kirk argued with him even threatening to throw him off but allan ignored the arguments with bland goodnature and looked upon the threats as the display of an excruciating sense of humor he continued to visit and to gossip on terms of the closest intimacy and began moreover to exercise a certain proprietary right over kirk following him through the train to see that no harm befell him and seizing the slightest opportunity to engage him in conversation anthony explained time after time that there were probably spotters on the run and that this conduct was sure sooner or later to get them both into trouble to all of which allan listened attentively and agreed with all earnestness but the next morning invariably found him back again with some excuse i cant hexplain it chief he acknowledged on one occasion every day swear i to cease but it is of no havail ever you been in love with a female sar what has that to do with it it is much the same i cant hallow you to leave me i would die and kill myself but rats yes sar it is very hannoying is it not do you want me to lose my job oh mon im going to speak to the boss if you dont let up i dont want to get fired never mind you for these hengagements i will work for you becoming really concerned lest he should be accused of withholding fares kirk did speak to runnels explaining fully whereupon a watch was set with the result that on the very next morning allan was chased out of the railroad yards by an unfeeling man with a club failing for a second time to evade the watchful eyes of the gateman he ranged back and forth beyond the iron fence like a captive animal raising his voice to heaven in weird complaint he was waiting when the train pulled in that evening glued to the iron bars his eyes showing as white in the gloom as his expansive grin of welcome for several days this procedure was repeated with variations until the dreadful threat of arrest put an end to it allan had conceived a wholesome respect for spiggoty police and for a few days thereafter kirk was rid of him then one morning he reappeared as usual in one of the forward coaches how the deuce did you make it asked anthony allan proudly triumphantly displayed a ticket exclaiming it is of no havail to prevent me boss that ticket is good only to corozal the first station youll have to get off there but when corozal had been passed he found allan still comfortably ensconced in his seat now boss we shall have fine visits today the negro predicted warmly and kirk did not have the heart to eject him at the other end of the line allan repeated the process and thereafter worked diligently to amass sufficient money to buy tickets from panama to corozal and from colon to mt hope relying with splendid faith upon his friend to protect him once he penetrated past the lynxeyed gateman runnels accepted kirks explanation and so far exceeded his authority as to make no objection allan therefore managed to spend about half his time in company with the object of his adoration although the master of transportation never referred to his conversation with kirk on the occasion of their trip through culebra cut he watched his new subordinate carefully and he felt his instinctive liking for him increase the young fellow was in earnest he decided in his effort to succeed on his own merits and had not been posing when he offered to start at the bottom it gave runnels pleasure to see how he attended to his work once he had settled down to it accordingly it afforded him an unpleasant surprise when he received a printed letter from a st louis detective agency relative to one frank wellar alias jefferson locke last seen in new york city november th and offering a substantial reward for information leading to his arrest the communication reached runnels through the usual channel copies having been distributed to the heads of various departments it was the description that caught his attention white age twentyeight years occupation clerk eyes bluish gray hair light shading upon yellow complexion fair height six feet weight one hundred ninety pounds no prominent scars or marks so far as known but very particular as to personal appearance and considered a good athlete having been captain of u of k football team there was but one man in runnels department whose appearance tallied with all this and it gave the master of transportation a start to note how very complete was the identification nevertheless he held the letter on his desk and did nothing for a time except to question his new collector upon the first occasion the result was not at all reassuring a few days later chancing to encounter john weeks on his way across the isthmus he recalled kirks mention of his first experience at colon by way of an experiment he led on the consul to speak of his former guest anthony oh yes wheezed the fat man i see youve got him at work you and he are friends i believe i thought youd be interested to know hes getting on well in fact hes the best collector i have were hardly friends said the consul cautiously i suppose hes all right must be or cortlandt wouldnt have taken him up but theres something about him i dont understand either hes on the level or hes got the nerve of a burglar how so well i know he isnt what he claims to be i have proof hes no more darwin k anthonys son than darwin k anthony exclaimed the railroad man in amazement did he claim that he did and he the speaker checked himself with admirable diplomatic caution say hes taught me one thing and that is that it doesnt pay to butt into other peoples business i played him to lose and he won and i got into a fine mess over it weeks wrinkled his face into a ludicrous expression of mournful disgust i couldnt pick a winner if there were two horses in the race and one of them had a broken leg whether his name is anthony or locke makes no difference to me i got in dutch for meddling and alfarez lost his job for arresting him its only a damn fool who gets stung twice in the same spot im through youll get your money anthony told me hed square up on payday weeks snorted at this why ive got it already ive been paid mrs cortlandt sent me her check he stared at his companion curiously funny isnt it how i got called down and ramen alfarez got fired on his account what does it mean he winked one red eye in a manner that set runnels to thinking deeply xvi for a few days after this conversation the master of transportation was in doubt as to what course he should pursue in the end he did nothing and the letter from st louis was permanently filed away there were several reasons for this action for one thing he was a salaried man and could not afford to lose his job what influenced him most however was his genuine liking for anthony he could not bring himself to attach much weight to the suspicious circumstances connected with him being a man of sufficient courage to back his own judgment he decided that no matter what might have been the past of frank wellar alias jefferson locke kirk anthony was entitled to another chance the first thing kirk did when payday came was to enclose the greater part of his salary in an envelope and send it to john weeks with a note explaining that he had withheld only enough for his own actual needs and promising to continue reducing his indebtedness by a like amount monthly he was surprised beyond measure to have the remittance promptly returned the brief letter that accompanied it brought him a flush of discomfort what the deuce had made mrs cortlandt do that for a time he was undecided whether to be offended at her conduct or gratified and he had not settled the matter to his satisfaction when he called upon her that evening weeks wrote me you had squared my account with him he said awkwardly im tremendously obliged of course and ill give this to you instead of him he offered her the envelope with his pay enclosed dont be silly kirk she said in a matteroffact tone i didnt wish weeks to have any opportunity to talk you need this money and i dont perhaps i should have offered it to mr cortlandt stephen knows nothing about the weeks affair if you choose to regard my little favor as a debt however please let it run on until you are better able to pay but anthony remained inflexible and at last she accepted his proffer with some impatience you are the most foolish person i ever knew she remarked cant you understand that such obligations dont exist between friends a few dollars mean nothing a few dollars mean a good deal to me just now you have the most disappointing way of receiving favors i had a decent position for you but you would go to collecting fares i hope you have had enough of it by now and are ready to take something worth while not until it comes naturally no hopskipandjump for mine edith sighed it is terribly dull for me here at present she said mr cortlandt is very busy i have no one to talk to no one to amuse me why ive scarcely seen you since you went to work it is flattering to be missed will you come to the dance tomorrow night he shook his head the music is good you will meet some nice people if you remember one of your qualifications for a position was that you are a good waltzer i cant mingle with the quality be sensible this is an invitation i am getting sensible fast ive learned something about canal conditions what would people say if mrs stephen cortlandt were seen dancing with the new collector of no my dear boy do you suppose mrs stephen cortlandt cares what these people say mr stephen cortlandt might mr stephen cortlandt isnt snobbish either one has to be on the canal zone besides to tell the sordid truth i havent any clothes edith silently extended the envelope in her hand but he laughed perhaps ill come to the next dance ill be rich then see he showed her a long slip of paper consisting of five coupons each numbered lottery tickets he nodded allan had a very particular dream about the number eight so i invested five dollars silver on his hunch you know he has the most wonderful dreams there was one about a whale it was appallingly vivid but you dont bet on all these miraculous whales and things oh no the whale was a little too much for me but i thought id take a chance on the number eight it didnt seem quite so apocryphal but why did you select such a ridiculous combination it isnt likely that the eight will come out three times in four its the number of my automobile license kirk sighed at the memory of his new french car you dont object to such gambling hardly laughed edith when i have a ticket for the same drawing every one does it you know if i win the capital prize ill come to the next party and claim all the dances you will allow me not much encouragement in that for a lonely lady oh im the luckiest chap in the world the drawing comes off next sunday and it happens that ive been shifted to no for a few trips so ill have a chance to see the fun if you were a little less quixotic and werent so remarkably afraid of getting more than your deserts you could come to all these dances im sorry he acknowledged but i have to do things in my own way it was a welcome change for him to sleep as late as he wished on sunday morning and he enjoyed the privilege to the full inasmuch as no did not leave until one oclock he had ample time in which to witness the lottery drawing a thing he had been curious to see since he had first heard of it this form of gambling was well recognized it seemed not only the natives but all classes of canal zone workers engaged in it freely on every street corner women sold tickets day after day and as the drawings were conducted under rigid government supervision the lottery had come to be regarded as a sort of public institution quite as reputable as an ordinary church raffle allan vastly excited was of course waiting to accompany him and when kirk had finished a leisurely breakfast the two strolled idly down into the city oh boss exclaimed the negro i feel that we shall hexperience goodfartune today did you buy a ticket no sar i reinvested all my monies travelling on those railroad trains now see how foolish you are if youd stayed at home you might have bought the winning number today i prefer to haccompany you but i have been thinking to make you a proposition of partnership master hauntony i will stay home and dream numbers which you can purchase with your salary in that manner we shall certainly burst this lottery oh i see youll sleep while i rustle the coin to play whats your idea of a fair division of the profits it is sometimes exceedingly fatiguing to dream said allan defensively sometimes one wastes an entire day and has no success thats merely a question of diet i could make you dream your head off but i do not desire the profits however for being partners with you i would like you to have plenty of monies that is all i love you sar dont you embarrass me it is true chief i would die and yes yes kill yourself i pray to god hevery day that some bad man will hassault you in order that i may die for you the jamaican was growing excited as usual when he dwelt upon this subject i would henjoy to shed my blood for you sar i would like to see it running running running he waved his arms wildly dont bleed to death i wish to suffer and scream and groan so that you will be knowing never mind i think i get the idea but im not going to allow it and im not going to allow you to dream you sleep too much as it is besides your dreams are no good look at that whale dream of yours for instance oh sar the fish number did not win to be sure but water did but you didnt dream about water it was about fish vivid fish i did not chance to think of the water acknowledged allan but there was the whale lying upon the hedge of the hocean hall the time the drawing which was for a capital prize of fifteen thousand dollars silver had drawn a larger crowd than usual and when the two reached cathedral square they found the lottery building thronged to overflowing with the usual polyglot elements that make up these latinamerican gatherings negroes indians panamanians spaniards americans while in the plaza itself other groups were waiting to hear the report by dint of considerable effort kirk succeeded in working his way through the wide double doors and being much above the average height he was able to get a good view of the proceedings upon a platform a group of ceremonious officials were gathered about a revolving wire cage so arranged that it could be whirled rapidly upon its axis into it were put ten ivory spheres resembling billiardballs in size and appearance when this had been done the cage was closed and a very badly frightened twelveyearold girl was selected at random from the audience then lifted to the stage where it required the commands and entreaties of her excited parents to prevent her from dissolving in tears at a word from the master of ceremonies the cage was spun until the ivory balls inside leaped and capered like captive squirrels then at another signal it was stopped the door was opened and the little girl reached in a trembling hand and selected a sphere it proved to be hollow with two halves screwed together and in full sight of the assembly it was opened displaying a bit of paper inside ocho cried the announcer and a card bearing the numeral was raised the paper was replaced inside the ivory ball the ball itself was dropped into the wire cage the door was closed and once more the cage was spun kirk was much interested in the scene not from any faintest hope that he would draw a prize but purely from the novel atmosphere and color of the thing while his eyes were busiest and just as the child prepared to draw another ball he felt a clutch upon his arm and glancing down beheld the glowing black eyes of senor ramon alfarez fixed upon him alfarez was dressed immaculately this time in civilians white linen his ferocious little mustachios carefully pointed his cheeks freshly shaven and talcumed his slender feet encased in white canvas shoes a wonderful guayaquil hat the creamy straws of which were no thicker than silk threads crowned his sleek raven locks it must have cost a small fortune he carried a dapper little cane with which he tapped his former prisoner to attract his attention at sight of him kirk drew down his brows and said gruffly dont poke me with that umbrella he turned away but again alfarez touched him with the rattan i will spik wit you hombre he said if you keep jabbing me with that crutch ill break it and then you cant walk home ramen jerked his head toward the square outside in an imperious fashion and kirk curious to learn the cause of this unusual excitement followed him without demur when they had reached the street the spaniard turned with flashing eyes and a mirthless smile well he said dramatically pretty well how goes it with you so you ave socceed in your cowardly attemp my what i am lose my poseetion as commandante of police you dont say so kirks face broke into a smile of real pleasure ha makes it you to laugh then exclaimed the panamanian excitedly peraps you shall answer to those detestable actions senor perhaps i see you blame me for the loss of your job well maybe you wont beat up the next american you get your hands on bot i ave another poseetion ramen exulted indeed are you behind the ribbons at the local wanamakers i ave been promote i am appoint yesterday by his excellency the presidente to be his secretary so those dastardly attack of yours is transpire to my blessing it will be always so i suppose its a good job but you ought to be selling poison in a drugstore did you call me out to hear this news si alfarez nodded his head vigorously then narrowing his eyes he said meaningly in a voice that none might overhear panama is sometimes very onealthy city for fat americans he ran a hostile glance up and down anthonys burly frame it is the climate peraps of too great eat in other words you intend to make it hot for me eh i the excommandant shrugged his shoulders in eloquent denial i shall do noting bot if you are wise man you will not display yourself to the dangers of these climate you will return ome say ive a good notion to punch your head alfarez paled slightly soch would be most dangerous for in chiriqui prison there is at the present some fatal disease he laughed sneeringly the senor is reech mans son eh those do not geeve the appearance with supreme insolence he touched one of the buttons upon kirks linen uniform with his cane whereat the american snatched the stick out of his hand broke it and tossed it into the street his blood was up and in another breath he would have struck the spaniard regardless of consequences but just at that moment allan dashed out of the crowd crying breathlessly oh boss oh boss glory to god it is true ohhh glory seizing kirks hands he kissed them before the other could prevent then ran on frantically come quick come come come look out snapped kirk angrily whats happened the dream the dream is come oh god sar you you have won the capital prize sar alfarezs exclamation as much as the boys wild hysteria brought anthony to himself no honest now whats the number he exclaimed height height three height sobbed the jamaican kirk made a dive for his coatpocket while allan continued in a rising voice glory to god sar glory to god it is fifteen thousand dollars silver i thought i should hexpire from fright oh i quick praise be do not say you have lost the ticket or i shall die and kill myself here it is in his hand anthony waved a slip of paper out of which leaped four big red numbers carraho came from behind him and he turned to behold alfarez livid of face and with shaking hand fling a handful of similar coupons after the broken cane without another word or a glance behind him the panamanian made off across the plaza barely in time to escape the crowd that surged around the two he had quitted bombarded by a fusillade of questions in a dozen tongues jostled by a clamoring curious throng the lucky owner of fought his way back into the lottery building and as he went the news spread like flaming oil there it was plainly displayed there could be no possible mistake and it meant fifteen thousand silver pesos a princely fortune indeed for the collector of no promptly at five minutes to one oclock that afternoon allan allan late of jamaica strode through the panama railroad station and flaunted a firstclass roundtrip ticket to colon before the eyes of his enemy the gateman he was smoking a huge jamaican cigar and his pockets bulged with others when he came to board the train he called loudly for a porter to bring him the step and once inside selected a shady seat with the languid air of a bored globetrotter he patronized the butcher lavishly crushing handful after handful of lemondrops noisily between his teeth and strewing orange peel and cigar ashes on the floor with the careless unconcern that accords with firmly established financial eminence he spat out of the window he waved a dignified greeting to his countrymen gathered upon station platforms he halted hurrying brakemen to inquire times of arrival and departure and in general he had the time of his young life only when kirk appeared upon his rounds did he forego his haughty complacency then his wide lips which nature had shaped to a perpetual grin curled back as they were intended his smile lit up the car and he burst into loud laughter enjoying yourself inquired his hero passably sar passably then with a painful assumption of seriousness how is the train sar may i ahsk on time rarely it is so as a general thing it is fartunate hindeed that you consented to run her this time in a hurry to get to colon quite so it is himpartant that i harrive promptly today i have business haffairs his countenance assumed tortured lines as he endeavored to maintain his gravity then failing in his attempt he burst suddenly into a gale of merriment that sent forth a shower of peanuts and lemon candy praise god boss we are appy gentlemen today are we not kirk found that the report of his goodfortune had spread far and wide he was halted a score of times for congratulations operators at the various stations yelled at him and waved their hands runnels wired hurrah at gatun a certain respect was in these greetings too for he had suddenly become a character as yet however he had not fully considered what this windfall meant to him his first thought had been that he could now discharge his debts go back to new york and clear himself before the law yet the more he thought of it the less eager he became to return seven thousand five hundred dollars in gold to kirk anthony of panama collector was a substantial fortune to kirk anthony of albany distributor it was nothing suppose he went home and squared his account with the police what would he do then nothing as usual here he was proving that the anthony breed was selfsupporting at least and there was another reason the weightiest of all long before he had reached the end of his run he realized that not one hundred times the amount of this capital prize would tempt him to leave panama before he had seen chiquita chiquita was beginning to seem like a dream at times during the past week he had begun to wonder if she were not really a product of his own imagination his fancy had played upon her so extravagantly that he feared he would not know her if ever they came face to face his mental picture of her had lost all distinctness her face was no longer clearcut before his minds eye but so blurred and hazy that even to himself he could not describe her with any accuracy this was most unsatisfactory and he reproached himself bitterly for the involuntary faithlessness that could allow her image to grow dim he was almost without hope of seeing her again and then with the inconsequence of dreams and sprites she appeared to him it was but a glimpse he had and a tantalizing flash of recognition from her eyes it happened in the dusk during the confusion that accompanied the arrival of no at panama and it came with a suddenness that stunned him the station was jammed with a roaring flood of negroes another crowd was forcing its way through the exits in the high iron fence the street was a crush of spiggoty coaches kirk had volunteered to assist an old lady and his arms were full of bundles as he guided her between the clicking teeth of a turnstile he was helping her into a carriage when he heard the sharp clatter of hoofs upon the brick pavement and looked up to see a fine peruvian mare hitched to a tancolored surrey skirting the confusion a black coachman was driving and there were several people in the carriage kirk cast it a casual glance and just as he looked it swept into the glare of an electric light out from the back seat shone a perfect oval face with soft luminous eyes it was just as he had pictured it only more beautiful kirk nearly upset his little old lady who was struggling into her equipage he swept his armful of bundles into the coach seized his scandalized companion under the arms and deposited her bodily upon a seat without waiting to hear from her he dashed away through the bedlam under horses heads he went past flying hoofs and scraping wheels jostling pedestrians and little brown policemen until he had reached the outskirts of the crowd where he vaulted into a vacant vehicle and called upon the driver to whip up quick quick follow that tancolored surrey ill give you a dollar gold not to lose sight of it with the blandest of smiles the coachman started his horses then turning he inquired politely otel tivoli no no follow that carriage no sabe ingles said the coachman before kirk had succeeded in making him understand the street had become jammed with carriages and the peruvian mare was lost to sight after a halfhour of futile clattering back and forth kirk dismissed the driver but there was no doubt that she had recognized him and nothing now could prevent him from continuing his search the trouble was that his present occupation allowed him no opportunity he was tied to the railroad except at night it was perhaps two weeks later that a serious shakeup occurred in the office force of which no one seemed to know the cause there was a mad scramble for advancement all along the line in which kirk took no part but unexpectedly runnels summoned him to his office how would you like an inside position said the master of transportation eying him keenly so soon i said id advance you if you made good he paused an instant then said deliberately when you get the hang of things here youll have a chance to be my assistant kirk opened his eyes in amazement gee thats great but do you think i can get away with it not at once it will take time of course and youll have to work like the devil runnels regarded him curiously recalling the letter so carefully filed away then he yielded to his natural impulse look here anthony he said im partly selfish in this for i believe youre the sort im going to want within the next year the superintendent has had an offer from a big system in the states and hes going to quit when his vacation comes he likes me and he says ill probably step into his shoes do you understand what that means ill need fellows i can count on fellows who wont doublecross me to make a dollar for themselves or knife me when my back is turned ive got to have an efficient noiseless organization otherwise well all go under for well be into politics up to our necks i think youre my sort so if youll stick to me ill help you and for every step i take ill drag you up one its a go the two young men clasped hands heartily runnels had struck the right note beside his former desire to prove himself a man kirk now felt a strong sense of loyalty to the one who had recognized his worth this was no mere matter of promotion he and runnels would work shoulder to shoulder a sense of responsibility descended upon him for the first time he thoroughly understood the spirit of the ardent toilers who were giving their best to the big job he was really one of them now and the thought electrified him when he told his good news to mrs cortlandt her surprise was so cleverly simulated that he never dreamed that she had been at great pains to bring this thing about not that runnels was indisposed to act upon his own initiative but the circumstances that had made his action possible had been due to her it was hard to help a man against his will but she profited by experience and took the line of least resistance the young man himself did not inquire too closely into the occasion of his advancement and edith cortlandt was but little in his mind he was consumed with the thought of chiquita he hoped that his new work would allow him more control of his time and perhaps put him in the way of learning her name he could move in better society now meanwhile he laid other plans he took allan into his confidence and told him frankly that he was in love with a woman he did not know of course his faithful follower was delighted and made extravagant promises of aid now that the dry season has come said kirk people must be living at the savannas and i want you to haunt the region round that swimmingpool until you discover who she is you must be my detective oh boss i would dont tell me youd die and kill yourself for me i want you to live and find this girl for me ill take you out today after office hours and show you the place then youll have to do the rest you talk spanish you know but above all dont tip off tip hoff what shall i be climbing sar i mean you mustnt tell a soul never fear boss hallan will discover your female and dont call her a female it sounds indecent remember she has a bajan with her six feet tall named stephanie who knows maybe you can win stephanie for yourself kirk chuckled at the thought no sar if you please those bajan oomen is all very disagreeable you understand i cant quit work to go looking for the girl because ive simply got to tend to business but ill spend sunday out there if you havent already discovered her now ill chant this all over again on the way out so you wont forget anything xvii garavel the banker these were busy days for the cortlandts they entertained constantly and the occasions when they dined without from one to a dozen guests became so exceptional as to elicit remark around the hotel most of their efforts were devoted to certain panamanians of the influential class and in company with one or more of these cortlandt made frequent trips to the various quarters of the republic sometimes absenting himself for days at a time during these intervals his wife assumed the direction of affairs and continued to entertain or be entertained her energy and resource seemed inexhaustible the officials of both governments treated her with punctilious respect and the prestige gained in this way she used to enhance her reputation as a hostess soon she became the social dictator of the city and the most exclusive circles american and panamanian alike allowed her to assume control the result was just what had been designed tourists and visiting newspaper people spoke glowingly of the amity between the two nations and wondered at the absence of that spanish prejudice of which they had heard so much those who chanced to know the deeper significance of it all and were aware of the smouldering resentment that lay in the latin mind commented admiringly upon her work and wondered what effect it would have upon the coming election already this event had cast its shadow ahead bringing memories of the last election with its disturbances and ragged uncertainty that had been a pregnant epoch armed guards hidden behind american walls had listened to the growing clamor and prepared to fire american marines had been held in readiness to take such action as might have convulsed the other watchful world powers since then the fuse had burned steadily if slowly as the time drew near there were those who openly predicted trouble others scoffed at the idea although they claimed that this would be the last election ever held in panama but all united in declaring that whatever the work to which the cortlandts had been assigned they were doing it well no one but the woman herself and her husband really understood the tremendous difficulties of their task or the vital issues at stake although they seemed to be making progress they knew that they were dealing with a people not only excitable and egotistic but steeped in guile and distrustful by nature the fire was close to the magazine but this was edith cortlandts chosen field and she brought to bear a manlike power of cool calculation together with a brilliant intuition of her own never had her tact her knowledge of human nature her keen realization of political values been called into such play as now so triumphantly did she exercise these qualities that all who came into contact with her recognized the master mind directing the campaign and consciously or unconsciously relegated her husband to the background to the latin intellect this display of power on the part of a woman was a revelation she knew the effect she produced and made the most of it old anibal alfarez was perhaps the last fully to appreciate her he did however learn in time that while he could successfully match his craft against that of the husband the wife read him unerringly the result was that he broke with them openly when news of this reached the members of the canal commission they were alarmed and colonel jolson felt it necessary to make known their views upon the situation accordingly a few nights later the cortlandts dined at his handsome residence on the heights above culebra after their return to panama the colonel in whom was vested the supreme authority over his nations interests acknowledged that his acquaintance with diplomacy was as nothing compared with edith cortlandts it was to colonel bland in charge of the atlantic division that he confessed in all my life i never met a woman like her cortlandt as you know is a clever fellow and i flatter myself that im no mental invalid but we were like children in her hands he sided with me at first but she talked us both around in spite of ourselves i agree with her now perfectly and i am content to let her have free rein general alfarez is the strongest man in the republic said colonel bland as governor of panama province hes the logical next president besides that he has the machinery behind him i dont see who there is to defeat him we argued the same thing she thinks garavel is the proper man garavel is a banker hes not a politician the chiefengineer laughed all spanishamericans are politicians colonel they cant help it would he accept it is her business to find out i had my doubts but could he win it would be a calamity if he had american backing and failed it would mean a disaster cortlandt has been working carefully and he has been in all the seven provinces he admits that it might be done and she is certain you see their part in the colombian affair makes them strong with the leaders and they have already whipped the foreign influences into line of course it will mean a fight alfarez wont give up easily but if garavel should be the next president it would be a fine thing for both countries the other commissioner shook his white head doubtfully i supposed it was all settled cortlandt himself told me alfarez was a good man the last time i talked with him my god it seems to me weve got enough on our hands without being guardians for a twobyfour republic filled with maniacs weve got to finish this job on time i cant understand this change of sentiment oh it isnt settled there is ample time for anything to happen when the psychological moment comes cortlandt will be in position to swing his influence whichever way he thinks best well its a puzzling situation colonel bland admitted and i wish it were over then he branched off on the subject of a cargo of cement which had not been up to standard and might have to be rejected over at panama the cortlandts were looking for a house to lease affairs had reached a point where it seemed advisable to give up their quarters at the tivoli and enter into closer contact with the life of the spanish city one reason for the move was the necessity for a greater privacy than the hotel afforded for the time was not far distant when privacy might prove of paramount importance meanwhile they gave a ceremonious little dinner the one and only guest being andres garavel the banker of all the charming peoples of central america there are perhaps none more polished and wellbred than the upperclass panamanians of this agreeable type senor garavel was an admirable example having sprung from the finest castilian stock as a name running back through the pages of history to the earliest conquests attested other garavels had played important parts in the troubled affairs of guatemala and it was the bankers proud boast that one of his ancestors had assisted alvarado to christen the first capital of that country the city of st james the gentleman in the name had later figured prominently in antigua that athens of the new world where the flower of spanish america gathered a later forebear had fled southward at the time of the disturbances incidental to the revolt of the colonies but in his departure there had been no disgrace and since that time the garavels had worthily maintained the family traditions of dignity and honor the present bearer of the name was of distinguished appearance he was swarthy of skin his hair was snowwhite and he had stern black eyes of great intelligence in size he was not above the medium but his manner fully made up for any deficiency of stature he was courtly and deliberate evincing a pride that sprang not only from good blood but from good deeds his poise was that of a man with heavy responsibilities for andres garavel was a careful banker and a rich one he was widely travelled wellinformed an agreeable talker and the conversation at mrs cortlandts table did not lag i am so disappointed that your daughter could not come edith told him for the second time im afraid she objects to our american informality no no my dear lady said their guest she admires american customs as i do we are progressive we have travelled in my home in my private life perhaps i am panamanian but in my business and in my contact with other peoples i am as they are it is the same with my daughter when you latins really become cosmopolitan you are more so than we americans cortlandt acknowledged we assume foreign airs and customs that please us and forget to retain our own while you well with germans you are german with englishmen you are english and yet you never forget to be spaniards the banker smiled my daughter has had a wide education for a child she has travelled she speaks five languages and yet underneath it all she is a garavel and hence a panamanian she is all i have and my life is hers when we are settled in our new house we hope to see something of you both you have effected a lease of the martinez home i believe yes do you know it as my own you are indeed fortunate to secure so fine a place i wish that in some way i might be of service to you the wish is mutual cortlandt answered meaningly but senor garavel concealed any recognition of the tone by a formal bow and the meal progressed with only the customary small talk to enliven it as soon as the three had adjourned to the cortlandts suite the host of the evening proceeded to approach the subject in his mind as directly as the circumstances permitted through a series of natural transitions the conversation was brought around to politics and garavel was adroitly sounded but he displayed little interest maintaining a reserve that baffled them it was impossible to betray him into an expression of feeling favorable to their views when at last he consented to show his awareness of the suggestion so constantly held out he spoke with deliberate intention general alfarez is my respected friend he said with a quietness that intensified his meaning and i rejoice that he will be the next president of panama you of course know that there is opposition to him all panama knows that general alfarez does not seem to be a friend of the united states there are few who hold the views i do he is a man of strong character he has no commercial interests to influence him as i have and so we differ yet i respect him it is precisely because of those views of yours that i wish to consult you said cortlandt slowly in all the republic there is no one so progressive as you may i speak frankly garavel inclined his white head without removing his intense dark eyes from the speaker don anibal alfarez can never be president of panama the banker made no visible movement yet the effect of this positive declaration was almost like that of a blow after a pause he said may i tell him you said so if you wish but i do not think you will the hearer let his eyes flit questioningly to mrs cortlandts face to find her smiling at him believe me dear lady he said i suspected that there were grave reasons for this interview but as yet i am at sea i am not a politician you know i shall have no voice in our political affairs of course we know that senor garavel and of course there are grave reasons why we wished to talk with you as stephen has said general alfarez cannot be president madame he said coldly panama is a republic the voice of the people is supreme down in your heart do you really think so she was still smiling at him no the united states is supreme ah that day will come perhaps i have said so i look forward to it as the best solution but the day has come even so alfarez is an honorable man a strong man and the wealthiest man in our country he is a politician but he is not a friend of our country i am not so sure garavel frowned at his cigar for a moment while the room became silent what has this to do with me madame he asked at last cant you guess the intensity of her look caused him to rise hurriedly and cast a quick glance from one to the other you are also a rich man a man of ability said cortlandt quick to seize the momentary advantage your name is second to none in all central america the next president must possess intelligence honor ability he must be a friend of our people there is no one better impossible exclaimed the banker in a strange voice i no no and why not have you never had political aspirations of course all men have dreams i was secretary of finance under amador but the garavels have never really been public men politics have been a curse to our house my grandfather i know broke in mrs cortlandt but times have changed panama has seen her last revolution and she needs a business man at her head presidents are not made now by rifle and sword and the man with the machete must give way to the man with a capacity for handling big affairs there will be no more swineherd presidents like your guatemalan countryman corera nor tyrants like zelaya panama is a healthy country with no national debt she is growing developing she holds the gateway to the western world and her finances must be administered wisely you mr garavel are one of the few who are clearheaded enough to see that her destiny is linked with ours and there is no one who can direct her so well as you it is impossible repeated garavel his agitation growing more pronounced general alfarez is my friend his son will be my son ramon is ramon engaged to your daughter yes exclaimed the banker shortly he began to pace the room what difference would that make if the young people love each other certainly cortlandt agreed they are not children as for love ramon loves and my daughter will love also once she is married for she is a garavel if ramon isnt satisfactory to her ought you to force her inclination mrs cortlandt offered eagerly but the banker flung his arms aloft in a gesture of halfhumorous despair ohh these young ladies he cried they do not know what they want what pleases today displeases tomorrow it is yes and no yes and no until one must decide for them that after all is best he paused abruptly this comes upon me like a flood my friends i am swept away and yet i i will need to think seriously certainly to an honorable man the salary will mean nothing i have many affairs i fear i cannot afford this sacrifice would you retire in favor of some one who could afford it alfarez is honest alfarez cannot be president it would require a great deal of money i am considered a rich man but i have discounted the future and my enterprises he flung out his arms i have spread out i must be careful it is not alone my money that i have invested it will require very little money said cortlandt i have been from david to darien from bocas to colon and i know the public sentiment speaking of david his wife added it was you who first projected the railroad to that point senor garavel yes i saw that it was needed it would make panama he said simply under your administration it can be built mr cortlandt can assure you of our governments earnest cooperation that would not be the case if general alfarez were elected perhaps the colombian boundary can be settled there also our influence might avail those two steps forward would make the name of garavel as famous in panama as it is in guatemala those are important issues for any loyal panamanian he admitted and you love your daughter you say your life is hers your honor would be hers also senorita garavel would have no cause to regret her fathers presidency oh it is useless to argue smiled the spaniard i am weak i am human i am also patriotic and i realize that our little country must look to your great one for its stimulus our life must be moulded after yours for years i have dreamed of a railroad to david which would some day form a link in the great system that will join the three americas i have pictured our inland jungles replaced with homes a great traffic flowing from end to end of the republic but i have also seen that our people would not profit by it the languor of the tropics is in their blood and you yankees would be needed to inspire them his voice shook with emotion as he went on they are good simple people no more than children and i love them a gracious providence gave us the key to the worlds commerce but we could not use it it needs all our wisdom now to adapt ourselves to the conditions that have arisen andres garavel president of the republic of panama it has a sweet sound my friends and yet i have fears lets take them one by one laughed his host and prove them imaginary i see a great goodfortune in store for you it was midnight before senor andres garavel the banker bade his friends goodbye when he descended the hotel steps to his carriage he held his white head proudly erect and there was new dignity in his bearing as he was whirled homeward behind his spirited peruvian mare a wonderful song was singing in his heart xviii the siege of maria torres the faithful allan was not long in fulfilling his mission such devotion as his it seemed could hardly fail and if there had been a hundred chiquitas doubtless he would have corralled them all he conveyed the impression that if it had been necessary to journey beyond the grave and bring back the ghost of some deadandgone chiquita he would have gloriously succeeded one morning a few days later he appeared to kirk bursting with importance and news well sar i have discovered your female he announced pompously no whats her name who is she her is named maria torres sar and resides in the small ouse you hobserved upon the ill did you see her anthony could hardly believe his ears oh yes very hextensively what does she look like is she dark very dark sar and small not too small opined allan of course just right and her eyes like like hink spots of hink oh it is she master hauntony jove i believe it is youre an ace allan youre my ace of spades out of pure joy he began to pummel him playfully why dont you rejoice lift up your voice and sing maria torres its a heavenly name why dont you make a joyful noise allan voiced a feeble hurrah it was only by chawnce that i hencountered her boss for she is residing in the city i hascertained all those facts good find the street and number quick im going awooing say when these spaniards court a girl they hang around her window and roll their eyes dont they me for that ill haunt the torres neighborhood until she shows herself or die in the attempt ill play their game ill get a guitar ill oh from this moment im a spaniard of the spaniards im the incarnation of ten thousand fiery cavaliers ill stand in front of her house until she sends me a chair maria tor what the deuce are you loafing for get a move on hustle those kidney feet of yours dont come back until you have located her for tonight ah blessed night my lifes romance begins in earnest get out allan fled while kirk proceeded to dream over his breakfast of bacon and coldstorage eggs he was beaming when he appeared at the office he sang he whistled he performed his duties with a joyous uproar that interfered seriously with all around him and set the whole place in confusion nor did his spirits lessen when later in the day allan informed him that the residence of senor luis torres whom the gods had selected as father to the delectable maria was at number avenida norte anthony did not taste his dinner that evening as darkness settled he planted himself conspicuously on the corner opposite no and began to study the premises it was a trifle disappointing to note that chiquita lived in such poor style the place was not at all impressive the first floor of the building was given over to a chinese bazaar and the upper story seemed neither extremely clean nor at all modern but although this clashed a bit with his preconceived ideas he knew that many of the nicest panamanian families lived in modest quarters his natural impulse was to apply boldly at the door but he had learned something of local customs and he determined to give no possible ground for offence after she had recognized him and seen his willingness to follow the habit of her spanish suitors it would be feasible perhaps to adopt a more americanized method meanwhile he must run no risk of antagonizing her people in the central american scheme of courtship patience plays a large part it is the young mans practice to martyr himself until the sight of him becomes such a reproach that the family must perforce express its sympathy although this procedure struck anthony as ludicrous in the extreme its novelty was not without charm and he had lived through such a period of torturing uncertainty that the mere fact of the girls presence was compensation enough for his pains for an hour he stood motionless staring at the upper windows of no then his feet began to hurt and he paraded slowly back and forth playing the bear as he had heard it termed another hour passed and he discovered that if his presence had not been marked by the members of the torres household it was at least exciting comment elsewhere in the neighborhood faces appeared at nearby windows he heard sounds of muffled merriment which made him uncomfortable passersby smiled at him and dropped encouraging remarks which he could not translate the little policeman lounging at the next corner watched him complacently and agreed with his neighbors that the americano was undoubtedly a fineappearing lover kirk took his stand at last beneath a street light and gazed languorously upon the windows opposite until his eyes ached as well as his feet at last a curtain parted and he saw the flash of a white dress back of it his heart leaped he raised his hat there was a titter from beyond the iron grating presently another figure was dimly revealed the watcher held his position stubbornly until the last light in the torres house winked out then limped homeward warmed by the glad conviction that at least he had been recognized promptly at seven oclock on the following evening he returned to his post and before he had been there five minutes knew that his presence was noticed this was encouraging so he focused his mental powers in an effort to communicate telepathically with the object of his desires but she seemed unattuned and coyly refrained from showing her face he undertook to loiter gracefully knowing himself to be the target of many eyes but found it extremely hard to refrain from sitting on the curb a manifestly unromantic attitude for a lovelorn swain he swore grimly that if usage required a suitor to make an exhibition of himself before the entire neighborhood he would do the job thoroughly it did not cheer him to reflect that the girl had a keen sense of humor and must be laughing at him yet he determined to put in a week at this idiotic lovemaking before he attempted anything else later in the evening he was rewarded by the glimpse of a handkerchief cautiously waved and he was delirious with joy as he hobbled homeward night after night he spent assiduously studying the cracks and blemishes in the stucco walls of no avenida norte encouraged by the occasional flutter of a hand or a soulful sigh from behind the lace screen at the third window from the corner but when sunday came he was in no mood to continue this roundabout and embarrassing mode of courtship longer he made an early start from his quarters taking allan with him ill catch her going to mass he explained hopefully ive just got to put an end to this performance will you haccost her hopenly inquired allan you bet if she runs away you trip her up oh its great to be in love without doubt sar shes a corker isnt she i do not know as to that allan demurred what may be a carker i mean shes beautiful oh hindeed so and her heyes like hink spots as you say was she wearing a denim dress when you saw her yes yes eagerly agreed the negro oh there is no mistake it was a red dress no it wasnt it was blue hexactly sar a sort of reddish blue and she was petite rather more dark i should say i mean she was small oh it is the same female it is hexciting is it not kirk acknowledged that it was exciting for now that he had a full day in which to besiege no he felt certain of gaining a word at least with his inamorata he was in good time it seemed for hardly had he taken his customary station before the cathedral bells awoke the slumberous echoes of the city praise god she will be coming soon allan exclaimed i shall hexpire from fright look there there down the wide stairs leading from the livingrooms of senor torres came two women and the negro danced in excitement as they emerged upon the sidewalk the younger one flashed a glance at the men opposite and kirk saw that she was a mulatto evidently a housemaid his eager eyes flew back to the entrance allan hissed at him yonder goes quick or you will be losing she where there the young female in wite it is hindeed the senorita torres that anthony stared at the girl amazedly as she cast him a second and more coquettish flash of her black eyes why damn it that why shes a nigger no no shrilly expostulated the jamaican it is she halas they have turned the corner kirk wheeled upon his detective in overwhelming disgust you idiot he breathed that girl is a dinge so shes the one ive been oh its unspeakable lets get away from here you hinformed me in particular that she is dark protested allan come on kirk dragged his companion away as fast as he could his thoughts were too deep for tears as soon as his emotion permitted coherent speech he launched into a tirade so eloquent and picturesque that allan was reduced to a state of wondering awe pausing at length in his harangue he turned smouldering eyes upon the black boy i ought to punch you right in the nose he said with mournful calmness let me feel your head allan obediently doffed his cap and kirk rapped the woolly cranium with his knuckle do you feel that is there any sensation yes sar shortly i shall suffer a swelling allan stroked the spot tenderly its all imagination theres no feeling to solid bone youve got an ivory nut my friend just like a cane ivorynuts grow upon trees sar in the darien region anthony regarded him sourly the brunswickbalke people never turned out anything half so round and half so hard that burr of yours is a curio i told you chiquita was small and beautiful and dainty and oh whats the use this dame is a truckhorse shes the color of a saddle oh she is not too dark sar allan came loyally to the defence of miss torres some of the finest people in panama is blacker than that there is but few who are hall wite well shes all white and i want you to find her today today understand you gallop out to the savannas and make some inquiries he shook his fist in allans face if you dont learn something this trip ill have your lignumvitae cranium in a bowlingalley by dark lord if i only spoke spanish allan reluctantly departed and kirk went back to his quarters in high displeasure it seemed as if the affair had actually left a bad taste in his mouth he could not compose his features into anything like a decently amiable expression but went about with a bitter smile upon his lips every time some new aspect of his grotesque and humiliating mistake occurred to him he suffered a nervous twinge that afternoon a card was brought to him bearing the ornate inscription in a beautiful spencerian hand professor jesus herara the herara college of business reconciling himself as best he could to the prospect of an interview with some importunate stranger he grudgingly consented to have the visitor brought in professor herara was not alone he was accompanied by a very short very fat man whose smooth skin had the rich dark coloring of a nice oily cuban cigar senor anthony it is inquired the professor bowing ceremoniously thats my name it is my privilege to consult you upon a business of importance im afraid you have the wrong party i dont care to learn shorthand ah no it is not concerning my academy allow me to present senor luis torres kirk felt the room begin to revolve slowly my friend does not possess a card at the moment eh continued the professor the little rotund man bowed his handpolished mahogany features widening in a smile sveree hot wedder he exclaimed he begs one thousand pardons for not speaking of your language the more perfectly and so he is request of me to be his interpreter something urged kirk to flee while there was yet time but the father of maria torres was between him and the door and he could not bring himself to push the little man out of the way so he bade them both be seated in the only two chairs which the room contained while he rested gingerly upon the edge of the bed the newcomers let their eyes roll curiously about the chamber and an embarrassing silence descended senor torres maintained a set smile designed to be agreeable professor herara serene in the possession of his linguistic acquirements displayed the insouciance of an undertaker together they beamed benignantly almost patronizingly upon the young man plainly they meant to put him at his ease but they failed at length after clearing his throat impressively the interpreter began again of course you have been expecting this visit senor n not exactly my friend is deeply disappointed that he has not the honor of before meeting you i am flattered but indeed yes then you are perhaps acquainted with senor torres by reputation you know who he is professor jesus herara raised his brows and inclined his head like a polite schoolteacher endeavoring to encourage a diffident pupil i regret that i do not he is one of our most estimable citizens he is possess not only of the magnificent residence at no avenida norte but also of a comfortable abode at las savannas and he has a large trade in sponges and hides his place of business you will have noticed upon the waterfront perhaps kirk wiped his brow nervously and cursed allan and now as for you senor the principal of the herara college of business awaited an answer with unctuous deference evidently attributing the young mans silence to modesty he went on helpfully senor torres has instituted inquiries and ascertained your excellent position with the p r r but he would know more if soch is not disagreeable to you well i there isnt much to tell it is my first job this was quickly put into spanish whereupon mr torres nodded with vigor as if this information were indeed gratifying nay splendid it is agreeable to my friend to ascertain your industry and i may say you are most highly spoke of at the railroad office therefore senor torres affords you an invitation to call at his residence on thursday evening thats awfully nice gasped anthony but er whats the idea ah the interpreter beamed mr torres beamed they combined to radiate a gentle effulgence which was most disquieting it is indeed pleasing to encounter a gentleman so truly modest so possessed of delicacy but i may say that senor torres is look with favor upon your suit of course he checked kirks hasty words it is not completely settle by no means the young lady is but partly won however he winked one black eye reassuringly as friend of the family i bid you not to permit discouragement and despair anthony broke out in desperation hold on let me explain theres been an awful mistake mistake the tone was blandly incredulous yes im not in love with miss torres professor jesus herara stared at the speaker as if his mastery of the english language was after all incomplete torres seeing that he was missing something interpolated a smiling inquiry then as his interpreter made the situation clear his honeyed smile froze his sparkling eyes opened in bewilderment he stared about the room again as if doubting that he had come to the right place theres really a mistake kirk persisted i dont even know miss torres ah now i understand the professor was intensely relieved it is precisely for that purpose we arrived bueno you admire from a distance is it not so you are struck with the ladys beauty your heart is awakened you are miserable you pine away you cannot find courage to speak it is admirable senor we understand fully and i who know assure you of her many virtues no its nothing like that either i have no doubt miss torres is altogether charming but i theres just a mistake thats all im not the least bit in love with her but senor is it not you who have stood beneath her window nightly is it not you who have laid siege to her these many days the speakers eyes were glowing with anger as he turned to make his inquiry clear to the young ladys father mr torres began to swell ominously if youll just let me explain im in love with a young woman true enough but it doesnt happen to be miss torres i thought it was but it isnt there was another vibrant exchange of words between the spaniards you were making sport then of my friend no no its another person altogether who i dont know her name what herara was about to burst forth when his friend nudged him and he was obliged to put this amazing declaration into spanish senor torres breathed heavily and exploded an oath i met her in the country and made a mistake in the town houses kirk floundered on i never knew till this morning that i was on the wrong trail it is all my fault i thought the ladys name was torres eh so you love one whom you do not know incredible it does sound a little fishy and it is a grave affront to my friend how will the senorita understand she in whose breast is awakened already an answering thrills im mighty sorry if you wish ill apologize in person to miss torres at this herara cried out in horror then after a brief colloquy with the father he rose stiffly saying i offer no words from my friend for the present he does not believe nor do i inquiries will be institute of that be assured if you have deceived if your intentions were not of the most honorable the head of the herara business college glared in a horrible manner you will have occasion to regret those foolish jokes kirk tried to explain that his present regrets were ample for all time but bowing formally the visitors withdrew leaving him to revile anew the name of allan allan when the black boy returned footsore but cheerful his appearance was the signal for an outburst that left him disconsolate and bewildered he apologized over and over for his little error and tried to reinstate himself by announcing with a confidence he was far from feeling that this time he had identified the elusive chiquita beyond the peradventure of a doubt this welcome intelligence did much to make kirk forget his wrath whats her name he inquired eagerly fermina sar are you sure hentirely but it will not havail to be courting of those ladies master hauntony is there more than one two of they sisters very rich they hoccupy the ouse hadjoining senor torres allan spoke in a hushed voice and shook his head as if to show the hopelessness of aspiring to such aristocracy surely kirk knew of the ferminas arcadio fermina was the owner of the pearlfishery concession and a person of the highest social distinction he was white all white there was no doubt on that score undoubtedly chiquita would prove to be his daughter and a joint heiress to his fabulous fortune but she was not the sort to be courted from the street even allan knew that much for after all such a procedure was followed only by the middle classes and in this instance would result in nothing less than disaster it sounded reasonable and kirk allowed himself to be half convinced it was no later than the following day however that runnels pointed out two young ladies who were driving past and informed him that they were the misses fermina their old man has made a fortune out of the pearl islands he remarked they say those girls have the finest collection of pearls in central america kirk gazed after them eagerly but it took no more than a glance to show him that they were not even distantly related to the object of his search once more he set allan upon the trail with instructions to find out who lived in the large house upon the hill the one with the driveway of royal palms and not to return without the information but by now the jamaican was beginning to weary of this running back and forth and to consider the quest a vain imagining so being wishful to dream another lottery number he brought back with him a fanciful tale designed to quiet his employer and to assure himself ample leisure in the future master hauntony your female is gone he informed him sadly gone where somewhere on a ship are you sure there is no doubt sar her name is garavel and she hoccupies the big ouse on the ill i discovered those himpartant facts from the bajan ooman stephanie you saw her by jove then you are right this time quick tell me all you learned allan lied fluently elaborately and finding his hero plunged into despair resigned himself gratefully to another period of blissful idleness this was much the simplest way he decided for even should kirk meet a garavel or a fermina there was no chance of his winning her and love after all is but a passing impulse which may be summoned or banished at will by such simple mediums as charms the boy did go out of his way to ease his benefactors malady by taking a lock of his own fuzzy wool and placing it beneath kirks mattress after certain exorcisms there followed a period of blank dejection kirks first disappointment when the girl had failed to keep her tryst was as nothing compared to this for now he felt that she was unattainable he did not quite give up hope so many strange experiences had befallen him since his involuntary departure from new york that it all seemed like a dream in which anything is possible but he was deep in the doldrums when with magic suddenness the scene changed and his long discouragement came to an end xix la tosca the winter season was at its height now for weeks there had been no rain and the pacific side of the isthmus was growing sere and yellow beneath the ceaseless glare of the sun the musty dampness of the rainy season had disappeared the steady tradewinds breathed a dreamy languor and the days fled past in one long unending procession of brilliant sameness every ship from the north came laden with tourists and the social life of the city grew brilliant and gay there were receptions dinners dances the plazas echoed to the strains of music almost nightly now that nature smiled the work upon the canal went forward with evergrowing eagerness records were broken in every department the railroad groaned beneath its burden the giant human machine was strained to its fullest efficiency young anthony mastered the details of his work very rapidly for railroading had been bred into him he needed little help from runnels and soon began to feel a conscious grasp of affairs as surprising to himself as to his chief being intensely interested in his work he avoided all social entanglements despite repeated invitations from mrs cortlandt but when the grandopera season began he made an exception and joined her boxparty on the opening night it seemed quite like old times to don an evening suit the stiff white linen awakened a pang of regret the time was not far distant when he had felt never so much at home as in these togs but now they were hot and uncomfortable and how they accentuated his coat of tan there was a somewhat formal dinner in the cortlandts new home at which there were a dozen guests so kirk had no opportunity of speaking with his hostess until they had reached the theatre where he found himself seated immediately behind her ive scarcely seen you lately she said at the first opportunity youre a very neglectful young man i knew you were getting settled in your house and weve been tremendously busy at the office i began to think you were avoiding us you must know better than that she regarded him shrewdly over her shoulder youre not still thinking of that night at taboga you havent seemed the same since he blushed and nodded frankly i cant help thinking about it you were mighty nice to overlook a break like that but unconsciously his eyes shifted to cortlandt who was conversing politely with a giggly old lady from gatun she tapped his cheek lightly with her fan just to show you how forgiving i am i am going to ask you to go riding with me the late afternoons are lovely now and ive found a good horse for you i suppose you ride i love it wednesday at five then she turned to another guest and kirk leaned back to take in the scene about him like most latinamerican cities panama prides herself upon her government theatre which is in truth very beautiful although it remains dark most of the year its brief period of opera is celebrated by a notable outpouring tonight the magnificent whiteandgold auditorium was filled to the topmost gallery and the two circles of boxes were crowded with the flower of panamanian society tourists from the north and americans from the whole length of the canal zone kirk himself had seen to running a theatre special from colon and recognized all six of the commissioners with their families it was an exceedingly welldressed audience and although the pit was plentifully sprinkled with men in white the two lower galleries were in solid fulldress bejewelled women in elaborate gowns lent the affair almost the elegance of a night at the metropolitan while the flash of many uniforms made the scene colorful suddenly the orchestra broke into the national air and with a great rustling and turning of heads the audience rose to its feet in the centre box of the first tier ornately hung with flags and a coat of arms anthony beheld a giant black man of majestic appearance drawn to his full height and flanked by a halfdozen aides in uniform all at a stiff military salute that is president galleo edith told him jove hes a regallooking chap kirk exclaimed hes very much of a man too yet even here there is a color line nobody acknowledges it but the old castilian families are keenly aware of it just the same as the last measured strain died out the audience reseated itself the introduction to la tosca sounded and the curtain rose although the names of the performers were unknown to kirk their voices were remarkably good and he soon became absorbed in the drama a sudden lonesomeness surged over him as he recalled another night when he and darwin k anthony had heard these same notes sung but then they had sat enthralled by the art of caruso scotti and the ravishing cavalieri it had been one of the rare hours when he and his father had felt themselves really in sympathy the governor had come down for some fabulous directors meeting he remembered and had wired his son to run in from new haven for the evening they had been real chums that night and even at their modest little supper afterward when the old gentleman had rowed with the waiter and cursed his dyspepsia they had laughed and chatted like cronies yet a week later they had quarrelled with an unexpected access of tenderness anthony jr longed to see once more that tumbled shock of white hair that stronglined face to hear again the gruff tones of that voice he loved so well after all there were only two anthonys left in the world and he had been to blame he acknowledged that he had been a neerdowell no wonder his father had been harsh but still old darwin k should not have been so domineering so ready to credit all he heard kirk pressed his lips together and swore to make good if for no other reason than to show his dad as the curtain fell on the first act he rose with the others and accompanied by mrs cortlandt made his way down the long passageway and out into a brightly lighted highly decorated foyer filling now with voluble people it was a splendid room but he had no eyes for it his gaze was fixed upon the welcome openair promenade outside and his fingers fumbled with his cigarettecase oh wait please he heard edith say i want you to meet some one he had done little except respond to meaningless introductions all the evening and nothing could have pleased him less at the moment but somewhat awkwardly he began to edge his way through the press in the wake of his hostess the next moment he halted and stood stockstill in helpless surprise there not a yard away was the girl of his dreams demurely bowing to edith cortlandt her hand upon the arm of a swarthy man whom kirk knew at once as her father he felt the blood rush blindingly to his head felt it drumming at his ears knew that he must be staring like a man bereft mrs cortlandt was speaking and he caught the name garavel like a buglecall they turned upon him the spanish gentleman bowed and he saw that chiquitas little whitegloved hand was extended toward him she was the same dainty desirous maid he had met in the forest but now splendidly radiant and perfect beyond his imagining she was no longer the simple woodsprite but a tiny princess in filmy white moulded by some master craftsman as on that earlier meeting she was thrilling with some subtle mirth which flickered on her lips or danced in the depths of her great dark eyes how he ever got through that wild introductory moment without making a show of himself anthony never knew for his first overwhelming impulse was to seize the girl and never let her escape it was the same feeling he had had at las savannas only ten times harder to resist the general confusion perhaps helped to hide his emotion for around them eddied a constant human tide through which at last came mr cortlandt and the other members of his party there were more introductions more bows and polite exchanges of words which had the maddening effect of distracting miss garavels attention then by some glorious miracle kirk found himself moving toward the open air at her side with mrs cortlandt and the banker in advance of them oh chiquita he said softly i thought id never find you ive hunted everywhere at the tremulous intensity of his tone she gave an uncertain laugh and flashed him a startled glance chiquita is not my name she said reprovingly yes it is it must be i cant think of you by any other hasnt it been whispering at my ears ever since you said it it has nearly driven me mad senor antonio i have seen you but once i have seen you every day every hour indeed i cant see anything else dont you understand you forget that we have but just been introduced dont be offended you see i cant realize that i have found you at last when i learned you had gone away i thought i would surely i have been nowhere didnt you go away on a ship that is absurd i have remained always in my fathers house then wait until i catch that boy of mine didnt you know i was looking for you couldnt you feel it indeed why should i imagine such things why if you couldnt feel a thing like that you cant love me of a certainly not she gasped you should not joke about such things im not joking i never was so serious in my life iim afraid i cant tell you everythingit all wants to come out at once why didnt you come back as you promised it was stephanieshe is such a ferocious person i was brought to the city that daybut no senor i did not promise i said only perhaps have you done your penance it was finished yesterday this is the first time i have been out oh it is delightful the musicthe people and i can come to see you now very well do you know that you cannot have you not learned our customs then with an abrupt and icy change of tone i forget of course you are familiar with those customs since you have become the wooer of miss torres oh lord where did you hear about that so it is true you are fickle senoror is it that you prefer dark people i was looking for you i thought it was you behind those curtains all the time he began a flurried defence of his recent outrageous behavior to which miss garavel endeavored to listen with distant composure but he was so desperately in earnest so anxious to make light of the matter so eager to expose all his folly and have done with it that he must have been funnier than he knew in the midst of his narrative the girls eyes showed an encouraging gleam and when he described his interview with torres and heran their surprise and dramatic indignation she laughed merrily oh it wasnt funny at the time he hastened to add i felt as though i had actually proposed and might have to pay alimony poor maria it is no light thing to be cast aside by ones lover she is brokenhearted and for six months she will do penance this penance thing is a habit with you girls but i wasnt her lover im yours do not be foolish she exclaimed sharply or i shall be forced to walk with my father dont do that cant you see we must make haste while the curtain is down i do not see i am strolling in search of the cool air she bowed and smiled at some passing friends she seemed very careless very flippant she was not at all the impetuous mischievous chiquita he had met in the woods see here he said soberly we cant go on this way now that ive met your father im going to explain my intentions to him and ask his permission to call on you we have a proverb senor ir por lana y volver trasquilado which means take heed lest you find what you do not seek do not be impetuous theres only one thing im seeking my father is a stern man in his home he is entirely a spaniard and if he learned how we met for instanceeven under the electric light he saw her flushhe would create a terrible scene she paused in her walk and leaned over the stone balustrade staring out across the inkblack harbor trust me i shant tell him there are so many reasons why it is useless name one one she shrugged lightly in the first place i care nothing for you is not that enough no indeed youll get over that let us imagine then the contrary you americans are entirely different from our people you are cold deliberate wickedyour social customs are not like ours you do not at all understand us how then could you be interested to meet a spanish family why youre half american oh yes although it is to be regretted even at school in your baltimore i learned many improper things against which i have had to struggle ever since for instance ah she sighed i saw so much liberty i heard of the shocking conduct of your american ladies and while i know it is quite wrong and wicked stillit is interesting why there is no other nice girl in all panama who would have talked with you as i did in the forest that day but what has all this to do with my coming to see you it is difficult to explain since you will not understand when a young man is accepted into a spanish house many things are taken for granted besides that we do not know each other you and i also if you should come to see me it would cause gossip misunderstanding among my friends ill declare myself in advance he promised warmly no no no we spanishamericans do not care for strangers we have our own people and we are satisfied you yankees are not very nice you are barbarous you assume such liberties our young men are gentle modest sweet umm i hadnt noticed it this is the first time i have ever talked so freely with a gentleman and i suppose it is immodest after all it is much better that old people who are of more experience should discuss these questions but dont you want to have a voice in your own affairs he eagerly urged do you really want your relatives to tell you whom to meet whom to love and whom to marry she answered frankly sometimes i feel that way yet at other times i am sure they must know best i dont believe you are the sort to shut your eyes and do exactly as youre told i do rebel sometimes i protest but it is only the american blood in me if youd learn to know me a little bit maybe youd enjoy having me around the house but i cannot know you any more than you can know me she cried with a little gesture of despair at his dullness dont you see before we could get acquainted nicely people would be talking lets try youre living at the country place again arent you suppose i should get lost some day tomorrow for instance no no listen it is the warning bell and we must return the crowd was filing into the theatre now they fell in behind senor garavel and mrs cortlandt im going hunting again tomorrow prophesied kirk and im almost certain to lose my wayabout three oclock you should take with you a guide thats not a bad idea id like to talk it over with you suppose we have another stroll after the next act i shall be with my father never before have i enjoyed so much liberty she sighed gratefully oh i detest your blamed straitlaced spanish customs he cried hotly what do they amount to anyhow i love you i do i do she laughed and darted to her fathers side dont you think miss garavel is a pretty girl mrs cortlandt questioned as they strolled toward their box shes a dream anthonys tone left nothing unsaid you got along together capitally most of the senoritas are impossible by the way what is her name gertrudis rather pleasing i think kirk thought so too in fact it pleased him so greatly that he thought of nothing else during the entire second act of la tosca it was even sweeter than the music of her hesitating accent when after an age the curtain fell for a second time he escaped from his companions mumbling some excuse or other and made haste to find her again but as he approached he felt a sudden pang of jealous rage ramon alfarez was beside her and the two were chatting with an appearance of intimacy that made him furious close at hand stood garavel deep in conversation with colonel jolson ah ramon i wish you to meet mr anthony said gertrudis so you have met before in colon kirk explained while alfarez scorched him with his eyes mr alfarez was very hospitable to me yes the spaniard exclaimed it is my great regret that senor antony did not remain for longer ramon is with the presidents party this evening he is senor galleos secretary you know i informed you concerning those good fortunes some time since eh ramons insulting stare made kirk long to take him by the throat yes you told me i suppose it is a fine position alfarez swelled pompously i ave many responsibilities it brings you very close to the chief executive no doubt i ave indeed the honor to be his intimate hes the tallest negro i ever saw kirk said simply at which the haughty ramon seemed about to explode and miss garavel quite shamelessly giggled that is funny she exclaimed but you must not tease ramon you understand the voice of the people has made galleo president but no one forgets that he is not one of us her youthful countryman twisted his mustache with trembling fingers it is politics he declared and yet galleo is a great man i am honor to be his secretary but by the grace of god our next president will be wite ramons father don anibal you know gertrudis nodded wisely at the american we are very proud of ramon he is so young to be high in politics eh yes and many of our bravest patriots ave been black men oh weve had some brave negroes too kirk acknowledged so you see alfarez was triumphant the greatest fighter we ever had was a colored chap ah his name was gansjoe gans you are still joking said miss garavel in baltimore i read the newspapers about that gans he was aboxfighter what exactly but he never carried a secretary alfarezs countenance was sallow as he inquired does senor antony discover our climate to be still agreeable very it hasnt grown too warm for me yet we are but approaching our ot season the speakers eyes snapped oh ill stand the heat all right and the mosquitoes too eh do not be too sure the mosquito makes a leetle buzzingbut it is well to take warning if not behol some day you grow ver seeck heretofore kirk had hated ramon in a careless indifferent sort of way feeling that he owed him a good drubbing which he would be pleased to administer if ever a fitting time arrived but now since he saw that the jackanapes had the audacity to love gertrudis his feeling became intense the girl of course was fully alive to the situation and although she evidently enjoyed it she did her best to stand between the two men as for alfarez he was quick to feel the sudden fierce hostility he had aroused and it seemed to make him nervous moreover he conceived that he had scored heavily by his last retort at which kirk had only smiled it therefore seemed best to him to withdraw from the conversation annoyingly conducted in english and a few moments later he stalked majestically away this was just what kirk wanted and he quickly suggested the balcony but gertrudis was obstinate i must remain with my father she said may i sit beside you then ive been thinking of a lot of things to say i always think of bully remarks when its too late now ive forgotten them do you know im going to nestle up to your father and make him like me again you are speaking of that subject i have known you but an hour and you talk of nothing but my father of me of coming to call well i cant think of anything else you are too bold spanish fathers do not like such young men but to hear me talk she flushed slightly i have lost all modesty to speak of those things you force me to embarrass myself i was an instantaneous success with miss torres father he was ready to send a dray for my trunks let us discuss other things i havent the strength you once spoke of a chap your people had picked out it isntalfarez she let her dark eyes rest upon his a moment and his senses swam then she nodded slowly you do not like him just like a nosebleed the day you and i are married im going to send him a wreath of poison ivy it pleases you always to joke no joke about that you wont give in will you there is no question of force nor of surrender senor i insist now that we shall speak of other things a few moments later he was constrained to rejoin his hostess party when are you going back to las savannas he asked as he reluctantly arose tomorrow the hunting ought to be good but she frowned at him in annoyance and he left her after all without knowing whether he had gained or lost ground of one thing only he was suretheir meeting had been in some respects a disappointment she was not by any means so warm and impulsive as he had supposed her girlishness her simplicity her little american ways cloaked a deep reserve and a fine sense of the difference in their positions she could be spanish enough when she chose he perceived and he felt as he was intended to feel that the little lady of quality he had met tonight would be much harder to win than the girl of the woods the plague of it was that if anything he was more in love with the definite and dazzling gertrudis garavel than he had been with the mysteriously alluring chiquita if only she were all american or even all spanish perhaps he would know better how to act but unfortunately she was bothjust enough of both to be perplexing and wholly unreliable and then too there was alfarez xx an awakening he was in no more satisfactory frame of mind when on the next afternoon he shouldered his gun and set out for the country he went directly to the fairy pool and waited there in a very fever of anxiety despite the coolness and peace of the place he felt his pulses throb and his face burn if she came it would mean everything to him if she stayed awaywhy then he would have to believe that after all the real gertrudis garavel had spoken last night at the opera and that the sprightly mirthful little maid who had bewitched him on their first meeting no longer existed an odd bashfulness overtook him it did not seem to him that it could possibly have been he who had talked to her so boldly only the evening before at the thought of his temerity he felt almost inclined to flee yet he would not have deserted his post for worlds the sound of a voice shot through his troubled thoughts like a beam of sunlight through a dark room oh senor antonio how you startled me instantly his selfpossession came back he felt relieved and gay goodafternoon queen he rose and bowed politely i thought i saw one underneath the waterfall just now who would have expected you to be here she cried with an extreme and obviously counterfeit amazement that filled him with delight im lost he declared then after one look into her eyes he added absolutely utterly irretrievably lost it is very fortunate that i chanced to be passing for this is a lonely spot nobody ever comes here well i hardly ever lose myself in busy places wont you sit down since we have met quite by accident perhaps it would not be so very improper she laughed mischievously you know ive been lost now for several months its a delightful feelingyou ought to try it she settled uncertainly beside him like a butterfly just alighting ready to take flight again on the instant perhaps i can help you to find your way senor she said with ingenuous politeness you are the only one who can miss garavel i dont know that i ever told you but im in love indeed i am the most miserably happy person in the world for i have just this moment begun to believe that the young lady likes me a little bit oh but i forgot the real reason why i came i have something i must tell you all right but honestly now didnt you want to come she turned upon him in a little burst of passion yes she cried of course i did i wished to come madly senor there is no use to lie but wait it is wholly because i am awhat you call fleerta very sad fleert no one could possibly describe the quaint pronunciation she gave the word it makes my heart patter like that she made her little fingers patterto be wooed even by a yankee but i do not love you in the least oh no even if i wished to do so there are too many reasons why i could not and when i explain you will understand i know its ramon alfarez youre halfway engaged to him but you know you dont love him ah it is not too sure he is of fine family he is rich he is handsomenot possibly could i care for any man who was not all of those all my life i have thought him a very sweet gentleman and for a long time it has been agreed that i should be his wife even all the young ladies are furious at me which is very nice alsoso it is only because i am disobedient that i rebelled but i was punished for my evil disposition she sighed mournfully and now it is all arranged once more is it really signed sealed stamped and delivered in the presence of no no but arco siemprc armado of course is that a prescription a bow long bent grows weak and there are so many reasons why i should say yes you havent mentioned any that would be binding in law my fathers wish is not that sufficient you disregarded that once that was but a flutter all the time i knew i should be ramons wife when the time arrived but it made him so unhappy that i was quite pleased only for those ugly blue dresses i would have greatly enjoyed my penance perhaps i could refuse to wed a man my father chose for me but no nice spanish girl would dare to wed a man her father did not like do you see but its no cinch your father wont positively hunger for me once we get chummy and i for ramon how sad that would be eh really now couldnt you bring yourself to marry a chap who wasnt aristocratic rich and handsome you know thats a tough combination most aristocratic people are poor and the rich ones have dyspepsia oh no i am quite certain suppose i should show you a family tree that you couldnt throw a stone over it would not do at all i am so extravagant i fully intend to be rich some time but you are not handsome senor her eyes travelled over him with a mischievous twinkle you are too beeg im very durable id last a long time she shook her dark head decisively and he saw the lights that rippled in her profuse crown of hair you are too different you disregard our customs you are bold you continue to come here against my wishes which no spanish gentleman would dare to do oh im no spanish gentleman im just an emotional blond but im bound to marry you if one of my countrymen found me so indiscreet as to talk with him alone like this he would go away and never come back i am amazed at you senor have you no pride not a bit and now that i have met all your objections lets arrange the details shall it be a church wedding she laughed deliciously what a nice game it is we have played but now i must talk seriously you witch he breathed do you think i could ever give you up she checked him gravely truly it was just a gameand yet it was not altogether so either but here is what i came to say the strangest thing has happenednot until last night after the opera did i even dream of it andeven now i cannot believe oh i am so proud more bad news for me i suppose yes but such good news for me that i am sure you will be glad timidly he reached out and touched a fold of her white dress she seemed to be slipping from him coming home from the theatre my father told meoh the most wonderful thing he saidbut how shall i speak of such a secret evidently you dont intend to i promised very faithfully not to tell sohe is to be the next president of panama pres anthony stared at her in frank amazement why i thought old man alfarez it seems your country does not like him because he hates americanssee this is the work of that mr cortlandt think is it not wonderful now that you know the truth you must see at once that by no means could i marry to a person like you why not ohe dont you understand i shall be the finest lady in the republic all men will adore me i will have suitorsnot one or two as now but many i will bethe beautiful senorita garavel for all the great people are beautiful i shall be proud also and i shall not even speak to yankees any more my father will be the most famous man of all the republicperhaps in the whole world i dont know i dont think it will make any difference with him when he knows who i am then you also are a great man eh she hitched herself about to face him more squarely that is truly interesting he would scarcely wish a railroad conductor to address the daughter of president garavel oh ive been promoted since i was out here last anyhow i guess my dad is pretty nearly as good as anybody in panama he is then of blue blood no red oh but a gentleman he is now he used to be a brakeman you appear to beproud of such a thing how strange my fathers blood runs back to the conquistadors even in the earliest books one finds garavels they were conquerors they ruled this country and all these people thats something to be proud of but it isnt everything highbred horses run well but they cant pull its the old farm nag that delivers the merchandise but ill tackle your father and ill promise to vote for him you are very fonny she gazed at him seriously one tiny foot curled under her her chin nestling into her palm do you love me not one single speck i merely like you to make love at me and cause my heart to jomp but that is not fair to you is itsince you can have no hope the little hypocrite continued to voice words of warning and denial though her eyes invited him and for a long time they continued this delightful play of pleading and evasion but at last chiquita jumped up with a great appearance of alarm heavens the time she cried i have stayed too long by much stephanie will miss me he rose and stretched out his hand as if to hold her shall i come again tomorrow she grew suddenly earnest no no senor that is something you should not ask if ever we are to meet again it must be with my fathers consent please do not urge for truly i would have to refuse she let her palm rest in his an instant and her cheek went scarlet as he pressed it to his lips then she said go mr brazen one how greatly it surprised me to find you here i cannot say it gave me such a start and senor antonio my father may be found any day at his bank before he could detain her she was gone flitting up the path with just one flashing smile of mischief over her shoulder anthony went home with his head in the clouds all his doubts were now at rest for while chiquita had stubbornly denied him all encouragement he felt sure that her heart had answered it was in the highest spirits therefore that he opened a letter he found awaiting him and read as follows dear kirk i hope you are heartily sick of yourself and ready to do something decent for a change knowing your aristocratic habits as i do i realize you must owe a lot of money by this time and your new friends must be getting tired of you i have been expecting you to draw on me daily and am taking this occasion to warn you in your own expensively acquired college english that there is nothing doing except upon one condition if you will agree to behave yourself in future i will pay your debts send you west and give you a job as operator at forty dollars a month but you will go where i send you and you will stay where you are put i will do the thinking for both of us and judge of your associates maybe if you prove to be any good at all i will arrange with the police to let you spend your vacations in that dear new york which still shows signs of your red paint brush i would be pleased to have an apology by return mail so that i may meet you in new orleans and start you off once more on the road to decency and selfrespect you will never be a success at anything but i am always ready to do my duty this is my last offer and if you refuse you may distinctly and definitely go to the devil as ever your loving father darwin k anthony ps i can get good operators for thirty dollars a month the extra ten dollars is pure sentiment kirk had known in advance just about what the letter contained and now laughed aloud it was so like the old gentleman why he could almost hear him dictating it spurred by his present exhilaration he wrote an answer which he read with a good deal of satisfaction before sealing it up dear dadyour affectionate letter with the kind offer to take charge of a siding out in the dakotas is at hand i would like to help you along with your business but upward and onward is my motto and youll have to raise that salary a bit i am drawing two hundred and twentyfive dollars a month at present quarters furnished and promotion promised i have made some good investments and there are no debts to settle enclosed find my last bank statement which will doubtless prove a great disappointment to you if you need a good master of transportation i would be pleased to consider an offer at any time provided the salary is satisfactory but your proposal to edit my acquaintances is out of the question my decency and self respect are doing well thank you and i like the climate outside my window a mockingbird sings nightly and i have a tame rabbit with ears like a squirrel and babyblue eyes also a jamaican negro boy who i fear could not stand our harsh northern winters the salary would have to be about six thousand a year as always your devoted and obedient son kirk ps i would not care to locate farther west than buffalo my wife might not like it if he survives the first part that tag line will put him down for the count mused the writer with a grin and yet something tells me he will not embrace my offer ah well promotion is slow he whistled blithely as he sent allan off to the postoffice kirk lost no time in calling at the bank but was disappointed to learn that senor andres garavel had left the city for an unexpected business tour of the provinces and would not return for at least two weeks at first he was inclined to doubt the truth of this statement but a casual inquiry from mrs cortlandt confirmed it and cursing his luck he sought distraction where he could most easily find it in the days that followed he saw nothing of gertrudis but a good deal of edith cortlandt she had redeemed her promise of getting him a good horsesomething rare in this countryand he was grateful for the exercise which came as a welcome relief from his indoor toil they rode almost daily he dined at her house and once again made one of her party at the opera soon their old friendly intercourse was going on as if it had never been interrupted as for edith this unsatisfying semipublic intimacy came to be quite as much a pain as a pleasure to her during these past few weeks she had been plunged in a mental turmoil the signs of which she had concealed with difficulty she had fought with herself she had tried to reason she had marshalled her pride but all in vain at last she awoke to the terrifying certainty that she was in love it had all begun with that moment of impulsive surrender at taboga the night following had been terrible to her in its dark hours she had seen her soul for the first time and the glimpse she got frightened her following this she became furious with herself then resentful toward anthony next she grew desperate and reckless she began to look upon her husband with a quickened curiosity and found him a stranger for years she had made allowance for his weaknesses ignoring them as she ignored his virtues but never before had he appeared so colorless so insignificant above all so alien she had barely tolerated him hitherto but now she began to despise him if cortlandt was aware of her change of feeling and its cause his method of dealing with her showed some keenness silent contempt was what she could least endure from him of all men yet this was just what his manner toward her expressedif it expressed anything beyond those words as they were leaving the island he had said nothing had never referred to the incident had not so much as mentioned anthonys name unless forced to do so and this offended her unreasonably she caught him regarding her strangely at times with a curious faltering expression but he was so icy in his reserve he yielded so easily to her predominance that she could divine nothing and turned the more fiercely to her inward struggle even if he did suspect what then it was no affair of his she was her own mistress she had given him all he possessed she had made a man of him he was her creature and had no rights beyond what she chose to give they saw less and less of each other he became more formal more respectfully unhusbandlike he spent few daylight hours in the house coming and going as he pleased frequenting the few clubs of the city or riding alone on more than one occasion he met her and anthony on their horses only before others or at their frequent political councils were they quite the same as they had been of anthony on the other hand she arranged to see more than ever flattering him by a new deference in her manner making him feel always at ease with her watching him vainly for the least sign of awakening desire in their frequent rides they covered most of the roads about the city even to the ruins of old panama then they began to explore the bypaths and trails one afternoon they turned into an unfrequented road that led off to the jungle from the main highway walking their horses while they marvelled at the beauty of the foliage the trail they knew led to a coffee plantation far up among the hills but it was so little travelled that the verdure brushed them as they went and in many places they passed beneath a roof of branches before they had penetrated a quarter of a mile they were in the midst of an unbroken solitude shut off from the world by a riotous glory of green yellow and crimson they had not spoken for a long time and were feeling quite content with the pleasant monotony of their journey when they burst out into a rocky glen where a spring of clear water bubbled forth with a common impulse they reined in twenty feet farther on the trail twisted into the screen of verdure and was lost what a discovery exclaimed edith help me down please im going to drink kirk dismounted and lent her a hand the horses snorted appreciatively and stepping forward thrust their soft muzzles eagerly into the stream then fell to browsing upon the tender leaves at their shoulders edith quenched her thirst shook the cramp from her limbs and said some time we will have to see where this road leads there may be more surprises beyond she broke a flower from its stem and fastened it in kirks buttonhole while he gazed down at her with friendly eyes youre looking awfully well lately he declared glancing up she met his gaze and held it for an instant its the open air and the exercise i enjoy these rides with you more than i can say something in her look gave him a little thrill of embarrassment i think ill give marquis and gyp their dessert he said and turning aside began to gather a handful of the greenest leaves the instant his eyes were off her she took the horses by their bridles swung them about and with a sharp blow of her ridingcrop sent them snorting and clattering down the trail kirk wheeled barely in time to see them disappearing here he cried sharply what are you doing they bolted theyll hike straight for town now ill have to chase he glanced at her sharply say why did you do that because i wanted to isnt that reason enough her eyes were reckless and her lips white you shouldnt do a thing like that he cried gruffly its foolish now ill have to run them down oh you cant catch them well ill have a try at it anyhow he tossed away his handful of leaves silly i did it because i wanted to talk with you well those horses wouldnt overhear dont be angry kirk i havent seen you alone since that night taboga he said guiltily youre not going to lecture me again im sorry enough as it is never in all his life had he felt more uncomfortable he could not bring himself to meet her gaze feeling that his own face must be on fire what a queer chap you are am i so unattractive that you really want to rush off after those horses he said nothing and she went on after a moment of hesitation i have known men who would have thought it a privilege to be left alone with me like this i have no doubt you remember for instance i told you there was one man at taboga whom i did not wish to see yes at the sanitarium well something like this happened once with him and i told stephen and did you tell mr cortlandt what i did do you think i would have come riding with you if i had she shook her head kirk i used to think you were an unusually forward young man but youre not very worldly are you nno yes i guess im as wise as most fellows sometimes i think you are very stupid he began firmly see here mrs cortlandt you have been mighty good to me and im indebted to you and your husband for a whole lot i am terribly fond of you both she clipped a crimson bloom from its stem with a vicious blow of her crop then with eyes fixed upon the fallen flower broke the awkward pause that followed i suppose she said half defiantly you know how things are with stephen and me everybody must know i suppose i have done a lot of thinking lately and i have made up my mind that the last appeal of what is right or wrong lies with ones self im not going to care any longer what the world thinks of my actions so long as my own heart justifies them happiness that is what i want and i will have it i will have it at any cost it is my right because a woman marries without love is it right for her to forego love all her life i think not she looked up and with a change of tone ran on swiftly i have studied you for a long time kirk i know the sort of man you are i know you better than you know yourself very lately i have begun to study myself too and i know at last the sort of woman i am she drew near and laid a hand on each shoulder forcing him to look straight into her eyes i am not like most women i cant do things by halves i cant temporize with vital things i prefer to experiment even blindly i used to think i was born to rule but i think now that a womans only happiness lies in serving and i used to believe i was contented when all the time i was waiting for something and didnt know it dont be silly now youre just like every other man i cant pretend to misunderstand you although listen he cut his words short here comes some one she turned her head as from the direction their mounts had taken came the sound of approaching hoots natives from the hills she nodded carelessly toward the purple mountains back of them but the next moment she gave a little gasp of consternation out from the overhung path with a great rustling of leaves came not the expected fleabitten panama horse but a familiar bay astride of which was stephen cortlandt he was leading marquis and gyp by their bridles and reined in at sight of his wife and her companion hello he said i caught your horses for you jove thats lucky kirk greeted the husbands arrival with genuine relief they bolted when we got down to take a drink and we were getting ready for a long walk thanks awfully no trouble at all i saw them as they came out on the main road cortlandts pigskin saddle creaked as he bent forward to deliver the reins he was as cool and immaculate as ever he met ediths eyes without the slightest expression nice afternoon for a ride if i had known you were riding today you might have come with us she said he smiled in his wintry fashion then scanned the surroundings appreciatively pretty spot isnt it if you are going back ill ride with you good enough may i give you a hand mrs cortlandt kirk helped edith to her seat at which her husband bowed his thanks then the three set out in single file which way inquired stephen as they reached the highroad back to town i think edith told him and you im not ready yet see you later he raised his hat and cantered easily away while the other two turned their horses heads toward the city xxi the rest of the family the time for senor garavels return having arrived kirk called at the bank and found not the least difficulty in gaining an audience indeed as soon as he had reminded the banker of their former meeting he was treated with a degree of cordiality that surpassed his expectations i remember quite well sir said garavel la tosca since you are a friend of mrs cortlandt i shall be delighted to serve you now that they were face to face kirk felt that he distinctly approved of chiquitas father this dignified distinguishedlooking gentleman awaited his pleasure with an air of leisurely courtesy that would have made him under other circumstances very easy of approach but there was a keenness in his dark eyes that suggested the futility of beating round the bush kirk felt suddenly a little awkward i have something very particular to say to you he began diffidently but i dont know just how to get at it garavel smiled graciously i am a business man this isnt business blurted kirk its much more important i want to have it over as quickly as possible so ill be frank i have met your daughter mr garavel the bankers eyes widened in a look of disconcerting intensity and i am in love with her sort of a shock isnt it it was to me id like to tell you who i am and anything else you may wish to know my dear sir you surprise me if you are really serious why you have seen her but once a moment at the theatre i met her before that night out at your country place i had been hunting and on my way home through the woods i stumbled upon your swimmingpool she directed me to the road but even so well i loved her the first instant i saw her i knew nothing of this if you had reason to think that your suit would be acceptable why did you not come to me before i couldnt i didnt know your name i was nearly crazy because i couldnt so much as learn the name of the girl i loved kirk plunged confusedly into the story of his search for chiquita that is a strange tale said senor garavel when he had finished a very strange tale and yet you did well to tell it me at present i do not know what to think young men are prone to such romantic fancies rash and illconsidered they are perhaps excusable but oh i suppose you cant understand how a fellow falls so deep in love on such short acquaintance but i have been brooding over this for months theres nothing hasty or illconsidered about it i can assure you i am terribly hard hit sir it means everything to me if you would tell me something about yourself i might know better in what light to regard this affair gladly though there isnt much to tell just now im working on the prr as assistant to runnels the master of transportation you know i like the work and expect to be promoted i have a little money just enough to give me a fresh start if i should lose out here and oh well im poor but honest i suppose thats about the size of it he paused vaguely conscious that he had not done himself justice what else was there to say about kirk anthony then he added as an afterthought my father is a railroad man in albany new york in what capacity is he employed may i ask said garavel showing something like real interest kirk grinned at this and seeing a copy of bradstreets on the bankers table turned to his fathers name which he pointed out rather shamefacedly senor garavel became instantly less distant of course the financial world knows darwin k anthony said he even we modest merchants of the tropics have heard of him and that his son should seek to win success upon his own merits is greatly to his credit i congratulate you sir upon your excellent progress i hope to make good said kirk simply and i think i can then he flushed and hesitated as a realization of the situation swept over him could he gain the favor of chiquitas father under false pretences surely it was only just that a man should stand upon his own merits and yet it didnt seem quite right at length he said with an effort i ought to tell you sir that i am not on good terms with my father at present in fact he has cast me off that is why i am here supporting myself by hard work instead of living in idleness but im beginning to like the work and ill make good ill do it if only to show my father his mistake thats what i care about most i dont want his money its easier to make money than i thought but i must succeed for his sake and my own despite his embarrassment his face shone with sudden enthusiasm he looked purposeful and aggressive with a certain sternness that sat well upon his young manhood garavel lifted his brows may i inquire the cause of this estrangement oh general worthlessness on my part i suppose come to think of it i must have been a good deal of a cross i never did anything very fierce though he smiled a little sadly i dont wonder that i fail to impress you a quick light of thought flashed through the bankers eyes he was a keen judge of men well well he said with a trace of impatience there is no need to go into the matter further your proposal is impossible for many reasons it is impossible and yet your spirit is commendable does that mean you wont even allow me to see your daughter it would be useless but i love gertrudis said kirk desperately garavel looked a trifle pitying you are by no means the first he said i have been besieged by many who say always the same thing without gertrudis they cannot they will not they should not live and yet i have heard of no deaths at first i was greatly concerned about them poor fellows but most of them are married now so i not do take your words too seriously he laughed goodnaturedly you unemotional americans do not love at first sight i do sir tut it is but admiration for a beautiful girl who i say it is wicked enough to enjoy creating havoc take time my boy and you will smile at this madness now let us talk of something else it is no use sir i have it bad but when you make such a request as this you assume to know the young ladys wishes in the matter not at all without your consent i dont believe shed allow herself to even like me that is why i want to fix it with you first in that at least you are quite right for gertrudis is a good girl and obedient as a general rule but it is impossible her marriage has been arranged do you think that is quite fair to her if she loves ramon alfarez once again garavels brows signalled surprise ah you know yes sir i was about to say if she really loves him i cant make any difference but suppose she should care for me again it could make no difference once she had married ramon but she is too young to know her own mind these young girls are impressionable romantic foolish i can see no object in deliberately courting trouble can you in affairs of the heart it is well to use judgment and caution qualities which come only with age youth is headstrong and blinded by dreams hence it is better that marriage should be arranged by older persons exactly thats why i want you to arrange mine the banker smiled in spite of himself for he was not without a sense of humor and the young mans sincerity was winning it is out of the question he said useless to discuss forgetting for the moment all other considerations there is an obstacle to your marriage into a spanish family which you do not stop to consider one which might well prove insurmountable i speak of religion no trouble there sir you are then a catholic it was my mothers faith and i was brought up in it until she died after that i sort of neglected it you see i am more of a catholic than anything else what we call a bad catholic yes sir but if i were not it wouldnt make any difference chiquita is my religion who the father started i i call her that kirk explained in confusion to myself of course indeed so do i said senor garavel dryly for a moment he frowned in meditation there were many things to consider he felt a certain sympathy for this young man with his straightforwardness and artless brusquerie moreover though the banker was no great respecter of persons the mention of darwin k anthony had impressed him if kirk were all that he seemed he had no doubt of the ultimate reconciliation of father and son at all events it would do no harm to learn more of this extraordinary suitor and meanwhile he must treat him with respect while carefully guarding his own dignity against possibly impertinent advances she has been promised to ramon he said at last and i have considered her future quite settled of course such arrangements are frequently altered for various causes even at the last moment but quien sabe he shrugged his shoulders she may not wish to entertain your suit so why discuss it why make plans or promises it is a matter to be handled with the greatest delicacy there are important issues linked with it where there is the prospect of an alliance between two houses of business or politics you will understand that according to our ideas those considerations must govern absolutely otherwise i do not know i can say nothing to encourage you except that for a young man i have known so very short a time he smiled genially you have impressed me not unfavorably i thank you for coming to me at any rate the two men rose and shook hands kirk was not altogether cast down by the result of the interview he understood the bankers allusion to the possible change of arrangements and felt sure from what chiquita had told him that the marriage with ramon could not take place after the true nature of garavels political aspirations became known in that case if all went well it did not seem impossible that garavel would give his consent and then gertrudis alone would remain to be won if on the other hand her father refused his permission well there are many ways of winning a bride kirk believed in his lucky star and had a constitutional inability to imagine failure the truth was that andres garavel had not hesitated long after that memorable night at the tivoli before accepting the brilliant prize which the cortlandts had dangled so alluringly before his eyes and the decision once made he had entered into the scheme with all his soul he was wise enough however to leave his destiny largely in their hands this meant frequent councils among the three a vast amount of careful work of crafty intrigue of untiring diplomacy and although his candidacy had not as yet been more than whispered the purple robe of power was daily being woven thread by thread it was not long after kirks visit to the bank that garavel during one of these conferences took occasion to bring up the young mans name cortlandt had been called to the telephone and edith was left free to answer without constraint i have seen you and him riding quite frequently her guest remarked with polite interest is he then an old friend yes we are very fond of him your mr runnels believes him most capable we were speaking of him but yesterday oh he will be successful if thats what you mean i shall see to that he has his fathers gift for handling men you know his father not personally only by reputation kirk will be promoted soon bytheway although he doesnt know it he is to replace runnels as soon as he is able remarkable and yet i have seen the marvels you work dear lady but is not this a strange sphere of activity for the son of darwin k anthony oh he had some kind of fallingout with his father i believe which occasioned his coming here there was nothing really to kirks discredit of that i am perfectly sure it would be unfortunate indeed if this breach between father and son should prove serious oh i dare say it wont kirk is certain to succeed and old anthony will come round if i know american fathers garavel smiled well pleased that he had treated his recent visitor with proper consideration after all why not invite the young fellow to his house that would be rather a significant step according to spanish custom yet he need not be bound by it he could put a stop to the affair at any time besides despite his frequent protestations to the contrary he was somewhat influenced by his daughters desire for more liberty it was not fair to her he thought in his heart that she should know only ramon one reason especially appealed to his pride if a break came between him and alfarez ramon must not appear to have jilted gertrudis if meanwhile she had another suitor and one of distinguished family the affair would wear a better look it cannot be denied that the name of darwin k anthony rang musically in his ears the boy has the right stuff in him edith went on he began at the bottom only a few months ago preferring to work his way up though he was offered a firstrate position to begin with she would have said more but just at that moment her husband entered you were saying that alfarez suspects said cortlandt addressing garavel has he said anything not to me as yet but he surely must know the rumors must have reached him he is cold and ramon acts queerly i feel guilty almost as if i had betrayed a friend nonsense there is no room for fine scruples in politics we mustnt be in too great a hurry though things are going smoothly and when the time comes you will be called for but it must be the voice of the people calling bocas chiriqui colon they must all demand garavel cortlandt sighed i shall be very glad when it is over he looked more pale more bloodless more worldweary than ever you need have no fear that it will cause serious trouble between you and the general mrs cortlandt assured garavel ramon should be able to effect peace no matter what happens ah i am not so sure that there will be a marriage between gertrudis and him young ladies are most uncertain when allowed the slightest liberty is she growing rebellious cortlandt inquired if i were you then i wouldnt force her a loveless marriage is a tragic thing his wife nodded her agreement not exactly rebellious she would do whatever i asked regardless of her own feelings for that is the way we spaniards bring up our daughters but she is cold to ramon and he i believe is suspicious of my intentions toward his father therefore the situation is strained it is very hard to know what is right in a case of this sort the young are impressionable and reckless often what seems to them distasteful is in reality a blessing it is not every lovematch that turns out so happily as yours my dear friends well i suppose i am weak with gertrudis i cannot be severe but unless it becomes necessary to make conditions with my old friend alfarez i should prefer to let the girl have her own way as cortlandt escorted his caller to the door the panamanian paused and said with genuine solicitude you look badly sir i am afraid you work too hard i would not easily forgive myself if this affair of ours caused you to fall ill oh i am all right a little tired thats all i dont sleep well it is worry over this thing cortlandt smiled crookedly i am not the one to worry i am not the one at the head surely you know what people say that i am her officeboy garavel found it hard to laugh this off gracefully you are too modest he said i admire the trait but i also chance to know the wonderful things you have accomplished if people say such things it is because they do not know and are too small to understand your voluntary position it is very fine of you to let your wife share your work senor but he shook his head as the door closed behind him really doubting that cortlandt would prove physically equal to the coming struggle it was about this time perhaps two weeks after kirk had replied to his fathers letter that runnels called him in one day to ask do you know a man named clifford no he dropped in this morning claiming to be a newspaper man from the states wanted to know all about everything on the canal and the usual thing he didnt talk like a writer though i thought you might know him he asked about you me kirk pricked up his ears i gathered the impression he was trying to pump me runnels eyed his subordinate shrewdly i boosted you is he short and thickset no tall and thin as kirk merely looked at him in a puzzled way he continued i suppose were all suspicious down here theres so much of that sort of thing if he has anything on you hes got nothing on me im glad of that youre the best man i have and that shakeup i told you about is coming off sooner than i expected id hate to have anything happen to you do you think you could hold down my job what do you really mean it i do i think i could if you would help me runnels laughed that remark shows you havent developed isthmitis anyhow what is that well its a sort of mental disorder most of us have we believe everybody above us is incompetent and everybody below us is after our jobs youll get it in time even some of the commissioners have it it goes without saying that id like to be master of transportation but not until youre through well the old man has had another row with colonel jolson and may not wait for his vacation to quit im promised the vacancy then you have seen the colonel no but i have seen mrs cortlandt i felt i had a right to ask something from her in return for what i did for you i know that sounds rotten but youll understand how it is colonel jolson wants his brotherinlaw blakeley to have the place but im entitled to it and she has promised to fix it for me if i go up you go too thats why i was worried when this clifford party appeared there is something i suppose i ought to tell you although it doesnt amount to much i was mixed up in a scrape the night i left new york a plainclothes man happened to get his head under a falling bottle and nearly died from the effects what was the trouble it really wasnt the least bit of trouble it was fatally easy we were out on a grape carnival six of us it was an antiprohibition festival and he horned in there is nothing else nothing well this clifford party is stopping at the hotel central better look him over i will said kirk feeling more concern than he cared to show but his apprehension turned out to be quite unfounded on inspection clifford proved to bear no resemblance whatever to williams nor did he seem to have any concealed design he was a good sort apparently with a knack of making himself agreeable and in the weeks that followed he and kirk became quite friendly meanwhile no word had come from senor garavel and kirk was beginning to fret but just as he had reached the limit of his patience he received a note which transported him with joy senor andres garavel he read would be in the city on the following tuesday evening and would be pleased to have him call even with his recent experiences of spanish etiquette kirk hardly realized the extent of the concession that had been made to him he knew nothing of the tears the pleadings and the spirited championship of his cause that had overborne the last parental objection it was lucky for him that chiquita was a spoiled child and garavel a very americanized spaniard however as it was he went nearly mad with delight and when tuesday came round he performed his officework so badly that runnels took him to task what the devil has got into you the last few days he exclaimed irritably im going to see a certain party tonight and i cant contain myself im about to blow up thats all woman eh kirk grinned it has taken months and id begun to think i wasnt wanted oh ive had a battle anybody i know yes but i cant talk about her theres a man in the case see im going slow to start with runnels who had never seen kirk with any woman except edith cortlandt formed his own conclusions helped a bit perhaps by the memory of that conversation with john weeks on the day of their ride across the isthmus that these conclusions were not pleasing to him he showed when he returned to his office he stood an instant in thought looking rather stern then murmured half aloud thats one thing i wouldnt stand for kirk had hard work to refrain from shaving himself twice that evening so overcareful was he about his toilet yet his excitement was as nothing compared to that of allan who looked on with admiration tempered by anxious criticism the boy it seemed appropriated to himself the entire credit for the happy ending of this affair it will be a grand wedding sar he exclaimed hallan will be there for giving you away you dont know enough about me to give me away kirk returned lightly i shall be needing some hexpensive garments for the ceremony i would hahsk you to be so kind not too fast it hasnt gone quite that far yet but i shall need to have those garments made by a tailor and that will require time they will be made precisely to resemble yours then nobody can tell hus apart thats considered genuine flattery i believe would you do me a favor master hauntony surest thing you know i shall be waiting in the street tonight could you harrange to hahsk those fatal questions hadjoining the window so that i might hoverhear no and i dont want you prowling around outside either youre not to follow me understand i have enough on my mind as it is the residence of senor garavel is considered one of the show places of panama it is of spanish architecture built of brick and stucco and embellished with highly ornamental iron balconies it stands upon a corner overlooking one of the several public squares guarded from the street by a breasthigh stone wall crowned with a stout iron fence diagonally opposite and running the full length of the block is a huge weatherstained cathedral the front of which is decorated with holy figures each standing by itself in a separate niche in the open church tower are great chimes which flood the city with melody and in the corner fronting upon the intersecting street is a tiny shrine with an image of the madonna smiling downward it is only a little recess in the wall with barely room for a few kneeling figures but at night its bright radiance illumines the darkness round about and lends the spot a certain sanctity contrary to the usual custom the garavel mansion has a narrow yard almost smothered in tropical plants that crowd one another through the iron bars and nod at the passersby riotous vines half screen the balconies great overhanging redtiled eaves give the place an air of coziness which the verdure enhances a subdued light was glowing from the lower windows when anthony mounted the steps and rang an indian woman clad in barbarous colors her bare feet encased in sandals admitted him and the banker himself met him in the hall he led the way into a great barren parlor where to kirks embarrassment he found quite a company gathered his host formally presented him to them one after another there were senor pedro garavel a brother of andres senora garavel his wife who was fat and short of wind the two misses garavel their daughters then a little wrinkled brown old lady in stiff black silk who spoke no english kirk gathered that she was somebodys aunt or grandmother last of all gertrudis came shyly forward and put her hand in his then glided back to a seat behind the old lady just as they were seating themselves another member of the family appeared this time a second cousin from guatemala like the grandmother he was as ignorant of english as kirk was of spanish but he had a pair of frightfully intense black eyes with which he devoured the american these orbs exercised an unusual effect upon the caller they were unwinking the lids were wide open and the brilliance of the pupils was heightened by the startling whiteness surrounding them they were like the eyes of a frightened horse it was very trying to be the target of so many glances and to know that he was being studied like a bug beneath a microscope yet kirk managed to keep a degree of selfpossession making up his mind to display a modest reticence that could not help appearing admirable but he soon found that this did not suit instead of resuming their conversation the entire assemblage of garavels waited calmly for their caller to begin and he realized in a panic that he was expected to make conversation he cast about madly for a topic his host helped him to get started and he did fairly well until one of the misses garavel began to translate his remarks to the old lady and the ferocious cousin from guatemala as their replies were not rendered into english he was left stranded he knew that his whole salvation lay in properly impressing his auditors so he began again and floundered through a painful monologue it was not at all pleasant it was like being initiated into some secret order these strange people sitting so stiff and watchful formed an inquisitorial body the night suddenly turned off swelteringly hot perspiration began to trickle down his brow his collar became a tourniquet and he cast appealing glances at the silent figure hidden demurely behind the rustly old lady in the black harness the look of mingled pity and understanding she gave him somewhat revived his fainting spirit and he determined to stick it out until the family were ready to retire and allow him a word with her alone but idle hope gradually it dawned upon him that they had no such intention to relieve the strain he became facetious and told funny stories but this was an unlucky experiment for his witticisms fell with a ghastly hollowness no one laughed save the grandmother and the guatemalan cousin who could not understand and at this kirk fled helterskelter from the realms of humor by now his collar had given up the struggle and lain limply down to rest the whole experience was hideous yet he understood quite well that these people were not making sport of him all this was only a part of their foreign customs they were gentlefolk reared to a different code from his that was all and since he had elected to come among them he could only suffer and be strong in time he became sufficiently inured to the situation to take in the details of the room which were truly markable to begin with the parlor walls entirely lacked the sort of decoration to which he was used the furniture costly and rare in itself was arranged stiffly in a square about the room the precise geometrical centre being occupied by a great urn of impressive ugliness a richly carved mahogany whatnot against one wall was laden with seashells and other curios at various points about the room were many statuettes vases and figures of every conceivable size and shape some of bisque others of common pottery a few of exquisite marble all standing upon the floor a tremendous french chandelier of sparkling crystal cascaded downward from an american ceiling of pressed metal at regular intervals around the wall were panels painted to resemble marble crouched upon a rug in one corner was a lifesize figure of what seemed to be a tiger perfectly colored and made of porcelain it had tremendous glass eyes larger even than the cousins from guatemala and they shone with a hypnotic intensity that was disturbing kirk wanted to kick it and cry scat hidden in other desolate quarters of the room were similar studies in animal life these anomalous surroundings by turns depressed him and provoked an insane desire to laugh what he ever talked about during that evening he never quite remembered at one time the cholo girl who had admitted him entered noiselessly bearing silver plates of fruit and shortly afterward he found himself trying to balance upon his knee a plate of pineapple soaked in spice and wine a fork a napkin starched as stiffly as a sheet of linoleum and a piece of cake which crumbled at a look it was a difficult bit of juggling but he managed to keep one or two of the articles in the air almost continuously when it came time to leave he expected at least to be allowed a farewell word or two with gertrudis but instead he was bowed out as ceremoniously as he had been bowed in and finding himself at last in the open sighed with relief he felt like a paroled prisoner but he thought of the girls glance of sympathy and was instantly consoled he crossed slowly to the plaza pausing a moment for a goodnight look at the house then as he turned he caught a glimpse of a figure slinking into the shadows of the sidestreet and smiled indulgently evidently allan had been unable to resist the temptation to follow after all and had hung about hoping to overhear his hero at his best but when he had reached his quarters he was surprised to find the boy there ahead of him how did you beat me home he inquired i have been waiting himpatiently ever since you went out to be sure i have had one little dream didnt you follow me to the garavels oh boss never would i do such seeing that the negro was honest kirk decided that somebody had been spying upon him but the matter was of so little consequence that he dismissed it from his mind and what said your female upon your proposal of marriage allan inquired praise god i shall hexpire of suspense if you do not chaat me the truth oh there was a chorus of her relatives in the room they sat in my lap all the evening perhaps it is fartunate after all this senorita is rich ooman and therefar she would be hexpensive for us kirk managed to drive him forth after some effort and straightway retired to dream of timid spanish girls who peeped at him from behind old ladies porcelain tigers that laughed inanely at his jokes and guatemalan gentlemen with huge hypnotic eyes of glass xxii a challenge and a confession although runnels had spoken with confidence of the coming shakeup in the railroad organization it was not without a certain surprise that he awoke one morning to find himself actively in charge of the entire system he lost no time in sending for kirk who took the news of their joint advancement with characteristic equanimity now there is nothing cinched yet understand the acting superintendent cautioned him were all on probation but if we make good i think well stick ill do my best to fill your shoes and i have the inside track on blakeley in spite of colonel jolson so im not alarmed the break came sooner than i expected and now that we chaps are in control its the chance of our lifetimes kirk nodded youre entitled to all you get but ive never quite understood how i managed to forge ahead so fast why there are dozens of fellows here who know more than i and who could do better ive been mighty lucky you dont really call it luck do you runnels looked at him curiously im not conceited enough to think im a downright genius why the cortlandts engineered everything it was they who arranged your promotion to the office in the first place and theyre behind this last affair they have stood back of you at every step and incidentally back of me and the other boys when you say they you of course mean she of course one has to recognize him though as the head of the family and he really did have a part in it too at least if he had been against us we never would have won i cant pretend that i didnt suspect said kirk slowly but i did hope id made good on my own merits runnels laughed you have made good all right or you couldnt go forward but this is a government job and fellows like us arent big enough to get through on our own merits one has to be a real worldbeater to do that if the cortlandts hadnt backed us some other chaps with influence would have stepped in above us take blakeley for instance he is nothing extra and he doesnt know half as much about this business as i do but hes the brotherinlaw of colonel jolson and hed have landed the job sure if it hadnt been for our friends youd better let your conscience take a nap id like to show the cortlandts that we appreciate what theyve done but we cant openly thank her without humiliating him id like to give him something suppose we give him a quiet little supper some night and tell him frankly how grateful we are hes the sort to appreciate a thing like that and it would be a delicate way of thanking his wife too good ill speak to the other fellows and now the acting master of transportation is going to shake with the new acting superintendent and wish him every success runnels grasped the outstretched hand say anthony he said were young and we have a start i have what you lack and you have what i lack if we stick together well own a railroad some day is it a go you bet with a warm glow in his breast the new master of transportation plunged into his duties he really was making a success it seemed although it was a bit disappointing to learn that he owed so much of it to edith cortlandt at the same time he couldnt help thinking that his efforts had entitled him to reasonable success and anyhow it was pleasant to feel that at no point in his scramble up the ladder had he elbowed off some other man more deserving perhaps than he this last advancement too was very timely for it would surely have its effect upon andres garavel but his new work brought new troubles and worries runnels helped him whenever he could yet kirk was left largely to his own devices and learned for the first time what real responsibility was like he began to sleep shorter hours he concentrated with every atom of determination in him he drove himself with an iron hand he attacked his task from every angle and with his fine constitution and unbounded youthful energy he covered an amazing quantity of work he covered it so well moreover that runnels complimented him this stress of labor served one purpose for which he was very grateful it separated him from edith cortlandt and took his mind from that occurrence in the jungle ever since the day of his last ride with her he had been tortured with the most unpleasant thoughts he confessed to forgetting himself briefly that night at taboga but he had believed that she understood that she regarded him only as a chum and a companion therefore her open surrender coming so unexpectedly had dumfounded him as he looked back upon the incident now it seemed inconceivable yet her words her expression her reckless abandon at that moment were too significant to allow of misunderstanding still by dint of determination and stern attention to his tasks he was able to put the matter almost wholly from his mind soon after his promotion he received from andres garavel a warmly worded note of congratulation and some few days later an invitation to dine which he accepted eagerly the dinner proved to be another disappointing ordeal for again he was allowed no opportunity of speaking with gertrudis and had to content himself with feasting his eyes upon her but although the family were present en masse as on the former occasion they unbent to a surprising degree and he found them truly gracious and delightful he realized nevertheless that he was under the closest scrutiny and upon the strictest probation the garavels still held him at a noticeable distance and he was far from feeling wholly at ease later in the evening he found himself alone with chiquita and the old spanish lady and knowing that the latter could not understand a word of his tongue he addressed himself to the girl with some degree of naturalness i was sorry for you the last time senor she said in reply to his halfhumorous complaint and yet it was fonny you were so frightened it was my first memorial service i thought i was going to see you alone oh that is never allowed never how am i going to ask you to marry me miss garavel hid her blushing face behind her fan indeed you seem capable of asking that absurd question under any circumstances i wish you would straighten me out on some of your customs what for instance why does the whole family sit around and watch me i dont intend to steal any bricabrac they could search me just as well when i go out they wish to satisfy themselves as to your character perhaps yes but a fellow feels guilty causing them to lose so much sleep she gave him an odd look smiling timidly as for tonight do you attribute any meaning to my fathers request that you dine with us of course it means i wasnt blackballed at the first meeting i suppose after ive become a regular member and there is nothing missed from the lodgerooms ill be allowed to proceed in the ordinary manner she blushed delightfully again since you are so ignorant of our ways you should inquire at your earliest convenience i would advise you perhaps to learn spanish will you teach me ill come every evening she did not answer for the old lady began to show curiosity and a conversation in spanish ensued which kirk could not follow when it came time for their chaperon to leave she excused herself with royal dignity and going to the door called stephanie the giant st lucian woman not until the negress had entered did the grandmother retire which showed so kirk imagined that even yet the garavel household had no more confidence in him than in a badgeless building inspector he was not grateful for the change for he did not like stephanie and judging from the sombre suspicion of the black womans glances the feeling was mutual the conversation took perforce a less personal nature in her presence yet kirk departed with a feeling of exaltation beyond doubt his suit was progressing slowly perhaps but still progressing his understanding of spanish customs received a considerable enlargement on the following day when he met ramon alfarez outside the railroad office ramon had evidently waited purposely for him and now began to voice some unintelligible protest in the greatest excitement youll have to play it all over again kirk advised him im only just learning to conjugate the verb amar what seems to be the trouble this time ha for the moment i forgot your ignorance but onderstan this detestable person it is time you shall answer to me cheerfully ask your questions slowly onderstan further chattered the spaniard regardless of the appenings to me it shall never come to pass soch disgraceful occurrence shall never transpire of that be assure even if it exac the las drops of blood in the veins of me i ave despised you senor an so i ave neglec to keel you being busy with important affairs of government bot ow am i reward for those neglec eh alfarez breathed ferociously through his nostrils i dont know im sure what is your reward very well are you aware pig nix on those pet names the american ordered gruffly you ave insolt me cried ramon furiously and now you ave the insolence to interfere in my affairs he paused dramatically make it yourself ready to fight on tomorrow whats the use of putting it off i couldnt make your weight in that time ill do it now if you say no no onderstan we shall fight like gentlemen i shall keel you with any weapon you prefer by jove kirk exclaimed in amazement this is a challenge you want to fight a duel why this reads like a book he began to laugh at which ramon became white and calm listen kirk went on ill tell you what well do well fight with firehose again i suppose you want satisfaction for that ducking i prefer to shoot you senor the other declared quietly those marriage shall never occur until first i walk upon your dead body as matter of honor i offer you this opportunity biffore it is too late i guess you have been drinking youre a little premature in talking about my marriage arent you so you fear to confess the truth oh i am not to be deceive all panama is speaking of those engagements to senorita garavel come then must i insolt you further kirk replied dryly looking the spaniard over with cold blue eyes no i think youve gone about far enough you riffuse exclaimed ramon triumphantly look here said kirk ive had enough of this he advanced threateningly and the spaniard nervously gave way i dont fight duels its against the law in my country its a crime to kill a man in cold blood and we dont tie a fellow up and beat him when hes helpless and then offer him the honorable satisfaction of either committing murder or being killed theyre not wearing duels this season his hands clenched involuntarily i dont want to hurt you alfarez but i may not be able to help it if you dont keep out of my way he left the fiery little panamanian still scowling and muttering threats and went his way wondering vaguely how his attentions to chiquita had become so quickly known he was informed later in the afternoon as he left the office for the day he was handed a note from mrs cortlandt requesting him to call at once and summoning a coach he was driven directly to her house unlike the garavel home the house which the cortlandts had leased was set upon the waterfront its rear balcony overlooking the sea where it lapped the foundation of the city wall it was a delightful old place shut off from the street by a yard filled with flowering plants and shrubs and though flanked in true spanish fashion by stores and shops it was roomy and comfortable edith kept him waiting a moment before she descended dressed for her afternoon ride you see i havent given up my horse in spite of your neglect she said as she gave him her hand you got my note yes and i came straight from the office i suppose you know what it is about and are wondering how i heard the news what news your engagement she laughed with an amusement that did not ring quite true youre the second one to speak about that im not engaged of course not dont think for a moment i believed it i was calling on some spanish people this afternoon and heard the report i admit it was a shock when i learned the details i knew at once you ought to be told before it developed into something embarrassing come into the other room there is a breeze from the water she led him into the parlor from which the open windows shielded now by drawn shutters gave egress to the rear porch with its chairs and hammock dear dear you foolish boy youre always in trouble arent you you really dont deserve to be helped why you have avoided me for weeks the new arrangement has swamped us with work i have had no time to go out indeed you had time to run after the first pretty spanish face you saw im really angry though i suppose i cant blame you after all she is charming in her way you mean miss garavel yes didnt you realize what you were doing i realized what i was trying to do naughty but why select her of all people there are dozens of others who could amuse you and whose people would not object andres garavel isnt that sort he is a rich man he has political ambitions hes a very proud sort now i suppose i must get you out of this difficulty as best i can you ought to be more careful please he said crossly i could understand better what you are talking about if i knew just what this difficulty is why this silly engagement of yours dont pretend to be so stupid ramon alfarez heard that same report and very courteously invited me to wait a few minutes while he killed me its tremendously flattering to be linked up with miss garavel of course but i havent asked her to marry me but youve seen her you have called at her house sure twice at the invitation of the old gentleman all the little garavels were lined up like mourners and you dined there last night is that all you have seen of her nno ive seen her at las savannas thats why i went hunting so often at this confession which kirk delivered with sheepish reluctance mrs cortlandt drew herself up with an expression of anger then this has been going on for some time she cried why kirk you never told me why should i she flushed at this unconscious brutality but after a moment ran on bravely oh well i suppose any man would enjoy that sort of an adventure particularly with such a pretty girl but why did you let it go so far why did you let them commit you am i committed her look was half offended half incredulous are you trying to be disagreeable or is it possible you dont know the meaning of those invitations to call and to dine with the family and all that why they expect you to marry her it is all settled now according to the spanish custom the whole town is talking about it i cant understand for the life of me how you ever allowed yourself to go there the second time and to dine seeing the look in his face she cried sharply you dont mean that youre in earnest she was staring at him as if disbelieving her eyes certainly im in earnest edith turned away abruptly i hope youre not joking said kirk jove i im knocked clear off my pins a tremendous wave of excitement surged over him so thats what alfarez meant thats what she meant last night when she told me to look up he broke off suddenly for ediths face had gone chalkwhite but kirk what about me she asked in a strained voice there was deathlike silence in the room you cant love her said the woman why shes only a child and shes spanish they stood motionless facing each other at last kirk said gravely and deliberately yes i love her better than anything in the world and i want to marry her i could give up my country my dad anything for her pressing her gloved fingers to her temples she turned her head blindly from side to side whispering as if to herself what will become of me dont he cried in a panic and cast a hurried look over his shoulders youll be overheard youll be seen you dont know what youre saying wheres cortlandt at his club i suppose i dont know i i dont care then the paralysis that had numbed her vanished and she spoke with quivering intensity youve been dishonest with me kirk dont act this way he ordered roughly im terribly fond of you but i never knew you must have known i knew nothing i chose not to think what i saw i forgot i supposed you merely liked me as i liked you that night at taboga she flared up what about that couldnt you tell then i fought fought fought but i had to give up you havent forgotten those wonderful hours we had together she began to sob but steadied herself with an effort you say you didnt know then what about that afternoon in the jungle oh youre not blind you must have seen a thousand times every hour weve been alone together ive told you and you let me go on believing you cared do you think that was right now you are shocked because i admit it she mocked well i have no pride i am not ashamed its too late for shame now why even my husband knows with an exclamation he seized her by the arm you dont mean that he cried fiercely but she wrenched herself away why do you think i made a man of you why did i force you up and up and over the heads of others why are you in line for the best position on the railroad did you think you had made good by your own efforts she laughed harshly i took runnels and wade and kimble and the others that you liked and forced them up with you so youd have an organization that couldnt be pulled down did did you do all that i did more i broke with alfarez because of what his son did to you i juggled the politics of this country i threw him over and took garavel garavel my god what a mockery but i wont let you i wont let that girl spoil my work her voice trailed off in a kind of rasping whisper she struggled a moment for composure then went on it was i who promoted you to runnels position hell tell you that it was i who put ideas of advancement into his head i fostered this quarrel between jolson and the superintendent and ive used runnels to break trail for you why ask yourself why oh kirk she cried you mustnt marry that girl ill make you a great man you seem to forget cortlandt he said dully she gave a scornful laugh you neednt bring stephen in he doesnt count i doubt if hed even care our marriage amounts to nothing nothing youd better consider me and the sacrifice im willing to make im not going to listen to you he cried i suppose ive been a fool but this must end right here you cant marry that girl she reiterated hysterically she was half sobbing again but not with the weakness of a woman her grief was more like that of a despairing man for heavens sake pull yourself together said kirk you have servants i i dont know what to say i want to get out i want to think it over im dreadully sorry thats all i can seem to think about now he turned and went blindly to the door leaving her without a look behind when he had gone she drew off her ridinggloves removed her hat and dropped them both upon the nearest chair then crept wearily up the stairs to her room a moment later the latticed wooden blinds at the end of the parlor swung open and through the front window stepped stephen cortlandt behind him was a hammock swung in the coolest part of the balcony the pupils of his eyes ordinarily so dead and expressionless were distended like those of a man under the influence of a drug or suffering from a violent headache he listened attentively for an instant his head on one side then hearing footsteps approaching from the rear of the house he strolled into the hall a maid appeared with a tray a glass and a bottle i could not find the aspirin she said but i brought you some absinthe it will deaden the pain sir he thanked her and with shaking fingers poured the glass full then drank it off like so much water youre not going out again in the heat sir yes tell mrs cortlandt that i am dining at the university club he went slowly down the steps and out through the flowering shrubs xxiii a plot and a sacrifice kirk never passed a more unpleasant night than the one which followed in the morning he went straight to runnels with the statement that he could take no part in the little testimonial they had intended to give cortlandt but its too late now to back out i saw him at the university club last evening and fixed the date for saturday night did you tell him i was in the affair certainly i said it was your idea it affected him deeply too i never saw a chap so moved over a little thing kirk thought quickly perhaps edith had spoken rashly in her excitement and her husband did not know her feelings after all perhaps he only suspected in that case it would never do to withdraw it would seem like a confession of guilt if he has accepted that ends it i suppose he said finally what has happened runnels was watching him sharply nothing i merely wish i hadnt entered into the arrangement thats all ive ordered a watch for him too and its being engraved i wanted to give him something to show my own personal gratitude for what he and his wife have done for me lord it took a months salary i know its a jay present but theres nothing decent in these shops look here ive wanted to say something to you for some time though its deuced hard to speak of such things maybe i have more moral scruples than some people but runnels stirred uncomfortably in his chair steve cortlandt has put us where we are you understand when i speak of him i include his wife too well i like him kirk and id hate to see him made unhappy if a chap loves a married woman he ought to be man enough to forget it rotten way to express myself of course kirk looked the speaker squarely in the eyes as he answered i dont understand what youre driving at i havent the least interest in any married mans affairs never have had in fact im in love with gertrudis garavel and im engaged to marry her the devil its a fact i didnt know until last night that id been accepted then just forget what i said i was going north on a southbound track i ran ahead of orders i really do congratulate you old man miss garavel is well i wont try to do her justice i had no idea please pardon me certainly now that its settled im not going to let any grass grow under my feet why say garavel is to be the next president jove you are lucky cortlandt told me last night that the old fellows candidacy was to be announced saturday night at the big ball thats how he came to accept our invitation he said his work would be over by then and hed be glad to join us after the dance well well your future wife and fatherinlaw are to be his guests that night i suppose you know then they have patched up a truce with alfarez im glad to hear that its all settled i believe this dance is a big special event the american minister and the various diplomatic gangs will be there besides the prominent spanish people its precisely the moment to launch the garavel boom and cortlandt intends to do it after its over our little crowd will have supper and thank him for what he has done for us oh it will be a big night all around wont it do you realize the skyrockety nature of your progress young man lord you take my breath it does seem like a dream i landed here with a buttonhook for baggage and now say runnels her eyes are just like two big black pansies and when she smiles youll go off your trolley your promotion came just in time didnt it talk about luck we ought to hear from washington before saturday and know that our jobs are cinched this uncertainty is fierce for me you know i have a wife and kid and it means a lot when you give cortlandt that watch youll have to present him with a lovingcup from the rest of us i think its coming to him dont you i id rather you presented it not much i can run trains but i cant engineer social functions youll have to be spokesman i suppose jobs and increased salaries and preferments and all that dont count for much with a young fellow who is engaged to the fabulous miss garavel but with the runnels family its different meanwhile lets just hold our thumbs till our promotions are ratified from headquarters i need that position and im dying of uneasiness the night had been as hard for edith cortlandt as it had been for kirk but during its sleepless hours she had reached a determination she was not naturally revengeful but it was characteristic of her that she could not endure failure action not words or tears was the natural outlet of her feelings there was just one possible way of winning kirk back and if instead it ruined him she would be only undoing what she had mistakenly done as soon after breakfast as she knew definitely that her husband had gone out she telephoned to general alfarez making an appointment to call on him at eleven it was the first time she had ever gone to see him for she was in the habit of bringing people to her but this was no ordinary occasion and she knew the crafty old spaniard would be awaiting her with eagerness her interview with him was short however and when she emerged from his house she ordered the coachman to drive directly to the garavel bank this time she stayed longer closeted with the proprietor what she told him threw him into something like a panic it seemed that anibal alfarez was by no means so well reconciled to the death of his political hopes as had been supposed on the contrary in spite of all that had been done to prevent it he had been working secretly and had perfected the preliminaries of a coup which he intended to spring at the eleventh hour through ramon he had brought about an alliance with the outgoing galleo and intended to make the bitterest possible fight against garavel such joining of forces meant serious trouble and until the bankers position was materially strengthened it would be most unwise to announce his candidacy as had been planned the general had worked with remarkable craftiness according to mrs cortlandts account and galleos grip upon the national assembly was so strong as to threaten all their schemes she did not go into minute details there was no need for the bankers fears took fire at the mere fact that alfarez had revolted he was dumfounded appalled but it was only last week that we were assured that all was well he cried in despair she shrugged her shoulders one is privileged to change his mind overnight i suppose politics is not a childs game oh i am sorry i ever entertained the proposal to be defeated now would do me immeasurable harm not only in my pride but in my business affairs my affiliations with the government are of the closest they must be for me to live to be a candidate to make the fight and to be beaten what consideration will come to the firm of garavel hermanos think you not much but you are not so deeply committed that you cannot withdraw this cool suggestion brought the expected outburst rather than such a disgrace cried garavel i would go to certain defeat ones pride is not for sale madame what has caused this so sudden change of sentiment ramon is partly to blame he is just as proud as you or as his father when he heard of your daughters engagement to our friend anthony ah now i see it all his face darkened so this is my reward for heeding your advice in regard to gertrudis she should have wed ramon as was intended then i would have had a lever with which to lift his father from my path very well then there is no engagement with this anthony it may not be too late even yet to capture ramon the city is already talking about gertrudis and kirk no word has been spoken no promise given there is not even an understanding it is merely an old custom that has caused this report he seemed a pleasant fellow she had dreams so i yielded but do you suppose i would allow my great ambition to be thwarted by the whim of a girl to be upset by a strangers smile bah at their age i loved a dozen i could not survive without them he snapped his fingers you see now the truth of what i told you when we first spoke of my daughter it is the older heads that must govern always i should have foreseen this effect but ramon was offended and he said too little now i admire his spirit he is desperate he will fight he is no parrot to sit by and see his cage robbed so much the better since he is the pivot upon which this great affair revolves you see what must be done certainly come we will see my friend anibal at once but mrs cortlandt checked him saying quietly that is all right as far as it goes but you forget the other young man garavel paused in his heavy strides across the room eh how so gertrudis will not marry this anthony perhaps she loves him love is a fancy a something seen through a distant haze an illusion which vanishes with the sun in a month a year she will have forgotten but with me it is different this is my lifes climax there will be no other i am a garavel i have looked into the future and i cannot turn back i think also of panama herself there are great issues at stake but how will you handle anthony garavel looked at her blankly he is in my way he is ended is not that all i am glad you are practical so many of you latinamericans are absurdly romantic and why should i not be practical i am a business man i love but two things madame no three my daughter my success and my country by this course i will serve all three since you take this view of it i am sure that with ramons help we can dissuade don anibal from his course the general is sensible and doesnt want a fight any more than you do if your daughter will consent my dear lady give yourself no uneasiness she does not know the meaning of rebellion if necessary but there is not the slightest question it is done then let me look up ramon he and i will approach the general together she gave him her neatly gloved hand things are never so bad as they seem and i thank you for your promptness which alone perhaps has saved our hopes and our ambitions he escorted his caller to her carriage then hurriedly returned to his office that afternoon kirk received a formal communication from the banker which filled him with dismay it ran my dear mr anthony to my extreme distress i hear a rumor that gertrudis is to become your wife i assure you that neither she nor i blame you in the least for this unfortunate report but since busy tongues will wag upon the slightest excuse we feel it best that no further occasion for gossip should be given i am sure you will cooperate with us sincerely and respectfully your friend andres garavel a sense of betrayal crept over him as he read what the letter signified beyond the fact that mr garavel had changed his mind he could not make out and he resolved to go at once and demand an explanation but at the bank he was told that the proprietor had gone home and he drove to the house only to learn that senor garavel and his daughter had left for las savannas not half an hour before so back through the city he urged his driver across the bridge and out along the country road darkness had settled when he returned raging at the trickery that had been practised upon him if they thought to gain their point by sending him on wildgoose chases like this they were greatly mistaken he proposed to have chiquita now if he had to burst his way to her through barred doors never in all his easy careless life had anything of moment been denied him never had he felt such bitterness of thwarted longing reared in a way to foster a disregard of all restraint and a contempt for other peoples rights he was in a fitting mood for any reckless project and the mere thought that they should undertake to coerce an anthony filled him with grim amusement he had yielded to their lefthanded customs out of courtesy it was time now to show his strength what folly he might have committed it is hard to tell but he was prevented from putting any extravagant plan into operation by a message from the girl herself as he dismissed his coachman and turned toward his quarters stephanie came to him out of the shadows i have been waiting she said where is chiquita tell me quickly she is at the house she wants to see you of course she does i knew this wasnt any of her doing ive been hunting everywhere for her at nine oclock she will be in the plaza you know the dark place across from the church ill be there if we do not come wait certainly but stephanie tell me what it is all about the black woman shook her head she is sick she said in a harsh voice that is all i know i have never seen her act so from her expression kirk fancied that she held him responsible for her mistresss sufferings now dont be angry with me he made haste to say im sick too and youre the only friend we have you love her dont you well so do i and im going to make her happy in spite of her father and all the rest run along now i wont keep you waiting tonight long before the appointed time he was at the place of meeting but scarcely had the city chimes rung out nine when he saw two women emerge from the dark sidestreet next the garavel mansion and come swiftly toward him he refrained from rushing out to meet them but when they were close to his place of concealment he stepped forward with chiquitas name upon his lips and his arms outstretched she drew away no no senor she cried i sent for you because there was no other way that is all my father would not let you come to the house you will not think me bold of course not i could not let you go until you knew the truth you do not believe it was my fault i dont know what to believe because i dont know what has happened all i know is that i got a note from your father but that wont make me let you go she clung desperately to the bajan woman as if afraid to trust herself near him wait wait she said until you have heard it all never had she appeared so beautiful as now with her face white her bosom heaving as the halflight dimly revealed no matter what it is ill never give you up he declared stubbornly ah i feared you would say those very words but you must do it just the same it will be hard for us both i know but she choked and shook her head as the words refused to come stephanie laid a great copper hand soothingly upon her shoulder and growled at kirk in a hoarse accusing voice you see tell me first why i must give you up because in spite of all i am to marry ramon gertrudis said wretchedly who said so my father he has forbidden me to think of you and ordered that i marry ramon sick or well living or dead i must marry him im hanged if you do it is those miserable politics again if i do not obey my father cannot be president do you see pausing an instant to master her agitation she hurried on to be president means a great deal to him and to our family it is the greatest honor that has ever come to a garavel senor alfarez is terribly angry that i refused to marry his son to whom since i was a little child i have been engaged ramon also is furious he threatened to kill himself so it comes to this then if i will not bind myself to the agreement senor alfarez will contest the election i do not know how you say those things but my father will be defeated perhaps he will be humbled many other terrible things which i cannot understand will happen also if i agree then there will be no opposition to his plans he will be president and i will be a grand lady i wont stand for it theyre making you a sacrifice thats all what kind of a father is it who would sell his daughter no no you do not understand he is proud he cannot accept defeat he would rather give his life than be humiliated furthermore he wishes me to marry ramon and so that ends it her lips were trembling as she peered up at him to see if he really understood let them rave dear what does it matter who is president what does anything matter to you and me he says i am too young to know my own mind and perhaps that is true senor antonio perhaps i shall soon forget you and learn to love ramon as he loves me i do not know in spite of the pathetic quaver in her voice kirk cried with jealous bitterness you dont seem to object very strongly you seem to care about as much for alfarez as you do for me is that it yes senor she said bravely you are lying declared stephanie suddenly the girl burst into a perfect torrent of weeping that shamed him then without any invitation she flung herself recklessly into his arms and lay there trembling palpitating like an imprisoned bird forgive me dear he exclaimed softly i knew better all the time you mustnt think of doing what they ask i wont allow it his own heartbeats were shaking him and he hardly knew what he was saying the sight of her grief maddened him it was as if they had taken advantage of his helpless little maid to hurt her maliciously and his indignation blazed forth she looked up with eyes gleaming through her tears and said brokenly senor i love you truly you see i cannot lie her breath intoxicated him and he bent his head to kiss her but stephanie tore her roughly from his arms the woman showed the strength of a man and her vulturelike face was working fiercely as she cried no she is mine she is mine she is a good girl stephanie she loves me dont you see no no the black woman drew the girl into the shelter of her own arms oh i am wicked gertrudis said i love you keerk yes i love you very dearly but my father he refuses i must obey he has the right and i must do as he wishes come with me now well be married tonight he urged but she only clung to stephanie more closely as if to hold herself from falling you are very sweet to me she said with piteous tenderness and i shall never forget the honor but you see i cannot this is more to my father than his life it is the same to all our family and i must do my duty i will pray for strength to keep from loving you senor and some day perhaps the dear god will hear you must do likewise and pray also for me to have courage i could not let you go away thinking this was my doing so i sent for you no one must obey ones people for they are wise and good but one should be honest the tears were stealing down her cheeks and she thrilled to his pleadings as to some wondrous music yet she was like adamant and all his lovers desperation could not shake her it was strange to see this slender timid slip of a girl so melting and yet so cruelly firm he appealed to stephanie but she was as unresponsive as a bronze image seeing that his urging only made matters worse he said more gently you are exalted now with the spirit of selfsacrifice but later you will see that i am right i am not discouraged a thousand things may happen who knows what tomorrow may bring lets wait and see if we cant find a way out now that i know you love me i have the courage to face anything and i am going to win you chiquita i have never lost in all my life and i dont intend to begin now ill see your father in the morning and ill be here again tomorrow night but at this gertrudis cried out no no i cannot meet you again in this manner and stephanie nodded her agreement then ill see you the next night that is saturday you are coming to the big ball at the tivoli with him and the cortlandts i must see you then so make sure to be there and meanwhile dont give up oh there is no hope there is always hope ill think of something we must go said the barbadian woman warningly yes yes it is of no avail to resist came the girls choking voice she stretched out her little hand and then looking up at him said uncertainly i may never speak with you again alone senor and i must pray to cease loving you but will you kiss me once so that i may never forget he breathed a tender exclamation and took her gently to his breast while the negress stood by scowling and muttering the memory of that long breathless moment lived with him for years strangely enough at the touch of her lips he felt his courage forsake him it ran out like water he became weak fearful despairing as if it were his life that was ebbing away and the pang when she drew herself from him was like a bayonetthrust even when she and stephanie had melted into the shadows he stood motionless under the spell of that caress its ecstasy still suffusing him he found himself following slowly in the direction they had taken in the hope of catching just one more glimpse of her but as he emerged from the darkness of the park he paused there across the street in the little open shrine set in the corner of the great cathedral she was kneeling before the shining figure of the madonna the candleglow that illumined the holy image and shone out so hopefully against the gloom showed her crouched close before the altar her dark head bowed in uttermost dejection outside and barely revealed stood the tall gaunt bajan woman silent watchful and forbidding with a painful grip at his throat kirk watched until the girl rose and hurried away into the shadows then he too turned and made his way up the street but he went slowly unseeingly as if he had beheld a vision for the first time in his life he was a prey to fear a thousand panics clamored at him his mind began working with the exaggerated speed of a person in dire peril once more as upon that night when he had first called at her fathers house he turned abruptly at the corner to stare at her window and again he surprised a figure skulking after him without a moments hesitation he made after it at a run but the fellow dodged into the plaza and disappeared among the shrubbery not caring to pursue the chase into those lurking shadows kirk desisted certain only of one thing that he was not allan who was trailing him he recalled the oftrepeated threats of ramon alfarez and returned to his quarters by way of the lighted thoroughfares xxiv a business proposition edith cortlandts interview with the rival candidates for the panamanian presidency formed but a part of her plan she next held a long conversation with colonel jolson to the end that on friday morning runnels heard a rumor that threw him into the greatest consternation it was to the effect that instead of his succeeding to the office of superintendent he was to retain his old post and that colonel jolsons brotherinlaw was to supersede him although the word was not authoritative it came with sufficient directness to leave him aghast if true it was of course equivalent to his discharge for it meant that he could not even continue in his former position without putting himself in a light intolerable to any man of spirit since he was entitled to the promotion had been promised it in fact and had made his plans accordingly there was no course open except resignation if he did not resign voluntarily he knew that his new superior would eventually force him to do so for blakeley would build up an organization of his own and in it there would be no place for one who had aspired to the highest office inasmuch as his assistant was concerned in this threatened calamity runnels made haste to lay the matter before him at first kirk was inclined to take it as a joke but his friend quickly brought him to a more serious frame of mind no he said blakeley has finally put it over hes wanted this position for a long time and i guess the cortlandts werent strong enough to prevent it or else they have broken with the colonel didnt he promise you the job sure but what are promises ive been doublecrossed thats all it means i must quit of course im trying to figure out what it will mean to me runnels smiled grimly the same thing it would mean to me if i stayed id go back to my desk in a month id have a row with blakeley no matter what i did then id be fired and have a tough time getting a job with another railroad of course the cortlandts might do more for you than they would for me and you might be able to hang on then this would seem to end our fine hopes eh rather runnels broke out bitterly ive worked like a nigger kirk and i deserve promotion if anybody ever did this other fellow is a dub he has proven that why ive forgotten more railroading than hell ever know every man on the system hates him and likes me and on top of it all i was promised the job its tough on the wife and the kid he stopped to swallow his emotion he was a singlepurposed somewhat serious man a little lacking in resilience and he could not meet misfortune with kirks careless selfconfidence i gave this job the best i had in me he went on for i had the idea that i was doing something patriotic something for my country thats the way they used to talk about this canal you know ive put in four years of hell ive lost step with the world ive lost my business connections in the states and i havent saved up any money i cant quit and yet ill have to for if im fired itll mean ill have to go back there and start at the bottom again those people dont know anything about these damned politics theyll think i made a failure here in government work and ill have to live it down still i suppose i ought not to kick its happening all the time to other fellows who came down here with hopes as high as mine fellows who have given even more to the job than i have what are you going to do kirk started oh i dont know i was thinking about you this job doesnt worry me for im on my feet at last and i know i have the goods with me they can have my position and welcome now about you i havent spent much of that lottery coin its in the bank all that allan hasnt used and half of it is yours if youll take it you and mrs runnels and the kid and allan and i and one other party will hike back home and get something else to do what do you say runnels voice shook as he answered by jove youre the real stuff anthony ill think it over he turned away as if ashamed of his show of feeling only to whirl about with the question who is this other party my wife good lord youre not married no but im going to be you talk about your troubles now listen to mine ill make you weep like a fog briefly he told his friend of the blow that had so suddenly fallen upon him you are up against it old man agreed runnels when he had heard all garavel has set his heart on the presidency and hell pay any price to get it its the same all over central america these people are mad on politics there are never more than two parties you know the wanters and the hasers the wanters are out and the hasers are in thats what makes these wicked little revolutions at every change of the moon it isnt a question of policy at all now if miss gertrudis were an american girl she might rebel elope do something like that but shes been reared with the spanish notions of obedience and i dare say she will submit tamely because she doesnt know how to put up a fight thats an admirable characteristic in a wife but not very helpful in a sweetheart well shes half american said kirk what do you mean by that i mean the game isnt over i carried the ball forty yards once for a touchdown in the last ten seconds of play and yale won i had good interference then and i need it now somebodyll have to run ahead of me runnels smiled i guess you can count on me what is the plan for the next halfhour the two talked earnestly their heads together their voices low i dont believe it will work my boy runnels said at last i know these people better than you and yet lord if it does come off he whistled softly well they may kick the political props out from under us but there will be an awful crash when we hit now dont mention this rumor about blakeley i want to see steve cortlandt first cortlandt bytheway do you happen to remember that hes to be our guest for supper tomorrow night kind of a joke now trying to thank him for what hes done isnt it not at all it may be our one chance of salvation he may be the one person who can help us well kirk reflected i have a good deal to thank him for i suppose outside of this and ill go through with my part he proceeded at once to put his plan into execution his first step being to rent a room at the tivoli taking particular care to select one on the first floor in the north wing that evening he and allan moved it was a simple process yet he felt that he was engaged in the most momentous act of his hie as to its outcome much depended upon runnels and much more upon himself so much in fact that when he came to look at the matter coldly he confessed the hope of success was slender but such as it was he clung to it desperately runnels telephoned during the evening that he had been equal to his part of the task so there remained nothing to do but wait for the hour of the dance over and over anthony asked himself if he were not foolish to pin his faith to so slight a chance but he could find no answer he slept little amid his new surroundings that night and awoke saturday morning thrilled with the certainty that his lifes crisis was but a few hours away it was considerably after dark on saturday evening that john weeks american consul at colon received a caller who came to him direct from the royal mail steamer just docked at first sight the stranger did not impress mr weeks as a man of particular importance his face was insignificant and his paleblue eyes showed little force his only noticeable feature was displayed when he removed his hat then it could be seen that a wide white scar ran from just over his temple to a point back of his right ear he made his name known as williams which of course meant nothing to the consul and while drinking one of weeks highballs inquired idly about the country the climate and the people as if in no hurry to come to his point weeks watched him shrewdly convinced at last by his visitors excessive caution that his first judgment had been wrong and that the man was more knowing than he seemed mr williams was likewise studying the fat man and when he had satisfied himself came out openly with these words im looking for a chap named wellar he landed here some time late in november friend of yours um m not exactly mr williams ran a hand meditatively over the ragged scar on his scalp as if from force of habit wellar i never heard of him he may have travelled under another name ever hear of a fellow called locke the consuls moist lips drew together his red eyes gleamed watchfully maybe i have and maybe i havent said he why do you want him i heard he was here id enjoy meeting him again what does he look like mr williams rattled off a description of kirk anthony so photographic that the consul suddenly saw a great light yes i know him all right he confessed warmly hes a good friend of mine too in fact he lived with me for a while misconstruing the eager expression that came to his callers face he rose heavily and thrust out a thick wet hand dont lets beat about the bush mr anthony your son is safe and well and making a name for himself im happy to say i helped him not much to be sure but all i could yes sir i acknowledge the corn and im glad to meet you at last i have been waiting for you to arrive and im glad you dropped in on me i have a lot of things to talk about but the other stared upward impatiently no no youve got me wrong im a detective and im after your friend wellar alias locke alias anthony hes wanted for embezzlement and assault and a few other things and im going to take him the indistinctive mr williams spoke sharply and his pale blue eyes were suddenly hard and bright weeks stared openmouthed for an instant then youre really not darwin k anthony he gasped certainly not heres the warrant im sorry this chap is your pal but my pal hell i hate him like the smallpox good thing you spoke or id have sold you a cocoanut grove i knew he was wrong embezzler eh well well eighty thousand thats all and hes got it on him youre wrong there he was broke when he landed i ought to know oh no he came down on the santa cruz ive seen the purser he travelled under the name of jefferson locke theres no mistake and he couldnt have blown it all no its sewed into his shirt and im here to grab it weeks whistled in amazement he is a shrewd one eighty thou lord i wish id known that hes here all right working for the railroad and living at panama hes made good too and got some influential friends oh this is great working hey clever stall do you see that williams inclined his head for a fuller display of the disfiguration over his ear he hung that on me with a bottle i damn near died he laughed disagreeably hell go back and hell go back quick how do i get to panama weeks consulted his watch hastily youve missed the last train but well go over together in the morning i want to have a hand in this arrest for reasons of my own i dont like him or his influential friends he began to chuckle ponderously no i dont like his influential friends in particular while this scene was being enacted on the north side of the isthmus kirk anthony over at the tivoli hotel was making himself ready for the ball with particular pains even his personal appearance might have a bearing upon the outcome of this adventure and he dared not overlook the slightest advantage allan regarded him admiringly from many angles oh master hauntony he exclaimed rapturously you are beautiful thanks again thanks now can you remember to do as i have told you i would die dont say that again im too nervous here are your instructions once more keep both doors to this room locked and stand by the one to the veranda dont let any one in except mr runnels and the man hell bring dont leave this spot no matter what happens does that penetrate your teakwood dome does your ivory cueball encompass that thought i shall watch this hapartment carefully never fear but i do fear im scared to death my hands are go cold they are brittle remember when i knock so let me in instantly and keep your wits about you hallan never fails sar but what is coming to pahss never mind what is coming to pass this is going to be a big night my boy a very big night kirk strolled out into the hall and made his way to the lobby already the orchestra was tuning up the wide porches were filling with welldressed people while a stream of coaches at the door was delivering the arrivals on the special from colon it was a very animated crowd sprinkled plentifully with spanish people something quite unusual bytheway while the presence of many uniforms gave the affair almost the brilliance of a military function there were marine officers from bas obispo straight trim brown of cheek naval officers from the cruisers in the roadstead clad in their white trousers and bellboy jackets army officers detailed from washington on special duty others from the various parts of the work itself kirk wandered about through the confusion nodding to his friends chatting here and there his eyes fixed anxiously upon the door clifford approached and fell into conversation with him great doings eh i came up from the central just to see what these affairs are like did you see tonights paper no garavel is going to run for president this is a kind of political comingout party so i believe it looked like a fight between him and general alfarez but theyve patched it up and the general is going to withdraw garavel is to have uncle sams congratulations and cooperation its a joke isnt it this international good feeling excuse me anthony saw runnels searching the room with anxiety he hurried toward him and inquired breathlessly have you got him sure i showed him your room did you lock him in certainly not hell get away oh no hell be on the job has she come kirk shook his head gee im nervous he wiped his brow with a shaking hand dont weaken runnels encouraged im beginning to believe youll pull it off i told my wife all about it thought we might need her and shes perfectly crazy i never saw her so excited let me know as soon as you can which dance it will be this suspense gad there they are now go to it old man into the lobby came a mixed group in which were andres garavel his daughter ramon alfarez and the cortlandts kirks face was white as he went boldly to meet them but he did his best to smile unconcernedly he shook hands with edith and her husband bowed to gertrudis then turned to meet her fathers stare may i have a word with you sir garavel inclined his head silently as the others moved on he said this is hardly a suitable time or place mr anthony oh im not going to kick up a fuss i didnt answer your note because there was nothing to say you still wish me to cease my attentions i do it is her wish and mine then i shall do so of course if miss garavel is dancing tonight i would like your permission to place my name on her programme no exclaimed the banker purely to avoid comment every one knows i have been calling upon her and that report of our engagement got about considerably it would set people talking if she snubbed me that is the only reason i came to this dance believe me id rather have stayed away perhaps you are right let us have no unpleasantness and no gossip about the affair by all means i consent then garavels voice altered and he said with more of his natural geniality i am very glad you take the matter so sensibly mr anthony it was after all but a dream of youth and permit me to offer my congratulations upon the honor your country is about to bestow upon you conversing in a friendly manner they followed the rest of the party as the banker appeared upon the threshold of the ballroom a murmur ran through the crowd faces were turned in his direction whispers were exchanged showing that already the news had travelled conscious of this notice and its reason garavel drew himself up he walked with the tread of an emperor kirk ignored ramons scowl as he requested the pleasure of seeing chiquitas programme then pretended not to notice her start of surprise after a frightened look at her father she timidly extended the card to him and he wrote his name upon it as he finished he found mrs cortlandt regarding him will you dance with me he inquired yes i saved the fourth and the tenth as he filled in the allotted spaces she said in a low voice you are the boldest person did mr garavel give you leave to do that or of course thank you he made his way out of the press that had gathered and toward the open air he was shaking with nervousness and cursed all government hotels where a man is denied the solace of a drink runnels pounced upon him just outside well well quick did you make it number nine good i was gnawing my fingernails whew im glad that is over now pull yourself together and dont forget you have the first dance with mrs runnels there goes the music i im too rattled to dance anthony found his friends wife bubbling with excitement and scarcely able to contain herself oh ill never live through it i know she cried as soon as they were out upon the floor how can you be so calm im not im as panicky as you are and she poor little thing she seems frightened to death but isnt she beautiful mrs runnels admitted the fact cheerfully and at the same time noted how her partners muscles swelled and hardened as miss garavel glided past in the arms of ramon alfarez it gave her a thrill to see a real drama unfolding thus before her very eyes to kirk chiquita had never appeared so ravishing nor so purely spanish as tonight she was clad in some mysterious filmy white stuff that floated about her form like a mist the strangeness and brilliance of her surroundings had frightened her a little and the misery at her heart had filled her wide dark eyes with a plaintive melancholy but she was entirely the fine lady through it all and she accepted the prominence that was hers as the leading senorita of the republic with simple dignity and unconcern the women began to whisper her name the men followed her with admiring glances at every interval between dances she was besieged by gayly clad officers civilians in white the flower of her own people and of the american colony as well all eager to claim her attention or to share in her shy slow smile now and then her eyes strayed to kirk with a look that made his blood move quicker it boded well for the success of his plans and filled him with a fierce hot gladness but how the moments dragged general alfarez entered the room amid a buzz of comment then as he greeted his rival garavel with a smile and a handshake a round of applause broke forth the members of the commission sought them both out and congratulations were exchanged at last the garavel boom was launched in earnest mrs cortlandt expressed a desire to sit out the fourth dance so your engagement to miss garavel is broken she began when she and kirk had seated themselves in two of the big rockers that lined the porch all smashed to pieces runninggear broken steeringknuckle bent gasolene tank punctured i need a tow you take it calmly whats the use of struggling im no samson to go around pulling down temples did you expect her to yield so tamely i didnt know she had yielded in fact i havent had a chance to talk to her but she has mr garavel told me not an hour ago that as soon as he explained his wishes she consented to marry ramon without a protest a refusal would have meant the death of the old mans chances i presume she acted quite dutifully yes if she had refused ramon i doubt if we could have saved her father as it is the general withdraws and leaves the field clear the two young people are reunited quite as if you had never appeared and you my dear kirk now what about you oh i dont count i never have counted in anything you know thats the trouble with goodnatured people but is it true that garavel is practically elected general alfarez couldnt very well step in after he had publicly stepped out could he that would be a trifle too treacherous hed lose his support and our people could then have an excuse to take a hand im tremendously glad its all settled finally i assure you it was a strain and although im sorry you got your fingers pinched between the political wheels im relieved that the uncertainty is ended so far they had been speaking like mere acquaintances but now kirk turned upon her a trifle bitterly i think you worked it very cleverly mrs cortlandt he said of course i had no chance to win against a person of your diplomatic gifts i had my nerve to try she regarded him without offence at this candor then nodded yes you see it meant more to me than to you or to her with you two it is but a romance forgotten in a night i have pretty nearly outlived romance you think i will forget easily thats not flattering all men do you will even forget my part in the affair and we will be better friends than ever suppose i dont choose to accept what it pleases people to hand me my dear kirk she smiled you will have to in this case there is nothing else to do he shook his head i hoped we could be friends mrs cortlandt but it seems we cant be at this she broke out imperiously her eyes flashing i ask nothing you cant give i have never been denied and i wont be denied now you cant afford to break with me indeed why do you think that listen ive shown you what i can do in a few months in a year you can be a great success thats how big men are made they know the shortcuts you are too inexperienced yet to know what success and power mean but you are beginning to learn and when you have learned you will thank me for breaking up this foolish romance i dont ask you to forget your manhood i ask nothing i am content to wait you want to become a big man like your father well runnels will be out of the way soon blakeley amounts to nothing you will be the superintendent so thats not merely a rumor about blakeley runnels is fired eh yes if i choose not to give up chiq miss garavel then what it means the end of me here is that it if you choose why my dear you have no choice whatever in the matter it is practically closed you can do nothing although if you really intend to make trouble i shall walk inside when i leave and inform the old gentleman in which case he will probably send the girl home at once and take very good care to give you no further opportunity ramon is only too anxious to marry her as to this being the end of you here well i really dont see how it could be otherwise no kirk its for you to decide whether you wish to be shown the secret path up the mountain or to scale the cliffs unaided there are no conditions you merely mustnt play the fool and if i dont agree you will tell mr garavel that im going to make trouble he mused aloud watching her out of the corner of his eye she said nothing so he went on cautiously sparring for time well inasmuch as this seems to be a plain business proposition suppose i think it over when it comes time for our next dance ill say yes or no as you please very well the music has stopped wed better go in as they rose she laid her hand upon his arm and he felt it tremble as she exclaimed believe me kirk this isnt at all easy for me but i cant bear to lose xxv checkmate anthony had no partner for the eighth dance and was very glad of it for he could not have carried off the necessary small talk as it was he felt that his excitement must be patent to those around him his mind was filled with tormenting doubts his chance for success seemed so infinitely small his plan so extravagantly impracticable now that the time had come as the music ceased and the dancers came pouring out into the cool night air runnels approached with his wife well are you equal to it he asked kirk nodded he could not speak why you look as cold as ice exclaimed the woman halfresentfully im the only one who seems to feel it i im positively delirious my partners look at me in the strangest way as if they thought i were liable to become dangerous at any moment not too loud her husband cautioned then to kirk goodluck old man lord i need a bracer his words stuck in his throat and kirk realized that he was himself the calmest of the three together runnels and his wife strolled off through the crowd disappearing in the direction of the north wing of the hotel it seemed ages before the orchestra struck up kirk began to fear that something had happened to the musicians he edged closer to the door and searched out chiquita with his eyes there she was seated with her father colonel bland from gatun and some high officer or other probably an admiral ramon alfarez was draped artistically over the back of her chair curling his mustache tenderly and smiling vacantly at the conversation kirk ground his teeth together and set his feet as if for the sound of the referees whistle he heard the orchestra leader tap his musicstand then as the first strains of the waltz floated forth he stepped into the ballroom and made toward his sweetheart all at once he found that his brain was clear his heartbeats measured of course she saw him coming she had waited all the long evening for this moment he saw her hand flutter uncertainly to her throat then as he paused before her she rose without a word his arm encircled her waist her little cold palm dropped into his as lightly as a snowflake and they glided away together he found himself whispering her name over and over again passionately why why did you do this senor she protested faintly it is very hard for me it is the last time i shall ever hold you this way she faltered her breath caught please my father is looking ramon have you agreed to marry him yes no no oh i have prayed to the virgin every hour i cannot and yet i must see i cannot waltz senor i have sstepped upon you take me back to my seat for answer he pressed her closer to his breast holding her up without effort the incense from her hair was robbing him of his wits his old wild desire to pick her up and carry her away swept over him dont esqueeze me so she exclaimed i cannot hold back the tears i am so unhappy if i could die quickly now let us go out on the porch no no we must remain in my fathers sight will you take me to my seat no i want you to listen carefully to what im going to say he spoke low and earnestly try to show nothing in your face for they are watching us seeing her more composed and attentive he went on dont stop dancing now when i tell you chiquita dear you must marry me tonight right away i have arranged everything no dont look up at me until i have finished try to smile ive planned it all out and everything is in readiness i have a room just around the corner of the veranda theres a judge waiting for us and runnels and his wife you are mad she gasped no no well slip through one of the french windows and well be back again before they miss us nobody will know i tell you theyre waiting if we are missed theyll think it doesnt matter what they think youll be my wife and ramon cant marry you then well say nothing about it until your father is elected president senor one cannot be married in a moment i am catholic the banns ive thought of all that but a civil marriage is binding well have the religious ceremony afterward meanwhile this will stop ramon at least i promise not to see you again until you send for me until your fathers hopes are realized you may wait as long as you wish and nobody will know they tricked you chiquita dear i cant explain but it wasnt all politics by any means oh girl dont you understand i love you love you its our only chance the words were tumbling from his lips incoherently he was pleading as if for his life while she clung to him to support herself through it all their feet moved rhythmically their bodies swayed to the cadences of the waltz as they circled the ballroom he guided her among the other whirling figures under the very eyes of her father and her fiance while more than one of the onlookers commented upon the handsome appearance of these young people the one so stalwart and blond and northern the other so chic and dark and tropical he knew it was her lifelong loyalty her traditional sense of obedience that made her hesitate it was treachery to both of us he urged they imposed upon your father but when he has won hell forgive us i know what im saying mrs cortlandt told me tonight mother of god she exclaimed faintly is it that i am dreaming they are waiting for us the dance is half over already i love you better than all the world do you remember two nights ago you kissed me then and i i cant live without you well go away together you and i through all the world just we two she trembled against him quick he cried in her ear were coming to the spot they cant see us now if you feel weak hold to my arm until we are outside she gave a hysterical choking sob that was half a sigh then her eyes flashed upward to his they were wide and bright and shining her lips were parted her body was lithe and full of life she slipped from his embrace whispering yes yes quickly senor and the next instant they were out upon the wide gallery with the dance behind them hurree hurree or they will follow together they fled along the north wing of the hotel the girl was panting with one hand held to her bare throat but there was no need for him to help her for she ran like a fawn here he swung her around the corner and rapped sharply at a door quickly quickly she moaned for the love of with terrific force the door was fairly jerked from its hinges and slammed to behind them the next moment allans big body was leaning against it as if the wall were about to fall inward upon him runnels leaped forward with an exclamation his wife stood staring her face as white as snow with them was the genial grayhaired judge from colon whom kirk had met at the wayfarers club on the night of his arrival you made it runnels cried triumphantly miss garavel his wife echoed thank heaven you came quick the music will stop judge this is miss garavel you must marry us just as fast as you can i presume you consent the judge asked with a smile at the girl i i want to be happy she said simply her bosom was heaving her pansy eyes were fastened upon the magistrate with a look of pleading that drove the smile from his lips she clung to anthonys arm as if she feared these strangers might tear him away you understand judge shes of age so am i they want to force her to marry a man she doesnt the muffled strains of music ceased there came the faint clapping of hands madre de dios miss garavel cried we are too late she beat her little palms together in desperation there was a breathless interval then the music began again and to its throbbing measures the marriage ceremony was performed as the last word was pronounced mrs runnels burst into tears and hid her face against her husbands breast runnels himself held forth a shaking hand to kirk then patted the bride clumsily upon her shoulder i know you will be happy now mrs anthony he said with an incoherent cry of delight kirk folded his wife in his arms and she kissed him before them all senor i will love you always she said shyly during the progress of this scene allan allan of jamaica had stood frozen with amazement a doorknob wedged firmly into the small of his back his eyes distended and rolling but when mrs runnels collapsed as at a signal he too dissolved in tears oh glory to god boss he sobbed you is a beautiful bridegroom come we must get back the music has stopped again kirk turned to the judge nothing is to be said until miss gar mrs anthony gives the word you understand i cant thank you all half enough now allan see if the coast is clear quickly he was still in a panic for there yet remained a chance of discovery and ruin one more instant of suspense then the two stepped out the door closed softly behind them and they strolled around the corner of the north wing and into the crowd it had all happened so quickly that even yet they were dazed and disbelieving my wife kirk whispered while a tremendous rush of emotion swept over him she trembled in answer like a windshaken leaf youre mine chiquita they cant take you away his voice broke i am still dreaming what have i done ohh they will know in my face they will read the truth but i do not care is it indeed true they were at the entrance to the ballroom now through which they had come a few minutes before and pausing she gave him a halfserious halftimid glance senor i do not know if some time you will be sorry for this action but i shall never cease loving you i prayed hourly to the blessed virgin and she heard now i shall perish until you come when you give me leave through steel and stone through fire and water quick for the one more time call me that she hesitated blushing vividly i will hear it in my dreams my wife he whispered tenderly ho chiquita mia her father cried as they came to him there you are then i have missed you his eyes smouldered as he gazed suspiciously at kirk ah but i was too warm she said easily yonder by the door we have been standing in the night breeze and where is ramon he is looking for you one would think him a jealous husband already she exclaimed lightly then extending her hand coolly to kirk i thank you senor for the dance her husband bowed i shall not soon forget it to the father he added in a low voice i thank you also for your courtesy we have been discussing your daughters marriage during the dance and it is my one greatest hope that she will never regret it the banker acknowledged the words ceremoniously love is a thing that comes and goes marriage alone can bind it some day you will thank me and then perhaps you will honor our house again eh i shall be happy to come whenever you wish as he walked away the banker said with relief he takes it well he is proud almost like a spaniard kirk moved through the crowd as if in a trance but he was beginning to realize the truth now it surged over him in great waves of gladness he longed to shout his news aloud what luck was his the world was made for him there was no such thing as adversity or failure chiquita was his wife all christendom might go to pot for all he cared that marvellous fact was unalterable yes and he could speak his mind to mrs cortlandt his tentative acceptance of the terms she made sickened him he wanted to rid himself of this false position as soon as possible what mattered her threats what did he care for the things she could give or withhold when all the glad open world was beckoning to him and to his bride success riches he could win them for himself chiquita was all and more than they and he was a god in the midst of his rhapsody he heard a bellboy speaking his name and smiled at him vacantly as he turned away but the negro followed him persistently saying something about a letter letter i have no time to write letters oh i beg pardon letter for me he took the missive from the silver tray and stuffed it absentmindedly into a pocket fumbling meanwhile for a tip i dont seem to have any money my boy but money after all means nothing it is himpartant sar oh yes the letter very well he opened the envelope and pretended to read but in reality the sheet held nothing for him but a ravishing mischievous face with pansy eyes he must have stood staring unseeingly at it for several seconds then the dancing visions faded and the scrawl stood out plainly williams detective st louis arrived at colon this evening on the prince joachim youd better take it on the run it was written upon tivoli paper but the hand was strange and it was not signed well kirk came suddenly to himself and a spasm of disgust seized him what a rotten inconvenience he said aloud but before he had time to measure the effect of this new complication the swelling music reminded him that this dance belonged to mrs cortlandt and that her answer was due she was waiting for him in the gallery and motioned him to the chair adjoining hers i cant twostep and talk at the same time she said and here well be quite private kirk remained standing what i have to say wont take long ive made up my mind and i edith interrupted him with a lightness that her look belied oh lets not discuss it i dont want you to answer i dont want to think of it i just want to forget and to plan you understand how i feel she faced him with eyes bright and lustrous her red lips parted in a smile she was a very beautiful woman kirk realized a very compelling unusual woman and one whose capabilities seemed unbounded he began dimly to perceive that all women have great capabilities for good or evil depending largely upon the accident of their environment and with this thought came the feeling that he must speak frankly now or prove himself worse than base if only she were of the weakly feminine type his task would be far easier but it was hard to strike her for the very reason that he knew she would take the blow bravely and meet its full force i must answer he said i dont want to pretend im not good at lying i cant go through with any such arrangement as you suggested why the very idea is positively fierce youve been awfully nice to me but i had no idea of this besides cortlandts an awfully decent chap and and well he concluded lamely there are lots of reasons oh no there is only one reason all the others count for nothing she spoke in a voice that he could scarcely hear perhaps but its just impossible you know what it means she stared at him with hard level eyes im not a moderate person i cant do things by halves no i see you dont think of that you are mad over this garavel girl but you cant get her something in his dazzled lovefoolish smile enraged her so you are planning even now well then understand there are practical reasons political reasons why you cant have her if garavel were insane enough to consent others would not she is part of the machine and there are those who will not consent to see all their work spoiled that is altogether apart from me you understand i can build and i can destroy theres nothing more to say he interrupted her quietly so id better excuse myself yes i would prefer to be alone when he had bowed himself away she crushed the fan in her hand staring out across the lights of the city below and it was thus that cortlandt found her a few moments later as he idled along the veranda his hands in his pockets a cigarette between his lips he dropped into the empty chair beside her saying hello thought you had this with anthony i had whats the trouble there is no trouble she began to rock while he studied her profile then conscious of his look she inquired arent you dancing no just looking on as usual i prefer to watch you have broken your fan it seems he flung his cigarette into the darkness and reaching out took the fan from her hand she saw that his lips were drawn back in a peculiar smile well is that so strange she answered sharply you seem she broke off and looked deliberately away from him row eh he inquired softly she could barely hold back her hatred of the man he had worked powerfully upon her nerves of late and she was half hysterical why do you take pleasure in annoying me she cried what ails you these last few weeks i cant stand it i wont oh pardon one quarrel an evening is enough i should have known better she turned upon him at this but once more checked the words that clamored for utterance her look however was a warning she bit her lip and said nothing too bad you and he dont hit it off better he likes me there was no answer hes giving me a party after the dance sort of a gratitude affair a delicate way to acknowledge a debt eh she saw that his hand shook as he lit a fresh cigarettes and the strangeness of his tone made her wonder you know very well it is runnels doing she said oh there are six of them in it altogether but anthony originated the little surprise its intended for you of course i dont see it are you going i accepted what do you mean by that bah they wont give it he said harshly and why not i think it is rather nice of those chaps of course runnels would like to ingratiate himself with you funny spectacle eh me the guest of anthony there was a trace of anxiety in her voice as she answered and though she spoke carelessly she did not meet his eyes i id rather youd make an excuse ill have to go home alone you know he raised his brows mockingly my dear im to be the honored guest suit yourself of course a marine officer approached mopping his face and engaged her in conversation whereupon cortlandt rose languidly and strolled away through the crowd that came eddying forth from the ballroom meanwhile kirk had found runnels who was looking for him eager to express his congratulations and to discuss their exploit in detail ive just taken the wife home he explained i never saw anybody so excited if shed stayed here shed have given the whole thing away sure why she wasnt half so much affected by her own marriage i i havent pulled myself together yet funny thing ive just been watching my wife dancing with the man she is engaged to gee its great to be married shes the dearest thing i ever saw and wasnt she game alice will cry for weeks over this why its the sobfest of her lifetime shes bursting with grief and rapture i hope your wife can keep a secret better than mine otherwise there will be a tremendous commotion before tomorrows sun sets i suppose now ill have to hang around home with my finger on my lip saying hist until the news comes out whew i am thirsty anthony did not tell his friend about the detective in colon and his mysterious warning partly because he was not greatly disturbed by it and trusted to meeting the difficulty in proper time and partly because his mind was once more too full of his great goodfortune to permit of any other interest now that he had some one to whom he could talk freely he let himself go and he was deep in conversation when stephen cortlandt strolled up and stopped for an instant to say quite a lively party isnt it kirk noticed how sallow he had grown in the past few months and how he had fallen off in weight he looked older too his cheeks had sunken in until they outlined his jaws sharply he seemed far from well a nervous twitching of his fingers betokened the strain he had been under he was quite as immaculate as usual however quite as polished and collected how is our little stag coming on he asked fine everything is ready said runnels you wont expect an elaborate layout its mostly cold storage you know but well at least be able to quench our thirst at the central then its really coming off i was afraid youd forgotten it cortlandt cast a curious glance at kirk who exclaimed heartily well hardly then as their prospective guest moved off what a strange remark yes said runnels hes a queer fellow but then you know hes about as emotional as a toad xxvi the crash kirk had no further chance of speaking with his wife for after the dance she was whisked away leaving him nothing but the memory of an adoring blissful glance as she passed with runnels and cortlandt and the rest he was driven to the hotel central where they found a very attractive table set in a private diningroom it was a lively party and kirks secret elation enabled him to play the part of host with unforced geniality the others joined him in a hearty effort to show their guest the high regard in which they held him and if cortlandt did not enjoy himself it was entirely his own fault toward kirk however he preserved a peculiar attitude which only the young mans selfabsorption prevented him from noticing if he had been less jubilant he must have felt the unnatural aloofness of the other mans bearing but even had he done so he would doubtless have attributed it to cortlandts wellrecognized frigidity at the propitious moment runnels who had reluctantly agreed to share the social responsibility made a little speech explaining that he and his boys had been sensible from the first of their guests interest in them and were deeply grateful for it they were all working together he said and what helped one helped another they had banded together and now tendered him a token of their regard in a form which he could preserve its a little late he smiled in view of the rumor that has been going round within the last day or so but no matter what happens to any one of us in the readjustment of our department we appreciate the help you have given us collectively he handed a handsome lovingcup to cortlandt who thanked him appropriately then waited courteously for the party to break up but anthony rose saying i simply have to say a word on my own account fellows for i owe mr cortlandt more than any of you the object of these remarks shot a swift questioning glance from his stony eyes and raised a hand as if to check him but kirk ran on unheeding i want to thank him before all of you for what he has done for me personally when i landed in panama i was a rotter id never worked and never intended to i rather despised people who did i represented the unearned increment i was broke and friendless and what ideas i had were all wrong this is something you dont know perhaps but no sooner had i landed than i got into trouble of the worst sort and mr cortlandt got me out he was my bailbond he put me up at his hotel gave me clothes and paid my way until i got started i was a stranger mind you but hes been just like one of my own people and if i ever succeed in doing anything really worth while it will be due to the start he gave me though the words were commonplace enough they carried a sincere message and cortlandt saw by the faces about him that the others were pleased his own gaunt features turned more sallow than ever the memory of what he had heard on the porch of his own house a few afternoons ago of what he had seen at other times of his wifes telltale behavior on this very evening swept over him fanning anew the sullen emotions he had cherished all these months how far would this fellow dare to go he wondered what motive inspired him thus to pose before his friends and openly goad his victim under the cloak of modesty and gratitude was he enhancing his triumph by jeering at the husband of whom he had made a fool he dropped his eyes to hide the fury in them i want to give you a little remembrance of my own anthony was speaking directly to him it isnt much but it means a good deal to me and i hope it will have some sort of personal association for you mr cortlandt he drew from his pocket a plush case and took from it a very handsome thin swiss watch with the letters s c artfully enamelled upon the back runnels who knew the local shops wondered how it had been procured in panama the others openly expressed their admiration cortlandt accepted the gift mechanically then as it touched his flesh a sudden color mounted to his cheeks only to recede leaving them bloodless again he stared at it uncertainly then looked up and ran his eyes slowly around the table they came to rest at last upon the broad frame of the giver crowned with its handsome suntanned face and closecropped shock of yellow hair anthony was all that he was not the very embodiment of youth vigor and confidence while he was prematurely aged worn and impotent they noted how ill he appeared as if he had suffered from a jungle fever how his wellcut evening clothes refused to conceal the frail lines of his figure and how the hollows in his cheeks added to his age but for the first time since they had known him they saw that his eyes were alive and burning dully i really didnt expect this he began slowly as he rose anthony exaggerates he is too kind but since he has chosen to publicly call attention to our relations i will confess that what he tells you is all true he was everything he says when he first came to panama he did get into trouble and i helped him out he had no money and i put him up as my guest he needed work and i helped to place him through my assistance partly at any rate he has made a man of himself he has been welcome at my house at my table he has come and gone as he pleased like one of the family you might say but those are little things they count for nothing he smiled in a way that seemed ironical his lips writhed away from his teeth until his visage resembled a deathhead his tone had gripped his hearers and anthony stirred uneasily thinking this an odd way of accepting a gift unclasping his long white fingers cortlandt held up the watch to public view in payment for my poor friendship he has given me this magnificent thing of gold and jewels the finest i ever saw i never counted upon such gratitude it is too much and yet a man cannot refuse the gift of his friend and not seem ungracious can he somewhere in the orient they have a custom of exchanging gifts no man may accept a thing of value without making adequate return and it has always struck me as a wise practice he turned full upon kirk for the first time since he had begun speaking and his voice rose a tone as he said i cant let the obligation rest entirely upon me we have been friends anthony and i am going to give you something in return which i have prized highly it would be counted of great value by some once more he paused and drew his lips back in that grimace of mockery it could no longer be termed a smile it is this i am going to give you my wife you have had her from the first and now she is yours for one frightful moment there was no sound even the mens breathing was hushed and they sat slackjawed stunned halfminded to believe this some hideous incredible jest but the maniacal light in cortlandts eyes and anthonys chalkwhite frozen countenance soon showed them the truth some one gasped another laughed hysterically the sound breaking in his throat cortlandt turned away gloatingly kirk was the last to recover his powers but when they did revive they came with a prodigious rush he plunged upward out of his chair with a cry like a wounded animal and the others rose with him the table rocked something smashed a chair was hurled backward the room broke into instant turmoil kirk felt hands upon him and then went blind with fury struggling in a passion too strong for coherent speech he was engulfed in chaos he felt things break beneath his touch felt bodies give way before him how or when cortlandt left the room he never knew eventually he found himself pinned in his chair with runnels white face close against his own and other hands upon his arms his first frenzy quickly gave way to a sickening horror some one was commanding him to be still to create no scene but those were not words they were simply mutterings that conveyed no meaning its a lie the mans crazy he cried hoarsely then as his companions drew away from him he rose to his feet why are you looking at me like that i tell you its a damned lie i never runnels turned to the table and with shaking hand put a glass to his lips and gulped its contents wade and kimble exchanged glances then avoiding each others eyes took their hats from the hooks behind them wait bring him back kirk mumbled ill get him and make him say its a lie but still no one answered no one looked at him god you dont believe it im going home fellows im kind of sick kimble said one of the others murmured unintelligibly and wetting a napkin bound up his hand which was bleeding they continued to watch kirk as if fearful of some insane action yet they refused to meet his eyes squarely there was no sympathy in their faces the knowledge of what these actions meant came to him slowly was it possible that his friends believed this incredible accusation the thought made him furious too agitated as yet to realize that such a charge made under such circumstances could not well prove less than convincing as he began to collect himself he saw his plight more clearly his first thought had been that cortlandt was insane but the mans actions were not those of a maniac no he actually believed and and these fellows believed also no doubt they would continue to think him guilty in spite of all that he could do or say for after this shocking denunciation it would take more than mere words to prove that he had not betrayed his friend and benefactor it was incredible unbearable he wanted to shout his innocence at them to beat it into their heads but the more he expostulated the more distant they became one by one they took their hats and went out mumbling goodnight to one another as if intending to go home singly in order to avoid all discussion of this thing that had fallen among them runnels alone remained you dont believe i did that anthony asked in a strained voice i i think i do there was a miserable silence and then it isnt the thing itself you know so much as the rotten underhanded advantage you took if hed been a stranger now honestly isnt it true kirk shook his head listlessly i wouldnt lie to you runnels drew a deep breath oh come now the man must have known what he was saying do you realize what it means if well if he were mistaken it would be bad enough if he were not but this would be ten times worse dont you see i dont see much of anything yet im stunned ugh to make it public that way he must be made of iron runnels shuddered then with cold eyes on kirk continued he must have known anthony men dont do things like that on suspicion he misunderstood our friendship said kirk heavily then roused himself for a last plea look here he cried you know cortlandt and you know me the man was insanely jealous i know it sounds weak but its the truth and its all i can say ill go mad if you doubt me runnels face showed the pain he felt but his eyes looked incredulous another thing kirk went on desperately do you suppose that if what you believe were true i could have the inhuman nerve to come here tonight that would make me a fool or a monster i dont know said runnels you do know you know me if we werent such friends i wouldnt argue with you like this but i cant bear it and tonight of all he broke off sharply my god id forgotten that im married suppose gertrudis hears of this if it ever gets to her i believe i could kill him dont talk like that i never really thought i could take a persons life but if she heard she might believe everybody else seems to believe understand she hardly knows me she might she might anthony seized his temples in despair runnels took a sudden illogical decision he never knew exactly what had influenced him but his whole past knowledge of anthony surged up in him with a force that he could not resist he found that he could not really believe him capable of this abomination any more than he could believe it of himself little of our life is ruled by reason and it is something else than logic that produces the last feeling of conviction here this something was present where logic was lacking he laid his hand on kirks shoulder take it easy old man he said i believe you ive always known that they didnt get along together although well i wont try to understand it he may not do anything further and these fellows wont mention what happened here they cant you know were only half married moaned kirk hardly heeding him women are apt to be jealous arent they runnels what do you suppose shed do dont worry about that im thinking about cortlandt if he finds out hes mistaken what will he do hell have to find out im going to tell him his wife will tell him good god do you see what an awful light it puts me in you dont doubt me do you really old man no but what a night this has been it seems a year old come along now you must get out of here you must turn in oh i dont feel as if id ever sleep again until this thing is cleared up his anguish swept over him in a fresh tide those boys think i did that trick to the man who befriended me well dont lets talk about it any more we cant stay here all night anyhow the waiters are wondering what this row is about i think wed better take a walk runnels dragged his companion out trying to calm him as best he could in passing through the deserted lobby of the hotel they saw clifford idling about but they were too much absorbed to wonder what had kept him up so late by the clock across the plaza they saw it was two hours after midnight as they stepped into the street then finding no coaches in sight they set out to walk toward ancon both badly in need of the open air a moment later clifford followed them taking pains to keep at a distance now that the full import of cortlandts accusation had sunk into his mind kirk lapsed into a mood of sullen bitterness he said little but his set face worried his companion who was loath to bid him goodnight even when they were close to the tivoli after they had parted runnels was upon the point of going back and offering to spend the night with him but thought better of it after all he reflected his apprehensions were probably quite unfounded anthony was too sensible a chap to do anything he might repent of now that his gust of passion had died down so he went on homeward wondering vaguely how cortlandt would dare to meet his wife or if he really found himself mistaken how he could ever summon courage to look his hosts in the face instead of passing through the office kirk mounted to the porch of the tivoli and entered his room from the outside as he and chiquita had done earlier that evening he found allan waiting and bursting with a desire to gossip but cut him short get my streetclothes im going out he tore the white tie from his throat as if it were choking him it is too late sar you will be hexposing yourself to a fever in the mist expostulated the boy but kirk would not hear argument come along if you want to i cant sleep i want to walk walk until im tired mystified and frightened at this behavior allan obeyed never have i hobserved you so hangry boss he observed is it ramon alfarez his eyes began to roll in excitement for the spectacle of his masters agitation never failed to work upon him powerfully no not ramon another ive been hurt allan i cant explain for you wouldnt understand but ive been hurt the negros lips drew apart in an expression of apelike ferocity and he began to chatter threats of vengeance to which kirk paid little heed a few moments later they went out quietly and together took the rock road down toward the city the one silent and desperate the other whining like a hound nearing a scent xxvii a question edith cortlandt did not retire immediately upon her return from the ball her anger at anthonys behavior kept her wakeful and the night had turned off so dead and humid that sleep was in any case a doubtful possibility it was the lifeless period between seasons when the trades had died out or at best veered about bafflingly too faint to offer relief the cooling rains had not set in as yet and a great blanket of heat wrapped the city in its smothering folds the air was still and tainted like that of a sickroom through mrs cortlandts open windows came hardly a sound even from the sea below rose only a faint hissing as if the rocks at the waters edge were superheated earlier in the evening the temperature had been bearable but now it had reached an intensity to strain tired nerves to the snappingpoint it was the sort of night in which ailing children die and strong minds feel the burden of living no relief was to be had and the slightest physical effort was a misery she was still sitting there at a late hour when she heard the outside door close and cortlandts footsteps mounting the stairs she was glad he had his own room and never entered hers at such an hour for even to talk with him in her present state of mind and body would have been more than she could bear she was unreasonably annoyed therefore when he came boldly into her chamber without even knocking for all the world like a welcome lover to conceal her irritation she kept her face turned from him and continued fanning herself listlessly she was reclining in a wicker chair lightly clad in a filmy silk negligee which she mechanically drew closer rather late for goodnights she said coldly ive just come from anthonys supperparty his voice made her look round sharply she saw that his linen ordinarily stiff and immaculate was sodden and crumpled his collar limp his forehead glistening with drops of moisture she could not remember ever having seen him in such a state his appearance affected her queerly in him this dishevelment was shocking what ails you stephen she cried have you been drinking no i didnt drink much i brought you something he took the lovingcup from its flannel bag and set it upon the table they gave me this it is very pretty though i dont care for such things and this too he tossed the watch with its enamelled monogram into her lap ah thats very handsome yes i thought youd like it its from anthony he laughed then shuddered as though a cold wind had bitten through his sodden garments why you seem excited over these souvenirs you surely expected he broke in a thing he rarely did while she was speaking anthony made a speech when he gave it to me a very nice speech full of friendship and love and gratitude he repeated kirks words as he remembered them what do you think of that i think he expressed himself very frankly but why do you tell me now when the morning will do just as well im prostrated with this heat he actually acknowledged his debt in public mrs cortlandts eyes widened this was not the man she knew at this moment he was actually insistent almost overbearing and he was regarding her with that same ironical sneer that had roused her anger earlier in the evening well come to the point she cried irritably i dont understand what you are getting at if you didnt wish to accept anything from him why did you go he began to chuckle apparently without reason his shoulders shook feebly at first then more violently his flat chest heaved and he hiccoughed as if from physical weakness it was alarming and she rose staring at him affrightedly the sight of her increased his mirthless laughter he continued to shudder and shake in uncontrollable hysteria but his eyes were bright and watchful oh i i took it all in i let him pput the noose around his own neck and tie the knot then i hung him his convulsive giggling was terrible forecasting as it did his immediate breakdown stephen she exclaimed in a shocked tone convinced that his mind was going you are ill you need a doctor i will call joceel she laid her hand on his arm but he sniggered nno no im all right i tttt a stutteringfit seized him then with an effort of will he calmed himself dont think im crazy i was never more sane never cooler in here he tapped his head with his finger but im tired thats all tired of waiting wont you go to your room and let me call a doctor not yet wait he told them what i had done for him how id made a man of him when he was broke and friendless how id taken him into my home like one of my family and then i went him one better i acknowledged it all and made them hear it from my lips too then he paused and she steeled herself to witness another spectacle of his pitiable loss of selfcontrol but instead he grew icy and corpselike with lips drawn back in a grin what do you think i said cant you guess i couldnt let him get away with that could i i played with him the way you have played with me think her face went suddenly ashen he stood before her grimly triumphant enjoying his sense of mastery and deliberately prolonging her suspense well i told him before them all that i intended to give him something in return and i did i gave him you she stared at him uncomprehendingly he nodded i said hed had you from the first and that now id give you to him she gave an unintelligible cry standing now as if petrified he went on i knew all the time that i was in the way but my work is done at last so ill step out but you both got more than you bargained for didnt you god you didnt tell him that you didnt say that before those men ohh she shrank back drawing the gauzy silk robe closer about her breast her hands were shaking her hair which had fallen free when she rose cascaded about her neck and shoulders she let her eyes wander about the room as if to assure herself that this was not some hideous nightmare then she roused to sudden action seizing him by the shoulders she shook him roughly with far more than her natural strength voicing furious words which neither of them understood oh i did it he declared hes yours now you can have him hes been your lover she flung him away from her so violently that he nearly fell its a lie you know its a lie its true im no fool she beat her hands together distractedly what have you done what will those men think listen you must stop them quickly tell them its not so he seemed not to hear her im going away tomorrow he said but ill never divorce you no matter what you do and i wont let you divorce me either no no take him now if you want him but youll never be able to marry him until im gone and i wont die soon i promise you that im going to live you cant go theres a boat tomorrow dont you see you must stay and explain to those men my god theyll think you spoke the truth theyll believe what you said of course they will he chattered shrilly thats why i did it in that way no matter what you or he or i can do or say now theyll believe it forever it came to me like a flash of light and i saw what it meant all in a minute do you understand what it means eh listen no matter how you behave theyll know they wont say anything but theyll know and you cant stand that can you even if you could fool me once more against the evidence of my own eyes and ears and convince me that your lies are true it wouldnt do any good with them evidence you have no evidence no what about that night at taboga you were mad over the fellow then but you didnt think i saw that day i caught you together in the jungle have you forgotten that didnt you think it strange that i should be the one to discover you oh i pretended to be blind but i followed you everywhere i could and i kept my eyes open you saw nothing for there was nothing hes been with you day and night you have been together constantly and i knew what was going on but i waited because i wasnt strong enough to revolt until tonight oh but tonight i was strong something gave me courage in all their married life she had never known him to show such stubborn force he was like granite and the unbelievable change in him upsetting all her preconceived notions of the man appalled her there had been times in the past when they had clashed but he had never really matched his will with hers and she had judged him weak and spiritless now therefore failing to dominate him as usual she was filled with a strange feeling of helplessness and terror you had no right to accept such evidence she stormed bah why try to fool me i have your own words for it the other afternoon i came home sick with my head i was on the gallery outside when you were pleading with him and i heard it all you talked that night about taboga your guilty kisses and other things you acknowledged everything but he was growing tired of you that you know makes it all the more effective he smiled in an agonized fury you cur she cried with the fury of one beating barehanded at a barred door you had no right to do such a thing even if i were guilty right arent you my wife the look she gave him was heavy with loathing that means nothing with us i never loved you and you know it you know too why i married you i made no secret of it at the time you had what i wanted and i had what you wanted but you were content with the bargain because i gave you money position and power i never promised anything more than that i made you into something like a man you never could have succeeded without me all you have is due to me even your reputation in the service your success your influence it is all mine and the only thing you gave me was a name any other would have done as well he shrank a little under this tirade despite his exaltation marriage she continued in bitter scorn a priest mumbled something over us but it meant nothing then or now i have tolerated you because you were useful i have carried you with me as i carry a maid or a butler i bought a manikin and dressed it up and put breath into it for my own convenience and i owe you nothing do you understand nothing the debt is all on your side as you and i and all the world know who made me a manikin he demanded with womanish fury a fury that had been striving for utterance these many years i had ambitions and hopes and ability once not much perhaps but enough before you married me i was nothing great but i was getting along i had confidence too but you took it away from me you you absorbed me you had your fathers brain and it was too big for me it overshadowed mine in a way you were a vampire for what i had you drained me of at first it was terrible to feel that i was inferior but i loved you and although i had some pride he choked an instant and threw back her incredulous stare defiantly i let myself be eliminated you thought you were doing me a favor when you put me forward as a figurehead but to me it was a tragedy i couldnt help letting you do it do you realize what that means to a fellow i quit fighting for my own individuality i became colored by you i took on your ways your habits your mental traits and all the time i knew what was happening god how i struggled to remain stephen cortlandt but it would have taken a big man to mould you to his ways and i was only average i began to do your work in your particular style i forgot my ambitions and my dreams and took up yours thats what i fell to and all the time i knew it and and all the time i knew you neither cared nor understood my only consolation was the thought that even though you never had loved me and never could you at least respected our relation i clung to that miserably for it was all i had left all that made me seem like a man and yet you took away even that i tried to rebel but i had been drugged too long you saw anthony and he had the things i lack you found you were not a machine but a living woman he discovered the secret i had wasted away in searching for and you rewarded him oh i saw the change in you quickly enough and if id been a man instead of what i was id have but i wasnt i went spying around like a woman hating myself for permitting it to go on but lacking strength to stop it but tonight when he got up before those other men and dangled my shame before my eyes i had enough manhood left in me to strike back thank god for that at least maybe its not too late yet maybe if i get away from you and try his voice died out weakly in his face there was a miserable halfgleam of hope i never knew you felt like that i never knew you could feel that way she said in a colorless voice but you made a terrible mistake do you mean to say you dont love him no i have loved him for a long time i cant remember when it began she spoke very listlessly looking past him as if at a longfamiliar picture which she was tired of contemplating i never knew what love was before i never even dreamed id give my life right now to undo what you have done just for his sake for he is innocent oh dont sneer its true he loves the garavel girl and wants to marry her i know all that i overheard you in the parlor below listen please i dont remember what i said then and it doesnt matter you took too much for granted we must talk plainly now before she pressed her palms to her temples as if they were bursting before it becomes impossible i never lied to you stephen is that true i used to think so im going to tell you the whole truth now without sparing myself it began i think at taboga that night when he kissed me it was the only time he ever did such a thing it was dark we were alone i was frightened and it was purely impulse on his part but it woke me up and all at once i knew how much he meant to me i would have yielded utterly to him then if he had let me but he was panicstricken he spoke of you he apologized i never saw a man in more misery when i had time to realize the truth i tried to fight it off but it was no use and at last i gave up after that i put myself in his way deliberately i offered him opportunities continually but he never seemed to see them that day in the jungle i was desperate at his indifference and i drove the horses away when he wasnt looking i struck them with my crop and i actually threw myself at him as boldly as i could regardless of consequences but he was like ice he was speaking of you when you came it has always been the same when i discovered that he cared for that girl well if you overheard you must know i frightened garavel into dismissing him and i set out to break him just to show him that he needed me tonight i offered to divorce you and make him all and more than ive made you but he scorned me thats the truth stephen if we believed in oaths i would swear it no one who knew the woman could have disbelieved her and to the husband who knew her every mental and moral trait this bald hopeless confession came as a crushing anticlimax to his great effort it left him not the slightest doubt that she was honest he said dully in a feeble attempt to right himself you are shielding him you want to make me out wrong but she knew he knew those are the facts heaven knows they are bad enough but they are by no means so bad as you thought and im your wife stephen that thing you did was brutal those men will talk i was guilty no doubt in my thoughts but im young and you have no right to blight my life and my reputation yes and yours by a thing like that we will have to meet those men what are you going to do i dont know he said in all my life i never felt but one moment of power and that it seems was false for years i have longed to show myself a man and now what have i done what have i done i am no monster he moaned and sank limply into a chair folding together in an attitude of dejection that was pitiful he raised his head and broke out at her in a last spasm of desperation as a dying ember flares even while it crumbles my god why couldnt you be consistent why did you go halfway why couldnt you be all good or all bad and save me this all women are half good and half bad i cant blame you for not loving me i suppose he mumbled no woman of your kind could love a man like me those men she said in a way that made him writhe wait until i think i must think you cant think now and neither can i we must he wrung his hands theyll never believe me there was a long silence perhaps in the morning we can see a way out thats it he nodded you go to bed and ill think im trying to think now but this heat is suffocating me and my head is tired he brushed a hand feebly across his brow if it would only rain i could think better yes and we must think of anthony too no matter how you blame me you must realize that he was innocent and perhaps after all he is the one that you wronged deepest he will have to meet those men and they were his friends despite the breathless oppression of the night she shivered inever can meet them now and i dont see how you will dare to knowing that you were wrong dont he pleaded the other was bad enough but this tell me what to do i cant i dont know myself all i can see is that those men will never cease to believe no matter what you tell them she groped her way to the window but there was no relief even in the open air byandby she heard him sigh then rise and say goodnight as she prepared for bed an hour later she heard him still stirring about in his quarters but afterward as she lay staring into the black night she was so busied with the frightful fancies that swarmed about her that she did not detect his cautious footsteps when he stole out of his chamber closing the door softly behind him xxviii the answer kirk was roused from a heavy senseless slumber the next morning by a vigorous rapping at his door he lay still for a time vaguely resentful of the noise then glanced at his watch and found with a shock that it was quite late realizing only that he was due at the office he leaped out of bed he opened the door and runnels rushed in have you heard i heard your infernal pounding thats what woke me up runnels calmed his excitement which kirk now observed was intense where did you go after i left you last night i came here of course as the memory of the previous night swept over him he scowled did you stay here no i went out again and was out nearly all night trying to walk it off runnels face blanched and he drew back then of course you know what about cortlandt hes dead it was kirks turn to start and grow pale the last cobweb was swept from his brain and he gasped dead when where how did it happen nobody knows just how he was found on the seawall near alfarez house shot shot good lord it happened some time early this morning and the whole city is talking about it i came to you the first thing wed better hurry down there mrs cortlandt must be all broken up kirk began to dress hastily but paused as his friend stammered wait i i lets understand each other first i met wade just now the news has rattled him and hes been talking what do you mean did you see cortlandt again after i left you runnels swallowed hard kirk whirled about and faced him great heavens no see here that idea is ridiculous runnels sank weakly into a chair and mopped his face im glad to hear you say that it frightened me just the same for i remembered you acted so queerly when i left you and wade seemed to think perhaps when you said youd gone out again it knocked me flat understand i can prove where i was for allan was with me i couldnt sleep so i tried to walk off my excitement no no i couldnt do a thing like that i thought last night that i could but i couldnt really im afraid wade will tell all about the party if we dont stop him then wed better hunt him up kirk resumed his dressing while runnels consulted his watch no is due in twenty minutes well probably find him at the office together they hastened to the railroad building runnels telling all he knew of the tragedy as they went along cortlandts body it seemed had been found about daylight by a spiggoty policeman who had identified it becoming panicstricken at the importance of his discovery he had sounded the alarm then reported directly to the governor whose house was close by it was general alfarez himself who had informed mrs cortlandt over the telephone of her husbands death the whole city was alive with the news the police were buzzing like bees rumors of suicide murder robbery were about but no one seemed to know anything definite colonel jolson in his motorcar had just come from culebra and colonel bland was on no from gatun hence runnels desire to be at the station it was suicide kirk averred with conviction the man was insane last night and that accounts for what he said about me hes been sick for a long time if those boys will only keep their mouths shut runnels said anxiously theres no telling what these spiggoties might do if they heard about that row cortlandt was an american but it happened in panama and it would be their affair although it was sunday the four young fellows who had taken part in the entertainment on the night before had gathered in the office and at the appearance of runnels greeted him eagerly toward kirk however they maintained a disheartening constraint the acting superintendent began to caution them tersely boys theres no use to tell you that we must keep still about what happened last night kirk thinks cortlandts mind was unbalanced but whether it was or not he left a widow and what went on at that supper must never leak out why do you think he was crazy wade inquired his actions last night would show it kirk answered the man must have been out of his mind to believe or to say such a thing you mean then that he shot himself kirk nodded i dont agree with you ive seen crazy people but he was as sane as any of us and i dont believe in secrecy either i think we ought to be entirely frank about the matter the truth never hurt anybody its a bad business said runnels and its something i for one dont want to be mixed up in ive heard rumors already about some sort of a quarrel at our party so im afraid you fellows have been talking wade acknowledged it recklessly yes ill answer for my part and im not going to make any promise of secrecy either if that affair had anything to do with steve cortlandts death it ought to be known so the man who did it can be made to answer into the office behind them came ramon alfarez and two panamanian policemen one evidently a sergeant eh there you are alfarez cried as he caught sight of kirk then he said something in spanish to the sergeant who advanced and laid hands upon the american you are arrest what for gentlemen you will be so kind as to geeve the names yes the jodge will desire to make inquiries regarding those sopper to senor cortlan las night what am i arrested for kirk demanded come you are arrest that is enough at that moment the building began to shake and reverberate as no rolled in from colon bearing john weeks american consul and mr williams of st louis in one of the forward coaches as the two hurried out through the turnstiles they found the street blocked by a considerable crowd evidently interested in something quite apart from the arrival of the morning train but before they could learn the cause out from the nearby building came ramon alfarez accompanied by several policemen and a group of railroad employes among whom was kirk anthony there he is wheezed the consul clutching at his companions arm get him now before his friends but williams had been even quicker of eye than his fat guide and was plunging through the crowd toward his quarry he thrust the policemen and the curious onlookers aside and laying hold of anthony cried in triumph well mr jefferson locke i want you hello williams you got around finally didnt you kirk smiled at him a little man in blue uniform was attempting to take the prisoner in charge but the detective disregarded him it wont do you any good to resist he went on ive come to get you runnels elbowed his way forward with a question oh ive got a warrant for him williams declared what for well for one thing he embezzled eighty thousand dollars and im going to take him back eh wat is this alfarez bustled into the conversation embezzle he is then a tief exactly if youre the inspector ill ask you to make this arrest for me i believe were on foreign ground thats right alfarez came the voice of john weeks anxious to have a word in the affair ill vouch for mr williams this chap is a smooth one but his name isnt anthony at all nor locke either its wellar and hes wanted for other things besides embezzlement turning his triumphant little red eyes upon the prisoner he puffed got you didnt we i regret you ave arrive so late smirked alfarez the gentleman is already arrest for the murder of senor cortlan he will first answer to that i assure you kirk nodded too bad williams im sorry you didnt come last night they went on down the street leaving the detective staring and weeks openmouthed cortlandt murdered the consul gasped lord and to think i nourished that viper at my breast williams wheeled and cursed the fat man furiously it was during the lunchhour that ramon alfarez called at the garavel home finding the banker and his daughter still loitering over their midday meal and discussing the topic that had electrified the whole city ah ramon the old gentleman began eagerly be seated and tell us quickly the latest news a terrible thing was it not this death of our good friend i have been to see his unfortunate widow but even yet i cannot believe it to be true yes a terrible thing it was only last night that we saw him well and happy although alfarez was trembling with eagerness to tell his news he also meant to extract the greatest possible satisfaction from it and now bent an inquiring glance upon gertrudis his look turned to one of malicious triumph as he saw that he was indeed the first to bring the tidings of anthonys arrest for the girls acceptance of his suit had by no means wiped out the memory of her momentary preference for his rival and he had hastened hither straight from the police barracks delighting in the chance to make her suffer so fine a man the father was saying he was indeed my good friend it is shocking yes and to think he should have been killed in this cowardly manner killed is it believed that he was murdered caramba i supposed he had shot himself that was the gossip an hour ago garavel was deeply affected and motioned for the dishes in front of him to be removed ramon nodded there are suspicious circumstances it seems last night after the ball he had a serious quarrel one of those american fights almost that much is known gertrudis who had remained silent until now her dark eyes clouded with distress said sympathetically and the poor lady she must suffer terribly ah perhaps one cannot always tell ramon shrugged and smiled what do you mean cried garavel this quarrel you speak of continue ramon i am consumed with eagerness upon leaving the tivoli last night senor cortlan dined with six of his friends at the central there was drinking the waiters have been questioned also one of the men who was present has recounted to me what occurred it seems that for a long time senor cortlan has been jealous of his wife impossible jealous my dear ramon an admirable lady i i shall leave you perhaps questioned gertrudis modestly as she rose but ramon exclaimed no no by all means remain i have remarkable things to disclose amazing news that will interest you there was a serious altercation and senor cortlan openly accused his enemy before all the others it was most dramatic it was terrible there was a scene of violence the other man made threats garavel breathed an incredulous exclamation ah but wait it was senor cortlans best friend too the man for whom he had accomplished many favors whom he accused he noted with mingled anger and satisfaction the pallor that was creeping into the girls cheeks you would never guess it was i hesitate and yet you are bound to learn my dear friends it was this antony his moment had indeed been worth waiting for it even went far to atone for the sense of injury under which he smarted for the banker was stricken speechless and his daughter went deathly white her eyes began to fill with horror garavel was the first to recover himself infamous it is unbelievable the wretch then had betrayed his friend he is indeed a villain that much i have always known it is a lie said the girl quietly she had risen and was standing straight a tragic little figure gertrudis her father admonished you hear what ramon has said yes said ramon he deceived senor cortlan very nicely it had been going on for months it is a lie she repeated he loved no one but me gertrudis the banker was shocked beyond measure at what he considered his daughters jealousy those are not nice words he told you so yes but if he would betray his best friend he would deceive you also it was our great goodfortune to be done with him in time you will see now that i did well in sending him off eh chiquita no i do not believe you ramon had not counted upon such a spirit and his anger getting the better of him he sneered i should not have spoken i did not know you still care she does not care garavel declared loudly ah but i do i love him very dearly the two men were upon their feet in an instant staring at her the elder in amazement the younger with rage and resentment blazing from his countenance silence thundered the banker yonder stands your affianced husband it is a mistake she persisted gently no no no there is no mistake chattered ramon those other men have told all and your antony is now in the carcel under guard it was i who saw to his arrest the slender figure swayed a tiny olive hand fluttered to her breast ramon you must not heed her she is upset this is but a girls foolish fancy and it will pass the man was handsome and he cast a spell over her nor is that all ramon ran on excitedly he is not at all the man he pretended to be even his name is false this morning there arrived an american officer of police to arrest him on other charges he is a thief it seems having stolen eighty thousand dollars gold from his employers oh there is no mistake within the hour i have been talking with this detective and he has the papers of proof it will be in the newspapers every one will know shortly last night when senor cortlan made his accusation there was a frightful quarrel and antony swore to kill him at dawn the poor husband is found shot on the sea wall is not that enough it is indeed gasped the father you see then my child from what you were saved this should be a day of thanksgiving to you as it is to me for this deliverance i shall erect a cross of stone on the hill by our house so that all our lives we may offer a prayer when our eyes rest upon it come now it is ramon who has unmasked this person have you no thanks to give him but it is not true maintained the girl simply and her eyes were as steady as altar flames eh well he is in the barracks at this moment snarled ramon and there he shall remain i promise you until he goes to chiriqui or gertrudis turned to her father take me to him please i must go at once to the carcel but he only answered her with a stare of amazement go he murmured after an instant have i lost my senses he began to summon his indignation for a terrific outburst yes i must go for he is my husband we were wed last night there was a moment of absolute silence during which the clatter of a passing coach sounded loudly in the room then mother of god the banker ejaculated hoarsely and sank into the seat from which he had arisen ramon was staring from one to the other his head turning jerkily the girl raised her face proudly yes i am his wife although i had not expected to tell you so soon therefore you see i must go to him quickly or he will think i believe these lies you are mad do you know what you are saying oh yes the judge from colon married us during the dance i would have liked a church wedding but that will come later the senor ronnels and his wife were there also and they will tell you it made me very happy you see i prayed the virgin that i might be happy and she heard oh i offered so many prayers and all last night i lay awake giving thanks for my great happiness which even yet i cannot believe her face was transfigured by a look that left the two men no choice but to believe a civil marriage stammered ramen a civil marriage indeed said garavel in a choking voice so that is where you were when i believed you to be dancing he burst forth violently pounding the table with his clenched fist until the dishes danced his brilliant black eyes flashing beneath their thatch of white but i will not have it understand you are betrothed you have given your word to ramon ah but i never loved him you compelled me to consent because you said you could not be president unless i married him and that was not so ramon deceived you now it is all right you will be president and i can be happy ramons suspicion kindled on the instant he turned upon the banker so i begin to see that was a trick then to betray my father but wait gertrudis exclaimed sharply did you not trick us also did you not use the general your father to make me give up the man i love which of us then is the better andres garavel spoke threateningly menacingly to his daughter enough our word was given and you have broken it you have brought disgrace to our name can a garavel be president of the republic with his daughter wed to a murderer he is not that it was no marriage and it will not stand i will have it annulled such things are easily done ramon she is no wife the man was a criminal a fugitive even when he forced her to marry no no you cannot do that it was i who asked him to marry me the girl lied tremulously panicstricken at the threat before god i am his wife she maintained and if this marriage has a flaw then i will stand beside the prison gates and remarry him as he comes forth he will not come forth ramon declared harshly oh yes and now will you take me to him no her father bellowed you are my daughter you are under my roof and here you shall stay until you give up this madness and this man that i can never do she retorted proudly you see i am not all spanish i have in me also the blood of his people and that makes me steadfast i could not doubt him if i wished i forbid you to go near him come do you promise she inclined her dark head i must learn more of this affair at once you will find your senses miss or if you do not you will spend your life in meditation and prayer that much i promise you i do not wish to enter a convent she said with white lips i wish to be happy when keerk is free i shall go to him now if you please i think i shall go away she turned and went out of the big highceilinged room and not until she had reached the hall did her feet waver or her head droop when the two men were alone garavel said brokenly she is the first to bring disgrace upon our name is there absolute proof that the man is guilty ramon proof alfarez turned dazed eyes from the door through which gertrudis had gone proof i believe so i have not thought much of the matter as yet but i think there will be proof in plenty oh yes come then i must go to see him perhaps oh god perhaps what my head is afire my heart is broken for you my poor boy xxix a last appeal that was not a pleasant interview for anthony his surroundings were not such as to lend him assurance and garavels grief at his daughters disgrace was really distressing moreover the unequivocal threat to annul the marriage filled him with alarm his only consolation came from the fact that gertrudis had made known the truth without the slightest hesitation that showed that she was loyal at any rate kirk tried to assure his caller that he would have no trouble in proving his innocence but garavel seemed very little concerned with that phase of the affair and continued to bewail the dishonor that had fallen upon his name kirks pride arose at this and he exclaimed with some heat my dear mr garavel if you are so blamed sure that i did all these things why did you come to see me it was to learn if she spoke the truth oh were married right enough and youll have some difficulty in breaking it up before i get out you expect then to prove your innocence easily i do but i hear there are other serious charges it is quite the same with them but suppose you should not clear yourself of this murder would you wish to drag down my daughters name of course not i understand you have not spoken of this marriage perhaps you might consent to remain silent if by any chance you should be convicted of guilt what satisfaction could you derive from injuring me and mine none at all sir i am rich garavel went on meaningly if you are acquitted i might perhaps arrange amply for your future upon conditions in other words if i am to be hanged or shot or whatever it is they do to people down here youll expect me to keep my mouth shut on general principles and if im acquitted youll pay me well to disappear is that it well there is some family pride to that he laughed lightly my political future may depend upon it if i can help you in that way ill gladly keep silent as long as you wish but i dont think i care to make any further terms make sure of this snapped the father your marriage will be annulled no matter what you prove or fail to prove already chiquita is repentant and i shall not rest until she is free you have done me a great injury and i shall not forget it on the following morning the leading american attorney of the city called at the jail announcing that he had been retained as counsel but refusing to tell who had employed him supposing of course that he had been sent by friends who wished no publicity in the matter kirk did not press him for information together they outlined their defence as best they could with characteristic optimism kirk insisted upon treating the charge against him as of little consequence and it was not until he had undergone his preliminary hearing that he fully realized the gravity of his situation to his unspeakable indignation the officer who had discovered cortlandts body swore that he had seen the deceased pass him shortly before the time of his death evidently taking a walk along the waters edge for relief from the heat and that immediately afterward perhaps a minute or so the prisoner had also passed going in the same direction there was a street light close by he said and there could be no possible mistake as to anthonys identity a few moments later there had been a pistolshot muffled but unmistakable and the policeman had hastened in the direction from which it came the prisoner had appeared suddenly out of the darkness and hurried past in the politest manner possible the witness declared he had questioned him regarding the shot but mr anthony had neither stopped nor answered on the contrary he had broken into a run the officer had considered this strange behavior but being at all times most respectful toward americans he had made no effort to detain him passing on he had found the body of the dead man a revolver was beside it it was shocking it had quite upset the witness he had blown his whistle and seeing a light in the governors mansion close by had called there for assistance soon afterward another officer had arrived upon the scene when this amazing testimony was translated to kirk he was astounded but his indignation was as nothing to that which swept over him when a servant in the alfarez household swore to having actually witnessed the murder this fellow declared that he had been troubled greatly with a toothache toward morning of the night in question too restless for sleep he had gone out upon the sea wall even now his face was swollen and he made a determined effort to show the court the particular tooth which had made him an unwilling beholder of the tragedy overcome by exhaustion he had fallen asleep after a time and he was awakened by the sounds of a quarrel on opening his eyes he saw two americans one of whom was senor cortlandt and the other kirk anthony being utterly ignorant of their language he had no means of knowing what was said nor did he consider the altercation serious until the large man shot the senor cortlandt then being terrorstricken at what he had beheld he had run away entirely forgetting his toothache which by the grace of god was quite gone that was all he knew of the matter he recognized anthony as the man who had done the shooting he was troubled greatly with toothaches it all seemed like some grotesque practical joke and kirk at first could not believe that the evidence of these witnesses could have weight but he soon became convinced that this was no laughing matter since they had perjured themselves so readily it was evident that some determined influence was back of them and how far that influence might carry it was hard to tell the reason for it was all very simple of course and yet he was at a loss how to combat it wade was called next and told the story of that damning incident at the supperparty being corroborated by the others then there were several witnesses who swore to inconsequent things such as waiters at the hotel central and the doctor who had examined cortlandt for once in his careless life the young man realized that he was face to face with something bigger and stronger than his own determination and it daunted him he began to see that he had underestimated these foreigners for it seemed an easy matter to convict an innocent man in these central american courts he recalled certain ridiculous stories of spanish justice which he had laughed at he remembered mrs cortlandts vivid tale of an execution she had once beheld in the courtyard of chiriqui prison and suddenly he decided to cable for darwin k anthony the one man who was strong enough to save him when it came time for him to speak he told a straight story about his own actions on that night and he was corroborated by allan but he knew that their words had little weight against that other testimony of course he was remanded for trial and that night the newspapers of the city were crowded with columns of sensational readingmatter bearing upon the crime anson the lawyer gave him a ray of encouragement as he left dont go too much on this hearing he said i think well pull you out all right you think i dare say ramon alfarez can get a dozen men to perjure themselves as easily as he got those two exactly but i have a little coup that i intend to spring at the right moment for heavens sake tell me what it is im sorry but i cant just yet in the first place one must handle these people exactly right or they explode but give me an idea at least im really interested in the outcome of this case you know anson smiled of course you are and ill tell you as soon as i can but not now these spiggoties would enjoy standing me up against a wall with my head in a rag theyd make it a holiday and ring all the bells in town i cant assure you that it isnt serious anson acknowledged gravely for it is any time an american goes to court in this country it is serious but that doesnt mean that well lose you may be a good lawyer said kirk ruefully but youre a blamed poor comforter i i wish my dad was here hed fix it he wouldnt let em convict me hes great my dad is he can swear like the devil his voice caught and his eyes were unusually bright as he turned away to hide his emotions i like him better than any man ive ever met anson and you watch him come when he hears im in trouble he wrote a lengthy cablegram which the lawyer with a peculiar smile agreed to despatch at once he spent a sleepless night in the morning a message came signed by copley kirks heart leaped at the familiar name saying that darwin k anthony had left albany for the west on sunday night and could not be located for a few days he was never gone when i needed money the son mused hell be worried when he hears about this and he has enough to worry him as it is im mighty sorry but i simply must have him anson brought in the days papers which alluded as usual to cortlandts death as a murder and printed their customary sensational stories even to a rehash of all that had occurred at the stag supper this in particular made kirk writhe knowing as he did that it would reach the eyes of his newly made wife he also wondered vaguely how edith cortlandt was bearing up under all this notoriety the lawyer brought the further news that allan was in captivity as an accessory to the crime and that henceforth kirk need expect but few visitors somebody probably ramon alfarez had induced the officials to treat their prisoner with special severity during the days which followed kirk suffered more than he chose to confess even to his attorney in the first place it was hard to be denied all knowledge of what was going on anson would tell him little except that he was working every day and then too the long hours of solitude gnawed at his selfcontrol runnels managed to see him once or twice reporting that so far as he could learn chiquita had disappeared he took a message from kirk to her but brought back word that he could not deliver it kirk wondered if she could really believe those frightful halfcomplete newspaper accounts or if she had been unable to withstand the combined weight of her whole family and had given up it was almost too much to hope that a girl reared as she had been could keep her mind unpoisoned with all those lying tongues about her and besides she had the spanish ideas of morality which would make the actions of which he was accused seem doubly shocking the more he speculated upon the cause of her silence the wilder grew his fancies until it became a positive torture to think of her at all instead his thoughts turned to edith cortlandt in a curiously uninterested way her attitude was a problem perhaps she would leave him to his fate reviewing the circumstances coldly he could hardly blame her it was on sunday a week after his arrest that she came to him he was surprised to see the ravages that this short time had made in her for she was pale and drawn and wearylooking as if from sleeplessness strange to say these marks of suffering did not detract from her appearance but rather enhanced her poise and distinction she was not even veiled on the contrary she had driven openly to the police barracks and ordered her coachman to wait in the street outside then demanded to be shown to anthonys cell im awfully glad to see you mrs cortlandt he said as she extended her hand but do you think it was wise for you to come she shrugged people can say no more than they have already said my name is on every tongue and a little more gossip can make matters no worse i had to come i just couldnt stay away i wonder if you can realize what i have been through it must have been terrible he said gently yes i have paid it seems to me that i have paid for everything i ever did those newspaper stories nearly killed me but it wasnt that so much as the thought that you were suffering for my acts im very sorry you never thought for a moment that i did what they claim no no it has all been a mistake from the first i was sure of that you heard what those two men testified bah that is ramon alfarez but he can do nothing nothing i dont call a week in the bastile nothing why he has perjured two witnesses already and i dare say hell have the whole native population swearing against me when the trial comes up never mind i have had no time to do anything as yet there were so many things to be attended to she shuddered and sank down upon the edge of his cot stephen had a great many friends in various parts of the world i have been swamped with cablegrams if my dad were here hed have me free in a jiffy he can do anything i dont think well need him she said in a way that comforted him somehow though the feeling shamed him she laid a soft hand upon his arm and looking up eagerly into his face exclaimed you will forgive me for what i said that night at the hotel wont you i didnt really mean to injure you kirk but i was half hysterical i had suffered so these last few months that i was ready to do anything i was torn by two great desires one to remain what i am and have always been and the other well the other was the stronger or would have been if you had allowed it i never dreamed there was a way out of my misery a way so close at hand but somehow even before general alfarez voice on the phone told me what had happened i knew and i i felt i know you had a great deal to put up with he said but for both our sakes i wish it had come in some other way oh i dont care she cried recklessly the one thing i can grasp in all this turmoil the one thing that rings in my ears every moment is that i am free free that is all that matters to me you showed your loyalty to stephen more than once and though your scruples angered me i honor you for them now i can see too that you had no choice but to put me off even that night of the dance but my chains are broken and it is all different now your husbands death can make no difference with us mrs cortlandt he said gravely we have talked openly before and there is no need to do otherwise now you mean by that that you dont care for me but i know better i believe there is a love so strong that it must find an answer although you may not care for me now as you care for some one else i know that i can make you forget her and put me in her place i know men and i know you i came here prepared to be honest shameless if you like i am young i have money i have power i work for the love of doing things and you are learning to do the same i can help you oh so much we can win happiness together just as easily as we can win material success and that is ours now for the asking it dazzles me to think of it kirk it is like a glimpse of paradise and i can show it all to you she was bending forward her lips parted the color gleaming in her cheeks her whole face transformed by a passionate eagerness wait he said harshly you force me to break my word i dont want to tell you this but i am married she rose slowly her eyes fixed in bewilderment upon his her hand clutching at his sleeve you never told me that it was some mad college prank i suppose no no i married gertrudis garavel that night at the tivoli oh that cant be that was the night of the dance it is quite true mrs cortlandt stared about the squalid cell dully miss garavel why didnt you tell me why isnt she here why does she leave you alone no no you hardly know each other why shes not old enough to know her own mind but i know my mind and i love her her white hands strained at each other as she steadied her shaking voice love she cried you dont know what love means nor does she she cant know or shed be here shed have this prison torn block from block i suppose her father would not let her come said kirk slowly but edith did not seem to hear him the realization of her broken hopes was coming home to her poignantly my happiness she exclaimed i have been unhappy so long and i seemed to see it just within my reach oh kirk she thinks you are guilty she hasnt faith you have no right to say that see i came to you when i was married and asked you to take me ill do the same with you now you dont know what youre saying youre hysterical mrs cortlandt i love gertrudis so deeply that theres no room in me for anything else and never will be heaven only knows what they have made her believe about me but i dont care ill upset this little plot of alfarezs and when she learns the truth she will come back again this little plot edith cried in distraction and i suppose you wish me to give you back to her they confronted each other a moment in silence but i wont help her she went on im not that sort im a selfish woman ive always been selfish because ive never had anybody to work for but i have it in me to be generous im sorry he said you have suffered i know dont trouble any more about me please she stared at him defiantly although her whole frame was shaking as if from an ague oh id rather face the gallows as you face it than what is before me and im not sure i could help you after all you are in latin america now remember and your enemies are strong i am darwin k anthonys son he protested he wont allow it bah he is an american and these are spanish people you have seen how they like us and you have seen what alfarez can do hes rich and hell perjure more witnesses hell manipulate the court with his money yes and id rather he succeeded than see you no no what am i saying llet me go let me get away from here she broke down and went sobbing out into the corridor the iron door clanged to behind her on the same afternoon mr clifford accompanied by anson the lawyer took the train for colon as soon as he arrived he called up colonel jolson to request that the commissioners motorcar should without fail await him at ten oclock sharp on the next morning with an open track ahead of it strangely enough the colonel agreed very readily xxx darwin k anthony about noon on monday edith cortlandt received a caller the name she read on the card her maid handed her gave her a start of surprise and set her wits whirling in speculation show him into the drawingroom she said at length ill be right down as she descended a few moments later she was greeted by a gigantic old man with a rumbling voice who instead of seating himself in the drawingroom as he had been requested had flung open the carefully closed shutters to admit more light then kicked aside whatever articles of furniture happened to be in his way he was now pacing back and forth with the restlessness of a polar bear how do you do mrs cortlandt he began at sight of her his big voice flooding the room im sorry to disturb you under the circumstances you are mr anthony yes madam youll pardon my intrusion i knew your husband slightly and ive heard about you i extend my sympathy she bowed when did you arrive just now came across in one of those damned joywagons fifty miles an hour we hit a nigger on the way but we didnt stop i know everything madam what i didnt know before i landed i learned on the way across the isthmus so dont lets waste time hell of a position for you to be in i understand and all that and im sorry for you now lets get down to business for i must get back to new york it was impossible not to feel darwin k anthonys force it spoke in his every tone and action it looked out from his harshlined features and showed in his energetic movements he was a great granite block of a man powerful in physique in mind and in determination he had kirks eyes mrs cortlandt noted except that they were deeper set more fierce and eager she was not used to being overridden and his masterful air offended her in what way may i be of service to you she inquired coldly i want my boy he said simply and she began to see that underneath his cold and domineering exterior his heart was torn by a great distress you know all the circumstances of course i do thats why i came straight to you i know youre the keystone of the whole affair so i didnt waste time with these other people kirks a damned idiot and always has been he isnt worth the powder to blow him to excuse me i mean hes just a neerdowell but i suppose ill have to do my duty by him i understand that has always been your attitude exactly i got sick of his performances and cut him off couldnt stand for him any longer i tried my best to make a man out of him but he wouldnt have it so we severed our connections absolutely i just kicked him out sorry i didnt do it sooner if you have cut him off why do you care what becomes of him darwin k anthonys eyes dimmed but his voice rose fiercely hes my boy and ive a right to treat him any damned way i please but nobody else is going to abuse him these spaniards cant do it ill teach them to lay hands on my boy he tore a handkerchief from his pocket and blew a blast into it ill tear their little republic to pieces he shouted ill buy the whole works and throw it away ill buy their president and their courts and their whole infernal population and if they wont sell ive got enough men to take it hells bells madam do you think these little black people can shoot my son i dont care what hes done theyve got to give him up and hes going back with me hes going home i i want him why have you come to me she queried because you must know the truth if anybody does and i want your help his voice softened suddenly and he regarded her with a gentle kindness that was surprising ive heard all about you and kirk in fact ive known what was going on all the time for ive had a man on his track night and day you may know him clifford well he followed kirk that night after the supper to your husband but anson didnt dare call him to the stand at the hearing for fear this alfarez would perjure more of his blackandtans he ground his teeth in rage by god ill get that ramon if it costs me a million they cant stand for such things even here but i want more proof i want to snow him under absolutely completely so clifford is your man yes i took him off my system and sent him down here as soon as i got kirks idiotic impudent letter the old man began to sputter with indignation what dyou think he wrote me mrs cortlandt he had the impudence to turn down a good job i offered him because his wife might not like our climate imagine and i had positively begged him to come back on any terms of course it gave me an awful scare and i lost no time in learning if it was true thank god he had sense enough not to do that then you dont know know what that he is married damnation roared anthony furiously she nodded a miss garavel they were married a week ago she broke down miserably and hid her face in her hands he strode to her with a light of understanding in his eyes laying a great hand upon her drooping head he exclaimed with wonderful softness my dear mrs cortlandt im very sorry for you indeed i am how the boy ever let you go for any other woman i dont see but hes always been a fool thats why he never cared for me now now try to face it squarely all good women are brave and youre a good woman we both love him and i know we can save him if we pull together yes yes she raised her drawn white face eagerly to his it will only take a word but i have been like a mad woman i couldnt bear to give him up and when i learned the truth i thought i could let him suffer but i couldnt oh i couldnt and i knew it all the time i was distracted that is all you see i have no shame in telling you this for he is the first and only man i know he patted her in a way that said more than words i couldnt have stood out much longer then you have proof his face was wild with eagerness this take it quickly i only found it last night it had been mislaid in the confusion i meant to give it up i really did with clumsy fingers she drew from the front of her dress an unsealed letter and handed it to him stephen was not a bad man you see and he had no intention of wronging an innocent person darwin k anthonys pallor matched hers as he read the sheet then he exclaimed weakly thank god something told me to come straight to you something always tells me where to find the heart of things quick you must lose no time she exclaimed he is in prison and the place is frightful i will go with you to the mayor ah im very glad he will get his freedom from your hands i was so weak when this is done i shall go back north and try to live it out but i love him very dearly mr anthony her lip trembled piteously and i could have done so much for him grimfaced and scowling he reread the letter in his hand during the moment it required for edith to make ready the injustice that had been done his blood roused every passion in him he had himself well in hand however and he restrained his yearning to burst forcibly into the police barracks and take his boy to his heart he determined there should be no possible slip and he longed ferociously to meet ramon alfarez kirk was considerably surprised that afternoon when a sergeant and two policemen came to his cell signifying that he was to accompany them he could not make out where they were taking him and despite their unusual politeness they were dense to all inquiries it was a bright hot afternoon and the city seemed very beautiful and desirous as he was driven through it but the whole procedure filled him with uneasiness he was sure that it had nothing to do with his trial or anson would have posted him and he began to fear that it might concern his marriage perhaps chiquita was ill dying or perhaps they were trying to annul the bond the smiling little officer only shook his head shrugged and chattered unintelligibly at his questions the coach drew up at last before a large white building and he was told to descend up a flight of stairs he was escorted his pulses quickening with apprehension down a long corridor and into a large room where he saw runnels colonel jolson anson clifford a dozen or more panamanian officials and he stopped in his tracks as his eyes fell upon a huge whitecrowned figure that came to meet him his heart leaped wildly a great drumming set up in his ears something gripped his throat with agonizing pressure and robbed him of speech a certain harsh yet tender voice pronounced his name he felt his hands crushed in his fathers palms found the old mans arm about his shoulders and saw the deepset steelblue eyes he loved so well wet and shiny then for once and for all time he realized that in the whole wide world there was but one man who really mattered one man for whom he honestly cared a sudden sense of security swept over him banishing all his fears the room with its smiling faces became blurred and distant a thousand words of endearment sprang to his lips what he really said was hello and even that he pronounced as shyly as a girl my kid the old man said shakingly hhow have they treated you buster it was a nickname he had given his son when he was a sturdy roundfaced urchin of eight and which he had laid away regretfully in lavender so to speak when the boy grew to manhood you came didnt you kirk said in a voice not at all like his own i knew youd come of course i came the instant clifford cabled me that these idiots had arrested you by god theyll sweat for this how are you anyhow kirk dammit you need a shave wouldnt they give you a razor hey clifford colonel jolson come here these scoundrels wouldnt give him a shave darwin k anthonys eyes began to blaze at this indignity and he rumbled on savagely oh ill smash this dinky government try to convict my kid eh i suppose youre hungry too well som i well be out of here in a minute then you show me the best place in town and well have a decent meal just we two the way we used to ill pay the bill god almighty ive missed you buster wait dad kirk was smiling but his heart ached at his fathers emotion im a jailbird you know they think i killed a fellow but i dont care much what they think now thats all over clifford broke in weve squared that and youll be discharged in ten minutes honest certainly said the old gentleman cortlandt shot himself anybody but a blithering spanish ass would have known it at the start we have a letter he wrote to his wife an hour before he did it she just found it and turned it over she left here a moment ago bytheway all broken up shes a great woman kirk thats not all either clifford followed you that night and knows you didnt go near cortlandt oh you should have seen em jump when we flashed it on em all at once and they learned who i was but those men who swore they saw me bah weve got that little dago with the mustache and both his witnesses if they dont send him up ill run in a shipload of my brakemen and well push this isthmus overboard and him with it i knew you could fix things fix em fix em thats easy say how have you been getting along anyhow great and you married one of these panamanicures eh the father scowled lord i can trust you to make a fool of yourself say dad shes only so big anthony junior indicated his wifes stature smiling rapturously dwarf eh oh no love her do i its fierce humph youll have to get over it ill pay your debts and take care of you but i cant stand a mulatto around me there arent any debts and shes not a mulatto shes a dream theyre waiting mr anthony clifford made bold to say i think wed better get this over with kirk paid little attention to the formalities of the next few minutes he was too busy with thoughts of his amazing goodfortune his mind was too dazzled by the joy of freedom allan appeared from somewhere and clung to him in an ecstasy of delight colonel jolson runnels anson even the panamanian officials shook hands with him he accepted their congratulations mechanically meanwhile keeping very close to his fathers side some time later he found himself out in the open sunlight a free man once more with darwin k anthony and runnels on either side of him but before he had gone a block he halted suddenly saying williams id forgotten him and his warrant hes fixed runnels explained while your father and mrs cortlandt and colonel jolson were getting you out of jail clifford and i told him the truth hes rather a decent fellow they have caught the real jefferson locke or whatever his name is no yes a week ago he landed in boston couldnt stay away from his own country any longer williams hadnt heard of it what has become of higgins kirk inquired of his father anthony senior exploded oh hes back scorching up the tenderloin as usual but youll have to cut him out or ill leave you here thats final understand i intend to stay here anyhow huh the old man turned with a start im damned if you do then savagely what do you suppose i came down here for im lonesome i want you to come home kirk smiled craftily and looked at runnels well what can you offer im doing pretty well as it is and i cant afford to lay off his father in turn appealed to the acting superintendent see its nothing less than blackmail is he any good mr runnels if there werent so much politics in this job hed be master of transportation of the p r r thats doing pretty well isnt it were both going to quit and look for new work do you drink kirk i havent even had an alcohol rub since i left new york but dad if you place me youll have to take care of runnels too he knows more about railroads than you do mr anthony grunted a trifle sceptically at this and murmured he must be a bright young man i suppose what he doesnt know you do well how would you both like to come north and give me some lessons do you mean it they cried in chorus i do oh theres allan too hell have to go any cats and dogs youd like to have drawing salary from me now lets go somewhere and eat i havent tasted anything to speak of since cliffords message came if you dont mind i id like to stop at the garavels for a minute kirk said longingly and his father scowled id forgotten this wife of yours shes not there runnels hastened to say ive tried to find her but i was told she was out at the country place then i think id rather drive out there than eat wont you go with me dad well yes i want to see this banker fellow and im not so damned hungry after all well settle this thing right now the afternoon sun was still an hour high when kirk anthony came down the hill from the garavels home and crossed the meadow toward the forest glade he knew so well the grateful coolness of evening was stealing downward and nature was roused from her midday lethargy it was the vibrant active hour when odors are freshest and spirits rise the forest was noisy with the cry of birds and flocks of shrillvoiced paroquets raised an uproar in the tallest trees the dense canopy of green overhead was alive with fluttering wings the groves echoed to the cries of all the loudvoiced thicket denizens the pastured cattle which had sauntered forth from shaded nooks ceased their grazing to stare with gentle curiosity at the hurrying figure of course they recognized a lover speeding to his tryst and gave him passage shaking their heads at one another and wagging their ears in knowing fashion he faltered a bit despite his haste for this nook had grown sacred to him and even yet he felt that it was haunted the laughter of the waterfall helped to drown the sound of his approach but he surprised no dancing woodsprites instead he saw what filled his heart with a greater gladness than he had ever known chiquita was there huddled upon the seat where they had rested together one foot curled beneath her like a child her head bowed down disconsolately from one brown hand now drooping listlessly a few wild flowers had scattered and her slim figure was clad once more in the stiff coarse denim dress of blue her other hand was toying with her beads mechanically as if the fingers had learned their task from long practice her dusky eyes were fast upon the lights that wavered in the pool as if to prove that the spot was really peopled by kind spirits a gentle voice seemed to whisper the news to her and she turned to find him smiling at her she rose and met him with her hands outstretched her face transfigured after a time she leaned backward in his arms and said gravely you see when one says many many prayers the good saints always answer the padre told me that i should never cease until you came but i grew very tired senor and you never doubted me oh no im free you know of course what else were my prayers for had my father allowed i would have gone to your prison but he forbade it so i had no choice but every hour i prayed that he might give me leave and i think his heart was yielding im sure of that he told her for i have just come from him it was some time later when the sun was dipping that voices sounded outside the wall of verdure and kirk heard andres garavel saying of a certainty i shall try that experiment senor for the ticks in this country are a pest to cattle a little to the right and you will find the path so an instant later the two whitehaired men appeared hello there you are eh darwin k anthony exclaimed gruffly wheres that girl he paused and let his hostile eyes rest upon gertrudis she saw a great forbidding giant of a man scowling down at her with eyes like kirks and she came forward timidly holding out her hands she was smiling up at him faintly you are keerks father yes you are the senor antonio mr anthony uttered a curious choking exclamation and gathered her gently in his arms when he looked up his eyes were wet and his deeplined face was working i couldnt wait any longer he apologized humbly to his son i had to come and see her ah then i hope you will like me she said in her grave quaint way your father has told me everything garavel laid a hand upon his new sons shoulder and we have become good friends already i fear i owe you a great apology my boy but if i consent that you take my little girl away to your country will
