 chapter one a moorland death the first killing went well perfectly in fact though i always knew it would i had planned it well arrangements organisation these are things im good at now ive discovered im good at killing too at six oclock in the morning i turned the car left off the road towards tan hill the highest pub in england is at tan hill but theres just the pub there nothing else no houses no other buildings the nearest village is eight kilometres away the nearest shop twelve kilometres this is wild treeless country there would be amazing views later when the sun got up but i wasnt interested in them i continued along a dirt road across moorland stopping only when the car could no longer be seen from the road not that there was ever much traffic here i got out and stretched enjoying the sharp cold of the early autumn air to make myself less noticeable against the dull green grasses of the countryside around me i was wearing hiking clothes and boots of a similar greeny colour i took an old brown backpack off the back seat of the car and checked inside there was a map a bottle of water gloves binoculars and some sandwiches i took out the gloves and put them on i also had a handheld gps there were no paths where i was going in more ways than one i was making my way into the unknown it was a journey of discovery one that i had promised myself for some time it took me two hours to walk across the wild moorland to where i wanted to be two hours that seemed like no time at all excitement and nervousness were building up inside me in equal measure in my mind i was going through the different possibilities of what might happen yet i knew i would be successful finally i arrived at the place i had chosen there was an old longempty house beside a dirtybrown stream which laughed its way down the side of the hill the house was roofless and one wall was falling down there were piles of old stones lying around i found a stone that felt comfortable in my right hand heavy and with sharp edges later i would use it a path turned this way and that up the hillside past the house and over a wooden bridge across the stream the path is well known to walkers though not especially popular the chances of a single walker taking advantage of this bright autumn morning were good but there was unlikely to be a whole crowd of them then later when the body was found the police would think the killer had come along the same path as the walker rather than over the pathless moorland they would start searching in the wrong places i had chosen well i took off my gloves got my binoculars and a sandwich out of my backpack and sat down on a large stone to wait from where i was i would be able see anyone coming from a long way away but they would have difficulty seeing me i had hardly finished my sandwich when a man appeared in the distance walking in my direction quickly i put on my gloves picked up my chosen stone and hid behind the back wall of the house i waited my heart went faster i took deep breaths to slow it down i had a picture in my mind of the man coming nearer my excitement rose my nervousness disappeared i heard the sound of footsteps on the dirt path coming near nearer i raised my stone this was the moment of truth and then it was done the man lay on his side on the ground by my feet his longish grey hair had fallen over his face his eyes were closed but there was movement under the eyelids i took off my left glove and felt the side of his neck he wasnt dead just unconscious i looked at him this was the moment the moment i wanted to experience the moment i had promised myself i hit him again hard driving the edge of the stone deep into the side of his head through the bone and then he was completely still i looked down at the man a thousand different feelings fought for my attention i had done it i felt high drunk untouchable i felt brilliant strong undefeatable i was alive i threw the stone far away let the police find it i thought they would learn nothing from it then i took a playing card out of my jacket pocket found the dead mans wallet in his jacket and put the card inside i put the wallet back where i had found it a moment later i picked up my backpack and started back to my car this is just the beginning i can show them i can show them they are wrong i can show them what im really made of it was four oclock in the afternoon when detective inspector charles neville got out of a dark blue police land rover in the middle of the cold north yorkshire moorland near surrender bridge the emergency call reporting a dead body had come in an hour or so earlier the first police officers had arrived at the scene twenty minutes later and established that the death wasnt natural neville had immediately been called out it was his day off and he had been out with his wife shopping for a new kitchen for his home suddenly seemed far less important as neville got out of the vehicle a young woman with short dark hair came over to him it was his sergeant helen scott i got here a few minutes ago said scott the bodys over there behind that building she waved a hand in the direction of an old roofless building that had half fallen down neville could see that black and yellow sceneofcrime tape had already been put around the building and also round a largish area of moorland three other land rovers and a couple of other offroad vehicles were parked near the building as neville walked with scott towards the building he looked up at the sky thick dark cloud was beginning to blow in from the west yorkshire weather he said badtemperedly pointing at the sky lets hope the rain keeps away until were finished here neville was from the southeast although hed lived in yorkshire for the last ten years he still hadnt got used to the weather when the sun was out it was indeed a special place but it wasnt uncommon to experience all four seasons in one day yes agreed scott around the corner of the building they found kay harding the police doctor bending over the body of a middleaged man dressed in hiking clothes and boots he still had a backpack on harding stood up as she heard the detectives arrive and started talking immediately charles helen she said looking from one to the other and then down at the body what we have here is the body of a fifty to fifty fiveyearold man he was presumably out walking someone has hit him hard on the side of the head twice probably with a stone time of death asked neville somewhere between eight and ten this morning id say replied harding anything else asked neville not at the moment replied harding once the photographers done his business ill take the body away ill leave you the backpack and anything i find in his pockets ok thanks said neville nevilles mood improved harding was one of the best clear professional and she didnt waste words he liked that he looked at the sky again and then at his watch they would have to hurry he turned to scott well have enough daylight he said but god knows how long the rain will hold off get this area searched as much as you can and as carefully as you can were obviously looking for anything that might be useful but were especially looking for the stone that killed him right answered scott who found the body asked neville a local couple answered scott theyre in the green land rover over there she pointed to it ill go and talk to them said neville then well need to think about an operations room reeth is the nearest village maybe theres somewhere there scott nodded she and neville had offices at the police station in richmond the nearest town but that was almost twenty kilometres away neville would want to be closer to the scene than that there was a mobile office they could bring over and use or they could find a large room nearby that they could borrow right she said ill get the search started here at eight oclock the following morning neville and scott and a team of fifteen officers met in reeth memorial hall their new operations room this large empty room was normally used for anything from childrens playgroups to concerts to band practice now it was filled with desks chairs computers phones and police officers neville stood facing his team his age showing in the grey of his hair and the lines on his face scott was next to him neither of them had had much sleep behind them was a whiteboard with the photograph of a mans face on it ok began neville first what we know this is matthew kenworthy he pointed at the photograph he was found at three oclock yesterday afternoon by a local couple who were out walking their dog he died some time yesterday morning between eight and ten someone hit him on the side of the head twice with a stone weve got the stone but its anyones guess if well find out anything from it he stepped back and looked across at scott over to you he said kenworthy was here on his own on a walking holiday she began he was staying at the shoulder of mutton pub here in reeth he arrived a couple of days ago he hadnt been to the area before he was friendly but kept himself to himself she cleared her throat before continuing yesterday morning he went off in his car intending to walk an eightkilometre path that goes in a circle from surrender bridge we found his car near the bridge scott then pointed to a number of plastic bags on the table beside her weve been through the things in his room theres nothing of interest there weve been through what he had with him on the walk he just had the usual stuff that walkers take map gps hat gloves sandwiches water but there was one unusual thing scott picked up a plastic bag and held it up so that everyone could see inside the bag was a playing card the ace of spades she said it was in his wallet and there were no other cards in his room any ideas heads shook all round the room neville stepped forward again ok he said kenworthy was single and lived in bristol the police there are making inquiries up here weve got work to do too i want four of you to walk the eight kilometres that kenworthy intended to walk the murderer may have followed him or may have come from the opposite direction go in two pairs one pair in the same direction as kenworthy the other pair in the opposite direction check along the path for anything that might be useful neville picked up a pile of photographs from the table and gave them to scott i want the rest of you making doortodoor inquiries in reeth he said its a small place everyone knows everyone take kenworthys picture with you see if anyone knows him or spoke to him or saw anyone speaking to him ds scott will tell you whos doing what neville turned and was about to leave the room when a voice came from the back sir neville turned round yes he said one of the officers had a hand in the air to show that he had spoken what is it asked neville the ace of spades sir said the officer ive just remembered its the card of death chapter two a serial killer i waited ten days before i decided to kill again i could have waited longer but i wanted to experience that wonderful feeling again i wanted to experience it quite badly that feeling of pleasure of being successful and of showing im right ive read the papers and the police seem to have no idea whats happening i didnt think there was any danger of being found out i was right about that i decided to use the same basic plan as before i would park my car in one place and then find an unwilling helper somewhere completely different however i had made some improvements to my plan the first was to leave my car in full view somewhere hikers leave their cars all over the north yorkshire countryside noone pays them any attention but a car that appears to be hidden might now after what happened ten days ago be of great interest to the police secondly i was going to put my plan into action in the late afternoon i hoped that meant the body wouldnt be found until the next morning that would make things a little more difficult for the police another change was to use a knife i had decided i wanted to experience different ways of killing finally i was going to use footpaths to get to the place i had chosen there are so many paths all over this part of yorkshire it would be difficult to avoid them for ever of course the police might be able to match my boots or my clothes to something they found along the path but i had thought about that after this and every future adventure i would burn everything that i was wearing or carrying clever arent i cleverer than the police i think i drove up the road from grinton towards redmire and left my car on moorland about halfway between the two villages then i started walking back over the hill towards reeth the day was cloudy but it was warm for the time of year the countryside in the yorkshire dales is very beautiful hills and dales up and down wild moorland on the tops of the hills sleepy villages and farms in the dales at the bottom to yorkshire people yorkshire is gods own country but i wasnt there to enjoy the natural beauty it took me a couple of hours walking through completely empty moorland to reach the place i was looking for a small building normally empty it was sometimes used by groups of people out shooting birds but not today it was right beside one of the main paths in the area with wonderful long views each way up and down the valley i took my knife and a map out of my backpack and sat down behind the building to wait there was always a chance that this late in the day nobody would walk past me however that was a chance i was prepared to take after about half an hour i saw a man and a woman in the distance but they turned off before they reached me and walked down the hill to the river at the bottom that was lucky because it might have been difficult to kill both of them i was saving a double killing for the time when i would use a gun shortly after that i noticed a woman on her own coming from the opposite direction it soon became clear she was going to come right past me this time i felt very calm i knew what to do time seemed to move more slowly as the woman walked towards the building i prepared myself and began to look forward to what i was going to do she was still about fifty metres away when i stepped out i was holding the map in my hand the knife was in the same hand but hidden under the map as i stepped out i was looking at the map so as not to frighten her she kept on walking towards me and i looked up she was medium height blonde probably in her thirties i smiled at her and looked a bit embarrassed im sorry i said waving the map a little but keeping the knife hidden i seem to be a bit lost you couldnt show me where i am could you of course she said and came over to where i was standing she bent to look at the map and i stuck my knife sharply into the lefthand side of her chest there was a long soft noise as the air seemed to leave her body i looked into her eyes feeling the moment enjoying it a surprised look crossed her face she tried to speak but couldnt i let go of the knife as she fell to her knees then onto her side her eyes closed and she was dead i stood still for a moment looking down at her i had done it again i felt wonderful godlike this was better than sex quickly i bent down and pulled the knife out of her chest i cleaned it on the outside of her jacket then put it in my backpack i took out a playing card from my pocket and put it in one of her pockets just so that the police would know who had done it then i started the twohour walk back to my car two happy hours in which i could relive the moment fiona russell was in her office in the north yorkshire police headquarters in northallerton she had just finished reading a recent report about internet crime and sat back to think about what she had learnt although she worked for the police she wasnt actually a police officer she was a crime analyst that meant she was one of the few people who was likely to see everything to do with a particular crime she read every piece of paper every interview every report she looked for patterns similarities differences she reported her findings to the senior officer in the investigation and she would make suggestions about what else needed to be done or what further information might be useful just as she sat back her phone rang russell she said picking up the phone immediately this is detective inspector neville north yorkshire police said the voice coming straight to the point im looking for an analyst with experience of serial killers your boss tells me youre the person to speak to russell felt the hairs on the back of her neck stand up she had worked on two serial killer investigations before at the end of each she had been exhausted each investigation had been a race against time a race to stop the killer murdering yet more people each investigation had demanded long patient hours each had stretched her mind more than she thought possible each had in its own way given her a new and different way of looking at pain and suffering but each had brought its own excitement and professional pleasure i guess so replied russell good said neville at the moment weve only got two murders so if were going by the rules this person isnt yet a serial killer russell knew that for a killer to become serial the rule was three or more but i dont want to wait for number three continued neville theres no doubt in my mind there will be a third one and more if we dont find him youll understand why when you see what weve got so far id like you on the team as soon as possible russell noticed nevilles use of him there had been female serial killers but mostly they were men ok answered russell where are you reeth swaledale replied neville russell looked at her watch i can be there in about an hour she said ninety minutes later fiona russell was sitting at a table at the back of the operations room helen scott was in a chair opposite giving her a quick overview of the investigation so far she was already describing the second murder the body was found early this morning on the hillside just outside reeth she said ill show you where on the map in a moment it was a thirtytwoyearold woman sheila mcfadyen she lived in richmond she was a nurse she worked nights at the local hospital and often came over here during the day to go walking she was divorced her exhusband lives locally but they seem to have got on well enough he says he was at home at the time she was murdered on his own it seems unlikely hes our man but were checking him out anyway just to be on the safe side she didnt have a boyfriend at least not that anyone knows about she had a lot of friends everyone speaks well of her she held her hands out as if to show the hopelessness of the situation there appears to be no reason why anyone would want to kill her scott added she paused for a moment what about the crime scene asked russell like the first one weve got almost nothing continued scott the killer stuck a knife straight into mcfadyens heart we havent found the knife the killer pulled it out cleaned it on her jacket and took it away weve found nothing at the scene that tells us anything about the killer we dont know which way he arrived at the scene or which way he left actually we dont know if its a man or a woman nobody seems to have seen anything or anyone strange scott reached over to a neighbouring table and picked up two small plastic bags inside each was a playing card an ace of spades in one the two of spades in the other and then we have these she said and put them on the table in front of russell russell picked one up and looked at it scott sat back in her chair and looked at russell two playing cards said scott the ace was found on the first body the two on the second you can see why the boss thinks weve got a serial killer on our hands of course the cards are a common make available anywhere yes said russell as she put down the ace and picked up the two looking at the two of spades she noticed two handwritten words in the middle of the card they read by knife an icy feeling ran down her back she put down the card and looked at scott she was in her late twenties with short dark hair smartly dressed and clearly intelligent a useful person to have in this kind of investigation everyone needed to be awake and alive to all the possibilities she was about to speak when a tall man in a suit came towards them his face was lined and there was a lot of grey in his black hair di neville he said introducing himself call me charles you must be fiona russell he pulled a chair out from the table and sat down has helen told you where were at he asked yes she has answered russell and asked neville any immediate thoughts russell was unwilling to say too much until she knew more about the investigation however being new to the team she felt she needed to give neville and scott something having read widely about serial killers she could make a few general points we can make some intelligent guesses said russell first of all were most probably looking for a man most serial killers are men there have been women serial killers but interestingly they usually prefer to kill indoors inside the home or maybe in a hospital a nurse killing off patients for example russell looked at scott and neville and id guess hes between the ages of twentyfive and forty she continued he needs to be old enough to plan and organise this but when theyre over forty people normally calm down or theyve already been caught and locked up neville and scott looked at each other then back at russell and he does seem to be organised added russell organised and intelligent thats why youve found so little at the crime scenes hes also carried out the murders well away from any cctv cameras were the most watched country in the world but out here in the dales there are very few cameras at all not many cctv traffic cameras in towns hardly any cameras around buildings and out in the countryside none at all neville and scott were listening and watching carefully id also say were looking for someone reasonably local someone who knows the area russell went on i mean im sure youve thought of this yourselves both the murders happened in places where the killer was unlikely to be interrupted he obviously knows the area well true said scott putting her elbows on the table but why why have these people been killed im not a psychologist said russell i just study the facts but looking at the playing cards i agree with you that hell try again i think youre absolutely right that this is a serial killer she looked at both of them and gave a small smile and of course if he keeps killing well catch him we only need to get lucky once he has to stay lucky all the time that afternoon the restaurant at the nearby half moon hotel was full of journalists both national and local from the newspapers radio and tv charles neville standing and facing the room had explained the latest developments the finding of the second body and how the investigation was moving forward he didnt much like talking to journalists in fact he didnt much like journalists but he knew that there were times when they could help investigations he had given a short report to keep them happy but said nothing about the playing cards it was usual for the police to keep back some information this unreported information was often useful later now he was preparing to answer questions with two dead bodies and no idea who the killer might be he wasnt expecting an easy time he could see scott at the back of the room standing and watching she smiled at him to let him know she was there if he needed her he nodded his thanks ive just time for a few questions said neville looking around the room a few people asked for more information about where the bodies had been found someone else asked some questions about the dead man and woman then a woman at the front spoke gemma taylor radio yorkshire she said there have been two murders so far do you think this is the work of a serial killer neville took a breath before answering as you know the two people were killed in very different ways he said however were obviously keeping an open mind on this question a man near the back raised a hand jonathan greene london evening post isnt it true that a playing card was found at each crime scene wouldnt that suggest the same killer for both crimes the room had been reasonably quiet but now there was complete silence this was new information nevilles neck started to turn red scott could see that he was holding back his anger neville caught scotts attention at the back of the room she knew what he wanted and nodded at him im afraid i cant discuss exactly what was and wasnt found at the crime scenes said neville but greene wasnt giving up so easily surely playing cards found at each crime scene would suggest the same killer said greene possibly even a serial killer suddenly all the journalists started talking to each other two left the room walking past scott taking phones from their pockets as they went this second investigation is less than a day old we dont yet have a clear idea of how everything at the crime scene might be important said neville he looked at his watch and now ladies and gentlemen im afraid thats all i have time for he looked at scott and nodded then left the room quickly there was a lot of noise as the journalists stood up and started to leave when jonathan greene stood up scott noticed he was short rather fat with thinning light brown hair and a big nose not attractive as he walked past her she turned and walked along beside him mr greene she said im detective sergeant scott id like to have a word with you chapter three early investigations what a good idea it was to send a text message to that journalist of course he wont know who its from i used a special website aliamailcom you can use it to send emails and text messages without anyone knowing where they come from you have to give a name and an email address when you start using the website but i gave a false name and i used an internet email service i also sent the message from an internet cafe not from my own computer smart eh naturally the police will want to talk to everyone who knows the journalists mobile phone number that could be hundreds of people and anyway the police wont find my name the journalist has no idea that i know his number how in fact do i know it well thats my secret so soon i will have what i want the information about the playing cards will be in tomorrows papers then the whole country will know that these achievements are the work of one person the whole country will see how good i am at what i do how successful i can be and then eventually when i reach my final goal i will show them that they were wrong who are they they are the people who stopped me realising the one burning ambition i had in life they are the people who wrongly and unkindly took away the chance i had to achieve something real but im talking too much and as the saying goes actions speak louder than words i must get on and plan my next adventure first i need some new clothes and boots i burned the clothes i used last time as i said i would and the boots are at the bottom of the river swale with a heavy stone in each one i dont want to buy new clothes secondhand ones will be much better there are plenty of shops around selling second hand clothes for a start secondhand clothes are cheaper and after all im only going to wear them once but also noone will recognise them as being mine that should confuse the police if they ever get a description of me then ive got to decide the how when and where for my next adventure the how is easy this time i want to get up close and personal a strangling my hands around the throat of my helper i want to experience the physical closeness that comes from using my hands rather than a stone or a knife so far i have always watched life go this time i want to feel it leave as for the when it must be soon i think i cant wait much longer the police are no closer to finding me i dont have to worry about them and i have a growing hunger for the excitement of the kill or is it a thirst for blood to be honest i dont care for me it has become like a drug one which i need more and more so theres only one thing left to decide the where ill have to study my map the yorkshire dales is a large area but fortunately i know it well it will be easy to find somewhere suitable you might want to know where but im not going to tell you youll find out soon enough a quiet place for a private meeting i tell you i dont know who sent it to me jonathan greene searched through his pockets and finally pulled out a mobile phone greene neville and scott were at the back of the reeth memorial hall in a small room which neville had decided to use for interviews there were four chairs and a table the walls were a dull cream colour with some tourist photos of swaledale on them and there was a window that looked out onto the back of reeth garage greene put his phone on the table and pushed it across to neville check for yourself he said rather crossly theres no senders number neville pushed the phone towards scott she picked it up opened it and started pressing buttons you didnt think it might be a good idea to come and talk to me the senior officer about it nevilles face was still red with anger and there was a sharp edge to his voice come on inspector replied greene he put an elbow on the table and turned his hand over im a journalist i get a text message with information about a murder inquiry information that the police must already have do i go and tell the police something they already know or do i send in the story so that the evening post is first with the breaking news come on inspector get real dont tell me to get real exploded neville his fist hit the table hard his face grew darker this is a murder investigation neville spoke slowly his voice low and angry his eyes locked on to greenes you have what could be in fact probably is a message directly from the murderer you have no idea how important that might be to the investigation it might lead us straight to the murderer it might help us save a life lives even and yet you dont think that the first thing you should do is bring it to the attention of the police no mr greene you get real keeping information from the police is a crime and you know it neville stopped speaking but continued to stare at greene there was silence in the room eventually greene looked away embarrassed even a little shaken by nevilles anger scott looked up for a moment and then continued to examine the phone hes right she said to neville theres no sender number on that message how easy is it to get your number asked neville how many people have it not that many replied greene looking happier now that the questioning had moved onto easier ground probably just the people in my phone book i dont give my number out to that many people and the newspaper wont give it out neville looked at scott well want that phone then he said make sure you give mr greene a receipt for it and get someone to check everyone in his phone book but hey you cant do that said greene i need my phone tough said neville turning back to greene its part of a murder inquiry now get out youre lucky not to be spending the night in jail and next time if there is a next time make sure you do the right thing greene stood up slowly and shaking his head left the room as the door closed neville looked at scott check him out too said neville and actually do it yourself i want someone experienced on it i want to know how long hes been a journalist if hes any good how long hes been at the london evening post everything i want to know why the murderer chose to give the information to him if in fact he did scott looked up sharply you dont think hes she began probably not replied neville but it doesnt hurt to be careful late afternoon the following day with the second murder less than fortyeight hours old russell was called into the interview room to talk to neville and scott a lot of noise was coming through from the main hall officers were making phone calls asking questions checking information writing reports neville closed the door and the noise level dropped right he said pulling out a chair and sitting down heavily fiona youve been here twentyfour hours now and youve been through everything what can you tell us russell sat down scott took out a notebook and kept it in her hand russell had a pile of papers which she put on the table well i dont want to raise your hopes too much began russell but there is a line of inquiry that might be useful though might is the important word here go on said neville the bristol police have been very helpful continued russell theyve searched kenworthys house spoken to a lot of his friends and to his employers kenworthy worked at one of the universities in bristol he was a lecturer in medicine at avon university and sheila mcfadyen was a nurse said scott exactly replied russell but theres more she actually did her nursing training at avon university so she could have known matthew kenworthy said neville well yes russell sounded unsure but asked neville like i said russell went on i dont want to raise your hopes sheila mcfadyen was at university twelve fifteen years ago i dont yet know if kenworthy was there then he lectured in medicine she studied nursing ok the subjects are similar but theyre completely different courses so even if they were both there at the same time they might not have known each other i see what you mean about might being the important word said neville however its certainly a line of inquiry thats worth following up right replied russell ive emailed the bristol police a list of questions that they can find answers to there first thing tomorrow morning ill have another list of questions that your officers can follow up here good said neville anything else not really replied russell as i said yesterday the killer is organised and intelligent hes left us very little so far what about mcfadyens exhusband asked scott is there any chance it could be him he kills someone else first then his exwife then a third person maybe so it looks like a serial killing but actually all he wants to do is get rid of his ex an unpleasant thought said neville the smallest of smiles came and went in his eyes but one thats certainly worth considering why dont you look into that possibility ok replied scott and wrote in her notebook neville sat back in his chair now then he said still looking at scott what about mr greene tell us what youve found out about him scott turned back a few pages in her notebook apparently jonathan greene is a wellknown journalist he works mainly down south on the london evening post which explains why ive never heard of him scott looked up from her notes he usually covers crime stories but he also makes his own investigations into areas where he thinks people have been breaking or bending the law such as asked neville ive got a list of some of his more recent stories replied scott turning over a page in her notebook a lot of his stuff is just straight crime reporting what happened who did what who went to prison that sort of thing but at the end of last year he wrote a couple of big pieces one was on crime in the health service cleaners stealing drugs and equipment and selling it all on the black market that resulted in a police investigation i remember that said neville i didnt realise it was greene the other piece was an interview with jerry anderson continued scott whos he asked russell one of the big players in organised crime in london in the s answered neville hed just come out of prison after fifteen years for bank robbery and murder continued scott and greene persuaded him to do an interview he talked all sorts of rubbish about how he had seen the light given up his life of crime and was going to go straight mind you added neville im told theres a few million that still hasnt been found from his last bank job so he can probably afford to go straight anyway i guess thats why greenes phone number is difficult to get hold of explained scott you wouldnt want anderson calling you up in the middle of the night hes not a pleasant character at the best of times absolutely replied neville scott looked down at her notes again and theres another big story that hes been working on recently she said unfortunately it hasnt made the newspapers yet and as a result i havent been able to find out anything about it he was away for a couple of weeks at the beginning of the year working on something but well the people i spoke to either didnt know or didnt want to tell me i think you should investigate that further suggested russell it might be worth finding out if thats why hes really up here i mean it seems odd for a journalist from a london evening newspaper to be here he might have come because of the text message said scott i dont think so replied russell she looked through some of the papers on the table in front of her no she continued he only received the message a couple of hours before charles spoke to the journalists i made a note of the time well i agree with fiona said neville you need to find out more about this story of greenes just then there was a knock a woman with short blonde hair opened the door and looked into the room sorry to interrupt sir she said to neville another bodys been found an oldish man on the harkerside road near scabba wath bridge there was a three of spades in his hand chapter four a different kind of killing i needed luck today i wasnt absolutely ready for the kill id looked at my map i had some ideas but i hadnt reached a final decision on where i was going to find my helper then he found me i knew him of course he lived near me id seen him around and chatted to him before i passed him on the street near his house in the middle of the afternoon and said hello he invited me in for a cup of tea and i accepted as soon as we stepped into his house i knew he was the one something in the air seemed different he was an expoliceman and he knew something i was sure of it i experienced an unusual feeling partly a warning partly a call to action he turned and started to speak immediately i knew what i had to do he looked in good shape for someone in his early sixties but im young strong and healthy and i had the element of surprise on my side to delay would allow the tiniest possibility of watching my dream die i couldnt let that happen my hands flew forward round his neck my thumbs pressed hard down on his throat stopping him breathing his eyes opened wide and filled with fear as he realised what i was doing he fought back he tried to pull my hands away from his throat but i was too strong he hit at my arms but he was already becoming weak he reached for my eyes with his fingernails a last hopeless attempt to save himself but i was expecting that my head shot forward through his hands my forehead hitting him square on the nose there was the sickening noise of breaking bone his hands fell weakly down to his sides as his face started to turn a kind of bluish purple a few drops of blood from his nose covered his top lip his tongue came out his body became a dead weight in my hands i let it down gently and laid him on the floor then i sat down next to him i was breathing hard my heart going as if i had just run a hundred metres i could feel the sweat on my face and the fear in my heart fear or was it excitement i took some deep breaths and began to feel calmer i looked at him i felt his neck he was definitely dead but i couldnt enjoy the moment as i had hoped i had a decision to make i could leave the body here or i could take it into the countryside where the other bodies had been found i looked round there was only a little blood it was all on his top lip and drying fast there were no obvious signs of a fight nothing to show that i had been there but im a planner a careful planner i knew that the more i planned the luckier i would be so i decided to take the body to the countryside sure the police would realise that the body had been moved i had watched enough crime shows on tv to know that but they wouldnt know where the body had been moved from and that might be important there might be just some little thing in this room skin hair clothing that could lead the police to me but not if they didnt look it was a good plan i felt a wave of pleasure wash over me i let myself out of the back door and started to walk home i would need to steal a car i obviously couldnt use my car for this id also need a blanket to cover the body in the back of the car and the three of spades helen scott pulled the police land rover onto the grass at the side of the road a few hundred metres from scabba wath bridge on the lefthand side of the road was a drystone wall with fields the other side going down to the river at the bottom of the dale on the right was grass moorland and some low bushes with yellow flowers sheep were wandering freely over the moorland as they often do at this time of year it was early evening not yet dark and a light rain was falling scott and neville got out of the land rover and climbed to a group of people standing further up the hillside kay harding the police doctor was on her knees examining a mans body he was lying on his stomach his head turned away looking up the hillside harding stood up as neville and scott arrived one of us she said looking at neville nevilles eyes asked the question brian barningham said harding he was an inspector in leyburn he stopped work last year just after his sixtieth birthday and moved to richmond god neville shook his head in disbelief i know i was there at his leaving party i knew him quite well harding bent down to look at the body again im afraid its not pretty to look at she said he was strangled he was also hit in the face about the time he died is it the same began scott yes replied harding straightening up and passing a plastic bag to neville inside it was a playing card the three of spades and across the middle of the card were the words by hand neville passed it to scott who looked at it and gave it back to harding but there is a difference said harding bending down again for another look the bodys been moved killed here and just moved asked scott or killed somewhere else and brought here oh killed somewhere else and brought here answered harding i mean hes lying on his front now but after death id say he spent a short time on his back and then longer on his side neville looked at the moorland round about then down at the roadside get some sceneofcrime tape he said turning to scott i want it twenty metres each side of the body down to the road noone else can walk there until that areas been searched right replied scott nodding at a couple of the officers in the group to do what neville wanted and i mean searched continued neville carefully i want officers on their hands and knees the killer must have come by car so look for tyre marks by the side of the road too ok answered scott who found the body asked neville a local farmer replied harding first farm on the left that way she pointed down the road to her right he had to get back said something about his sheep ok said neville well talk to him time of death asked scott some time this afternoon said harding three or four maybe it was quite a warm afternoon before the rain came so its not easy to be exact ok thanks kay said neville hes all yours he was divorced said neville looking at scott but i guess someone ought to tell his ex ill go and do that i know where she lives you look after things here and talk to the farmer who found the body ill meet you back in reeth in an hour or so at seven oclock the following morning fiona russell yawned as she checked her email in the operations room shed had three hours sleep shed stayed up well into the night reading reports from officers in bristol richmond and reeth a new email had come in from bristol overnight but it didnt contain any useful information shed now seen everything to do with the first two murders and everything that had so far come in about the third the only thing that seemed odd to her was that the third body had been moved why was that had he had to move it and if so why she was just turning these questions over in her mind when the door opened and neville and scott came into the room carrying cups of coffee neville was speaking theyre going to go crazy he was saying two murders in fortyeight hours he looked at russell journalists he explained with feeling as if we didnt have better things to do than talk to them we have work to do neville walked through to the interview room and put his coffee on the table the killers made a mistake he said changing the subject im sure of it hes made a mistake and weve got to make the most of it he looked at russell what do you think about it fiona neville asked moving the body i mean russell joined them and they all sat down it is strange she replied she thought for a minute and then looked at neville up until now we havent looked at any cctv film have we she asked there are no cctv cameras where the bodies were found replied neville weve got no idea what to look for or where we might have now said russell what do you mean asked neville well we now know barningham was killed some time soon after three oclock and his body was found at about six thirty she put a finger to her lips as she continued to think her idea through our killer might live in one of the villages in swaledale or arkengarthdale or wensleydale even but equally he might live in one of the nearby towns where there are cctv cameras said scott good thinking said neville he looked at scott get going helen we want all cctv film from the roads leading out here from both richmond and leyburn and catterick asked scott yes replied neville and maybe barnard castle too also get someone to keep those journalists off our backs ill talk to them later this afternoon if ive got time scott got up and left the room any news from bristol asked neville turning to russell its still possible that kenworthy and mcfadyen knew each other answered russell we now know they were both at the university at the same time however the bristol police havent been able to establish that they ever actually met ok said neville keep on at them and what about mcfadyens husband any news on him hes in the clear replied russell helen sent some officers round to talk to his neighbours one of them saw him putting his rubbish out at the time of the murder right said neville i suppose crossing someone off our list is a kind of move forward russell smiled tiredly at neville as scott came back into the room this latest murder does raise a few questions said russell the first is why did he move the body this time also the fact that barningham was expolice is that important in anyway neville and scott both shook their heads no idea replied scott the other thing continued russell is why is he doing this there has to be a reason even if it only means something to him look at the ways hes killed hit on the head with a stone stabbed with a knife strangled the first card didnt have any writing on it but the second and third said by knife and by hand its almost as if hes trying out different ways of killing people said scott exactly replied russell there was silence for a moment maybe to show that he can suggested scott more silence he doesnt seem to be getting pleasure from making people suffer said russell i mean some serial killers take ages they almost play with the people they kill so youd say its the act of killing thats important to him then would you asked neville yes i think so replied russell later that morning scott was walking back from the bakers in silver street after an unsuccessful attempt to buy some cheese sandwiches when she saw jonathan greene walk into the shoulder of mutton pub he had a large bag over his shoulder and was wearing a patterned grey shirt and grey trousers given his appearance and build it wasnt a great fashion choice he looked a bit like a baby elephant well theres always one way to find out what hes doing here scott said to herself she waited a couple of minutes and then walked into the pub after him greene was sitting in the corner beside a coal fire there was a glass of beer in front of him and he was reading the darlington and stockton times he looked up as scott came over to his table a little light reading he said with a smile i love local newspapers from the way he spoke scott realised he meant something quite different not good enough for you the d and s asked scott not in the same class as the nationals and the london dailies hey i was joking replied greene looking a little hurt yeah right said scott not believing him for a moment scott pulled out a chair and sat down id like to ask you a few questions she said greene said nothing scott looked him straight in the eye it would be very helpful if youd answer them here and now she said rather than make me take you to the operations room to talk to di neville i think youd prefer it too in the inspectors judgement journalists are the lowest form of human life you may have noticed greene smiled ask away he said i cant promise to answer them all but i never mind talking to an attractive woman scott felt slightly sick at the thought of being chatted up by greene but she continued as you know were looking into who could have your mobile number especially up here in north yorkshire she began so it would be helpful for us to know why youre here ah said greene we know you didnt come up here to report on the murders said scott ah said greene again he bit his bottom lip then smiled and said how badly do you want to know scott wasnt sure if this was a real question or a chatup line it didnt really matter to her how badly do you want to see di neville she asked in reply looking at greene her eyes were stony greene pushed a hand through what hair he had left this is really difficult he began i mean i dont tell anyone about my stories until where were you earlier this year interrupted scott i understand you were out of the country for a time where did you go greene paused a moment then seemed to accept that he would have to answer the middle east he said the gulf asked scott yes scott had a sudden thought the army catterick garrison was about twenty kilometres from reeth there were over soldiers there all of whom had seen active service the army she said yes said greene youve been talking to soldiers she said it wasnt really a question yes said greene we havent found any soldiers numbers in your phone book said scott i told you i dont keep many numbers in my phone book he answered but youve given your number to some soldiers said scott yes replied greene scott took out a notebook and pushed it across the table i want the name of every soldier who has your number she said but now said scott greene held out his hands i can give you some names he said but not all of them i meet a lot of these guys in pubs we just chat i dont ask them their names quite often they dont want me to know with the kind of story im investigating if their name gets in the paper it makes trouble for them with the army they have to be careful scott took out a pen and gave it to greene she looked him in the eye and said nothing greene pulled the notebook towards him and started writing when youve done that said scott you can tell me exactly what youre investigating chapter five caught on film i got away with it but i was exhausted so tired that this morning i slept till midday part of the tiredness was physical first the fight then moving the body part of the tiredness was in the mind because i hadnt been completely ready for this adventure id had to think quickly and carefully noone else was at home when i got up i made a coffee and thought back to yesterday afternoon i needed to check i had made no mistakes i had walked home for a blanket a change of clothes and the three of spades although i was in a hurry i walked running would have drawn attention to me i put the blanket the card and a pair of binoculars in a bag and went out to look for a car stealing a car is easy when you know how and i know how i drove it back to my helpers house and parked round the back got the body onto the back seat and covered it with the blanket then i started out towards reeth on the way i thought about where to leave the body a side road somewhere quiet where i could get the body out without being seen it was about four oclock in the afternoon but a light rain had been falling all afternoon there wouldnt be many walkers out i decided on the perfect place i drove along the swaledale road and turned left over scabba wath bridge then i turned left again onto the road back to grinton and reeth there was moorland here with low bushes that would hide the body for a while i pulled off the road there was grass by the side of the road so i wouldnt leave any tyre marks then i got out of the car and carefully checked the countryside around me with the binoculars nobody working quickly i got the body off the back seat holding it by the ankles i pulled it up the side of the hill and hid it behind some bushes i left the card in the mans hand looked round to make sure there was nothing for the police to find and made my way back to the car there was little else left to do get rid of the car change my clothes and burn the ones i was wearing drop my shoes in the river easy it had all been rather hurried and i was sorry about that but now that its over i can relax look back and enjoy the moment i can put a third sticker on my murder map to show where the third body will be found if it hasnt been found already i can also start planning my next adventure im getting a taste for this not only can people see how powerful i am and what i can achieve but im also enjoying the feeling its the high that comes with every kill the certainty that its right to be doing this the next one will be two double pleasure ill use the gun ive been out on the moors and fired a couple of shots just to get used to it there are only five shots left in the gun and i dont know if i can get any more bullets because of that i want to get close so theres no chance of missing i know when and where its going to happen too it will be in the early evening at the roadside so ill need to steal another car but that wont be a problem perhaps tonight is a bit early or perhaps not already i can feel the excitement building already i know how good the feeling will be yes tonight that evening fiona russell was at her desk wondering when shed next get a good nights sleep she reached for her coffee and heard another email come through on her computer a report of two cars stolen in richmond the afternoon before two stolen cars was pretty unusual for richmond it wasnt a big town cars didnt often get stolen and two on the same day was strange a dark green mini had been stolen from the market square late in the evening and a silver skoda had gone missing from the gallowfields business park some time between pm and pm the skoda had been stolen around the time of the third murder so a skoda then maybe russell made a note of the car number then she started up some cctv film on her computer film from the one camera in richmond that covered the road out to swaledale and reeth she pressed fastforward until the time in the righthand corner was that was about the right time but was it the right road of course the car thief might not be the killer at all he or she might not even have headed towards swaledale russell hit play cars went past then cars didnt go past then one car then no cars for a long time it wasnt a busy road she hit fastforward then play again when more traffic came along the time got to the little red bus went past the bus service from richmond to reeth and then on up swaledale then a farm vehicle followed by a line of cars then nothing russell stopped the film and went back the cars behind the farm vehicle were quite close together she froze the picture and looked closely at the back of the line was a bmw then an audi a ford a land rover but what was the first car it was difficult to see the cctv was black and white so that was no help she zoomed in close and moved down the picture to try and see the cars back number plate it was hidden the land rover was too close she went back a couple of minutes and started the film again this time she played it slowly when the cars came into view she froze the film and zoomed in on the back of the first car yes it was a skoda that was good she let the film go forward again slowly stop she could see half the number plate just the last three letters they were the same as the last letters of the stolen skoda yes that was very good something like electricity rushed through her her head felt light the feeling almost took her breath away just then scott came into the room there was an excited look on her face but she stopped when she saw russell fiona are you ok she asked looking worriedly at the other woman russell waved a hand and gave her a big smile im fine im fine she said come and look at this she took the film back to where the line of cars first came into view watch this she said the first car behind the tractor is the one to watch i think our man is driving it they watched the film closely until the cars went out of sight the cars were moving away from the camera so it was impossible to see the drivers russell took the film back to the beginning and they watched it again slowly then russell stopped the film and looked at scott why do you think its him asked scott the car was stolen around the time of the murder answered russell ah said scott you think he stole a car rather than used his own if he has one yes replied russell she reached out and took hold of scotts arm if its him he stole the car she said and he drove out from richmond so maybe he lives there she smiled at scott hes starting to make mistakes russell let go of scotts arm and stood up anyway she said you came in here with something important oh yes said scott the excited look returning to her face lets find charles we need to compare notes half an hour later neville scott and russell were sitting round the table in the interview room let me get this straight said neville looking at scott the investigation that jonathan greene is working on at the moment is to do with the army yes replied scott hes looking at the effects of active service on soldiers who have been out in the middle east and the gulf mainly the effects on their minds and what the government is doing to help soldiers who are badly affected i thought he was a crime reporter said russell he is replied scott he thinks the government isnt doing enough apparently he feels that their position can be seen as criminal greenes brother was a soldier he was so badly affected that he had to leave the army he now never goes out of his house for greene this is personal i see said neville and you think a soldier sent greene the text message about the cards a soldier that greene gave his number to that does seem logical said russell i mean we think the killer lives locally we think the killer sent the text message the killer had greenes mobile number and the only people up here that he has given his mobile number to are soldiers and a few other journalists and how many soldiers did greene give his number to neville asked scott thats the problem replied scott he doesnt know ive got half a dozen names here but hes talked to lots more soldiers are quite happy to talk to him but because his investigation is unlikely to be popular with the army theyre less happy about giving him their names neville looked at russell and you think you have the killer on cctv in a stolen skoda leaving richmond just after the last murder yes replied russell i need to see if he comes back the same way later i might even get to see him since hell be facing the camera but you know how clear cctv pictures are i dont expect to be able to tell you what he looks like she opened her mouth to say something else but then stopped and thought yes asked neville as far as i know said russell slowly still thinking her ideas through no cars were stolen around the days of the first two murders ill check that but im pretty sure im right neville and scott said nothing they waited for russell to finish making her point that means he must have used his own car to come out here for the first two murders said russell so more than likely hes going to be on cctv in his own car on those days said scott if they still have the film they dont use videotapes these days said russell everythings on computer hard disk and its kept for longer so we should be able to get hold of it right said neville making a decision fiona first check the cctv to see if youve got him coming back into richmond yesterday then look at the film from the same camera for the first two murders he turned to scott helen he said you follow up the army idea youve got the list of soldiers go over to catterick talk to them ask questions see if you can find out who else talked to greene take a couple of officers with you this could be important pushing his fingers through his hair neville stood up itll be good to have something new to tell the journalists tomorrow he said i have to say im getting sick of seeing my photo on the front page of national newspapers as neville scott and russell were making their way back into the operations room they heard a woman police officer talking on the phone yes she said yes i agree thats very strange well ill tell my boss and at that moment she looked round and saw neville behind her just a moment my boss is right here ill pass you over neville raised his eyebrows inspector atkins from richmond something about a stolen car said the officer neville took the phone di neville he said he lifted a hand to tell scott and russell to wait they heard his end of the conversation thats right yes i know weve just been talking about it yes that is strange yes well id like forensics to examine it as soon as possible we think it may have been used by the killer ok ill leave it with you tell them to ring me as soon as they have anything neville gave the phone back to the officer and looked at scott and russell they found the car in almost exactly the same place it was stolen from he told them atkins is getting forensics on to it strange to be in the same place said scott russell looked thoughtful i wonder why she asked what do you mean asked neville why did he put it back in the same place she asked there must be a reason it could be close to where he lives so it was easy to get to or it could be a long way from where he lives to make life difficult for us scott walked over to the door and back thinking the others watched her the timing she said the timing is important we know the time of death soon after three by four oclock weve got him on the cctv camera coming out of richmond exactly replied russell he must have stolen the car from somewhere close to the scene of the crime said scott the car was in the gallowfields business park said russell not far from barninghams house added scott which might be the scene of the crime said neville although we havent found any signs there just then a phone rang on the other side of the operations room a police officer answered it then looked at neville another one sir he said in fact this time there are two the room went silent russells eyes opened wide neville went across the room and took the phone after a short conversation he put the phone down and turned to face the room the four and five of spades by gun he said hes shot a young couple out by surrender bridge he looked at scott lets go he said sir asked russell she knew they normally used first names but she was intending to ask for something special a little extra politeness would be good politics neville looked at her she could see he knew what the question was she could also see what the answer would be yes he replied i know the scene of the crime isnt where im usually supposed to be she began yes yes come on replied neville get your coat and come with us but dont be sick i have seen dead bodies before said russell chapter six closing in life just gets better and better or is it death thats getting better anyway it was another perfect killing im so good at it why they didnt want me i just dont understand i walked down to the old station to find myself a car the old railway station is now a cinema and theres a car park in front of it if the owner of the car was watching a film i might even get the car back before the film finished he or she wouldnt even know it had been stolen it would all depend how the evening went it was early evening not dark yet you might think i was taking chances stealing cars in broad daylight but im quick i broke into the car quite easily put my gun on the floor in front of the passenger seat and got the car started then i drove out towards reeth and swaledale i knew what i was looking for there are small parking areas beside the road in a number of places in the dale i would drive round until i found one with a car parked in it maybe an old couple whod stopped to look at the view or some young lovers having a kiss and a cuddle its all the same to me i just want to show what i can do i got to reeth first the lights were on in reeth memorial hall id read in the papers that the police were using it as an operations room it seemed funny to be driving past the place they were trying to catch me from catch me if you can i thought but you cant you wont there was noone parked between reeth and langthwaite so i turned left along the road to surrender bridge and headed towards swaledale theres a ford along here where a stream goes over the road and you have to drive through the water the ford is famous because it was always shown at the beginning of a popular tv series about a vet id watched those programmes as a kid but these days i only watch crime shows from there i drove on to surrender bridge as i came over the top of the hill and looked down towards the bridge i could see that just over the other side a blue car was parked and there were people in it two people just what i was looking for i drove over the bridge and then stopped but not too close to the other car i didnt want to alarm them when id stolen the car id noticed that there was a map on the back seat i thought id try the map business again i put the gun in my pocket and opened the map then i got out and walked across there was a young couple in the car he was about twenty darkhaired goodlooking she was the same age blonde and pretty they had been kissing but had broken off when i stopped my car seeing me coming towards them map in hand the young woman opened the drivers window can i help you she smiled at me i was only a couple of metres away by then i smiled back took out my gun and shot her in the head she fell forward onto the wheel her boyfriend shouted something but he didnt have time to do anything i pointed the gun a few centimetres to the left and shot him through the head as well i checked they were both dead and then sat both the bodies up in their seats so they looked alive finally i reached into the car and threw the four and five of spades onto the back seat when you fire a gun like this the bullet shoots out of the front of the gun and the casing which holds the bullet is thrown out of the side sometimes a few metres away one casing was easy to find i picked it up and put it in my pocket the other was nowhere to be seen i searched for it among the grass and small bushes but i just couldnt find it after a few minutes i heard the sound of a car in the distance it was time to go even if the police found the casing it was unlikely to matter taking the casings was just me being careful leaving nothing to chance what the police really needed was the gun with the gun and the bullets they could get a match but they would never find the gun i got back in my car and drove away it would be some time before the bodies were found nobody would think twice about gunshots out here farmers are always shooting rabbits and the rich pay large amounts of money to come and shoot birds the sound of gunshots isnt unusual in the dales i drove back to richmond enjoying the moment feeling the excitement run through my body and already looking forward to the next killing im getting closer to my goal it took neville scott and russell fifteen minutes to reach surrender bridge from the operations room in reeth neville and russell went in a police land rover scott took her own car black and yellow sceneofcrime tape was already closing off a wide area around a small blue car two police land rovers were parked on the opposite side of the road behind a red toyota x a man and a woman police officer were talking to someone in the toyota a third police officer was setting up some large lights so that everyone could see what was going on a fourth was standing just near the sceneofcrime tape the police doctors on her way he said as neville came up to him neville nodded towards the toyota whats happening there he asked the young womans mother replied the officer her daughter was out with her boyfriend and said shed be home for dinner by eight when she wasnt back by ten thirty her mum came out looking for her she said she knows the places they usually go weve been trying to calm her down but understandably shes really upset husband asked neville a couple of the guys have gone to get him and to tell the boys parents replied the officer the cards asked neville on the back seat replied the officer i havent touched anything as soon as i saw the bodies and the cards i closed the area off good thank you neville turned to scott lets have a look they took some white plastic overshoes out of the back of the land rover and put them over their own shoes then they bent under the police tape and slowly and carefully walked over to the blue car what do you think asked neville and they walked round the car looking in through the windows id say they were shot from fairly close said scott but i guess we should wait and see what kay has to say just then a green land rover arrived and kay harding got out she immediately put on overshoes and joined scott and neville she reached in through the car window and felt the necks of both the young people for signs of life no surprises there she said but i have to check then she bent down and looked at the bullet holes in their heads they were shot from less than a metre away she said let me get on with things and ill tell you more when ive finished here i realise how important this is thanks kay said neville neville and scott made their way back outside the police tape where russell joined them charles she began neville looked at her in reply if he came from richmond again she left the sentence unfinished good thinking said neville looking at his watch lets say he took some time to find what he was looking for so first see if there are any reports of stolen cars then check cctv film from about six oclock to eleven oclock you know what to look for russell had a busy night to start with no cars had yet been reported stolen the next problem was that cctv cameras in north yorkshire werent managed by the police but by a local government officer he wasnt happy to get a midnight phone call from fiona russell wanting cctv film from that evening and from two weeks earlier cant it wait until morning he complained sleepily sure replied russell ill suggest that to my boss im sure hed be happy for you to come into the police station until then helping us with our inquiries through the night god thought russell smiling to herself ive spent so long with police officers im starting to sound like one russell received the film by email within the hour and started work first she played through the film from the evening before noting the number of each car or van that went from richmond towards reeth and swaledale then she went through again noting cars going back into richmond then she matched the two lists ten cars were on both lists she yawned pushed her fingers through her hair and looked across the operations room neville and scott had returned at two in the morning they were in the interview room working their way through a pile of papers russell poured herself a coffee from the machine by the window and went back to her computer there was no point telling neville anything until she had names and addresses for the owners of those ten cars in any case she felt sure the killer had used a stolen car after half an hour on the driver and vehicle database russell had the information she needed she went over to join neville and scott in the interview room they looked up as she came in ten names and addresses she said putting a piece of paper on the table owners of cars that left richmond early yesterday evening in the direction of reeth and returned some time later theyre all possibles but my guess is the car was stolen even though it hasnt yet been reported anyway ill start on the film from the first two murders now just then the phone rang neville picked up di neville he listened for a moment then said just a moment kay helen and fiona are here ill put you on speakerphone he pressed a button and kay hardings voice came into the room loud and clear you owe me charles she said ive been working through the night on this one for you noted replied neville what have you got i can narrow the time of death to between eight and nine thirty if that helps she answered it might replied neville they were both young and healthy both as you know died from a bullet wound to the head continued harding ok said neville and the bullets yes the bullets said harding both from the same gun both ninemillimetre both made in iraq what neville halfshouted the question what do you mean your guys found a casing from one of the bullets at the scene of the crime explained harding there was some writing on it i copied it and emailed it to a friend of mine at newcastle university hes a lecturer in middle eastern studies he told me that the writing was arabic and that it says alqadisiyyah i looked it up on the internet and asked neville alqadisiyyah is a province in southern iraq said harding but its also the name of a factory that makes a ninemillimetre gun called a tariq basically a beretta ml but made in iraq theyve been making them since before and theyre still used today by the iraqi police the iraqi police there was disbelief in nevilles voice russell put a hand on his arm no she said it adds up its all to do with the army soldiers out in iraq or afghanistan or wherever they get lots of opportunities to get their hands on guns bullets knives all sorts of things especially from the people they are fighting thanks very much kay said neville switching the phone off deep in thought he turned to russell so youre saying he said that its easy for a soldier to get hold of a tariq ninemillimetre and bring it back to britain as a kind of war prize absolutely said russell i worked on a case in london a few years ago where an exsoldier was selling guns to criminals guns that hed brought back from places all around the world nobody spoke for a moment we come back to soldiers and the army again said neville he looked at scott how are you getting on with greenes list he asked i called catterick earlier she said there were six names on greenes list of those three were at the garrison at the time of the first two murders and the other three have recently gone out to afghanistan they left before the murders started however i did manage to speak to one of the first three soldiers hes given me the names of nine others who spoke to greene but didnt tell him who they were scott looked at neville and russell but dont get too excited she warned them i get the feeling greene spoke to a lot more people never mind that said neville its a start as fiona said at the beginning we only need to get lucky once i dont suppose you found out which of those nine live in richmond did you asked russell thats where the cars have been stolen from scott started to look through the papers on the table in front of her and pulled out the one she was looking for yes she replied i did she looked at the list two of them she turned the paper round so that the others could read it ill look on the driver and vehicle database to see if either of them has a car said russell then if we look at the cctv from the days of the first two murders we might find a match do it said neville and he looked at scott and helen give fiona a hand ive got a feeling we might be getting close ten minutes later russell gave scott a piece of paper with letters and numbers written on it two car numbers she said one for each of the soldiers who live in richmond ive emailed the cctv film from the day of the second murder to your computer you look through that ill look at the first one you were right about a car being stolen last night said scott as she sat down it was reported at ten twenty last night in richmond the reports only just made it onto the computer russell thought for a moment has the car been found yet she asked i dont think so replied scott tell them to try the gallowfields business park said russell when scott looked questioningly at her russell said just a guess then she pushed her fingers through her hair and took a deep breath she looked at the two names and addresses on the paper in front of scott i dont know richmond that well she said is either of these addresses near the business park neither of them is very far away answered scott russell sat down in front of her computer she put her elbows on the table and rested her chin on her hands she thought for a few moments i think she began speaking slowly i think that the third murder the one where he first stole a car i think that maybe it wasnt planned as well as the others i think he was surprised in some way scott looked at russell i also think continued russell that he felt he had to move the body in a hurry and that first stolen car was taken from the business park because its close to where he lives leaving the car there when hed finished with it was just an attempt to confuse us that sounds a reasonable guess to me replied scott ok said russell having another look at the car numbers in front of her lets see if we can find one of these two russell and scott started watching the different films on their computers fortyfive minutes later russell watched the same thirty seconds of film for the third time then she sat back in her chair got you she said quietly chapter seven the reid family after the shooting i wanted to put the car back in the station car park but as i got near i could see a police car and a man and a woman talking to two police officers i drove by quickly before they saw me then i went up to the gallowfields business park if i leave all the stolen cars in the same place the police wont know what to think i walked home thinking about the shooting it was cleverly done in my opinion a foreign gun a stolen car two clean kills two killings nearer my goal im like a welloiled machine a welloiled killing machine training ha i dont need training for this this is all down to planning organisation and being brave enough to believe i can do it being brave thats it they never really thought i was brave enough before i went home i turned down a side street and decided to keep walking i didnt want to arrive home and have to talk to anyone also i had to put the gun back in its hiding place i would stay out for another half an hour until everyone at home had gone to bed while i walked i could plan my next adventure it should be soon maybe even tomorrow the sooner i reach my goal my target number the sooner i can show the world what im made of and the sooner theyll want me tomorrow then tomorrow morning a drowning i think there are plenty of paths by the river in both swaledale and arkengarthdale it should be easy to surprise someone hold them under the water and feel the life leave their body of course they would fight back but i would be prepared for this i could either knock them out first and then hold them under or i could choose someone smaller and less powerful than me i considered both courses of action i liked them both i would decide tomorrow and where do i plan to do this mentally i worked my way along the river swale from reeth to the upper dale theres a favourite place of mine where a stream called barney beck joins the river i had many picnics there as a child ive walked that path many times as an adult i know the place better than the back of my hand it was ten past eleven when i let myself quietly in through the front door i stopped inside the door and listened silence gently i locked the door and went into the kitchen from there a door leads through to the garage the garage is full of everything that we dont want in the house old boxes a clothes dryer two bikes a television that doesnt work suitcases all sorts of rubbish the suitcases are kept on a kind of platform under the roof i climbed up and opened one of them inside was a metal box and in the metal box was a piece of material i took the gun out of my pocket put the material round the gun the gun in the box and the box back in the suitcase thats where he keeps the gun but he doesnt know that i know ill put a sticker on my map tonight for tomorrows adventure you may think thats overconfident of me but i dont think so i know i wont fail major alan reid said fiona russell writing on a piece of paper owns a red ford focus kveuu ive got the car driving out of richmond towards swaledale at five twentyfive on the morning of the first murder and then back into richmond at eleven forty helen scott looked down her list of car numbers ive got the same car at four thirty in the afternoon on the day of the second murder she said weve got a match charles russell called to neville neville came over to russells desk address he asked russell gave him the piece of paper she had been writing on quarry road richmond is that near the gallowfields business park she asked very close said neville he looked at scott come on lets go he said he turned to russell you too i want to know what you think half an hour later at seven thirty in the morning scott stopped the police car outside a smartlooking stone house on quarry road the front garden was tidy and well kept there was no red ford focus on the drive in front of the house nor in the street neville scott and russell went to the front door neville rang the bell there was the sound of someone coming to the door and then the door being unlocked the door was opened by a whitehaired woman in her sixties wearing a dressing gown over her nightclothes yes she asked neville held up his police id di neville north yorkshire police he said this is ds scott and this is ms russell a police analyst were looking for a major alan reid the woman looked worried alan she asked what do you want him for im afraid i cant tell you that said neville perhaps we could come in the woman opened the door wider well yes she said i suppose youd better come into the front room and ill go and get alan the woman showed neville scott and russell into a bright room at the front of the house they stood and looked round it comfortable furniture pictures of the dales family photos a grandfather clock in the corner alan they heard the woman shout upstairs there are some police officers here to see you are you ok coming down on your own im fine mum was the reply there was the sound of someone slowly coming downstairs then the door opened the woman came back into the room followed by a man in his early thirties moving very slowly under each arm was a crutch to help him walk his right leg was normal his left leg was missing the trouser leg cut off above the knee he looked round the room youll excuse me if i sit down he said he made his way to a brightly coloured armchair dropped into it and laid his crutches on the floor beside it roadside bomb afghanistan he said by way of explanation i was the lucky one it killed two of my men im waiting for a new leg neville scott and russell looked at each other this man obviously wasnt their killer what can i do for you asked reid looking at neville youre major alan reid said neville yes you own a red ford focus said neville yes where is it asked neville isnt it in front of the house asked reid no it isnt said neville well terrys probably gone out in it replied reid terry asked neville my brother explained reid russell noticed a photo on a small table beside her two young men and an older woman alan and terry reid and their mother she picked the photo up and passed it to neville is your brother in the army too asked neville looking at the photo no hes a gardener parttime he works for a few people in different parts of richmond answered reid have you been to iraq as well as afghanistan asked neville yes replied reid twice do you own a gun asked scott no replied reid obviously i know how to shoot one and i have one with me when im on active service but when were back home were not allowed to take guns out of catterick garrison there was a short silence what about a tariq ninemillimetre asked scott what do you mean asked reid i mean something you brought home to remind you of your time in iraq a war prize said scott major reid said neville before reid had time to answer were investigating the series of murders in the dales you will have read about them in the papers and seen the news reports i expect an honest answer from you reid took a deep breath yes he said i do have a tariq ninemillimetre but so im sure do a few hundred other soldiers and exsoldiers mine is well hidden and hasnt been used since i brought it back where is it asked neville wed like to see it reid picked up his crutches and with difficulty stood up ill show you he said neville nodded at scott and she followed reid out of the room during the conversation russell had been looking round the room shed noticed more family photos and started to take a closer interest in them a baby a young boy and their parents two teenage boys two young men and their mother a younger alan reid in army uniform in fact there were three or four of reid in uniform but no recent photos of his brother russell looked at reids mother who had been sitting on the sofa but taking no part in the conversation mrs reid she began is terry younger than alan yes answered mrs reid theres four years between them and did terry want to join the army too asked russell oh yes answered mrs reid once alan was in the army it was all terry talked about how theyd be in the army together he always wanted to do what alan did you know he looked up to him like younger brothers often do so what happened asked russell well he started the training said mrs reid looking down at the floor and then the army decided they didnt want him russell said nothing she just looked questioningly at mrs reid eventually the whitehaired woman looked up at russell they said it was something to do with his mind something psychological she said i didnt really understand it hes healthy strong he passed all the physical tests he passed all the exams and then they said he was unsuited to life in the modern army how did he feel about that asked russell well you can imagine said mrs reid joining the army had been his lifes ambition his dream and it just disappeared overnight it was terrible for him he was very very disappointed more than disappointed actually angry as well russell looked at neville and then back at mrs reid do you think it changed him at all she asked not getting into the army mrs reid thought about this for a moment yes she said i think it did really he used to be more open more friendly with people hes more private now hes kind of turned in on himself just then the door of the front room opened and scott came back into the room reid behind her there was a gun in scotts hand a tariq ninemillimetre she said and its been used recently mrs reid made a sound and her hand went to her mouth you cant think she began but she couldnt finish reids face was white he looked shaken it cant be terry he said he doesnt know ive got the gun ive never told him about it hes not he too found himself lost for words wed like to look in his room said neville of course said mrs reid her voice shaky its at the top of the stairs on the right neville gave scott a sign that she should stay with the reids then he and russell headed up the stairs we need to find him as soon as possible said russell as she climbed the stairs behind neville i think hes gone out to kill again today said neville yes replied russell today as a rule once serial killers get started the time between the killings gets shorter and shorter it becomes like a drug they need it more and more terry reids room was unnaturally tidy a perfectly made bed chair and desk arranged with mathematical neatness pens and pencils in a line bookshelves with books arranged in order of size a clothes cupboard neville opened the cupboard door russell started on the desk drawers two minutes later she was opening out a map shed found in the third drawer down here she said neville came across to look look where the blue stickers are said russell pointing at the map the first murder the second the third the fourth and fifth each sticker was at the place where one of the murders had happened and an extra one here said neville pointing at another barney beck that must be where hes gone chapter eight catching the killer i left the house early this morning it was cloudy but it looked as though the sky would clear later i took alans car today i dont want to steal a car too often the science is so good these days you can never tell what the police might be able to find i drove to reeth and parked in the middle of the village then i started out towards the little stream called barney beck the path goes across the fields down to the river swale then along the river bank through some trees just before barney beck the path moves in closer to the river theres a drystone wall on the right of the path and the river is just a couple of metres to the left with tall trees growing on both banks so here i am now at the place where barney beck joins the river waiting its a private place thats why ive chosen it and because there are stepping stones across the stream mum often brought alan and me here when we were young wed walk from reeth and stop here for a picnic and throw stones in the water then wed either return the way wed come or when we were older wed walk on to scabba wath bridge and back to reeth on the other side of the river happy days my dad died when i was eighteen months old so i didnt know him at all alan hardly remembers him either mum brought us up on her own i always felt i was her favourite even though she was very fair alan was always out with his friends playing football or cycling or rock climbing or doing something i spent a lot of time with mum weve always been very close i look both ways up and down the river noone is coming yet i find a place where i can hide behind the wall if a couple or a group of walkers come past ill hide im waiting for someone on their own although im mums favourite ive always been jealous of alan hes the successful one out of us mum was so pleased when he got into the army i knew that i had to try too i look both ways again i can see a group of four people in the distance coming along the path from reeth quickly i get into my hiding place it takes the group fifteen minutes to arrive and go past i give them another five minutes to get well away then i come out for another look in both directions noone everything went well when i started my army training there was nothing physically wrong with me i passed my exams actually i passed them well but then there were psychological tests questions which didnt seem to have a right or wrong answer questions about being on active service about being on the front line and then they told me i was unsuitable at first i couldnt believe it being a soldier was the only thing i wanted the army had refused me how would i be able to look at myself in the mirror every morning i did the only thing i could i decided to show them they were wrong i look both ways along the river again theres something red about a hundred metres away i look through my binoculars its a woman in a red anorak shes coming along the path from scabba wath shes on her own i stretch my hands open and closed this is it im ready scott drove neville and russell sat in the back of the car neville took out his phone and made a call russell listened to him giving instructions for a minute then reached forward and took a map off the front seat she knew where barney beck was along the river swale between reeth and healaugh she had walked there many times herself but she wasnt sure of the easiest way to get to it she opened the map from what neville was saying on the phone it was clear to russell that he knew the area well she stopped listening as she looked at the map the path from reeth to where they thought terry reid might be was a long one it would be quicker to park on the road just outside healaugh and walk down through two fields she was about to point this out to neville when she heard him say i want three men armed waiting in reeth in a car not a land rover well pick them up as we go through the closest we can get to barney beck is the road just outside healaugh then well go on foot from there he turned off his phone russell looked at neville his face looked tired exhausted even but now there was the light of excitement in his eyes as they closed in on their man it had been like this with the other serial killer investigations she had worked on the killings got closer and closer together in time the police worked longer and longer hours looking at more and more information and then everything seemed to explode into madness towards the end scott had the blue light going and made it from richmond to reeth in seventeen minutes an unmarked police car was waiting opposite the buck hotel she stopped beside it and neville opened his window follow us he told the driver five minutes later they pulled as far into the side of the road as they could just outside the village of healaugh russell realised why neville had asked for a car not a land rover the land rover was a high vehicle and youd be able to see the roof from down by the river over the top of the drystone walls clever the police officers and russell got out of the cars guns were handed to neville and scott neville looked at russell you stay here he said youre not police i dont want you anywhere near this no problem she said she hoped that with her help neville and scott had got to the right place in time to save someones life but she was quite happy not to get any closer than this to a serial killer scott opened the gate and the five officers entered the field she closed the gate there were a few sheep on the far side of the field and even with a killer running free the farmer wouldnt be happy if they got out quickly the officers made their way across the field keeping low so that they wouldnt be seen at the bottom of the field was another gate opening and closing it quietly they ran across the next field to the wall at the bottom they stayed low when they reached the wall scott looked round faces were set lips pressed together guns at the ready neville nodded at scott she looked over the wall it took her five seconds to realise what was happening there were stepping stones across barney beck a man was standing on one side of the stream his back was towards her but she was sure that it was terry reid on the other side of the stream was a walker a woman in a red anorak she was a few metres away from the stepping stones and walking towards them reid put out a hand to help her over the stones she took the offered hand as she did so she looked up and saw scott reid realised there was someone behind him he turned suddenly and looked straight at scott there was no time to think about what to do next scott lifted her gun over the wall and pointed it at reid police she called let go of that womans hand and dont move reid moved fast he stepped quickly across the stream towards the woman pulling the hand he was holding up behind her back and putting his other arm round her neck stay there he called to scott dont come any closer scott knew that neville could hear the conversation whispering and pointing he would be sending the other officers to come up on reid from behind probably one to cross the river further back towards reeth the other two to go back up towards the road and to get behind reid that way she knew hed stay hidden behind the wall dont do anything stupid said scott just let her go and well talk ha reid laughed and started to move backwards there was a wall and an opening into a field behind him scott could see what he was trying to do but there was little she could do to stop him suddenly reid picked a stone off the top of the wall and hit the woman over the head with it as she fell he turned and ran fast up the field quick shouted scott to neville and the others as she ran across the stepping stones to the injured woman hes getting away towards the road neville turned and started running at first fiona russell sat in the car but it soon grew too warm in the autumn sunshine she got out and stood by the gate that neville scott and the others had first gone through her elbows were resting on the top of the gate and she was looking down towards the river there had been some shouting a few minutes ago but no shots she wondered if theyd found reid or not a couple of minutes later she saw two of the officers from reeth climbing over the drystone wall down the righthand side of the field it looked as if theyd certainly found someone she was about to go back to the car when she felt something hard stick into her back be very careful said a voice this is a gun and i dont want to use it russell felt sweat break out all over her body what do you want she said she knew it was reid are the keys in the car asked reid i think so open the passenger door and get in very slowly he said russell turned a little to reach the car door she couldnt see the gun but she could feel it pressed hard into her side out of the corner of her eye she could see him the man she had been hunting he was tall he looked tired he had small eyes a weak chin and straight black hair take it easy she said im not a police officer but i can help you dont talk he replied just move very slowly and get in the car gently russell let herself down onto the passenger seat reid kept the gun tight against her side now move across to the drivers seat ordered reid russell was about to move over when she heard a noise she looked to her left neville and scott had appeared at the gate into the field guns in hands leave her alone said neville his gun pointing at reid step back very slowly or well shoot ill shoot too said reid im sure you dont want this woman to die russell saw neville and scott look at each other where did you get the gun reid asked scott she stared at reid then she turned and her eyes met russells fiona has he really got a gun she asked russell thought quickly shed felt the gun but she hadnt seen it it wasnt the tariqnine millimetre theyd seen that in his house earlier that morning did he have another gun should she take a chance she turned sideways and pushed reid hard in the chest with both hands he fell away from the car onto his back in his hand was a piece of wood that he had been pretending was a gun within seconds neville and scott were through the gate neville pressed his gun to the side of reids head scott pulled his arms roughly behind his back and put the handcuffs on reid started to fight against the handcuffs let me go he shouted turning his head from side to side i need to finish this i need to reach my goal i need to show them what i can do neville scott and reid looked at each other the army continued reid still trying to get his hands free i need to show them ive got what it takes i need to show them i can kill people and that im good at it i need to show them im just the sort of person they want neville just shook his head later that afternoon neville scott and russell were in the bar at the half moon hotel reeth memorial hall had been emptied of all the desks chairs computers and phones that the police had brought terry reid had been interviewed taken to richmond police station and would be interviewed again later helen scott had been to richmond to talk again to reids mother and brother she had then returned to reeth neville had spoken to the journalists and been interviewed for tv and radio neville carried three glasses from the bar and put them on the table where they were sitting beer for him white wine for scott red wine for russell thank god thats over he said sitting down heavily yes agreed scott and just because the army refused him said neville well in his eyes the army refused him because they didnt think he could kill people explained russell he killed to show that he could and he used a different way of killing each time to show how good he was crazy said neville completely mad yes agreed russell but to him it was logical he was just trying to show the army theyd made a mistake serial killers often think theyre behaving logically but logically in a crazy way said scott yes replied russell and this is what your third or fourth serial killer asked neville third replied russell she drank a little of her wine all three very different in some ways but very similar in others how do you mean asked scott well the first began russell was a woman a nurse actually who killed some of the old people she visited at home in her mind they were too old to look after themselves and so they shouldnt be allowed to live russell drank some more wine the second she continued was a man whose girlfriend left him about five years before since then hed had great difficulty in his relationships with women the problem built up and up and eventually he started killing young women in their twenties with blonde hair girls who reminded him of his exgirlfriend and now a guy who wants to show the army that he knows how to kill so that theyll let him join up added scott exactly replied russell and how are they similar asked neville they show just how little it can take to turn the balance of the human mind upside down answered russell a failed attempt to join the army breaking up with a girlfriend being in a job where you end up hating the people youre supposed to be helping these are things that people often experience at some time in their lives but it doesnt usually turn them into killers interrupted scott no it doesnt said russell normal people manage they move on they get a different job they get a new girlfriend but for a very few people it changes the balance of their minds just enough they develop a strange kind of poisonous murdering logic that drives them to kill and having killed once russell stopped speaking and looked down into her glass scott put her hand on russells arm its over now fiona she said russell looked up yes it is she agreed until the next time the end
