neil gaiman books have sexes books have sexes or to be more precise books have genders they do in my head anyway or at least the ones that i write do and these are genders that have something but not everything to do with the gender of the main character of the story when i wrote the ten volumes of sandman i tended to alternate between what i thought of as male storylines such as the first story collected under the title preludes and nocturnes or the fourth book season of mists and more female stories like game of you or brief lives the novels are a slightly different matter neverwhere is a boys own adventure with an everyman hero and the women in it tended to occupy equally stock roles such as the dreadful fiancйe the princess in peril the kickass female warrior the seductive vamp each role is i hope taken and twisted from skew but they are stock characters nonetheless stardust on the other hand is a girls book even though it also has an everyman hero young tristran thorne not to mention seven lords bent on assassinating each other that may partly be because once yvaine came on stage she rapidly became the most interesting thing there and it may also be because the relationships between the women the witch queen yvaine victoria forester the lady una and even ditchwater sal were so much more complex and shaded than the relationships between the boys the day i swapped my dad for two goldfish is a boys book coraline is a girls book the first thing i knew when i started american gods even before i started it was that i was finished with c s lewiss dictum that to write about how odd things affect odd people was an oddity too much and that gullivers travels worked because gulliver was normal just as would not have worked if alice had been an extraordinary girl in sandman id enjoyed writing about people who belonged in places on the other side of the looking glass from the dreamlord himself to such skewed luminaries as the emperor of the united states not i should say that i had much say in what american gods was going to be it had its own opinions novels accrete american gods began long before i knew i was going to be writing a novel called american gods it began in may with an idea that i couldnt get out of my head id find myself thinking about it at night in bed before id go to sleep as if i were watching a movie clip in my head each night id see another couple of minutes of the story in june i wrote the following on my battered atari palmtop a guy winds up as a bodyguard for a magician the magician is an overthetop type he offers the guy the job meeting him on a plane sitting next to him chain of events to get there involving missed flights cancellations unexpected bounce up to first class and the guy sitting next to him introduces himself and offers him a job his life has just fallen apart anyway he says yes which is pretty much the beginning of the book and all i knew at the time was it was the beginning of something i hadnt a clue what kind of something movie tv series short story i dont know any creators of fictions who start writing with nothing but a blank page mostly you have something an image or a character and mostly you also have either a beginning a middle or an end middles are good to have because by the time you reach the middle you have a pretty good head of steam up and ends are great if you know how it ends you can just start somewhere aim and begin to write there may be writers who have beginnings middles and ends before they sit down to write i am rarely of their number so there i was four years ago with only a beginning and you need more than a beginning if youre going to start a book if all you have is a beginning then once youve written that beginning you have nowhere to go a year later i had a story in my head about these people i tried writing it the character id thought of as a magician now seemed to be called wednesday i wasnt sure what the other guys name was the bodyguard so i called him ryder but that wasnt quite right i had a short story in mind about those two and some murders that occur in a small midwestern town called silverside i wrote a page and gave up mainly because they really didnt seem to come together there was a dream i woke up from somewhere back then sweating and confused about a dead wife it seemed to belong to the story and i filed it away some months later in september i tried writing that story again as a first person narrative sending the guy id called ryder to the town on his own i covered about ten pages and then stopped i still wasnt comfortable with it by that point i was coming to the conclusion that the story i wanted to tell in that particular little lakeside town hmm i thought somewhere in there lakeside thats what its called a solid generic name for a town was too much a part of the novel to be written in isolation from it and i had a novel by then id had it for several months back in july i had gone to iceland on the way to norway and finland it may have been the distance from america or it may have been the lack of sleep involved in a trip to the land of the midnight sun but suddenly somewhere in reykjavik the novel came into focus not the story of it i still had nothing more than the meeting on the plane and a fragment of plot in a town by a lake but for the first time i knew what it was about i had a direction i wrote a letter to my publisher telling them that my next book wouldnt be a historical fantasy set in restoration london after all but a contemporary american phantasmagoria tentatively i suggested american gods as a working title for it i kept naming my protagonist theres a magic to names after all i knew his name was descriptive i tried calling him lazy but he didnt seem to like that and i called him jack and he didnt like that any better i took to trying every name i ran into on him for size and he looked back at me from somewhere in my head unimpressed every time it was like trying to name rumpelstiltskin he finally got his name from an elvis costello song its performed by was and is the story of two men named shadow and jimmy i thought about it tried it on for size and shadow stretched uncomfortably on his prison cot and glanced across at the wild birds of north america wall calendar with the days hed been inside crossed off and he counted the days until he got out and once i had a name i was ready to begin i wrote chapter one around december i was still trying to write it in the first person and it wasnt comfortable with that shadow was too damn private a person and he didnt let much out which is hard enough in a a third person narrative and really hard in a first person narrative i began chapter two in june on the train home from the san diego comics convention the book had begun i wasnt sure what i was going to call it but then the publishers started sending me mockups of the books cover and it said american gods in big letters in the top and i realised that my working title had become the title i kept writing fascinated i felt on the good days more like the first reader than the writer something id rarely felt since sandman days neither shadow nor wednesday were in any way everyman figures they were uniquely themselves sometimes infuriatingly so odd people perfectly suited for the odd events they would be encountering the book had a gender now and it was most definitely male i wonder now looking back if the short stories in american gods were a reaction to that there are maybe half a dozen of them scattered through the book and all of them are most definitely female in my head that may have been it i dont know i do know that there were things about america and about its history that it seemed easier to say by showing rather than telling so we follow several people to america from a siberian shaman years ago to a georgian pickpocket two hundred years ago and from each of them we learn things and after the short stories were done i was still writing and writing and continuing to write the book turned out to be twice as long as i had expected the plot i thought i was writing twisted and snaked and i slowly realised it wasnt the plot at all i wrote the book and wrote the book putting one word after another until there were close to of them and one day i looked up and it was january and i was sitting in an ancient and empty house in ireland with a peat fire making no impression at all on the stark cold of the room i saved the document on the computer and i realised id finished writing a book i wondered what id learned and found myself remembering something gene wolfe had told me six months earlier you never learn how to write a novel he said you just learn how to write the novel that youre writing
