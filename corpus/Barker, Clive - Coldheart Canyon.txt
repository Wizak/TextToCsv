coldheart canyon a hollywood ghost story copyright by clive barker scanned from an advanced readers edition for david emilian armstrong acknowledgments there are a lot of people to thank for helping me bring this one home it was a devil of a book to write for a host of reasons for one thing i began writing it the week before my father passed away and inevitably the long shadow of that event dimmed the joy of writing at least for the first six months or so slowing it to a crawl paradoxically even as my production of useable text diminished i could feel the scale of the story i wanted to tell getting bigger what had originally begun life as an idea for a short satiric stab at hollywood began to blossom into something larger lusher and stranger a fantasia on hollywood both in its notsoinnocent youth and in its present wholly commercialized phase linked by a sizeable cast and a mythology which i would need to create and explain in very considerable detail i dont doubt that this second incarnation of the book will be much more satisfying a read than the firstwhich i had written almost in its entirety before changing directionbut lord it was a son of a bitch to get down onto the page forgive me then if the list of people im thanking is longer than usual and believe me when i tell you every one of them deserves this nod of recognition because each has helped get coldheart canyon out of my head and into print let me begin with the dedicatee of this book david emilian armstrong my husband and in every sense of the word my partner the one who was with me when one of our five dogs charlie passed away david always has faith in my capacity to go one step further to make the tale im telling a little richer the picture im painting a little brighter the photograph im taking a little sexier my thanks to craig green and don mackay to whom i first gave the handwritten pages to be typed and most especially to david john doddsmy oldest and dearest friendwho worked through much of the christmas period polishing the text then polishing the polishes so that the immense manuscript would be ready to be dispatched to my publishers before i went to recuperate in kauai to bob pescovitz my researcher and angela calin my translator my thanks to michael hadley joe daley and renee rosen who run all the various aspects of my creative life outside writing and painting my gratitude in the last year and a half i have often been an absentee boss because ive been in the wilds of coldheart canyon during that period they have worked together to make our businesses prosper let me not forget ana osgood and denny mclain to whom fall the very considerable responsibilities of organizing and archiving my visual work especially the many enormous paintings for my next books the abarat quartet then there are the two peopletoya castillo and alex rosaswho make the homes in which we work run smoothly who feed david and myself and wash our clothes who make sure theres shampoo in our shower and our dogs smell sweet again i have been something of a phantom of myself for much of the last year passing through the house on my way to write or paint with a distracted look they kindly indulge my craziness and my endless calls for cups of hot sweet tea i also owe a great debt of gratitude to dr alex del rosario and his assistant judy azar i recently described alex as the perfect artists doctor he has guided me through some lengthy periods of sickness in the last couple of years understanding as no other physician in my history has the fierce and sometimes selfwounding passion that makes artists attempt to do the impossible to paint another world into being while writing a two hundred thousand word novel while producing a couple of movies for instance for me this is my natural albeit obsessive behavior but my body isnt that of a thirtyyearold any longer it complains now when i drive it hard as i do daily it has taken a massive contribution of sympathetic counsel medication and alternative therapies to keep body and spirit together since my fathers death and i owe alex a huge debt of thanks for my present good health finally the powers that be first my love and thanks to ben smith my hollywood agent who has been a true visionary in a job that is often maligned as being for cold artistically disinterested men and women my thanks and great admiration go to the lawyer who has helped shape my business life in the last two years david golden the abarat deal with the disney company was the largest literary deal made in hollywood last year and it covers every possible shape and permutation that my invented world might take in the hands of disneys imagineers to give you a taste of what kind of wordage david golden has minutely analyzed on my behalf the disney contract had three pages alone devoted to listing its contents on the literary side my dear anne sibbald who has surely the tenderest heart of any agent who ever represented an unreformed maker of monsters like myself has been a constant source of encouragement and a fearless champion whenon occasionthe machinations of the corporate world proved painful and incomprehensible and lastbut oh you both know never leastmy editors in new york robert jones and finally we come to jane johnson my jane i insist the editor of editors who is never far from my mind when i set pen to paper increasingly jane i think i write to entertain you to please you we have survived for many years together on a raft of shared beliefs about the necessity of dreams tossed around in the tumultuous seas of modern publishing in that time jane has lost countless colleagues to exhaustion frustration and despair and yet she manages to be a mistress of beautiful prose as well as an editor of a stable of authors who like me could not imagine their literary lives continuing without her i would have given up the increasingly problematic ambition of having a broad audience for my work and fled into the minor the hermetic and the oblique without her tireless encouragement my love to you my jane and as always my heartfelt thanks heres another tale for you saved from the flood cb contents prologue the canyon part one the price of the hunt part two the heartthrob part three a darker time part four life after fame part five desire part six the devils country part seven the alist part eight the wind at the door part nine the queen of hell part ten and the dead came in part eleven the last chase epilogue and so love prologue the canyon it is night in coldheart canyon and the wind comes off the desert the santa anas they call these winds they blow off the mojave bringing malaise and the threat of fire some say they are named after saint anne the mother of mary others that they are named after one general santa ana of the mexican cavalry a great creator of dusts others still that the name is derived from santanta which means devil wind whatever the truth of the matter this much is certain the santa anas are always baking hot and often so heavily laden with perfume that its as though theyve picked up the scent of every blossom theyve shaken on their way here every wild lilac and wild rose every white sage and rank jimsonweed every heliotrope and creosote bush gathered them all up in their hot embrace and borne them into the hidden channel of coldheart canyon theres no lack of blossoms here of course indeed the canyon is almost uncannily verdant some of the plants here were brought in from the world outside by these same burning winds these santa anas others were dropped in the feces of the wild animals who wander throughthe deer and coyote and raccoon some spread from the gardens of the great dream palace that lays solitary claim to this corner of hollywood alien blooms this last kindorchids and lotus flowersnurtured by gardeners who have long since left off their pruning and their watering and departed allowing the bowers which they once treasured to run riot but for some reason there is always a certain bitterness in the blooms here even the hungry deer driven from their traditional trails these days by the presence of sightseers who have come to see tinseltown do not linger in the canyon for very long though the deer venture along the ridge and down the steep slopes of the canyon and curiosity especially amongst the younger animals often leads them over the rotted fences and toppled walls into the secret enclaves of the gardens they seldom choose to stay there for very long perhaps it isnt just that the leaves and petals are bitter perhaps there are too many whisperings in the air around the ruined gazebos and the animals are unnerved by what they hear perhaps there are too many presences brushing against their trembling flanks as they explore the clotted pathways perhaps as they graze the overgrown lawns they lookup and mistake a statue for a pale fragment of life and are startled by their error and take flight perhaps sometimes they are not mistaken perhaps the canyon is familiar with perhaps with what may or may not be and never more so than on such a night as this when the winds come sighing off the desert heavy with their perfume and such souls as the canyon hosts express their longing for something they dreamed they had or dreamed that they dreamed their voices so tenuous tonight that theyre inaudible to the human ear even if there were someone to hear them which there never is thats not entirely true on occasion somebody will be tenacious enough to find their way into this vale of luxury and tears a tourist perhaps even a family of tourists foolishly determined to discover what lies off the prescribed route looking for some famous heartthrobs lovenest or a glimpse of the idol himself caught unawares as he walks with his dog there are even a few trespassers over the years who have found their way here intentionally guided to this place by hints dropped in obscure accounts of old hollywood they venture cautiously these few indeed there is often something close to reverence in the way they enter coldheart canyon but however these visitors arrive they always leave the same way hurriedly with many a nervous backward glance even the crassest of themeven the ones whod claim they dont have a psychic bone in their bodiesare discomfited by something they sniff here their sixth sense they have discovered is far more acute than they had thought only when they have outrun the alltooeager shadows of the canyon and they are back in the glare of the billboards on sunset boulevard do they wipe their clammy palms and wonder to themselves how it was that in such a harmless spot they could have been so very afraid part one the price of the hunt one your wife did not want to look around the fortress any further mister zeffer father sandru said seeing that on the second day the middleaged man with the handsome sad face had come alone the lady is not my wife zeffer explained ah the monk replied the tone of commiseration in his voice indicating that he was far from indifferent to katyas charms a pity for you yes yes zeffer admitted with some discomfort shes a very beautiful woman the monk studied zeffers face as he spoke but having said what hed said zeffer was unwilling to play the confessee any further im her manager he explained thats all there is between us father sandru however was not willing to let the issue go just yet after the two of you departed yesterday he said his english colored by his native romanian one of the brothers remarked that she was the most lovely women he had ever seen he hesitated before committing to the rest of the sentence in the flesh her names katya by the way zeffer said yes yes i know said the father his fingers combing the knotted graywhite of his beard as he stood assessing zeffer the two men were a study in contrasts sandru ruddyfaced and rotund in his dusty brown habit zeffer slimly elegant in his pale linen suit she is a moviestar yes you saw one of her films sandru grimaced displaying a poorlykept array of teeth no no he said i do not see these things at least not often but there is a little cinema in ravbac and some of the younger brothers go down there quite regularly they are great fans of chaplin of course and theres avampis that the word yes zeffer replied somewhat amused by this conversation vamps the word called theda bara oh yes we know theda in that yearwhich was everybody knew theda bara she had one of the most famous faces in the world as of course did katya both were famous their fame tinged with a delicious hint of decadence i must go with one of the brothers when they next go to see her father sandru said i wonder if you entirely understand what kind of woman theda bara portrays zeffer replied sandru raised a thicketed eyebrow i am not born yesterday mister zeffer the bible has its share of these women these vamps theyre whores yes women of babylon men are drawn to them only to be destroyed by them zeffer laughed at the directness of sandrus description i suppose thats about right he said and in real life sandru said in real life theda baras name is theodesia goodman she was born in ohio but is she a destroyer of men in real life no i doubt it im sure she harms a few egos now and again but thats about the worst of it father sandru looked mildly disappointed i shall tell the brothers what you told me he said theyll be very interested well thenshall i take you inside matthias zeffer was a cultured man he had lived in paris rome london and briefly in cairo in his fortythree years and had promised himself that he would leave los angeleswhere there was neither art nor the ambition to make artas soon as the public tired of lionizing katya and she tired of rejecting his offer of marriage they would wed and come back to europe find a house with some real history on its bones instead of the fake spanish mansion her fortune had allowed her to have built in one of the hollywood canyons until then he would have to find aesthetic comfort in the objets dart he purchased on their trips abroad the furniture the tapestries the statuary they would suffice until they could find a chateau in the loire or perhaps a georgian house in london somewhere the cheap theatrics of hollywood wouldnt curdle his blood you like romania the father asked as he unlocked the great oak door that lay at the bottom of the stairs yes of course zeffer replied please do not feel you have to sin on my account sandru said with a sideways glance sin lying is a sin mister zeffer perhaps its just a little one but its a sin nevertheless oh lord zeffer thought how far ive slipped from the simple proprieties back in los angeles he sinned as a matter of course every day every hour the life he and katya lived was built on a thousand stupid little lies but he wasnt in hollywood now so why lie youre right i dont like this country very much at all im here because katya wanted to come her mother and fatherim sorry her stepfatherlive in the village yes this i know the mother is not a good woman youre her priest no we brothers do not minister to the people the order of st teodor exists only to keep its eyes on the fortress he pushed the door open a dank smell exuded from the darkness ahead of them excuse me for asking zeffer said but it was my understanding from yesterday that apart from you and your brothers theres nobody here yes this is true nobody here except the brothers so what are you keeping your eyes on sandru smiled thinly i will show you he said as much as you wish to see he switched on a light which illuminated ten yards of corridor a large tapestry hung along the wall the image upon it so grey with age and dust as to be virtually beyond interpretation the father proceeded down the corridor turning on another light as he did so i was hoping i might be able to persuade you to make a purchase he said of what zeffer said zeffer wasnt encouraged by what hed seen so far a few of the pieces of furniture hed spotted yesterday had a measure of rustic charm but nothing he could imagine buying i didnt realize you were selling the contents of the fortress sandru made a little groan ahim afraid to say we must sell in order to eat and that being the case i would prefer that the finer things went to someone who will take care of them such as yourself sandru walked on ahead a little way turning on a third light and then a fourth this level of the fortress zeffer was beginning to think was bigger than the floor above corridors ran of in all directions but before i begin to show you sandru said you must tell meare you in a buying mood zeffer smiled father im an american im always in a buying mood sandru had given katya and zeffer a history of the fortress the previous day though as zeffer remembered it there was much in the account that had sounded bogus the order of st teodor zeffer had decided had something to hide sandru had talked about the fortress as a place steeped in secrets but nothing particularly bloody there had been no battles fought there he claimed nor had its keep ever held prisoners nor its courtyard witnessed atrocity or execution katya in her usual forthright manner had said that she didnt believe this to be true when i was a little girl there were all kinds of stories about this place she said i heard horrible things were done here that it was human blood in the mortar between the stones the blood of children im sure you must have been mistaken the father had said absolutely not the devils wife lived in this fortress lilith they called her and she sent the duke away on a hunt and he never came back sandru laughed and if it was a performance then it was an exceptionally good one who told you these tales he said my mother ah sandru had shaken his head and im sure she wanted you in bed hushed and asleep before the devils came to cut off your head katya had made no reply to this there are still such stories told to children of course always stories people invent tales but believe me this is not an unholy place the brothers would not be here if it was despite sandrus plausibility thered still been something about all of this that had made zeffer suspicious and a little curious hence his return visit if what the father was saying was a lie then what purpose was it serving what was the man protecting certainly not a few rooms filled with filthy tapestries or some crudely carved furniture was there something here in the fortress that deserved a closer look and if so how did he get the father to admit to it the best route hed already decided was fiscal if sandru was to be persuaded to reveal his true treasures it would be through the scent of hard cash in his nostrils the fact that sandru had raised the subject of buying and selling made the matter easier to broach i do know katya would love to have something from her homeland to take back to hollywood he said shes built a huge house so we have plenty of room oh yes and of course she has the money this was naked he knew but in his experience of such things subtlety seldom played well which point was instantly proved how much are we talking about the father asked mildly katya lupi is one of the bestpaid actresses in hollywood and i am authorized to buy whatever i think might please her then let me ask you what pleases her things that nobody else would be likelyno could possiblypossess please her zeffer replied she likes to show off her collection and she wants everything in it to be unique sandru spread his arms and his smile everything here is unique father you sound as though youre ready to sell the foundations if the price is right sandru waxed metaphysical all these things are just objects in the end yes just stone and wood and thread and paint other things will be made in time to replace them but surely theres some sacred value in the objects here the father gave a little shrug in the chapel upstairs yes i would not want to sell you let us say the altar he made a smile as though to say that under the right circumstances even that would have its price but everything else in the fortress was made for a secular purpose for the pleasure of dukes and their ladies and as nobody sees it nowexcept a few travelers such as yourselves passing throughi dont see why the order shouldnt be rid of it all if theres sufficient profit to be made it can be distributed amongst the poor there are certainly plenty of people in need of help zeffer said he had been appalled at the primitive conditions in which many of the people in the locality lived the villages were little more than gatherings of shacks the rocky earth the farmers tilled all but fruitless and on all sides the mountainsthe bucegi range to the east to the west the fagaras mountainstheir bare lower slopes as gray as the earth their heights dusted with snow god knew what the winters were like in this place when even the dirt turned hard as stone and the little river froze and the walls of the shacks could not keep out the wind whistling down from the mountain heights the day theyd arrived katya had taken willem to the cemetery so that she could show him where her grandparents were buried there hed had proof aplenty of the conditions in which her relatives lived and died it was not the resting places of the old that had moved willem it was the endless rows of tiny crosses that marked the graves of infants babies lost to pneumonia malnutrition and simple frailty the grief that was represented by these hundreds of graves had moved him deeply the pain of mothers the unshed tears of fathers and grandfathers it was nothing he had remotely expected and it had made him sick with sorrow for her part katya had seemed untouched by the sight talking only of her memories of her grandparents and their eccentricities but then this was the world in which shed been raised it wasnt so surprising perhaps that she took all this suffering for granted hadnt she once told him shed had fourteen brothers and sisters and only six of them were left living perhaps the other eight had been lain to rest in the very cemetery where theyd walked together and certainly it would not be uncommon for katya to look coldly on the business of the heart it was what made her so strong and it was her strengthvisible in her eyes and in her every movementthat endeared her to her audiences particularly the women zeffer understood that coldness better now that hed spent time here with her seeing the house where shed been born and brought up the streets shed trudged as a child meeting the mother who must have viewed her appearance in their midst as something close to a miracle this perfect rosebud child whose dark eyes and bright smile set her utterly apart from any other child in the village in fact katyas mother had put such beauty to profitful work at the age of twelve when the girl had been taken from town to town to dance in the streets andat least according to katyaoffer her favors to men whod pay to have such tender flesh in their bed for the night she had quickly fled such servitude only to find that what shed had to do for her familys sake she had no choice but to do for herself by the age of fifteen katya had been a woman in all but years her flowering an astonishment to all who witnessed it for three nights hed come to the square where she sang there to join the group of admirers who were gathered around to watch this childenchantress it hadnt taken him long to conceive of the notion that he should bring her back with him to america though hed had at that time no experience in the world of the cinema his instincts told him there was something special in the face and bearing of this creature he had influential friends on the west coastmostly men whod grown tired of broadways petty disloyalties and piddling profits and were looking for a new place to put their talents and their investmentswho reported to him that cinema was a grand new frontier and that talent scouts on the west coast were looking for faces that the camera and the public would love did this childwoman not have such a face hed thought would the camera not grow stupid with infatuation to look into those guileful yet lovely eyes and if the camera fell could the public be far behind hed inquired as to the girls name she was one katya lubescu from the village of ravbac he approached her spoke to her told her over a meal of cabbage rolls and cheese what he was thinking she was curiously sanguine about his whole proposal practically indifferent yes she conceded it sounded interesting but she wasnt sure if she would ever want to leave romania if she went too far from home she would miss her family a year or two later when her career had begun to take off in americashe no longer katya lupescu by then but katya lupi and willem her managertheyd revisited this very conversation and zeffer had reminded her how uninterested shed seemed in his grand plan her coolness had all been an illusion shed confessed a way in part to keep herself from seeming too gauche in his eyes and in part a way to prevent her hopes getting too high but that was only part of the answer there was also a sense in which the indifference shed demonstrated that first day theyd met was a real part of her nature bred into her perhaps by a bloodline that had suffered so much loss and anguish over the generations that nothing was allowed to impress itself too severely neither great happiness nor great sadness she was by her own design a creature who held her extremes in reserve providing glimpses only for public consumption it was these glimpses that the audience in the square had come to witness night after night and it was this same power she would unleash when she appeared before the cinematrographic camera interestingly katya had shown none of this quality to father sandru the previous day in fact it was almost as though shed been playing a part the role of a rather bland godfearing girl in the presence of a beloved priest her gaze had been respectfully downcast much of the time her voice softer than usual her vocabularywhich often tended to the saltysweet and compliant zeffer had found the performance almost comical it was so exaggerated but the father had apparently been completely taken in by it at one point hed put his hand under katyas chin to raise her face telling her there was no reason to be shy shy zeffer had thought if only sandru knew what this socalled shy woman was capable of the parties shed masterminded up in her canyonthe place gossipcolumnists had dubbed coldheart canyon the excesses shed choreographed behind the walls of her compound the sheer filth she was capable of inventing when the mood took her if the mask shed been wearing had slipped for a heartbeat and the poor deluded father sandru had glimpsed the facts of the matter he would have locked himself in a cell and sealed the door with prayers and holy water to keep her out but katya was too good an actress to let him see the truth perhaps in one sense katya lupis whole life had now become a performance when she appeared on screen she played the role of simpering abused orphans half her age and large portions of the audience seemed to believe that this was reality meanwhile every weekend or so out of sight of the people who thought she was moral perfection she threw the sort of parties for the other idols of hollywoodthe vamps and the clowns and the adventurerswhich would have horrified her fans had they known what was going on which katya lupi was the real one the weeping child who was the idol of millions or the scarlet woman who was the mistress of coldheart canyon the orphan of the storm or the dopefiend in her lair neither both zeffer turned these thoughts over as sandru took him from room to room showing him tables and chairs carpets and paintings even mantelpieces does anything catch your eye sandru asked him eventually not really father zeffer replied quite honestly i can get carpets as fine as these in america i dont need to come out into the wilds of romania to find work like this sandru nodded yes of course he said he looked a little defeated zeffer took the opportunity to glance at his watch perhaps i should be getting back to katya he said in fact the prospect of returning to the village and sitting in the little house where katya had been born there to be plied with thick coffee and sickeningly sweet cake while katyas relatives came by to stare at their american visitors did not enthrall him at all but this visit with father sandru was becoming increasingly futile and now that the father had made his mercenary ambitions so plain not a little embarrassing there wasnt anything here that zeffer could imagine transporting back to los angeles he reached into his coat to take out his wallet intending to give the father a hundred dollars for his troubles but before he could produce the note the fathers expression changed to one of profound seriousness wait he said before you dismiss me let me say this i believe we understand one another you are looking to buy something you could find in no other place something thats one of a kind yes and i am looking to make a sale so is there something here you havent shown me zeffer said something special sandru nodded there are some parts of the fortress i have not shared with you he said and with good reason let me say you see there are people who should not see what i have to show but i think i understand you now mister zeffer you are a man of the world you make it all sound very mysterious zeffer said i dont know if its mysterious the priest said it is sad i think and human you see duke goga the man who built this fortresswas not a good soul the stories your katya said she had been told as a child were true in a manner of speaking goga was a great hunter but he did not always limit his quarry to animals good god so she was right to be afraid the truth is we are all a little afraid of what happened here sandru replied because we are none of us certain of the truth all we can do young and old is say our prayers and put our souls into gods care when were in this place zeffer was intrigued now tell me then he said to sandru i want to know what went on in this place believe me please when i tell you i would not know where to begin the good man replied i do not have the words truly truly zeffer studied him with new eyes with a kind of envy surely it was a blessed state to be unable to find words for the terribleness of certain deeds to be mute when it came to atrocity instead of gabbily familiar with it he found his curiosity similarly muted it seemed distastefulnot to mention pointlessto press the man to say more than he expressed himself capable of saying lets change the subject show me something utterly out of the ordinary zeffer said then ill be satisfied sandru put on a smile but it wasnt convincing it isnt much he said oh sometimes you find beauty in the strangest places zeffer said and as he spoke the little face of katya lupescu came into his minds eye pale in a blue twilight two sandru led the way down the passageway to another door this one rather smaller than the oak door theyd come through to get to this level out came his keys he unlocked the door and to zeffers surprise he and the priest were presented with another flight of steps taking them yet deeper into the fortress are you ready the father asked absolutely zeffer said down they went the stairs were steep the air becoming noticeably more frigid as they descended father sandru said nothing as they went he glanced back over his shoulder two or three times to be sure that he still had zeffer on his heels but the expression on his face was far from happy as though he rather regretted making the decision to bring zeffer here and would have turned on his heel and headed back up to the relative comfort of the floor above at the least invitation at the bottom of the stairs he stopped and rubbed his hands together vigorously i think before we proceed any further we should take a glass of something to warm us he said what do you say i wouldnt say no zeffer said the father went to a small cubbyhole in the wall a few yards from the bottom of the stairs from which he brought a bottle of spirits and two glasses zeffer didnt remark on the liquors proximity nor could he blame the brothers for needing a glass of brandy to fortify them when they came down here though the lower level was supplied with electricity the light did nothing to warm the air nor comfort the spirit father sandru handed zeffer a glass and took the cork out of the bottle the pop echoed off the naked stone of walls and floor he poured zeffer a healthy measure of the liquor and then an even healthier measure for himself which he had downed before zeffer had got his own glass to his lips when i first came here the father said refilling his glass we used to brew our own brandy from plums we grew on our own trees but not now no the father said plainly saddened at the fact that they were no longer producers of liquor the earth is not good any longer so the plums never ripen properly they remain small and sour the brandy made from such fruit is bitter and nobody wants to drink it even i will not drink it so you can judge for yourself how bad it must be he laughed at his selfdeprecation and used the laughter as a cue to fill his glass up again drink he said to zeffer tapping his glass against zeffers glass as though this was the first hed had zeffer drank the brandy was stronger than the stuff hed had at the hotel in brascov it went down smoothly warming his belly when it arrived good yes the father said having downed his second glass very you should have another before we go on and he filled zeffers glass without waiting for a reply were a long way below ground here and it gets hellishly cold glasses were filled and emptied the fathers mood was noticeably better now and his tone chattier he put the glasses and the bottle back in the hole in the wall and then led the way down the narrow corridor talking as he went when the order first came to the fortress there were plans to found a hospital here you see there are no hospitals within a hundred and twenty miles of here it would be very practical but this is not a place for the sick and certainly not the dying so no hospital well we made preparations you saw yesterday one of the wards zeffer remembered hed glanced through an open door and thered been two rows of iron beds with bare mattresses i thought it was a dormitory for the brothers no we each have our own cells there are only eleven of us so we can each have a place in which to meditate and pray he offered zeffer a glance accompanied by a small smile and drink i cant imagine its a very satisfying life zeffer said satisfying the idea was obviously a little confounding to sandru meaning what oh just that you dont get to work in the community you cant help people they had come to the end of the passageway and sandru sorted through his collection of keys in order to open the third and final door who can truly be helped he said his face turned down to the labor of sorting i suppose perhaps children can be comforted sometimes if its dark and theyre afraid you can tell them youre with them and that will sometimes stop them crying but for the rest of us are there really any words that help i dont know of any he had found the right key and now slipped it noisily into the antiquated lock as he did so he glanced up at zeffer i think theres more comfort to be had from seeing beautiful women on the cinema screen than in any prayer i know well perhaps not comfort distraction he turned the key in the lock and if that sounds like heresy well so be it sandru pushed the door open the room was in darkness but despite that fact there was a warmth in the air at least in contrast to the chilly air of the passageway perhaps the difference was no more than two or three degrees but it felt significant will you wait here a moment sandru said ill just bring a light zeffer stayed where he was staring into the darkness enjoying the slight rise in temperature there was enough illumination spilling from the passageway behind him to light the threshold there carved into stone beneath his feet was a curious inscription quamquam in fundis inferiorum sumus oculos angelorum tenebimus he didnt linger to puzzle over this for more than a few seconds but instead let his eyes drift up and into the room itself the chamber before him was large it seemed and unlike the rest of the rooms and corridors which were simply constructed far more elaborate could he make out pillars supporting several small vaults he thought so there were chairs and tables within a few yards of where he stood and what appeared to be lamps or the like heaped on top of them the confusion inside was explained a moment later when the father returned with one of the bare bulbs attached to a length of electric cord we use this as a storeroom he said many of the items we found in the fortress when we arrived we put down here just to get them out of the way he lifted the light to give zeffer a better view zeffers estimation of the size of the place and of the complexity of its construction had been conservative it now turned out the chamber was fully thirtyfive feet long and almost as broad the ceiling higher than the passageway by six feet or more the floor was littered with furniture and crates the place plainly filled by hands that had little or no respect for the objects they were moving wishing only to put them quickly out of sight it occurred to zeffer that if indeed there were treasures here the chances of finding themor indeed of their being in reasonable condition when discoveredwere remote still the father had brought him this far at no little inconvenience to himself it would be discourteous to now show no interest in what the chamber contained did you have a part in moving all of this he asked sandru more out of a need to fill the silence between them than because he was genuinely curious yes i did the father replied thirtytwo years ago i was a much younger man but it was still a backbreaking labor they built things big here i remember thinking that maybe the stories were right stories about ohnonsenses about this furniture having been built for the retinue of the devils wife the devils wife lilith or lilitu sometimes called queen of zemargad dont ask me why this is the same woman katya spoke about sandru nodded thats why the locals dont have much hope for the sick if they stay here they think liliths curse is on the place as i say nonsenses whether it was nonsense or not the story lent some flavor to this banal adventure may i look more closely zeffer asked thats what were here for father sandru replied i hope theres something that catches your eye for your sake all these stairs and doors id forgotten how far down it was im sorry to have made this so burdensome zeffer said quite sincerely if id known you were going to go to so much trouble i wouldnt have no no sandru said its not a trouble to me i only thought there might be an item here that pleased you but now im down here i doubt it to be truthful i believe we should have taken all this trash up the mountain and thrown it in the deepest gorge we could find why didnt you do just that it wasnt my choice i was just a young priest at the time i did as i was told i moved tables and chairs and tapestries and i kept my counsel our leader then was father nicholas who was very clear on the best thing to be donethe safest thing for our soulsand would not be moved on the subject so we did as we were told father nicholas by the way had the foulest temper of any man i ever knew we all lived in fear of him zeffer moved into the room talking as he went may i say something that i hope wont offend you im not easily offended dont worry wellits just that the more i hear about your order the less like priests you seem to be father nicholass temper and the brothers all familiar with theda bara and then the brandy ah the sins of the flesh father sandru said we do seem to have more than our share dont we i have offended you no youve simply seen the truth and how can a man of god be justly offended by that what youve observed is no coincidence we are allhow shall i put thismen who have more than our share of flaws some of us were never trusted with a flock others like father nicholas were but the arrangement was never deemed satisfactory his temper i believe he threw a bible at one of the parishioners who was sleeping through the good fathers sermon zeffer chuckled but his laughter was silenced a moment later it killed the man killed an accident but still with a bible surely not well thats how the rumor went father nicholas has been dead twenty years so theres no way to prove it or disprove it lets hope it isnt true and if it is hope hes at peace with it now the fact is im glad i was never trusted with a parish with a flock to tend i couldnt have done much for them why not zeffer asked a little impatient with sandrus melancholy now do you have difficulty finding god in a place like this to be honest mr zeffer with every week that passesi almost want to say with every houri find it harder to see a sign of god anywhere it would not be unreasonable i think to ask him to show himself in beauty in the face of your ladycompanion perhaps katyas face as proof of gods presence it was an unlikely piece of metaphysics zeffer thought i apologize sandru said you didnt come here to hear me talk about my lack of faith i dont mind well i do the brandy makes me maudlin shall i take a look then zeffer suggested at whatevers in here yes why dont we sandru replied i wish i could give you some kind of guidance but he shrugged his favorite gesture why dont you start looking and ill go back and get us something more to drink nothing more for me zeffer replied well then for me sandru said ill only be a moment if you need me just call ill hear you zeffer took a moment when the man was gone to close his eyes and let his thoughts grow a little more orderly though sandru spoke slowly enough there was something mildly chaotic about his thought processes one minute he was talking about furniture the next about the mad duke and his hunters habits the next about the fact that they couldnt make a hospital here because the devils wife had cursed the place when he opened his eyes his gaze moved back and forth over the furniture and the boxes without lingering on anything in particular the bare bulbs were stark of course and their lights far from flattering but even taking that fact into account there was nothing in the room that caught zeffers eye there were some finelywrought things no question but nothing extraordinary and then as he stood there waiting for sandru to return his gaze moved beyond the objects that filled the chamber and came to rest instead on the walls beyond the chamber was not he saw made of bare stone it was covered with tile in every sense this was an understatement for these were no ordinary tiles even by so ungenerous a light as the bare bulbs threw upon them and viewed by zeffers weary eyes it was clear they were of incredible sophistication and beauty he didnt wait for father sandru to return rather he began to push through the piles of furniture towards the designs that covered the walls they covered the floor too he saw and ceiling in fact the chamber was a single masterpiece of tile every single inch of it decorated in all his years of traveling and collecting hed never seen anything quite like this careless of the dirt and dust laden webs which covered every surface he pushed on through until he reached the nearest wall it was filthy of course but he pulled a large silk handkerchief out of his pocket and used it to scrub away some of the filth on the tile it had been plain even from a distance that the tiles were elaborately designed but now as he cleared a swathe across four or five he realized that this was not an abstract pattern but a representation there was part of a tree there on one of the tiles and on another adjacent to it a man on a white horse the detail was astonishing the horse was so finely painted it looked about ready to prance off around the room its a hunt sandrus voice startled him willem jerked back from the wall so suddenly that it was as though hed had his face in a vacuum and was pulling it free he felt a drop of moisture plucked from the rim of his eye saw it flying towards the cleaned tile defying gravity as it broke on the flank of the painted horse it was a strange moment an illusion surely it took him a little time to shake off the oddness of it when he looked round at sandru the man was slightly out of focus he stared at the fathers shape until his eyes corrected the problem when they did he saw that sandru had the brandy bottle back in his hand apparently its contents had been more potent than zeffer had thought the alcohol along with the intensity of his stare had left him feeling strangely dislocated as though the world hed been looking atthe painted man on his painted horse riding past a painted treewas more real than the old priest standing there in the doorway a hunt he asked at last what kind of hunt oh every kind sandru replied pigs dragons women women sandru laughed yes women he said pointing towards a piece of the wall some yards deeper into the chamber go look he said youll find the whole thing is filled with obscenities the men who painted this place must have had some strange dreams let me tell you if this is what they saw zeffer pushed aside a small table and then pressed himself between the wall and a much larger piece of furniture which looked like a wooden catafalque too large to move obliged to slide along the wall his jacket did the job his handkerchief had done moments before dust rose up in his face where now he asked the father when hed got to the other side of the catafalque a little further sandru replied uncorking the brandy and shamelessly taking a swig from the bottle i need some more light back here zeffer said reluctantly sandru went to pick up the lamp it was hot now he rummaged in one of the nearby boxes to find something to protect his palm found a length of cloth and wrapped it around the base of the lamp then he tugged on the lightcord to give himself some more play and made his way through the confusion of stuff in the room to where zeffer was standing the closer sandru came with the light the more zeffer could make out of the painting on the tiles there was a vast panorama spread to left and right of him and up above his head and down to the ground spreading beneath his feet though the walls were so filthy that in places the design was entirely obliterated and in other places there were large cracks in the tiles the image had an extraordinary reality all of its own closer zeffer said to sandru sacrificing the arm of his fur coat to clean a great portion of tiled wall in front of him each tile was about six inches square perhaps a little smaller and set close to one another with a minimum of grouting so as to preserve the continuity of the picture despite the sickly right off the bulb its luminescence still showed that the color of the image had not been diminished by time the beauty of the renderings was perfectly evident there were a dozen kinds of green in the trees and more sweeter hues in the growth between them beneath the canopy there were burnt umbers and siennas and sepias in the trunks and branches skillfully highlighted to lend the impression that light was falling through the foliage and catching the bark not all the tiles were rendered with the same expertise he saw some of the tiles were the work of highly sophisticated artists some the work of journeyman someespecially those that were devoted to areas of pure foliagethe handiwork of apprentices working on their craft by filling in areas that their masters neither had the time nor perhaps the interest to address but none of this spoiled the power of the overall vision in fact the discontinuity of styles created a splendid energy in the piece portions of the world were in focus other parts were barely coherent the abstract and the representational sitting side by side on the wall all part of one enormous story and what was that story plainly given the kind of quarry sandru had listed this was more than simply a hunt it smacked of something far more ambitious but what he peered at the tiles his nose a few inches from the wall trying to make sense of what he was seeing i looked at the whole room before we put all the furniture in here sandru said its a view from the fortress tower but not realistic it depends what you mean by realistic sandru said if you look over the other side he pointed across the room you can see the delta of the danube zeffer could just make out the body of water glittering in the gloom and closer by a mass of swampy land with dozens of inlets winding through it on their way to the sea and there sandru went on to the left again zeffer followed sandrus finger at the corner of the room that rock i see it the rock was tall rising out of the ocean of trees like a tower shrubs springing from its flank thats called the may rock sandru said the villagers dance there on the first six nights of may couples would stay there overnight and try to make children its said the women always became pregnant if they stayed with their men on may rock so it exists in the world i mean out there yes its right outside the fortress and so all those other details the delta is nine miles away in that direction sandru pointed at the wall upon which the danubes delta was painted zeffer smiled as he grasped what the artists had achieved here down in the depths of the fortress at its lowest point they had recreated in tile and paint what could be seen from its pinnacle and with that realization came sense of the inscription hed read on the threshold though we are in the bowels of hell we shall have the eyes of angels this room was the bowels of hell but the tilemakers and their artist masters wherever theyd been had created an experience that gave the occupants of this dungeon the eyes of angels a paradoxical ambition when all you had to do was climb the stairs and see all this from the top of the tower but artists were often driven by such ambition a need perhaps to prove that it could even be done somebody worked very hard to create all this zeffer said oh indeed its an impressive achievement but you hide it away zeffer said not comprehending the way the room had been treated you fill the place with old furniture and let it get filthy who could we show it to the father replied its too disgusting i see nothing he was about to say disgusting when his eye alighted on a part of tilework that hed cleaned with his arm but had not closely studied in a large grove a round stadium had been set up with seating made of wood the perspective was off the steep benches were filled with people their bustle evoked with quick contentious strokes some people seemed to be standing some sitting two more groups of spectators were approaching the stadium from the outside though there was no room for them inside but what drew zeffers eye and made him realize that the father had been right to wonder aloud who he might show this masterwork to was the event these spectators had assembled to witness it was an arena of sexual sport several performances were going on at the same time all unapologetically obscene in one section of the arena a naked woman was being held down while a creature twice her size his body bestial his erection monstrous was being roped back by four men who appeared to be controlling his approach to the woman in another quarter a man had been stripped of his skin by three naked women a fourth straddled him as he lay on the ground in his own blood the other three wore pieces of his skin one had on his whole face and shoulders her breasts sticking out from beneath the ragged hood another sat on the ground wearing his arms and pulling on the skin of his legs like waders the third the queen of this quartet was wearing what was presumably the piece de resistance the flesh which the unhappy owner had worn from mid breastbone to midthigh she was cavorting in this garish costume like a dancer and by some magic known only to the maker of the mystery the usurped skin still boasted a full erection good god zeffer said i told you sandru said just a little smugly and thats the least of it believe me the least of it the more you look the more you see anywhere in particular go over to the wild wood look amongst the trees zeffer moved along the wall studying the tiles as he went at first he couldnt make out anything controversial but sandru had some useful advice step away a foot or so in his fascination with the details of the stadium zeffer had come too close to the wall to see the wood for the trees now he stepped back and to his astonishment saw that the thicket around the arena was alive with figures all of which were in some form or other monstrous and all unequivocally sexual erections were thrust between the trees like plumheaded branches women dangled from overhead with their legs spread is it like this all over zeffer said his astonishment unfeigned all over there are thirtythree thousand two hundred and sixtyeight tiles and there is obscene matter on two thousand seven hundred and ninetyeight of them youve obviously made a study zeffer observed not i an englishman who worked with father nicholas did the counting for some reason the numbers remained in my head i think its old age things you want to remember you cant and things that dont mean anything stick in your head like a knife thats not a pretty image with respect with respect theres nothing pretty about the way i feel sandru replied i feel old to my marrow on a good day i can barely get up in the morning on a bad day i just wish i were dead lord sandru shrugged thats what living in this place does to you after a while everything drains out of you somehow zeffer was only halflistening he was exhilarated by what he saw and he had no patience with sandrus melancholy his thoughts were with the walls and the pictures on the walls are there records documenting how this was created it is a masterpiece in its way one of a kind sandru said absolutely one of a kind to answer your question no there are no records its assumed that it was funded by duke goga who had lately returned from the crusades with a large amount of booty claimed from the infidel in the name of christ but to build a room like this with money youd made on the crusades zeffer said incredulously i agree it seems like an unlikely thing to do in the name of god of course none of this is proved there are some people who will tell you that goga went missing on one of his hunts and it wasnt him who built this place at all who then lilith the devils wife the father said dropping his voice to a whisper which would make this the devils country no has anybody tried to analyze the work oh yes the englishman i spoke of george soames claimed he had discovered evidence of twentytwo different styles amongst the designs but that was just the painters then there were the men who actually made the tiles fired them sorted out the good from the bad prepared the paint cleaned the brushes and there must have been some system to align everything the rows of tiles i was thinking more of the alignment of interior with the exterior perhaps they built the room first no the fortress is twoandahalf centuries older than this room my god so to get the alignment so perfect is quite miraculous soames found fiftynine geographical markers certain stones trees the spire of the old abbey in darscuswhich are visible from the tower and are also painted on the wall he calculated that all fiftynine were correctly aligned within half a degree of accuracy somebody was obsessive or else divinely inspired you believe that why not zeffer glanced back at the arena on the wall behind him with all its libidinous excesses does that look like the kind of work that somebody would do in the name of god as i said sandru replied i no longer know where god is and where he isnt there was a long silence during which zeffer continued to survey the walls finally he said how much do you want for it how much do i want for what for the room sandru barked out a laugh i mean it zeffer said how much do you want for it its a room mr zeffer sandru said you cant buy a room then its not for sale thats not my point just tell me is it for sale or not again laughter but this time there was less humor more bemusement i dont see that its worth talking about sandru said putting the brandy bottle to his lips and drinking lets say a hundred thousand dollars what would that be in lei whats the lei worth right now a hundred and thirtytwoandahalf to the dollar if you say so so thats what thirteen million two hundred and fifty thousand lei you jest no where would you find such money a pause followed if i may ask over the years ive made some very lucrative investments on behalf of katya we own large parts of los angeles half a mile of sunset boulevard is in her name another half mile in mine and you would sell all that to own this a little piece of sunset boulevard for your glorious hunt why not because its just a room covered with filthy tile so i have more money than sense what does it matter to you a hundred thousand dollars is a great deal of money yes it is so do we have a deal or not mr zeffer this is all too sudden were not talking about a chair here this is part of the fabric of the fortress it has great historical significance a minute ago it was just a room covered with filthy tile filthy tile of great historical significance sandru said allowing himself a little smile are you saying we cant find some terms that are mutually satisfying because if you are no no no im not saying that perhaps we could eventually agree on a price if we talked about it for a while but how would you ever get it back to california that would be my problem this is the twenties father anythings possible and then what suppose you could get everything back to hollywood another room the same proportions you have such a room no id build one we have a house in the hollywood hills id put it in as a surprise for katya without telling her well if i told her it wouldnt be a surprise im just astonished that she would allow you to do such a thing a woman like that like what the question caught sandru offbalance wellso beautiful yes i think our conversations come fullcircle father sandru conceded the point with a little nod lifting the brandy bottle as he did so so shes not as perfect as her face would suggest he asked at last not remotely thank god this place with all its obscenities would please her yes i think it would why does that make you more open to the idea of selling it to me i dont know sandru replied frowning this whole conversation hasnt turned out the way i thought it would i expected you to come down here and maybe buy a table or a tapestry instead you want to buy the walls he shook his head again i was warned about you americans he added his tone no longer amused what were you warned about oh that you thought nothing was beyond your grasp or beyond your pocket so the money isnt enough the money the money he made an ugly sound in the back of his throat what does the money matter you want to pay a hundred thousand dollars for it pay it ill never see a lei so why should i care what it costs you you can steal it as far as i am concerned let me understand you clearly are you agreeing to the sale yes father sandru said his tone weary now as though the whole subject had suddenly lost all trace of pleasure for him im agreeing good im delighted zeffer returned through the maze of furniture to the door where the priest stood he extended his hand its been wonderful dealing with you father sandru sandru looked down on the proffered hand and thenafter a moment of studytook it his fingers were cold his palm clammy do you want to stay and look at what youve bought no i dont think so i think we both need a little sun on our faces sandru said nothing to this he just turned and led the way out along the corridor to the stairs but the expression on his face as he turned was perfectly clear there was no more pleasure to be found above as there was down here in the cold nor prospect of any three there were ten thousand things zeffer had not witnessed or even glimpsed in his brief visit to the vast mysterious chambers in the fortresss bowels images haunting the tiles which he would not discern until the heroic labor of removing the masterwork from the walls and shipping it to california was complete he was a literate man better educated than most of his peers in the burgeoning city of los angeles thanks to parents who had filled the house with books even though there was often precious little food on the table he knew his classics and the mythologies from which the great books and plays of the ancients had been derived in time he would discover dozens of images inspired by those same myths on the tiles in one place women were depicted like the maenads immortalized by euripides maddened souls in service of the god of ecstasies dionysus they raced through the trees with bloody hands leaving pieces of male flesh scattered in the grass in another place singlebreasted amazons strode drawing their mighty bows back and letting fly storms of arrows there were other imagesmany many othersthat were not rooted in any recognizable mythology in one spot not far from the delta huge fishes which had sprouted legs covered with golden scales came through the trees in solemn shoals spitting fire the trees ahead of them were aflame burning birds rose up from the canopy in the swamp a small town stood on long limbs its presence appearing to mark the position of some place that had existed there once but had been taken by time or a prophecy of some settlement to come the artists had taken liberties with the rendering foreshortening the scene so that the occupants of the city were almost as big as their houses and could be plainly seen there were excesses here too perversities just as profound as anything the wild wood was hosting through one of the windows a man could be seen spreadeagled on a table around which sat a number of guests all watching a large worm enter him anally and then erupt from his open mouth another was the scene of a strange summoning in which a host of black birds with human heads rose up from the ground circling a girlchild who was either their invoker or their victim in a third house a woman was squatting and shedding menstrual blood through a hole in the floor several men smaller than the woman above by half were swimming in the water below and undergoing some calamitous transformation presumably brought on by the menses their heads had flowered into dark monstrous shapes demonic tails had sprouted from their backsides as father sandru had warned to zeffer there was no part of the landscape depicted there on the walls that was not haunted by some bizarre sight or other even the clouds shat rains of fire in one place and evacuated skulls in another demons cavorted unchallenged over the open sky like dancers possessed by some celestial music while stars fell between them others rose over the horizon leering like emaciated fools and in that same sky as though to suggest that this was a world of perpetual twilight teetering always on the edge of darkness and extinction was a sun that was threequarters eclipsed by an exquisitely rendered moon the latter painted so cunningly it seemed to have real mass real roundness as it slid over the face of the daystar in one place there was painted a line of crowned figuresthe kings and queens of romania back to ancient timespainted marching into the ground the noble line rotted as it proceeded into the earth carrion birds alighting on the descending lineage plucking out regal eyes and lawgiving tongues in another place a circle of witches rose in a spiral from a spot marked by standingstones their innocent victims babies whose fat had been used to make the flying ointment in which they had slathered themselves lay scattered between the stones like neglected dolls and all through this world of monstrous hurts and occasional miracles the hunt many of the scenes were simply documents of the vigorous beauty of the chase they looked as though they could have been painted from life there was a pack of dogs white and black and piebald some being muzzled by peasants others straining on their leashes as they were led away to join the great assembly of hunters elsewhere the dogs could be seen accompanying the hunters where the duke had chosen to kneel and pray a white dog knelt beside him his noble head bowed by the weight of shared devotion in another the dogs were splashing in a river attempting to catch the huge salmon outlined in the stylized blue waters and in a third place for no apparent reason but the playfulness of the artists the role of dogs and men had been reversed a long beautiful decorated table had been set up in a clearing amongst the trees and at it sat a number of finelybred dogs while at their booted feet naked men fought over scraps and bones closer examination showed the arrangement of figures to be even more anarchic than it first appeared for there were thirteen dogs at the table and in their center sat one dog with a halo perched between his pricked ears a canine last supper an informed observer knowing the traditional positions of the apostles could have named them all the writers of the gospels were there in their accustomed seats john sitting closest to his master judas sitting at the perimeter of the company while peter brooded at the other end his furrowed brow suggesting he already knew he would betray his master three times before the long night was over elsewhere in the landscape the dogs were painted at far crueler work tearing rabbits apart in one place and ripping the flesh from a cornered stag in another in a third they were in a contest with a lion and many had been traumatically injured by the battle some crawled away from the place trailing their bowels one had been thrown up into the trees and its corpse hung there tongue lolling others lay sprawled in the grass in pools of blood the hunters kept their distance no doubt waiting for the lion to become so weakened by bloodloss that they could close in and claim the heroic moment for themselves but the most perverse of all the scenes were those in which erotic love and hunting were conjoined there was for instance a place where the dogs had driven a number of naked men and women up a gorge where they had encountered a group of hunters armed with spears and nets the terrified couples clung to one another but the netters and the spearers knew their business men were separated from women and the men were run through with spears the women all bundled up in the nets heaped on carts and carried away the sexual servitude that awaited them was of a very particular kind reading the walls from left to right the viewers eye found that in an adjacent valley the women were freed from the nets and strapped beneath the bodies of massive centaurs their legs stretched around the flanks of the animals the womens response to this terrible violation was something the artists had taken some trouble to detail one was screaming in agony her head thrown back as blood ran from the place where she was being divided others appeared to be in ecstasy at this forced marriage pressing their faces joyously to the necks of their deflowerers but this part of the story did not finish there if the reader scanning these walls had continued his enquiry he would have found that some of the men had survived the massacre in the gorge and returned on a later sequence of tiles to hunt the creatures that had their wives in sexual thrall these were some of the most brilliantly painted sequences on the walls the surviving lovers returning on horseback so as to match their speed to that of the centaurs lassoes circling in the air over their heads they closed on the centaurs who were slowed down by the very women they carried around to pleasure them several were brought down by ropes around the neck others were speared in the throat or flank the women they carried were not always lucky in these encounters though no doubt their rescuers intended to free them it was often the case that they perished beneath the weight of their violators as the dying centaurs rolled over crushing them perhaps there was some moral heresome lesson about the vulnerability of the innocent women when two tribes of males were set against one another but the artists seemed to take too much grisly pleasure in their depictions for this to be the case rather it appeared to be done for the pleasure of the doing of the imagining and of the rendering there was no moral from one end of this world to the other it would be possible to go on listing at great length the horrors and the spectacles of the scenes laid out on the tile the fields of dancing demons the fairy races the succubi squatting on roofs the holy fools draped in coats of cowdung the satyrs the spirits of graveside roadside and hearthside the weaselkings and the bloated toads and so on and so on behind every tree and on every cloud sliding down every waterfall and lingering beneath every rock a world haunted by the shapes of lust and animal lust and all that humanity called to its bosom in the long nights of its despair though hollywoodeven in its fledgling yearswas presenting itself to the world as the very soul of the imagination there was nothing going on before the cameras there that could compete with what the master tilepainters and their apprentices had created it was as sandru has said the devils country zeffer went to brascov to hire men at prices five or six times what he would have paid locally because he wanted hands that could do the job with some finesse and minds that could count to a higher number than their fingers he devised the means by which the masterpiece could be removed himself the tiles were meticulously numbered on the reverse sides and a huge legend made of the room by three cartographers he had also hired in the city so that there would be a meticulous record of the way the design had been laid out and an obsessive accounting of how the tiles were numbered stacked and packed away including a detailed description of which tiles were cracked or damaged before they were packed which had been mislaid by the original tilers all so that when the tiles were unpacked at the house in coldheart canyon there would be no difficulty reordering them into the original design it was a long process a total of eleven weeks were to pass before the crated tiles were finally transported from the fortress all the work had drawn much attention of course from the brothers themselves who knew what was going on because father sandru had told them and from the villagers who had only the vaguest of ideas of what all this was about there were rumors flying around that the removal was being undertaken because the tiles had put the souls of the fathers in spiritual jeopardy but precise details of this jeopardy changed from account to account the vast sum of money that was now in the possession of the order did very little to transform the lives of the priests apart from inspiring some of the most embittered exchanges in the history of the brotherhood several of the priests were of the opinion that the tiles should not have been sold to this father sandruwho was more often and more publicly drunk by the dayoffered only a sneering dismissal what does it matter he said to the complainers they are only tiles for gods sake there were a good number of shaken heads by the way of response and a very eloquent riposte from one of the older fathers who said that god had put the tiles into their protection and it was cynical and careless of him to let them go what damage might they not do out there in the world he said what hurt to innocent souls sandru was unmoved by all this there were no innocent souls in hollywood he had learned nor was there any sin or excess painted in the tiles that the people of that city were not intimately familiar with he spoke with an authority which he didnt in truth possess but it sufficiently impressed the brothersor at least a greater number of themso that the naysayers were finally silenced there was much debate about what should happen to the money one faction led by the older men believed it had been acquired by dubious means and the only uncorrupted way to dispose of it was to distribute it amongst the poor surprisingly very few voices supported this solution some part of the money might be given to the needy in the village the priests agreed but there were other causes that should be attended to there was some lobbying for a complete removal of the order to some other place than the fortress a more comfortable place where they could find their way to god without the devils shadow falling across their path it was sandru who was the most eloquent advocate of their staying in the fortress his tongue well lubricated with wine he explained that he felt no sense of regret that hed sold the tiles it was a onceinalifetime opportunity and he was glad hed taken it now he said they should use the money to rejuvenate the place get the hospital up and running as had always been the plan see what they could do about refertilizing the land so that the vineyard would prosper as they had in the old days our path is perfectly dear he said to the brothers whether our faith in the lord is secure or not we can heal here and we can grow the grape and pass our lives with purpose he smiled as he spoke that wordpurposehad not been on his lips for many years and it gave him pleasure to speak it but even as he spoke the smile started to die away and the color shrank from his ruddy face i beg you to excuse me he said putting his hand to his belly i am sickened by too much brandy with that he pulled out of his robes the bottle from which he had been drinking since early morning and set it clumsily down on the table in front of him then he turned and stumbled out to get a breath of fresh air nobody went after him he had no friends left in the fortress his old allies were too embarrassed by his excesses to publicly share his opinions fearful that his behavior might reflect poorly on them and keep them from advancement so he was alone as he wandered giddily through the ruins of the dead vines it was evening and now that the summer was past the air was beginning to get chilly but the sky overhead was a perfect blue and there was a new moon its pallid crescent just clearing the mountains sandru tried to let the sight of the sky and moon calm him have them placate the pain of his heart give life back to his numbed fingers but the trick was beyond them he realized suddenly that this was not a spasm brought on by too much brandy he was dying the brothers had medicines for weakness of the heart he knew it would not be the end of him if he got back to them quickly enough he turned on his heel attempting to voice a shout of alarm but his panicked chest would provide no breath for him to cry for help his legs began to fail him and down he went face first into the dirt he tasted the soil in his mouth bitter and unappetizing he spat it out and with the last of his strength he pushed himself up out of the filth and let gravity roll him over he could not move but it didnt matter the darkening sky overhead was spectacle enough he lay there for six or seven shortening gasps while a star lonely in its solitude brightened at his zenith then he let life go the brothers did not find him until the middle of the night by which time a frost had settled on the old vineyard the first frost of that autumn it glittered on the bulk of the dead father on his bulbous nose and in the knots of his beard it had even inscribed its filigrees on his unblinking eyes four there was no hospital established at the fortress then or ever nor was there any attempt to replant the vineyard or make the grounds around the fortress in any way flourish with father sandrus passing what little enthusiasm there had been for change withered the younger men decided to leave the fortress three of them left the order entirely and became members of the secular community of the three onea young man by the name of jan valek took his own life less than a year later leaving a long suicide note a kind of epistle to his sometime brothers in which he wrote of how hed had a dream after the death of father sandru in which i met the father in the vineyards which were all burning it was a terrible place to be black smoke was filling the sky blotting out the sun he said to me that this was hell this world and there was only one way to escape it and that was to die his face was bright even in the darkness he said he wished hed died earlier instead of going on suffering in the world i asked him if they allowed him to drink brandy wherever he was now he said he had no need of brandy his existence was happy there was no need to conceal the pain with drinking then i told him i still had a life to live in the world whereas he had been an old man with a weak heart i was strong i said and there was a good chance id be alive for another thirty maybe forty years which was an agony to me but what could i do so take your own life he said to me he made it sound so simple cut your throat god understands he does i said to him certainly he told this world is hell just look around what do you see i told him what i saw fire smoke block earth seehe said hell i told him though of course i was still dreaming i was going to take his advice i was going to go back to my room find a sharp knife and kill myself but for some reason as often happens in dreams i didnt go home i went into bucharest to the cinema where brother stefan used to bring me sometimes to see films we went inside it was very dark we found seats and stefan had me sit down then the film began and it was a film about some earthly paradise it made me weep it was so perfect this place the music the way the people looked beautiful men and women all so lovely it took my breath away to look at them there was one young man in particularand it makes me ashamed to write this but if i dont do it here in my last confession where will i do ita young man with dark hair and lightfilled eyes who opened his arms to me he was naked on the screen with open arms inviting me into his embrace i turned to father stefan in the darkness and he said the very thing that was going through my mind he wants to take you into his arms i started to deny it but stefan interrupted me and said look at him look at his face its flawless look at his body its perfect and therebetween his legs i covered my face in shame but stefan pulled my hands from my face and told me not to be ashamed just to look and enjoy looking god made all of this for our pleasure he said why would he give us such a hunger to look at nakedness unless he wanted us to take pleasure in it i asked stefan how he knew it was gods work perhaps the devil had made nakedness i said to tempt us and ensnare us he laughed and put his arm around me and kissed me on the cheek as though i was just a little child this isnt the devils work he said this is your invitation to paradise then he kissed me again and i felt a warm wind blowing as though it was spring in whatever country they had created on the screen and the wind made me want to die with pleasure because it smelled of a time i remembered from long ago so now i have come back to my room i have a knife when i have finished writing this i will leave what i have written on the table and i will go out into the field and cut my wrists i know we are taught that selfslaughter is a sin and that the lord does not wish us to harm ourselves but if he does not wish me to end my life why is this knife within reach of my hand and why is my heart so much at peace his body was found about a hundred yards from the place where sandrus frostcovered body had been discovered coming so soon upon the death of the old priest the death of jan valek undid the brotherhood completely orders came from bucharest and the brotherhood was disbanded there was no need to guard the fortress any longer the archbishop said the brothers would be more useful to the church if they worked with the sick and the dying to offer the lords comfort where it was most needed within a week the order of st teodor had left the fortress goga there were those among the villagers who felt that the fortress had invited its abandonment and began its own process of selfslaughter superstition no doubt but it was certainly strange that after five centuries of life during which span it had remained strong a quick process of disintegration should begin as soon as the community of caretakers departed true the winter immediately following was particularly severe but there had been heavier snows on the roofs and they had not bowed beneath the weight there had been stronger winds through the casements and theyd not broken open and smashed there had been more persistent floodings of the lower floors and the doors had not been carried off on their rotted hinges by the time the spring came roundwhich was late april that yearthe fortress had effectively become uninhabitable it was as though its soul had gone out of it and now all it wanted was to allow the seasons to take their steady toll they were guileless collaborators the summer was as violently hot as the winter had been bitter and it bred all manner of destroyers in the fabric of the building worm and fly and wasp contributed to the baking heat of the sun with their burrowings and layings and nestings beams that had taken ten men to lift them became dusty hollow things as delicate as the bones of immense birds unable to support their own weight they collapsed upon themselves bringing down entire floors as they fell by the time september arrived the fortress was open to the elements the ward where the brothers had optimistically laid out rows of beds now had a ceiling of cloud when the first rains of autumn came the mattresses were soaked fungus and mildew sprouted where the sick would have lain the place stank of rot from end to end and finally somewhere in the middle of the second winter in its empty state the floorboards cracked and opened up and the lowest level of the fortress the level where father sandru had brought zeffer to show him the tiled chamber became available to sky and storm if anyone had ventured into the fortress that winter they would have witnessed the most delicate of spectacles through the eight vaults above the oncetiled roomwhich were now all cracked like eggssnow came spiraling down it fell into a room denuded the workmen zeffer had hired to do the work of removing the tiles had first been obliged to empty the room of all the monks had left in there some of the furniture had subsequently been stolen some broken up for firewood and the restperhaps a quarter of the bountysimply left to decay where it had been piled up the snow spiraling down settled in little patches on the floor patches which would not melt for the next four months but only get wider and deeper as the winters storms got worse the snow heavier just before the thaw in the middle of the following april the weight of snow and ice finally brought the vaults down in one calamitous descent there was nobody there to witness it nor anyone within earshot to hear it the room which had contained the hunt was buried in the debris of all the vaults plaster and wood and stone filling the chamber to the middle of the walls nobody who visited the fortress in subsequent yearsand there were a few explorers who came there every summer usually imagining theyd stumbled on something darkly marvelousa fortress perhaps belonging to vlad the impaler whose legendary territories lay only a few hundred miles off to the west in transylvanianone of these visitors dug through the overgrown ruins with any great enthusiasm certainly none ever asked themselves what function the halfburied room might have once served nor should it be said would they have been able to guess even the cleverest of them the mystery of the ruined chamber had been removed to another continent where it was presently unfolding its dubious raptures for the delectation of a new and vulnerable audience men and women wholike the tileshad in many cases lately left their homelands and in their haste to be famous left behind them such talismans as hearth and altar might have offered by way of protection against the guileful hunt part two the heartthrob one theres a premiere in los angeles tonight at graumans chinese theatre the chinese has been housing such events since but of course the crowds were much larger back then tens of thousands of people sometimes even hundreds of thousands would block hollywood boulevard in their hunger to see the star of the moment tonights event is nowhere near that scale though the studio publicists will massage the numbers for tomorrows variety and hollywood reporter claiming that a crowd of four thousand people waited in the chilly evening air for the appearance of the star of tonights movie todd pickett the true numbers are in fact less than half that still a third of the boulevard is barricaded off and there are a few cop cars in evidence just to give the whole event more drama as the limos approach the red carpet and the ushers who are dressed in the black leather costumes of the villains in the movie step forward to open the doors a few screamers paid and planted in the crowd by the studio publicity people to get a little excitement going start to do their job yelling even before the face of the limos passenger has been seen theres a large contingent of alist names on tonights guestlist and plenty of faces that elicit screams as they appear cruise isnt here but nicole kidman is so is schwarzenegger who has a small role in the picture as the retiring gallows a vengeful mythological character whom our hero played by todd pickett must either choose to embody when his time comes round orshould he refusebe pursued by the ghosts of several generations of former incarnations of the character to persuade him otherwise sigourney weaver plays the woman who has broken the curse of gallows once before to whom picketts character must go when the phantom pursuers are almost upon him her arrival at graumans is greeted by a genuine roar of approval from the fans who are devoted to her she waves smiles allows a barrage of photographs to be taken but she doesnt go near the crowd shes had experiences with overlypossessive fans before she walks straight down the middle of the red carpet where shes out of reach of their fingers still they shout we love you ripley which is the character she plays in the alien movies and with which she will be identified until the day she dies she waves even when they call the name ripley but her eyes never focus on anybody in the crowd for more than a moment the next limo in the line contains the bright new star of gallows suzie henstell named by this months vanity fair one of the ten hottest names in hollywood she is petite blonde and giggly shes shared a little marijuana with her boyfriend in the limo and it was a bad move she stumbles a little as she steps onto the red carpet but the crowd has been prepped thanks to several months of puff pieces and photospreads and indepth interviews to think of this woman as a fullblown star even though they have yet to see more than a few frames of her acting ability from the trailer for gallows so what do they care if she looks a little out of it unlike ms weaver who wisely chooses to be elusive allowing the photographers just a minute or two to catch her the new girl is still hungry for adulation she goes straight to the barricades where a number of young women with souvenir programs for gallows are waving them around she signs a few giving her boyfriend who is a sixfoot calvin klein model hunk a goofy geeimustbefamous look the model looks back vacantly which is the only look in his repertoire he can give it to you vacantly with a semi hardon in his jeans or vacantly with his ass hanging out of his yfronts either way it is heartachingly beautiful almost troublingly so the wind comes in gusts along hollywood boulevard and the security men start to look a little worried it was some bright publicists idea to build two gallows as a kind of gateway through which the audience for the premiere will need to come not it now seems a clever notion the gallows are made to be trashed tomorrow morning so theyre made of light timber and foamcore the wind is threatening to topple them or worse pick then up entirely and deposit them on top of the crowd light though they are they could do some serious damage if they fell four of the ushers from inside the theatre are summoned from their duties and told to go and stand beside the gallows two on either side holding on to them as casually as possible security is told that the publicity people only need five more minutes as soon as suzie henslett can be persuaded to move on up the carpet and into the building the directors rob neidermans limo can be brought to the carpet followed by the last and most important of the bunch todd pickett the wind is getting worse the gallows sway giddily an executive decision is made to bring neidermans limo in and if suzies screaming fans are visible waving like lunatics behind neiderman in his press pictures so be it this isnt a perfect world its already pm at this rate the picture wont be able to begin until half past the hour which wouldnt be a problem if the damn thing werent so long but neidermans cut came in at two hours and fortythree minutes and though the studio appealed to pickett to get him to shave the thing down to a tight two hours todd came back saying he liked the picture pretty much as it was so only four minutes were going out of it that means itll be past eleven before the pictures finished and almost midnight by the time everybodys assembled at the party venue its going to be a long night neiderman has persuaded the easilydistracted miss henslett away from her fans and down the carpet to the door the big moment is at hand the ushers cling to the gallows their jobs depending on the perpendicularity of their charges the largest of the limos comes up to the curb even before the door has opened the fansespecially the womenare in a state of ecstasy shrieking at the top of their voices todd todd oh god todd the cameras start to flash as though the incomprehensible semaphore of their flashes is going to summon the man in the limo and out comes todd pickett the star of gallows the reason why ninetyfive percent of its audience will be there when it opens next friday todd pickett one of the three biggest male actionmoviestars in the history of cinema todd pickett the boy from cincinnati who failed in all his grades but ended up the king of hollywood he raises his hands like a presidential candidate to acknowledge the shouts of the crowd then he reaches back into the limo to catch hold of the hand of his date for the night wilhemina bosch a waitressturnedmodelturnedactressturnedmodel again with whom he has been seen at parties and premieres for the past four months though neither will say anything about the relationship than that theyre good friends he gathers wilhemina to him so that the photographers can get pictures of them together then arm in arm through the blizzard of rights and the barrage of we love you todd coming at them from every side the pair make their way to the cinema doors whichhaving gathered their most important guests into the fold then close rather defiantly as if to divide the important from the unimportant the stable and the solid from those who are simply objects of the nights wind gallows is an irredeemable piece of shit of course and everyone involved with it from the executives who greenlit it to the humblest publicist knows it is in the words of corlisss review in time an old fashioned actionhorror picture which lacks the fullbone theatrics of grand guignol and the savvy john woostyle action piece audiences have come to expect one minute schwarzenegger is camping it up the next todd pickett as his unwilling successor is playing his scenes as though hes hamlet on a particularly dreary night in denmark from beginning to end gallows is bad noose everybody going up the red carpet that monday night already knows what time is going to say corliss had made his contempt for the picture very plain in a piece about the state of action movies he wrote two weeks before nor does it take an oracle to predict that there will be others who will not like the picture but the extent of vitriol will prove astonishing even to those who expected the worst in the next fortyeight hours gallows will garner some of the most negative reviews of the last twelve months the vehemence of the early news reviewers empowering minor names to pull out the stops besides the incomprehensible script everyone agrees there is a lackluster quality to the picture that betrays the casts indifference to the entire project performances arent simply uneven they seemed designed for entirely different movies a hopeless mismatch of styles the worst culprit in this regard there is no question about that all the reviewers will agree that the most inadequate performance comes from its star todd pickett people writes that mr pickett is plenty old enough to know better thirtysomethingyearolds dont act the way mr pickett acts here his trademark young man with a chip on his shoulder and a thousandwatt smile which was looking stale the second time he did it seems particularly outofplace here though it seems incredible that time has passed so fast since america first swooned to the charms of mr picketthes now simply too old to play the twentysomething vincent only wilhemina bosch as vincents prozacchewing sister comes out of this mess with any credibility she has an elegant beautifullyproportioned face and she can turn a line with the snappy eastcoast smarts of a young katherine hepburn shes wasted here or more correctly our time would be wasted here were she not in the movie the premiere audience didnt seem to mind it on occasion there were audible gasps and loud laughter for the jokes but there were several long stretches in the second act when the movie seemed to lose their interest even in the third act when the action relocates to the orbiting space station and the special effects budget soared there was very little real enthusiasm a few scattered whoops of nihilistic delight when the villains planetdestroying weapon actually went off against expectation and washington dc is fried to a crisp but then as the smoke cleared and todd as the new gallows proceeded to finish off the bad guys the audience became restless again about fifteen minutes before the end credits rolled a member of the audience got up from his seat on the aisle and went to the bathroom a few people caught a look at the mans face as he looked back at the screen it was todd pickett lit by the light of his own face nobody got up to ask for his autograph pickett stared at the screen for a moment only then he turned his back on it and trudged up and out of the cinema he didnt go to the restroom instead he asked one of the ushers if he could be allowed out of the back of the building the usher explained that the area around the back had no security i just want a quiet smoke with nobody watching me todd explained the usher said sure why not and led todd down a passageway that ran behind the screen todd looked up at his reversed image on the screen all he could remember about the scene that was playing was how damn uncomfortable his costume had been here you go the usher said unlocking the doors at the end of the corridor and letting todd out into an area lit only by the ambient light from the boulevard thanks todd said giving him a twentybuck bill ill be back out front by the time the credits roll the usher thanked him for the twentynote and left him to himself todd took out a cigarette but it never got to his lips a wave of nausea overtook him so powerful and so sudden that it was all he could do not to puke down his own tuxedo up came the scotches hed had in the limo as he drove on down to the premiere and the pepperoni pizza with three cheeses and extra anchovies hed had to add ballast with the first heave over he had the presence of mind to look around and confirm that this nasty little scene was not being spied on or worse photographed luckily he was alone all he had for company back here was the detritus of premieres past piles of standees and gaudy scenery pieces designed to advertise movies gone by mel gibson against an eruption of lurid flame godzillas eye the bottom half of a girl in a very short dress he got to his feet and stumbled away from the stench of his vomit making his way through this graveyard of old glories heading for the darkest place he could find in which to hide his giddy head behind him through the stillopen door he could hear the sound of gunfire and the muted sound of his own voice come on out you sonofabitch he was yelling to somebody by now if the movie had been working the audience would have been yelling and screaming wild with bloodlust but despite the overamped soundtrack nobody was yelling because nobody gave a damn the movie was dying on its feet another wave of nausea rose up in him he reached out to catch hold of something so that he didnt fall down and his outstretched hand knocked over a cardboard cutout of tom cruise which toppled backwards and hit a cardboard titanic which in turn crashed against a cardboard mighty joe young and so on and so forth like a row of candycolored dominoes stars falling against ships falling against monsters all toppling back into a darkness so deep they were an indistinguishable heap luckily the noise of his vomiting was covered by the din of his own movie he puked again twice until his stomach had nothing left to give up then he turned his back on the vomit and the toppled idols and stepped away to find a lungful of dean air to inhale the worst was over he lit his cigarette which helped settle his stomach and rather than returning inside where the picture was two minutes from finishing he walked along side of the building until he found a patch of streetlight where he could assess himself he was lucky his suit was unspattered there was a spot of vomit on his shoes but he cleaned it off with his handkerchief and then sprayed his tongue and throat with wintergreen breathcleanser his hair was cropped short so he had no fear that it was out of place he probably looked a little pale but what the hell pale was in there was a gate close to the front of the building guarded by a security officer she recognized todd immediately and unlocked the gate getting out before it gets too crazy she said to him he smiled and nodded you want an escort to your car yeah thanks one of the executive producers an overeager englishman called george dipper with whom todd had never worked before was standing on the red carpet his presence ignored by the press who were standing around chatting to one another or checking their cameras before the luminaries reappeared george caught todds eye and hurried over dragging on his own cigarette as though his life depended on its nicotine content there was scattered applause from inside which quickly died away the picture was over i think it played brilliantly george said his eyes begging for a syllable of agreement they were with us all the way dont you think so it was fine todd said without commitment forty million the first weekend dont get your hopes up you dont think well do forty i think itll do fine georges face lit up todd pickett the man hed paid twenty million dollars to was declaring it fine god was in his heaven for a terrible moment todd thought the man was going to weep with relief at least theres nothing big opening against it todd said so weve got one weekend clear and your fans are loyal george said again the desperation in the eyes todd couldnt bear to look at him any longer im just goin to make a quick getaway todd said glancing towards the theater doors the first of the crowd were emerging if the expressions on the first five faces he scanned were an omen his instincts were right they did not have a hit he turned his back on the crowd telling george hed see him later you are coming to the party george said hanging on to him as he headed down the carpet where was marco todd thought trusty marco who was always there when he was needed yes ill pop in later he said glancing back over his shoulder at george to reassure him in the seconds since hed turned away the audience spilling from the theatre door had jumped from five to a hundred half of them saw him in just a few seconds theyd be surrounding him yelling his name telling him they loved this and they hated that touching him pulling on him here boss marco called to him from the curb the limo door was open god bless him todd raced down the carpet as people behind him started to call his name cameras started to flash into the limo marco slammed the door todd locked it then marco dashed around to the drivers seat with a remarkable turn of speed given his poundage and got in where to mulholland mulholland drive winds through the city like a lazy serpent for many miles but marco didnt need to know where along its length his boss wanted to be taken there was a spot close to coldwater canyon where the undulating drive offers a pictureperfect view of the san fernando valley as far as the mountains by day it can be a smogbefouled spectacle brown and gray but by night especially in the summer it is a place of particular enchantment the cities of burbank north hollywood and pasadena laid out in a matrix of amber lights receding to the dark wall of the mountains and moving against the darkness the lights of planes circling as they await their instruction to land at burbank airport or the police helicopters passing over the city spitting a beam of white light often there were sightseers parked at the spot enjoying the scene but tonight thank god there were none marco parked the car and todd got out wandering to the cliffedge to look at the scene before him marco got out too and occupied his time with wiping the windshield of the limo he was a big man with the bearded face of a bear recently woken from hibernation and he possessed a curious mixture of talents a sometime wrestler and jujitsu black belt he was also a trained cordon bleu cook and a twicedivorced father of three with an encyclopedic knowledge of the works of wagner more importantly he was todds righthand man loyal to a fault there was no part of todds existence marco caputo did not have some part of he took care of the hiring and firing of domestic staff and gardeners the buying and the driving of cars and of course all the security duties the movies shit huh he said matteroffactly worse than sorry bout that not your fault i should never have done it shit script shit movie you want to give the party a miss nah i gotta go i promised wilhemina and george you got something going with her wilhemina yeah i got something i just dont know whether i want to plus shes got an english boyfriend the english are all fags yeah you want me to swing by the party and bring her back up to the house for you suppose she says no oh come on when did any girl say no to you todd said nothing he just stared out over the vista of lights the wind came up out of the valley smelling of gas fumes and chinese food the santa anas hot off the mojave gusted against his face he closed his eyes to enjoy the moment but what came into his head was an image of himself a still from the movie hed fled from tonight he studied the face in his minds eye for a moment then he said i look tired two todd picket had made two of his three most successful pictures under the aegis of a producer by the name of keever smotherman the first of them was called gunner the kind of high concept testosteronemarinated picture smotherman had been renowned for making it had made toddwho was then an unknown from ohioa bonafide moviestar if not overnight then certainly within a matter of weeks he hadnt been required to turn in a performance smotherman didnt make movies that required actors only breathtaking physical specimens and todd was certainly that every time he stepped before the cameras whether he was sharing the scene with a girl or a fighterplane he was all the eye wanted to watch the camera worked some kind of alchemy upon him and he worked the same magic on celluloid in life he was goodlooking but flawed he was a little on the short side with broad hips he was also conspicuously bandy but on the screen all these flaws disappeared he became gleaming studly perfection his jawline heroic his gaze crystalline his mouth an uncommon mingling of the sensual and the severe his particular beauty had suited the taste of the times and by the end of that first extraordinary summer of comingtofame his image dressed in an immaculate white uniform which made poetry of his buttocks had become an indelible piece of cinema iconography over the years other stars had risen just as high of course and many just as quickly but few were quite as ready for their ascent as todd pickett this was what hed been polishing himself for since the moment his mother patricia donna pickett had first taken him into a cinema in downtown cincinnati looking up at the screen watching the parade of faces pass before him hed known instinctively that he belonged up there with those stars and that if he willed it hard enough willed and worked for it then it was merely a matter of time before he joined the parade after the success of gunner he fell effortlessly into the labors of being a movie star in interviews he was courteous funny and selfeffacing playing the interviewers so easily that all but the most cynical swooned he was confident about his charms but he wasnt cocky loyal to his midwestern roots and boyishly devoted to his mother most attractive of all he was honest about his shortcomings as an actor there was a refreshing lack of pretension about the pickett persona the year after gunner he made two pictures back to back another action blockbuster for smotherman called lightning rod which was released on independence day and blew all former boxoffice records to smithereens and then for the christmas market life lessons the latter was a sweetly sentimental slip of a story in which todd played opposite sharon campbell a playboy model turned actress who had been tabloid fodder at the time thanks to her recent divorce from an alcoholic and abusive husband the pairing of pickett and campbell had worked like a charm and the reviews for todds performance were especially kind while he was still relying on his physical gifts the critics observed there were definitely signs that he was taking on the full responsibilities of an actor digging deeper into himself to engage his audience nor was he afraid to show weakness twice in life lessons he was required to sob like a baby and he did so very convincingly the picture was a huge hit meaning that both of the big moneymakers of the year had todds name above the title he was officially boxoffice gold for most of the following decade he could do no wrong inevitably some of his pictures performed better than others but even the disappointments were triumphs by comparison with the fumbling labors of most of his contemporaries of course he wasnt making the choice of material on his own from the beginning hed had a close relationship with his manager maxine frizelle a short sharp bitch of a woman in her midforties whod once been voted the most despised person in hollywood and had asked when the news had reached her if the awards ceremony was full evening dress though shed been representing other agents when she first took todd on shed let them all go once his career began to demand her complete attention thereafter she lived and breathed the pickett business controlring every element of his life private and professional the price she asked studios for his services rapidly rose to unheard of heights and she drove the deal home every single time she had an opinion about everything rewrites casting the hiring of directors artdirectors costume designers and directors of photographers her only concern were the best interests of her wonderboy in the language of an older but similarly feudal system she was the power behind the throne and everyone who worked with todd from the heads of studios to humble hairstylists had some encounter with her to relate some scar to show needless to say the pickett magic couldnt remain unchallenged forever there were always new stars in the ascendancy new faces with the new smiles appearing on the screen every season and after ten years of devotion the audience that had doted on todd in the midtolate eighties began to look elsewhere for its heroes it wasnt that his pictures performed less well but that others performed even better a new definition of a blockbuster had appeared moneymachines like independence day and titanic which earned so much so quickly that pictures which would once have been called major hits were now in contrast simply modest successes anxious to regain the ground he was losing todd decided to go back into business with smotherman who was just as eager to return to their glory days together the project theyd elected to do together was a movie called warrior a piece of high concept junk about a streetfighter from brooklyn who is brought through time to champion a future earth in a battle against marauding aliens the script was a ludicrous concoction of clichйs pulled from every cheesy sciencefiction bmovies of the fifties and an early budget had put the picture somewhere in the region of a hundred million dollars simply to get it on screen but smotherman was confident that he could persuade either fox or paramount to greenlight it the show had everything he said an easilygrasped idea a dozen action sequences which called for stateoftheart effects and the kind of hero todd could perform in his sleep an ordinary man put in an extraordinary situation it was a nobrainer all round the studios would be fools not to greenlight it it had all the marks of a massive hit he was nothing if not persuasive in person smotherman was almost a parody of a highvoltage salesman fasttalking shorttempered and oversexed there was never an absence of babes as he still called them in his immediate vicinity all were promised leading roles when theyd performed adequately for smotherman in private and all of course were discarded the instant he tired of them preparations for warrior were proceeding nicely then the unthinkable happened a week shy of his fortyfourth birthday smotherman died hed always been a man of legendary excess a bottomfeeder happiest in the gamier part of any city the circumstances of his death were perfectly consistent with this reputation hed died sitting at a table in a private club in new york watching a lesbian sex show the coronary that had felled him so massive and so sudden he had apparently been overtaken by it before he could even cry out for help he was face down in a pile of cocaine when he was found a drug hed continued to consume in heroic quantities long after his contemporaries had cleaned up their acts and had their sinuses surgically reconstructed it was one of the thirtyfive illegal substances found in his system at the autopsy he was buried in las vegas according to the instructions in his will hes been happiest there hed always said with everything to win and everything to lose this remark was twice quoted at the memorial service and hearing it todd felt a cold trickle of apprehension pass down his spine what smotherman had known and been at peace with was the fact that all of tinseltown was a gameand it could be lost in a heartbeat smotherman had been a gambling man hed taken pleasure in the possibility of failure and it had sweetened his success todd on the other hand had never even played the slots much less a game of poker or roulette sitting there listening to the hypocritesmost of whom had despised smothermanstand up and extol the dead man he realized that keevers passing cast a pall over his future the golden days were over his place in the sun would very soon belong to others if it didnt already the day after the memorial service he poured his fears out to maxine she was all reassurance smotherman was a dinosaur she said as she sipped her vodka the only reason people put up with his bullshit all those years was because he made everybody a lot of money but lets be honest he was a lowlife youre a class act youve got nothing to worry about i dont know todd said his head throbbing from one too many drinks i look at myself sometimes and what im not the guy i was when i made gunner damn right youre not you were nobody then now youre one of the most successful actors in history theres others coming up so what maxine said waving his concerns away dont do that todd said slamming his palm down on the table dont try and placate me okay we have a problem smotherman was going to put me back on top and now the son of a bitch is dead all right calm down all im saying is that we dont need smotherman well hire somebody to rework the script if thats what you want then well find somebody hip to direct it somebody with a contemporary style smotherman was an oldfashioned guy everything had to be big big explosion big tits big guns audiences dont care about any of that any more you need to be part of whats coming up not what happened yesterday you know i hate to say it but perhaps keevers dying is the best thing that could have happened we need a new look for you a new todd pickett you think its as simple as that todd said he wanted so much to believed that maxine had the problem solved how difficult can it be maxine said youre a great star we just need to get people focused on you again she pondered for a moment you know what we should set up a lunch with gary eppstadt oh jesus why you know how i hate that ugly little fuck an ugly little fuck he may be but he is going to pay for warrior and if hes going put twenty million and a slice of the backend on the table for your services to art you can make nice with the son of a bitch for an hour three it wasnt simply personal antipathy that had made todd refer to eppstadt so unflatteringly it was the unvarnished truth eppstadt was the ugliest man in los angeles charitably his eyes might have been called reptilian his lips unkissable his mother in a fit of blind affection might have noted that he was disproportioned all this said the man was still a narcissist of the first rank he hung only the most expensive suits on his unfortunate carcass his fingernails were manicured with obsessive precision his personal barber trimmed his dyed hair every morning having shaved him first with a straight razor there had been countless prayers offered up to that razor over the years entreating it to slip but eppstadt seemed to live a charmed life hed gone from strength to strength as he moved around the studios claiming the paternity of every success and blaming the failures on those who stood immediately behind him on the ladder whom he promptly fired it was the oldest trick in the book but it had worked flawlessly in an age in which corporations increasingly had the power and studios were run by committees of businessschool graduates and lawyers with an itch to have their fingers in the creative pie eppstadt was one of the old school a powermonger happiest in the company of somebody who needed his patronage whom he could then abuse in a hundred subtle ways that was his pleasure and his revenge what did he need beauty for when he could make it tremble with a smiling maybe he was in a fine mood when he and todd with maxine in attendance met for lunch on monday paramount had carried the weekend with a brutal revenge picture that eppstadt had taken a hand in making firing the director off the project after two unpromising preview screenings and hiring somebody else to shoot a rape scene and a new ending in which the violated woman terrorized and eventually dispatched her attacker with a hedgecutter thirtytwo point six million dollars in three days he preened in january thats a hit and you know what theres nobody in the picture just a couple noname tv stars it was all marketing is the picture any good todd asked yeah its fucking hamlet eppstadt said without missing a beat youre looking weary my friend he went on you need a vacation ive been taking time at this monastery monastery sounds crazy right but you feel the peace you feel the tranquility and they take jews actually ive seen more jews there than at my nephews bar mitzvah you should try it take a rest i dont want to rest i want to work we need to set a startdate for warrior eppstadts enthusiastic expression dimmed oh christ is that what this little lunch is all about maxine are you making it or not todd pressed because theres plenty of other people who will if you wont so maybe you should take it to one of them eppstadt said his gaze hooded you can have it in turnaround if thats what you want ill get business affairs on it this afternoon so youre really ready to let it go maxine said putting on an air of indifference perfectly ready if thats what todd wants im not going to stand in the way of you getting the picture made you look surprised maxine i am surprised a package like thatits a huge summer movie for paramount frankly im not sure this is the right time for the company to be making that kind of picture maxine its a very hard market to read right now and these expensive pictures i mean this is going to come in at well north of a hundred thirty million by the time weve paid for prints and advertising im not sure that makes solid fiscal sense he tried a smile it was lupine look todd i want to be in business with you paramount wants to be in business with you christ youve been a goldmine for us over the years but theres a generation coming upand you know the demographics as well as i dothese kids filling up the multiplexes they dont have any loyalty to the past eppstadt knew what effect his words were having and he was savoring every last drop of it you see in the good old days the studios were able to carry stars through a weak patch you had a star on a sevenyear contract he was being paid a weekly wage you could afford a year or two of poor performance but youre expensive todd youre crucifyingly expensive and ive got viacoms shareholders to answer to im not sure theyd want to see me pay you twenty million dollars for a picture that might only grosswhat did your last picture do fortyone domestic and change maxine sighed a little theatrically im sorry to hear that gary look maxine im sorry to be having to say it really i am but numbers are numbers if i dont believe i can make a profit what am i doing making the movie you see where im coming from that simply doesnt make sense maxine got up from the table will you excuse me a minute ive got to make a call eppstadt caught the fire in maxines voice no lawyers maxine please we can do this in a civilized manner maxine didnt reply she simply stalked off between tables snarling at a waiter who got in her way eppstadt ate a couple of mouthfuls of rare tuna then put down his fork its times like this i wish i still smoked he sat back in his chair and looked hard at todd dont let her start a pissing competition todd because if im cornered im going to have to stand up and tell it like it is and then well all have a mess on our hands meaning what meaning eppstadt looked pained as though his proctologist was at work on him under the chair you cant keep massaging numbers so your price looks justified when we all know it isnt you were saying id been a goldmine for paramount just two minutes ago you said that that was then this is now that was keever smotherman this is postkeever smotherman he was the last of his breed so what are you saying welllet me tell you what im not saying eppstadt replied his tone silky im not saying you dont have a career well thats nice to hear todd said sharply i want to find something we can do together but but eppstadt seemed to be genuinely considering his reply before he spoke finally he said youve got talent todd and youve obviously built a loyal fanbase over the years what you dont have is the drawing power you had back in the old days its the same with all of you really expensive boys cruise costner stallone he took a moment then leaned closer to todd dropping his voice to a conspiratorial whisper you want the truth you look weary i mean deep down weary todd said nothing eppstadts observation was like being doused in icecold water sorry to be blunt its not like im telling you something you dont already know todd was staring at his hand wondering what it would feel like to make a fist and beat it against eppstadts face over and over and over of course you can have these things fixed gary went on chattily i know a couple of guys older than you who went to see bruce burrows and looked ten years younger when he was finished working on them still idly contemplating his hand todd said whos bruce burrows well in many peoples opinion hes the best cosmetic surgeon in the country hes got an office on wilshire very private very expensive but you can afford it he does it all collagen replacements lifts peels liposculpture who went to see him oh just about everybody theres nothing to be ashamed of its a fact of life at a certain age its harder to get the lovehandles to melt you get laughlines you get frown lines you get those little grooves around your mouth i havent got grooves around my mouth give it time eppstadt said a touch avuncular now how long does it take i dont know ive never had any of it done if i went in there id never get out again too much to fix i think its bad taste to jump on somebody elses selfdeprecation todd but i forgive you i know it hurts to hear this the fact is i dont have to have my face out there fifty feet high you do thats what theyre paying for he pointed at todd that face if i was to get something done todd said tentatively about the lines i mean yes would you make warrior then he had opened the door to eppstadts favorite word maybe i dont know wed have to see but the way i look at it you havent got much to lose getting the work done anyway youre a heartthrob an oldfashioned heartthrob they want to see you kick the shit out of the bad guy and get the girl and they want their heartthrob perfect he stared at todd you need to be perfect burrows can do that for you he can make you perfect again then you get back to being king of the hill which is what you want i presume todd admitted it with a little nod as though it were a private vice look i sympathize eppstadt went on ive seen a lot of people just fold up when they lose their public they come apart at the seams you havent done that at least not yet he laid a hand on todds arm you go have a word with doctor burrows see what he can do for you six months then well talk again todd didnt mention his discussion about doctor burrows to maxine he didnt want the decision process muddied by her opinion this was something he wanted to think through for himself though he didnt remember having heard of burrows before he was perfectly aware he was riving in the cosmetic surgery capitol of the world noses were fixed lips made fuller crows feet erased ears pinned back laughlines smoothed guts tucked butts lifted breasts enhanced just about any piece of the anatomy which gave its owner ego problems could be improved sometimes out of all recognition traditionally of course it had been women who were the eager and grateful recipients of such handiwork but that had changed one of the eighties musclemen whod made a fortune parading a body of superhuman proportions some years before but had begun to lose it to gravity had returned to the screen last year looking more pumped than ever his perfect abdominals and swelling pectoralseven his sculpted calf musclessurgically implanted the healing had taken a little while given the extensiveness of the remodeling hed been out of commission for five monthshiding in tuscany the gossip wentwhile he mended but it had worked hed left the screen looking like a beatenup catchers mitt and come back spanking new todd began by making some very circuitous inquiries the sort of questions which he hoped would not arouse suspicion the word came back that the procedures were far from painless even legendary tough guys had ended up wishing theyd never invited the doctors to mess with them the process had been so agonizing and of course once you began if you didnt like what you saw you had to let burrows make some more fixes wounds on wounds pain on pain but todd wasnt discouraged by the news in fact in a curious way it made the idea of undergoing the procedures more palatable to him playing as it did both into his machismo side and a deep unexplored vein of masochism besides was there any pain on gods green earth as agonizing as reading daily variety and finding that once again you werent in its pages that other actorsnames sometimes youd never heard ofwere getting the scripts the parts and the deals that would once have dropped into your lap as a matter of course there was no pain as sharp or as deep as the news of somebody elses success if it was an actor older than himself that was bad enough but if it was a contemporaryor worse somebody younger somebody prettierit made him so crazy hed have to go pop a tranquilizer or three to stop himself getting morose and foultempered and even the happy pills didnt work the way they had in the old days hed taken too many his body was too used to them so what to do what to do should he sit on his slowlyexpanding ass and start to avoid the mirror or take the bull by the horns and get an appointment with doctor burrows he remained undecided for about a week and then one evening sitting at home alone nursing a drink and flipping the channels of his sixtyinch tv he came upon a segment from the telecast of last years oscar ceremony a young actor whom he knew for a fact was not one of the smartest bunnies in town was receiving his third oscar of the night for a picture he hadat least according to the creditswritten directed and starred in the latter well there was no disputing that he was in every other frame of the damn picture backlit and golden he was playing a stuttering mentally unstable poor boy from the deep south a role which he claimed he had based on the life of his fathers brother who had died tragically at the hands of a lynch mob that had mistaken him for a rapist it was all perfect oscarfodder the ambitious young artist bucking the star system to tell a tale of the human spirit rooted in his own family history except that the truth was neither so moving nor so magical far from having been lynched the dead uncle was still very much alive having spent twentytwo years in jail for a rape that he did not to this day contest he had received a healthy payback from the studio that released the picture to stay conveniently quiet so that his story could be told the hollywood way leaving the golden boy with his tenthousandwatt smile to walk off with three oscars for his mantelpiece todd had it on good authority that his directorial skills extended no further than knowing where his winnebago was parked he wasnt the only one aspiring to snatch todds throne there were plenty of others chirpy little cocksuckers swarming out of the woodwork to play the king of hollywood when todd had yet to vacate the role well fuck em hed knock them off their stolen pedestals the sons of bitches hed have the limelight back in a heartbeatall that glory all that loveand theyd be back on the casting couch in a week with their fannies in the air so what if it cost him a few weeks of discomfort it would be worth it just to see the expressions on their pretty little faces when they realized theyd got greedy a decade too early contrary to recent opinions the king of the heartthrobs was not dead he was coming home and he was going to look like a million dollars four on the day todd had booked to see burrows for a first consultation he had to cancel at the last minute youre not going to believe my excuse he told the receptionist but i swear its the truth go on my dogs sick well thats not one we hear very often so gold star for originality the fact was that dempsey his mutt was not looking too good that morning hed got up to go out into the back yard for his morning piss and hed stumbled as though one of his legs was numb todd went down to see if he was okay he wasnt though he still put on a happy face for his boss his expression looked strangely dislocated as though he was having difficulty focusing on todd whats wrong with you boy todd went down on his haunches in front of the dog and stroked his ears dempsey growled appreciatively but he felt unsteady in todds arms as though at any moment he might keel over todd called maxine and told her hed be at the vets for the next few hours something wrong with that flatulent old dog of yours youll be flatulent when you get to his age todd said and yeah there is something wrong he keeps falling over hed had dempsey eleven years hed bought the dog as a pup just before hed started to shoot gunner as a consequence the dogs first real experience of life beyond his mothers teat was being carried around a movie studio by his owner and adored all of which he thereafter took as his godgiven right dempsey had been with todd on every set since the two were inseparable todd and dempsey dempsey and todd thanks to those early experiences of universal affection he was a confident dog afraid of nobody andunless somebody was afraid of himpredisposed to be friendly the vets name was doctor spenser an ebullient black woman whod been looking after dempsey since puppyhood she did a few tests and told todd that yes there were definitive signs that dempsey was having cognitive difficulties how old is he now hell be twelve next march oh thats rightwe didnt know his birthday so we said oscar night whats wrong boy doctor spenser said to dempsey ruffling him under the chin hes certainly not his usual happy self is he nope well id like to keep him in here for a few tests i brought a stool sample like you asked thanks todd produced a small tupperware container of dog poop well well have that analyzed you want the container back just kidding dont look so grim todd i dont like seeing him like this its probably a virus hes picked up well give him a few antibiotics and hell be good as new but theres something weird about his eyes look hes not even focusing on us dempsey had raised his head knowing full well he was being talked about but plainly he was having some difficulty fixing his gaze on whoever was doing the talking this couldnt just be old age could it i doubt it hes been a very healthy dog so far and its my experience that a mutt like dempsey is going to last a lot longer than some overbred hound you leave him with me check in with me at the end of the day todd did that the news was there was no news the stool sample had gone to the lab to be analyzed and meanwhile dempsey was looking weak perhaps a little disorientated but thered been no noticeable deterioration in his condition you can either take him home tonight or leave him here hell be perfectly fine here we dont actually have anybody monitoring the dogs from eleven pm till six in the morning but the chances of im going to come and collect him despite spensers reassurances that there had been no deterioration todd disagreed usually when he arrived at the vets after dempsey had stayed in for a couple of hours either for a shot or his sixmonth checkup he was greeted by the dog in crazy mode yapping his delight at seeing his boss again and ready to be out of the door before they could stick another damn needle in his backside but today when dempsey came round the corner it seemed to take a moment before the dog even realized it was his master at the door calling to him and when he came though some of his old enthusiasm returned he was a shadow of his former self doctor spenser had already gone offduty for the night todd asked if he could have her home number but there were some things it seemed even being todd pickett couldnt get you shes got kids to take care of the male nurse said she likes to keep this place and her homelife very separate but if theres an emergency id recommend going to the twentyfourhour animal hospital on sepulveda therell be doctors there all night if anything were to happen but honestly i think its some virus hes picked up out at the dog park and itll just take a course of antibiotics well can i take some antibiotics then todd said getting a little irritated with the casual way dempseys case was being treated doctor spenser doesnt want to give dempsey anything till shes got some results from the stool sample so im afraid therell be no drugs for dempsey until tomorrow dempsey didnt eat he just looked at the bowl of food marco had prepared for him and turned up his nose at it then he went to lie on the back step and stayed there for the rest of the evening in the middle of the night todd was woken by what sounded like the effects track from the exorcist a stomachwrenching series of mumblings and eruptions he switched on the bedroom light to find dempsey at the bottom of his bed standing in a pool of bright yellow puke he looked horribly ashamed of having made a mess and at first wouldnt come to todd to be petted but when he didand todd had his arms around the dogit was clear he was in a bad way dempseys whole body was cold and he was trembling violently come on mman he said were gonna take you to get some proper doctoring the noise had woken marco who got dressed to drive while todd held onto dempsey who was wrapped in his favorite comforter a quilt todds grandmother had made for her grandson the dog lay sprawled over todds knee all one hundred pounds of him while marco drove through the almost empty streets to sepulveda it was five minutes after five in the morning when they arrived at the animal hospital and there were just two people waiting with their pets to be helped even so it took twentyfive minutes before a doctor could be freed up to see dempsey during which time it seemed to todd that dempseys condition worsened his shaking became more violent than ever and in the midst of one of his spasms he convulsively shat brown gruel mostly on the floor but on todds leg and shoe too well now said the night doctor brightly what seems to be the trouble todd gave him an exhaustive rundown on the events of the last day he then asked todd to pick dempsey up and put him on the examination tablechoosing this particular instant to remark what a fan of todds he was as though todd could have given a damn at that moment then he examined the dog in a good and thorough manner but making asides throughout as to which movies of todds he and his wife had particularly enjoyed and which they hadnt after about five minutes of this seeing the expression of despair and anger on todds face marco quietly mentioned that mr pickett was really only interested right now in the health of his dog the doctors mouth tightened as though hed just been badly offended and his handling of dempsey seemed to become a little more brusque well you have a very sick dog he said at the end of the examination not even looking at todd but talking to marco he was plainly embarrassed by his earlier show of fanboy enthusiasm and was now overcompensating for it wildly todd went to sit on the examination table to cradle dempsey which put him right in the doctors line of sight look he said quietly im sorry if im not being quite as appreciative ofyour support of my pictures as i would normally be doc its nothing personal im sure we could have a great conversation about it under different circumstances but id like dempsey comfortable first hes sick and i want him better finally the doctor managed a little smile and when he spoke his voice had also quieted matching todds im going to put dempsey on a saline drip because hes obviously lost a lot of fluids in the last twelve to twentyfour hours that should make him feel a whole lot happier meanwhile you said dr spencer over at robertson vga was doing stool checks she said it could be a virus wellmaybe but looking at his eyes it seems more systemic to me if he were a younger dog id say parvo or heartworm which is a parasite but again we commonly see toxo in pound dogs or strays and im sure hes had his heartworm medications anyway well see from the stool results tomorrow wait wait youre saying it could be parvo or heartworm but you dont really think its either of these no so what do you think it is the doctor shook his head id say theres a better than fiftyfifty chance hes got some kind of tumor on the brain or on the brainstem and if he has well its like a human being you can sometimes fix these things at this juncture as though to demonstrate that things were not in a very fixable state right now dempsey started to shudder in todds arms his claws scrabbling against the metal table as he tried to stay upright its okay boy its okay the doctor went for a nurse and came back with an injection whats that for just to calm him down a little so he can get some sleep are you sure yes im sure its a mild tranquilizer if you dont want me to give it to the dog mr pickett yes yes give it to him the injection did indeed subdue dempseys little fit they wheeled him away into another room to be given an intravenous infusion leaving todd with the quilt damn dog he said now dempsey was out of earshot more trouble than hes worth tears very close why dont we get a cup of coffee marco suggested and we can talk to the doctor more when we get back there was a little donut shop in the minimall at the top of sepulveda and it had just opened they were the first customers of the day todd knew the instant he walked in that both the women serving recognized him so he turned round and walked out again rather than risking getting caught in a conversation marco brought out two coffees and two bear claws in greaseproof paper still warm from the oven though he hadnt thought he had an appetite the pastry was too good not to be eaten so he ate then coffee in hand they walked down to the hospital the eyes of the women in the donut shop glued to todd until he had disappeared from sight they said nothing as they walked the day was getting underway the traffic on sepulveda backing up as it waited to take its turn to get onto the freeway these were people with twohour commutes ahead of them before they got to their place of work people with jobs they hated houses they hated and a paycheck at the end of the month that wouldnt even cover the cost of the mortgage the car payments the insurance right now todd said id give my eye teeth to be one of them instead of having to go back in there i can go in for you no dempsey trusts me marco said i know but hes my dog five again there was no news dempsey had been hooked up to a saline drip and looked as though the tranquilizer had taken its effect he wasnt quite asleep but he was dazy well do an xray today and see how he looks the doctor said we should have the results back by the end of the day so why dont you two go home well keep dempsey here and see what we can do to get him well i want to stay well thats going to be very uncomfortable for you mr pickett we dont have a room we can put you in and frankly you both look as though you didnt get a full nights sleep dempseys mildly sedated and well probably keep him that way but its going to be six or seven hours before we get any answers for you we share our xray technician with our hospital in santa monica so she wont even be in to look at dempsey until eleven at the earliest i still want to stay youve got a bench out there youre not going to throw me out if i sit on that are you no of course not then thats where ill be the doctor looked at his watch ill be out of here in half an hour and the daydoctor doctor otis will be taking over dempseys case i will of course bring him up to speed with everything weve done so far and if she feels theres something else she wants to try shell know where to find me right the doctor gave up a wan smile his second and last of the night well i sincerely hope you have good news with dempsey and that by the time i come in again tonight youve both gone home happy todd would not be dissuaded from staying on the bench even though it was situated a few steps away from the front counter next to the soda machine and would leave him in full view of everyone who came through the next few hours marco said that he would come back with a thermos of good coffee and something to eat and left todd there the parade of the needy began early about two minutes after marco had gone a distraught woman came in saying that shed struck a cat with her car and the victim was now in her car alive but terrified and badly hurt two nurses went out with wellused pairs of leather gloves and a syringe of tranquilizer to subdue the victim they came back with a weeping woman and a corpse the animals panicked selfdefenses had apparently used up what little energies its broken body had possessed the woman was inconsolable she tried to thank the nurses for their help but all she could do was cry there were six more accidents that rush hour two of them fatalities todd watched all this in a dazed state lack of sleep was beginning to catch up with him every now and then his eyes would flicker closed for a few seconds and the scene in front of him would jump like a piece of film which had had a few seconds worth of action removed and then been spliced back together again people moved abruptly from one place to another one moment somebody was coming in the next they were engaged in conversation with one of the nurses the next theyd gone or they were on their way out much to his surprise nobody gave him more than a cursory glance perhaps they thought that cant possibly be todd pickett sitting on a brokendown old bench next to a broken down old soda machine in a twentyfourhour animal hospital or perhaps it was just that they saw him recognized him and didnt care they had other things to think about right now more pressing than the peculiar presence of a wearylooking movie star on a broken down bench they had a rat with an abscess a cat that had had six kittens but had got the seventh stuck a guinea pig in a shoe box that was dead when the box was opened a poodle that kept biting itself a problem with fleas a problem with mange two canaries that hated one another and so on and so forth marco came back with coffee and sandwiches todd drank some coffee which perked him up he went to the front desk and asked not for the first time to see the daydoctor this time he got lucky doctor otis a pale and slight young woman who looked no more than eighteen and refused to look todd in the face appeared and said that there was nothing to report except that dempsey would be going for xrays in about half an hour and they would be available for viewing tomorrow at this point todd lost his temper it happened rarely but when it did it was an impressive spectacle his neck became blotchyred and the muscles of his face churned his eyes went to icewater i brought my dog in here at five oclock this morning ive been waiting heresitting on that benchthat bench right there you see it do you see that bench yes i thats where ive been since six oclock it is now almost eleven oclock ive asked on several occasions for you to have the common decency to come out and tell me whats happening to my dog always politely and ive been told over and over again that youre very busy its been a crazy morning mr pickett is my name well mr pickett im afraid i cant stop right there dont say you cant get the xrays until tomorrow because you can you will i want my dog looked after and if you wont do it ill take him some place where he can be taken care of and ill make sure every damn newspaper in the state of california at this moment an older woman obviously the hospital manager stepped into view and took todds hand shaking it mr pickett my names cordelia simpson its all right andrea ill take care of mr pickett from here the young woman doctor retreated she was two shades whiter than shed been at the beginning of the conversation i heard most of what you were telling andrea look im sorry thats not my style i dont like losing my temper but no its okay i understand youre tired and youre concerned about dempsey dempsey right i was told hed be xrayed today and wed have the results back this afternoon well the speed of these things all depends on the volume of work mr pickett cordelia said she was english and had the face and manner of a woman who would not be pleasant if she were riled but was doing her best right now to put on a gentler face i read a piece about you in the la times last year you were on the cover with dempsey as i remember clearly youre very close to your dog heres what im going to do she consulted her watch dempsey is being seen by the radiographer right now and i guarantee that well have the results back bysix it might be earlier but i think six we can guarantee so how long before i can take him home you want to take him now yes youll find him rather dopey im not sure he could walk i can carry him cordelia nodded she knew an immovable object when she saw one well ill have one of the nurses come fetch you when hes ready is that his she pointed to the quilt on the bench quite unconsciously todd had been nursing it while he waited no wonder people had kept their distance yes do you want me to have him wrapped up in it thank you cordelia picked up the quilt and my apologies mr pickett for any difficulties you may have had our doctors are horribly overworked and im afraid to say often people who are wonderful with animals arent always terribly good with human beings ten minutes later a burly latino appeared with a sleepyeyed dempsey wrapped in his quilt his ears pricked up just a little at the sight of todd enough for todd to know that his holding the dog and whispering to him meant something were going home old guy todd murmured to him as he carried him down the steps into the street and round to the little parking lot behind the building where marco was backing out the car i know you didnt like it in there all those people you didnt know with needles and shit well fuck them he put his nose into the cushion of baby fur behind dempseys ear which always smelled sweetest were going home for the next few hours dempsey slept in the quilt which todd had put on his big bed todd stayed beside him though the need for sleep caught up with him several times and hed slide away into a few minutes of dreamland fragments of things hed seen from his bench in the waiting room mostly the box containing the dead guinea pig that absurd poodle nipping its own backside bloody all just pieces of the day coming and going then hed wake and stroke dempsey for a little while talk to him tell him everything was going to be okay there was a sudden rally in dempseys energies about four oclock which was when he was usually fed so todd had marco prepare a sickbed version of his usual meal with chicken instead of the chopped horseflesh or whatever the hell it was in the cans and some good gravy dempsey ate it all though he had to be held up to do so since his legs were unreliable he then drank a full bowl of water good good todd said dempsey attempted to wag his tail but it had no more power in it than his legs had todd carried him outside so he could shit and piss a slight drizzle was coming down not cool but refreshing he held onto the dog waiting for the urge to take dempsey and he turned his face up to the rain offering a quiet little prayer please dont take him from me hes just a smelly old dog you dont need him and i do do you hear me pleasehear me dont take him he looked back at dempsey to find that the dog was looking back at him apparently paying attention to every word his ears were halfpricked his eyes halfopen do you think anyones listening todd said by way of reply dempsey looked away from him his head bobbing uneasily on his neck then he made a nasty sound deep in his belly and his whole body convulsed todd had never seen the term projectile vomit displayed with such force a stream of chewed chicken dog mix and water squirted out as soon as it stopped the dog began to make little whining sounds then ten seconds later dempsey repeated the whole spectacle until every piece of nourishment and every drop of water hed been given had been comprehensively ejected after the second burst of vomiting he didnt even have the strength to whine todd wrapped the quilt around him and carried him back into the house he had marco bring some towels and dried him off where the rain had caught him i dont suppose you care whats been going on all day do you marco said anything important great foreign numbers on gallows particularly in france huge hit in france apparently maxine wants to know if youd like to do a piece about dempseys health crisis for one of the womans magazines no thats what i told her she said theyd eat it up but i said no fuck will these people never stop no you got a call from walter at dreamworks about some charity thing hes arranging i told him youd be back in circulation tomorrow thats the phone yeah it is marco went to the nearest phone which was in the master bathroom while todd went back to finish drying the dog its andrea otis from the hospital i think its the nervous young woman you saw this morning stay with him todd said to marco he went into the bathroom which was cold picked up the phone mr pickett yes first i want to say i owe you an apology for this morning no thats fine i knew who you were and that threw me off dempsey a little im sorry dempsey yes well weve got the xray results back andim afraid the news isnt very good why not whats wrong with him he is riddled with cancer todd took a long moment to digest this unwelcome news then he said thats impossible its in his spine its in his colon but that cant be and its now spreading to his brain which is why weve only just discovered it these motor and perception problems hes having are all part of the same thing the tumors spreading into his skull and pushing on his brain oh god soi dont know what you want to do i want this not to be happening well yes but im afraid it is how long has he got his present condition is really as good as things are going to get for him she spoke as though she was reading the words from an idiotboard careful to leave exactly the same amount of space between each one all that is really at issue is how quickly dempsey becomes incapacitated todd looked through the open door at the pitiful shape shuddering beneath the quilt it was obvious that dempsey had already reached that point todd could be absurdly optimistic at times but this wasnt one of them is he in pain he asked the doctor well id say its not so much pain were dealing with as anxiety he doesnt know whats happening to him and he doesnt know why its happening hes just suffering mr pickett and its just going to get worse so youre saying i should have him put down its not my place to tell you what to do with your dog mr pickett but if he was your dog if he was my dog and i loved him as you obviously love dempsey i wouldnt want him sufferingmr pickett are you there here todd said trying to keep the sound of tears out of his voice so really its up to you todd looked at dempsey again who was making a mournful sound in his sleep if i bring him back over to the hospital yes would there be somebody there to put him to sleep yes of course ill be here then thats what i want to do im so very sorry mr pickett its not your fault dempsey roused himself a little when todd went back to bed but it was barely more than a sniff and a halfhearted wag come on you he said wrapping dempsey tightly in the quilt and lifting him up the sooner this is done the sooner youre not an unhappy hound will you drive marco it was fourthirty in the afternoon and though the drizzle had ceased die traffic was still horrendous it took them fiftyfive minutes to get down to the hospital but this timeperhaps to make up for her unavailability the last time hed been theredoctor otis was at the counter waiting for him she opened the side door to let him into die nonpublic area you want me to come in boss marco asked nah its okay well be fine he looks really out of it the doctor remarked dempsey had barely opened his eyes at the sound of todds voice you know i realize this may seem like a strange thing to say but in a way were lucky that this caught him so fast with some dogs it takes weeks and months in here todd said yes the doctor had opened a door into a room not more than eight by eight painted in what was intended to be a soothing green on one wall was a monet reproduction and on another a piece of poetry that todd couldnt read through his assembling tears ill just give you two some time doctor otis said ill be back in a few minutes todd sat down with dempsey in his arms damn he said softly this isnt fair dempsey had opened his eyes fully for the first time in several hours probably because hed heard the sound of todd crying which had always made him very attentive even if the crying was fake todd could be rehearsing a sad scene from a picture memorizing lines and as soon as the first note of sadness crept into his voice dempsey would be there his paws on todds knees ready to give comfort but this time the animal didnt have the strength to help make the boss feel better all he could do was stare up at todd with a slight look of puzzlement on his face oh god i hope im doing the right thing i wish you could just tell me that this is what you want todd kissed the dog tears falling in dempseys fur i know if i was you i wouldnt want to be shitting everywhere and not able to stand up thats no life huh he buried his face in the smell of the animal for eleven yearswhether todd had had female company or notdempsey had slept on his bed and more often than not been the one to wake him up pressing his cold nose against todds face rubbing his neck on todds chest i love you dog he said and i want you to be there when i get to heaven okay i want you to be keeping a place for me will you do that will you keep a place for me there was a discreet knock on the door and todds stomach turned times up buddy he said kissing dempseys burning hot snout even now he thought i could say no i dont want you to do this he could take dempsey home for one more night in the big bed but that was just selfishness the dog had had enough that was plain he could barely raise his head it was time to go come in he said the doctor came in meeting todds gaze for the first time i know how hard this is she said i have dogs myself all mutts like dempsey dempsey did you hear that todd said the tears refusing to abate she called you a mutt theyre the best yeah they are are you ready todd nodded at which point she instantly transferred her loving attention to the dog she lifted dempsey out from todds arms and put him on the steel table in the corner of the room talking to him all the while hey there dempsey this isnt going to hurt at all just a little prick she pulled a syringe out of her pocket and exposed the needle at the back of todds head that same irrational voice was screaming tell her no knock it out of her hand quickly quickly he pushed the thoughts away wiping the tears from his eyes with the back of his hand because he didnt want to be blinded by them when this happened he wanted to see it all even if it hurt like a knife he owed that to dempsey he put his hand on dempseys neck and rubbed his favorite place the syringe went into dempseys leg he made a tiny little grunt of complaint good boy doctor otis said there that wasnt so bad now was it todd kept rubbing dempseys neck the doctor put the top back on the syringe and pocketed it its all right she said you can stop rubbing hes gone so quickly todd cleared away another wave of tears and looked down at the body on the table dempseys eye was still halfopen but it didnt look back at him any longer where thered been a sliver of bright life where thered been mischief and shared ritualswhere in short thered been dempseythere was nothing im very sorry mr pickett the doctor said im sure you loved him very much and speaking as a doctor i know you did the right thing for him todd sniffed hard and reached over to pluck a clump of paper handkerchiefs from the box what does that say he said pointing to the framed poster on the wall his tears made it incomprehensible its a quote by robert louis stevenson andrea said you know who wrote treasure island yeah i know it says do you think dogs will not be in heaven i tell you they will be there long before any of us six he waited until he got home and hed governed his tears to make arrangements for dempseys cremation he left a message with a firm that was recommended by the animal hospital for their discreet handling of these matters they would pick dempseys body up from the hospital mortuary cremate him and transfer his ashes guaranteeing that there was no mingling of cremainsas they described thembut that the ashes they delivered to the owner would be those of their pet in other words they werent putting canaries parrots rats dogs and guineapigs in the oven for one big bonfire and dividing up the cremains in what looked to be the appropriate amounts he also called his accountant at home and made arrangements for a ten thousand dollar donation to the hospital the only attendant request being that five hundred of that money be spent on putting in a more comfortable bench for people to sit on while they waited he slept very well with the aid of several ambien and a large scotch until about four thirty in the morning when he woke up and felt dempsey moving around at the bottom of the bed the drugs made his thought processes muddy it took him a few seconds of leaning over and putting the coverlet at the bottom of the bed to bring his consciousness up to speed dempsey wasnt there yet hed felt the dog he would have sworn to it on a stack of bibles getting up and walking around and around on the same spot padding down the bed until it was comfortable for him he lay back on the pillow and drifted back to sleep but it wasnt a healthy sleep thereafter he kept halfwaking and staring down at the darkness of the bottom of the bed wondering if dempsey was a ghost now and would haunt his heels until the dog had the sense to go on his way to heaven he slept in until ten when marco brought him the phone with a woman called rosalie from the pet cremation service she was pleasant in her nononsense way no doubt she often had people in near hysteria at the other end of the telephone so a little professional distance was necessary she had already been in contact with the hospital this morning she said and they had informed her that dempsey had a collar and quilt with him did todd want these items returned or were they to be cremated with his pet they were his todd said so they should go with him fine said rosalie then the only other question is the matter of the urn we have three varieties just the best youve got that would be our bronze grecian style that sounds fine all i need now is your credit card number ill pass you back to my assistant he can help you with all that just one other question yes are youthe todd pickett yes of course he was the real todd pickett but he didnt feel like the real thing more like a badly bruised lookalike things like this didnt happen to the real todd pickett he had a way with life that always made it show the bright side he went back to sleep until noon then got up and ate some lunch his body aching as though he was catching a heavy dose of the flu his food unfinished he sat in the breakfast nook staring blankly at the potted plants artfully arranged on the patio plants hed never persuaded dempsey not to cock his leg against every time he passed im going back to bed he told marco you dont want to put a holding call into maxine shes called nine times this morning she says she has news about a foreign buyer for warrior did you tell her what happened to dempsey yes what did she say she said oh then she went back to talking about the buyer todd sighed defeated by the womans incomprehension maybe its time i got out of this fucking business he said to marco i dont have the balls for it any longer or the energy marco put up no protest at this he hated everything about the business except todd and always had why dont we go down to key west like we always promised ourselves open a bar get fat and drunk and die of heart attacks at fifty youre feeling morbid right now a little well it wont last forever and one of these days well have to honour dempsey and get another dog that wouldnt be honouring him thatd be replacing him and he was irreplaceable you know why why because he was there when i was nobody you were pups together this got a smile out of todd the first in fortyeight hours yeah he said his voice close to breaking again we were pups together he tried to hold back the tears but they came anyway what is wrong with me he said he was a dog i meancome on tell me honestly do you think tom cruise cries for a day if one of his dogs dies i dont think hes got dogs or brad pitt i dont know ask em next time you see em ask em oh sure thats going to make a dandy little scene todd pickett and brad pitt tell me brad when your dog died did you wail like a girl for two days now it was marco who laughed wail like a girl thats how i feel i feel like im in the middle of some stupid weepie maybe you should call wilhemina over and fuck her wilhemina doesnt do fucks she does lovemaking with candles and a lot of washclothes i swear she drinks im going to give her something fleas yeah fleas you know as a last act of rebellion on behalf of dempsey and myself id like to give fleas to wilhemina maxine and gary eppstadt both men were laughing now curing the hurt the only way it could be cured by being included in the nature of things speaking of inclusion he got a call from his mother about six oclock she was at home in cambridge massachusetts but sounded ready to jump the first plane and come visit she was in one of her ive a funny feeling moods whats going on nothing yes there is she was inevitably right she could predict with startling accuracy the times she needed to call her famous son and the times when she should keep her distance sometimes he could lie to her and get away with it but today wasnt one of those days what was the point dempseys dead that old mutt of yours he was not an old mutt and if you talk about him like that then this conversation ends right here how old was he patricia asked eleven going on twelve thats a decent age not for a dog like him what kind of dog would that be you know a mutt mutts always live longer than thoroughbreds thats a fact of life well mine didnt too much rich food you used to spoil that dog is there anything else you want besides lecturing me about how i killed my dog with kindness no i was just wanting to chat but obviously youre in no mood to chat i loved dempsey mom you understand what im saying if you dont mind me observing something could i stop you its sad that the only serious relationship youve had is with a dog its time you grew up todd youre not getting any younger you know you think about the way your father aged i dont want to talk about this right now okay listen to me mom i dont youve got his genes so listen for once will you he was a goodlooking man your father till he was about thirtyfour thirtyfive now granted he didnt take care of himself and you doi mean he smoked and he drank a lot more than was good for him but his looks went practically overnight overnight thats is ridiculous nobodys looks go all right it wasnt overnight but i was there i saw believe me it was quick five six months and all his looks had gone even though this was an absurd exaggeration there was an element of truth in what patricia pickett was saying todds father had indeed lost his looks with remarkable speed it would not have been the kind of thing a son would have noticed necessarily but todd had a second pointofview on his fathers sudden deterioration his best friend danny had been raised by a single mother whod several times made her feelings for merrick pickett known to her son the rumors had reached todd of course indeed theyd become practically weekly reports as dannys mothers plans to seduce the unwitting subject of her desires were laid and relaid all this came back to todd as his mother went on chatting eventually he said mom ive got to go ive got to make some decisions about the cremation oh lord i hope youre keeping this quiet the media would have a party with this you and your dog well all the more reason for you to clam up about it he warned if anybody calls saying they want a quote i know nothing you know nothing i know the routine by now honey dont worry your secrets safe with me dont even tell the neighbours fine i wont bye mom im sorry about brewster dempsey whatever it was true when todd gave the subject some serious thought merrick pickett had indeed lost his looks with startling speed one day hed been the best looking insurance agent in the city of cincinnati the next dannys mother wouldnt look twice at him suppose this was hereditary suppose fifty percent of it was hereditary he called eppstadts office it took the sonofabitch fortyeight minutes to return the call and when he did his manner was brusque i hope this isnt about warrior it isnt were not going to do it todd i get it gary is your assistant listening in on this conversation no what do you want when we had lunch you recommended a guy whod done some work for a few famous names bruce burrows how do i get hold of him hes not in the book dont worry ill hook you up thanks youre making a good call todd i hope we can get back in business as soon as youre healed once he had the number todd didnt leave himself further room for hesitation he called burrows booked the consultation and tentatively chatted over some dates for the operation there was one of piece outstanding business before he could move on the disposal of dempseys ashes despite the reassurances of robert louis stevenson todd did not have any clear idea as to the permanence of any soul whether animal or human he only knew that he wanted dempseys mortal remains to be placed where the dog had been most happy there was no doubt about where that was the backyard of the bel air house which had been since his puppyhood dempseys unchallenged territory his stalking ground his schoolyard when it came to learning new tricks and it was there the evening before todd put himself into the hands of bruce burrows that he took the bronzed plastic urn provided by the cremation company out into the yard the urn contained a plastic bag which in turn contained dempseys ashes there were a lot of them but then hed been a big dog todd sat down in the middle of the yard where he and dempsey had so often sat and watched the sky together and poured some of the ashes into the palm of his hand what part of this grey sand was his tail he wondered and which his snout which part the place behind his ear hed love you forever if you rubbed or didnt it matter was that the point about scattering ashes that in the end they looked the same not just the snout and the tail but a dogs ashes and a mans ashes all reducible with the addition of a little flame to this mottled dust he put his lips to it once to kiss him goodbye in his head he could hear his mother telling him that it was a gross unhealthy thing to do so he kissed them again just to spite her then he stood up and cast dempseys ashes around like a farmer sewing seeds there was no wind the ash fell where he threw it evenly distributed over the mutts dominion see you dog he said and went back into the house to get himself a large bourbon part three a darker time one for four months in the summer of his seventeenth year todd had worked at the sunset home for the elderly on the outskirts of orlando where hed got a job through his uncle frank who worked as an accountant for sunset homes incorporated the place was little more than a repository for the nearlydead working there had been the most depressing experience of his young life most of his duties did not involve the patientshe had no training as a nurse nor intended to get any but the care of one of the older occupants a man by the name of duncan mcfarlane was given over to him because mcfarlane was prone to unruliness when he was being bathed by the female nurses mcfarlane was no great trouble to todd he was just a sour sonofabitch who wasnt going to make anybodys life one jot easier if he could possibly avoid it the ritual of giving a bedbath to his patient was todds particular horror the sight of his own body awoke a profound selfdisgust in the old man asking around todd had discovered that mcfarlane had been an athlete in his prime but nowat the age of eightythreethere was no trace of the strength or the beauty his body had once possessed he was a pallid sack of shit and resentment revolted by the sight of himself look at me he would say when todd uncovered him christ look at me christ look at me every time it was the same murmured horror look at me christ look at me to this day the image of mcfarlanes nakedness remained with todd in all its grotesque particulars the little beard of dirty white hair that hung from the old mans scrotum the constellation of heavy dark warts above his left nipple the wrinkled folds of pale spotted flesh that hung under his arms todd felt guilty about his disgust and kept it to himself until one day it had been the subject of discussion in the dayroom and hed discovered that his feelings were shared especially by the male members of the nursing staff the female nurses seemed to have more compassion perhaps or were simply indifferent to the facts of creeping senility but the other men on the staffthere were four of them besides toddwere afterwards constantly remarking on the foulness of their charges one of the quarteta black guy from new orleans called austin harperwas particularly eloquent on the subject i aint endin up like any o these ol fucks he remarked on more than one occasion id blow my fuckin brains out fore id sink that fuckin low it wont happen todd had said howd you reckon that white boy austin had said hed patted todd on his backside which he took every possible opportunity to do when were as old as these folks therell be ways to fix it todd replied you mean well live forever bullshit i dont buy any of that sciencefiction crap boy im not saying well live forever but theyll have figured out what gives us wrinkles and theyll have a way to smooth them out will they now so yous goin to be all smoothed out is you i sure as hell am youll still die but youll die all smoothed out an pretty he tapped todds ass appreciatively again will you quit doin that todd said ill quit when you quit wavin it in my nose austin laughed and slapped todds ass a third time a stinging swat anyways todd said i dont give a shit what you think im going to die pretty the phrase had lingered to die pretty that was the grand ambition to die pretty and not find yourself like poor old duncan mcfarlane looking down at his own nakedness and saying over and over oh christ look at me oh christ look at me oh christ two months after todd had left florida to go to los angeles for a screentest hed got a scrawled note from austin harper whogiven that it was more or less certain that theyd never see one another again figured it was okay for todd to know that if austin had had a chance he would have plowed todds ass all the way to key west and back and then youd be all smoothed out baby harper had written oh and by the way hed added that old fuck mcfarlane died a week ago tried to give himself a bath in the middle of the night drowned himself in three inches of water thats what i call a damn fool thing to do stay smooth mman youre going to do great i know it just remember to thank me when they gives you an oscar two kiddo todd was floating in a blind black place his body untethered he couldnt even feel it kiddo can you hear me despite the darkness all around it was a comfortable place to be in there were no predators here in this nomansland there were no sharks circling wanting tenpercent of his flesh todd felt pleasantly removed from everything except for that voice calling him kiddo if you can hear me move your finger it was a trick he knew it was a way to get him to go back to the world where once hed lived and breathed and been unhappy but he didnt want to go it was too brittle that place brittle and bright he wanted to stay where he was here in the darkness floating and floating kiddoits donnie donnie wait that couldnt be right his older brother donnie they hadnt talked in months why would he be here trying to seduce him out of his comfortable hideaway but then if not donnie then who nobody else ever called him kiddo todd felt a dim murmur of anxiety donnie lived in texas for gods sake what was he doing here talk to me kiddo very reluctantly todd forced himself to reply to the summons though when he finally coaxed his lips to shape it the sound he made was as remote as the moon donnie well howdy i must say its good to have you back in the land of the livin he felt a hand laid on his arm the sensation like donnies voice and his own felt distant and dulled you had us a bit stirred up for a while there whysitso dark in here todd said will you have someone turn on the lights everythings going to be okay buddy donnie please turn on the lights they are on kiddo its just youve got some bandages over your face thats all it is youre going to be just fine bandages on his face now it all started to come back to him his last memories hed been going under burrowss knife for the big operation the last thing he remembered was burrows telling him to count backwards from ten burrows had been smiling reassuringly at him and as todd countedhad thought i wonder how much work hes had done on that face of his the nose for sure and all the lines gone from around his eyes are you counting todd burrows had said ten nine eight there hadnt been a seven not that todd could remember the drugs had swept him off to their own empty version of lala land but now he was back from that dreamless place and donnie was here at his bedside all the way from texas why and why the bandages over his eyes burrows hadnt said anything about bandages my mouths so dry todd whispered no problemo buddy donnie replied gently ill get the nurse in here ill have a vodkastraight up donnie chuckled ill see what i can do todd heard him get up and go to the door and call for a nurse his consciousness wavered and he felt himself slipping back into the void from which hed just been brought by donnies voice the prospect of that lush darkness didnt seem quite as comforting as it had a few moments before he started to panic scrambling to keep hold of the world at least until he knew what had happened to him he called out to donnie where are you donnie are you there footsteps came hurriedly back in his direction im still here kiddo donnies voice was tender todd couldnt remember ever hearing such tenderness in it before now burrows didnt tell me itd be like this todd said theres nothing to get worked up about donnie replied even in his semidrugged state todd knew a lie when he heard one youre not a very good actor he said runs in the family donnie quipped and squeezed todds arm again just kidding yeahyeah todd said as he spoke a spasm of pain ran from the bridge of his nose and spread across his face in both directions he was suddenly in excruciating agony jesus he gasped jesus make it stop he felt donnies reassuring hand go from his arm heard his brother crossing to the door again yelling as he went his voice suddenly shrill with fear will somebody get in here right now christ todds panic momentarily soothed by his brothers voice started to rise up in him again he raised his hand to his face the bandages were tight and smooth like a visor over his head searing him in he started to hyperventilate he was going to die in here if he didnt get this smothering stuff off his face he began to claw at the bandages he needed air right now air for christs sake air mr pickett dont do that please the nurse caught hold of todds hands but the panic and the pain made him strong and she couldnt prevent him from digging his fingers beneath the bandages and pulling there were flashes of light in his head but he knew it wasnt the light of the outside world he was seeing his brain was overloading fear was leaping like lightning across his skull his blood roared in his ears his body thrashed around in the bed as though he was in the grip of a seizure all right nurse ive got him now suddenly there were hands around his wrists somebody stronger than the nurse was gently but insistently pulling his fingers away from his face then a voice came to find him through the sound of his own sobs todd this is doctor burrows everything is fine but please calm down let me explain whats going on theres nothing to worry about he spoke like a hypnotist the cadence of his sentences even his voice completely calm and while he went on speaking repeating the same informationthat everything was fine all todd had to do was breathe deeply deeplyhe held todds arms against the bed after a few moments the bright bursts of light began to become less frequent the din of blood began to recede so by degrees did the waves of panic there doctor burrows said when the worst of it was over you see everythings fine and dandy now why dont we get you a fresh pillow nurse karyn would you please get mr pickett a nice fresh pillow oh so gently burrows raised the upper half of todds body off the bed talking to him all the while the same calming monologue all the strength to resist indeed all need to do so had gone out of todd all he could do was abandon himself to burrows care finally he said whatswrongwith me first lets get you comfortable burrows replied then well talk it all through todd felt the motion of the nurse as she slipped the fresh pillow into place behind him then with the same tenderness as he used to lift him up burrows carefully lowered todd back down upon the pillow there isnt that better burrows said finally letting his patient go todd felt a pang of separation like a child whod been abruptly deserted im going to let you rest for a while burrows went on and when youve slept well talk properly no todd said your brother dons here with you im here todd i want to talk now todd said not later now donnie make him stay its okay kiddo donnie said with just the right edge of threat doctor bs not goin anywhere answer his question doc well first things first burrows said theres absolutely nothing wrong with your eyes if thats what youre worried about we just have to keep the dressings in place around your eyesockets you didnt tell me id be waking up in the dark todd said no burrows replied thats because the procedure didnt go quite as we planned but every operation is a little different as youll remember i explained to you im sorry i wasnt here when you woke now that he was calmer todd began to recall some of the things about burrows that had irritated him one of them was that voice of his that fake basso profundo that was a practiced attempt to conceal his queeniness and to match his voice to the heroic proportions of his body an artificial body of course the man was a walking advertisement for his craft he was fiftyfive at least but he had the skin of a baby the arms and the chest of a bodybuilder and the waspwaist of a showgirl just tell me the truth todd said to him did something go wrong im a big boy i can take it there was a pindrop silence todd waited finally burrows said we had a few minor complications with your procedure thats all ive explained it all to your brother donald theres nothingabsolutely nothingfor you to be concerned about its just going to take a little more time than wed what kind of complications we dont need to go into that now todd yes we do todd said its my face for fucks sake tell me whats going on and dont screw around with me i dont like it tell him doc donnie said quietly but firmly todd heard burrows sigh then that studied voice again youll remember that during the preparation evaluation i did warn you that on occasion there were reactions to chemical peels which could not be predicted and im afraid thats what happened in your case youve had an extreme and as i say completely unpredictable allergic response to the peel i dont believe for one moment theres going to be any significant damage in the long term youre a healthy young man were going to see some swift epidermal regeneration what the fucks that your skins gonna grow back donnie replied his texan drawl turning the remark into a piece of cold comedy what do you mean todd said the effect of the procedure we useas i explained in our evaluation and is fully described in the literature i gave you i didnt read it todd said i trusted you the procedures we use may be likened to a very controlled chemical burn which produces changes in the dermis and the epidermis damaged or blemished skin is removed and after fortyeight hours at the most new healthy skin is naturally generated which has pleasing characteristics the client regains a youthful this time it was donnie who interrupted burrows molassic flow tell him the rest donnie said his voice thick with anger if you dont tell him i will donnie went on he didnt give burrows a chance to make the choice youve been out of it since you had the operation kiddo in a coma for three days thats why they sent for me they were getting worried i tried to have you moved to a proper hospital but that bitch of a managermaxine is itshe wouldnt let me she said youd want to stay here said she was afraid the press would find out if you were transferred were perfectly capable of looking after mr pickett here burrows said there isnt a hospital in california that could give him better care yeah well maybe donnie said seems to me hed still be better off in cedar sinai i really resent the implication burrows began will you just shut the fuck up donnie said wearily i dont give a monkeys ass what you resent all i care about is getting my brother properly fixed up and out of here and as i say yeah as you say tell you what why dont you and nurse karyn there step out for a few minutes and let me have a private word with my brother burrows didnt attempt any further selfjustification and todd knew why he could imagine donnies expression in perfect detail both brothers got colour in their faces when they were riled up and a cold eye burrows duly retreated which was the wisest thing he could have done i want to get you out of here kiddo donnie said as soon as they had gone i dont trust these people as far as i could throw em theyre full of shit i need to talk to maxine before we do anything what the fuck for i dont trust her anymore than i trust these sons of bitches there was a long silence todd knew what was coming next so he just waited for it just so you know donnie said youve done some damnfool things in your life but this whole deal is the stupidest idea i ever heard getting yourself a fuckin facelift what kinda thing is that christ does momma know about this no i put you down as next of kin i thought youd understand well i cant say i do its a mess its a goddam mess and ive got to go back to texas tomorrow why so soon because ive got a court appearance at eight oclock on thursday morning lindas tryin to take away my weekends with donnie junior and if im not in court her lawyers going to get the judge to rule against me ive been up before him a couple of times and he doesnt like me so im going to have to love you and leave you which i dont much like doin i guess i could call momma and no no donnie please i dont want her here todd reached out blind caught hold of donnies arm ill be okay you dont have to worry about me ill be just fine all right i hear you i wont call momma besides the worsts over im sure thats right but listen to me you get yourself the hell out of here and go to a proper hospital i dont want the press finding out about this if maxine thinks have you heard a fuckin word i said donnie said his voice getting louder i dont trust that bitch shes out for herself thats all she cares about her piece of the action dont start shouting well what the fuck do you expect ive been sitting here for seventytwo hours straight wondering how i was going to tell mom that you died having plastic fucking surgery on your fucking face he paused for a breath christ if dad was alivehed be so damned ashamed okay donnie i get the message im a fuckup youre surrounded by so many asskissers youre not getting good advice it makes me wanna puke i mean these people theyre all puttin on some showtellin me this tellin me thatand meanwhile youre lying there at deaths door and will they give you a straight answer will they fuck he paused to draw sufficient breath to launch in afresh what happened to you kiddo ten years ago you would have laughed your butt off at the thought of getting a facelift todd let go of donnies arm he drew a deep sorrowful breath its hard to explain he said but i got to stay on top of the heap somehow younger guys keep coming along so let em why do you need to stay on top why not walk away from it youve had a good run for christs sake youve had it all id say all and more i mean fuck what more do you want why do this to yourself because i like the life donnie i like the fame i like the money donnie snorted how much more money do you damn well need youve got more than you can spend if you dont tell me what ive got and i havent got you dont know what it costs to live houses and taxes he stopped his defense took a different track anyhow i dont hear you complaining wait donnie said knowing what was coming but todd wasnt about to be stopped when i send you money dont start that why not you sit there tellin me what a fuckup i am but you never said no to the cash when you needed it which is all the time who paid your last legal bills donnie and the mortgage on the house so you could start over with linda for the third time or fourth time or whatever it was who paid for that mistake he let the question hang there unanswered eventually very quietly donnie said this is so fucked i came here to see whether i was dead or alive to look after you you never cared before todd said with painful bluntness well did you all these years when have you ever come out here and spent time with me i was never welcome you were always welcome you just never came because you were too fucking jealous why dont you admit it at least once between us say it you were so fucking jealous you couldnt stand the idea of coming out here you know what i dont need to hear this donnie said you should have heard it years ago im outta here go on you did your gloating now you can go home and tell everyone what an asshole your brother is im not going to do that donnie said youre still my brother whatever you do but i cant help you if you surround yourself with asskissers yeah you said that todd heard donnie get up and cross to the door dragging his feet as he always had what are you doing todd said im leaving like i said i would youre going to be fine that faggot burrows will take very good care of you dont i get a hug or something another time when i like you better donnie said and when the hell will that be todd yelled after him but all he got by way of reply was the echo of his own voice off the opposite wall three maxine turned up a little after seven and after a few perfunctory expressions of relief that todd was back from the dead as she indelicately put it quickly moved on to the news she was here to debate somebody in this place has a big mouth she said i got a call from the editor of the enquirer this afternoon asking if it was true that youd been admitted to a private hospital i told him absolutely not this was a lie garbage etc etc and i said that if he published that you were in hospital or anything vaguely resembling that wed sue him and his wretched rag ten seconds later ive got peter bart calling from variety asking the same damn question and while im on with peter trying not to tell him an outandout lie cause he has a nose for bullshit i have a call from people on the other line asking the same question coincidence i dont think so todd moaned behind his mask of bandages ive told burrows we have to move you maxine went on wait donnie said yesterday you told him that you wanted me to stay here that was before i got the calls now its just a matter of time before some photographer finds his way in here shit shit shit that would make a nice little picture wouldnt it maxine said just in case todd hadnt already got a snapshot in his minds eye you lying in bed with your face all bandaged up wait todd said theyd never be able to prove it was me the point is it is you todd whoevers put out the word about your being here is working in this building theyve probably got access to your records your charts todd felt a spasm of the same panic that had seized him when hed first woken up the horror of being trapped this time he governed it determined not to let maxine see him losing control so when are you getting me out of here he said ive got a car coming at five tomorrow morning ive told burrows i want the security in this place tripled til you leave well take you to the beach house in malibu until we find somewhere more practical i cant go home todd said knowing even as he floated the idea that it was out of the question that would be the first place the journalists and the paparazzi would come looking for him maybe we should fly you out of state when youre feeling a little better ill call john see if i can get him to fly you up to montana i dont want to go to montana youd be a lot more secure up there than here we could arrange for roundtheclock nursing i said no i dont want to be that far away from everything all right well find some place here in the city what about your new ladyfriend miss bosch shes going to be asking questions too what do you want me to tell her shes gone shes shooting something in the cayman islands she was fired maxine said creative differences apparently the director wanted her to show her tits and she said no though god knows some of her runway work has left little to the imagination i dont know why shes got coy all of a sudden anyway she wants to talk to you what do i say anything you like so you dont want her in on this fuck no i dont want anybody to know okay its going to be difficult but okay ive got to go do you want me to send a nurse in to give you something to help you sleep yeah well find a place for you until you mend ill ask jerry brahms he knows the city back to front all we needs a little hideaway it neednt be fancy just make sure he doesnt get wind of whats going on todd said jerry talks give me a little credit maxine replied ill see you tomorrow morning you get some sleep and dont worry nobodys going to find out where you are or whats happened ill kill em first promise with my bare hands so saying she was out of the room leaving todd alone and in the dark donnie was right of course this was undoubtedly the stupidest thing he had ever done but there was no going back on it life like a movie only made sense running in one direction what could he do but go with the flow and hope to hell there was a happy ending waiting for him in the last reel a storm moved in off the pacific in the middle of the night the seventh storm of that winter and the worst over the next fortyeight hours it would dump several inches of rain along the coast from monterey to san diego creating a catalogue of minor disasters stormdrains overflowed and turned the streets of santa barbara into whitewater rivers two citizens and seven streetpeople were swept away and drowned powerlines were brought down by the furious winds the most badly struck area being orange county where a number of communities remained without power for the next three days along the pacific coast highway where the wildfires of the previous autumn had stripped the hillsides of vegetation the naked earth no longer knitted together by roots turned into mud and slid down onto the road there were countless accidents fourteen people perished including a family of seven mexicans whod only been in the promised land four hours having skipped over the border illegally all burned up together trapped in their overturned truck in the pacific palisades the deluge carried away several million dollar homes in topanga canyon the same of course all this made the business of getting todd from the hospital to maxines beachhouse both more lengthy and frustrating than it would have been otherwise but it may have helped to keep the endeavor secret certainly there were no photographers at the hospital door when they left nor anybody waiting for them in the vicinity of the beachhouse but that didnt mean they were out of danger calls to maxines offices inquiring about todds condition had multiplied exponentially and they were now coming in from further afieldseveral from japan where gallows had just openedas the rumors spread one of the german reporters had even had the temerity to suggest that todd was undergoing plastic surgery i gave him hell fucking kraut arent you german on your mothers side hes still a fucking kraut todd was sitting in the back of maxines mercedes with nurse karynwho had been thoroughly investigated by maxine and judged reliableat his side the nurse was a woman of few words but those she chose to utter usually carried some punch i dont see why yall give a damn i mean what does it matter if somebody gets wind of it he just got a chemical peel and a few nips and tucks whats the big deal its not something todds fans need to know about maxine replied theyve got a certain idea of who todd is so theyd think it wasnt too masculine nurse karyn said shall we just move on from this maxine said catching nurse karyns gaze in the driving mirror and shaking her head to indicate that the conversationor at least this portion of itwas at an end todd of course saw none of this he was still bandaged blind how are you doing todd maxine said wondering how soon soon maxine said soon oh by the way i had a word with jerry brahms and told him exactly what we needed two hours later he came back to me said he had the perfect house for you im going to see it with him tomorrow did he tell you where it was somewhere up in the hills apparently it was a place he used to go and play when he was a kid i guess this is in the forties he says its completely secluded nobodys going to come bothering you hes full of shit they have fucking bus tours up in the hills every other house has somebody famous living in it thats what i told him but he swore this house was ideal nobody even knows about the canyon its in thats what he said so well see if it isnt any good for you ill keep looking later that afternoon burrows came out to the beachhouse to change todds dressings it was a surreal ritual for all concerned todd semirecumbent on the deco sofa in the large window overlooking the beach maxine sitting at a distance nursing an early vodka stinger burrowshis confidence tentatively back in place after the prickly exchanges of the previous daychatting about the rain and the mudslides while he delicately removed the bandages now the area around your eyes is going to be a little gummed up he warned todd so dont try and open your eyes until ive done some cleaning todd said nothing he was just listening to the boom of his heart in his head and outside the boom of the stormstirred waves they were out of step with one another i wonder burrows said to maxine if youd mind closing the blinds a little way i dont want it to be too bright in here when i uncover todds eyes todd heard maxine crossing to the window then the mechanical hum of the electric blinds as they were lowered i think thatll be far enough burrows said a click and the hum stopped now lets see how things look hold very still todd please todd held his breath as the dressing which the bandages had kept in place was gently teased away from his face it felt as though a layer of his skin was coming away along with the gauze he heard a little intake of breath from maxine what he murmured its okay burrows said softly please hold still this is a very delicate procedure by the way when i put the new dressing on ill be leaving holes for your eyes so youll be able tovery still pleasegood goodso youll be able to see maxine please todd dont move a muscle i want her to tell me what it looks like she cant see yet todd burrows said something to his nurse half under his breath todd didnt catch the words but he heard the gauze which had now been stripped from his face completely dropped with a wet plop into a receptacle he imagined it soaked with his blood shreds of his skin stuck to it his stomach turned i want to puke he said shall i stop for a moment burrows asked no just get it over and done with right well then im going to start cleaning you up burrows saidthen well see how youre healing i must say its looking very good so far i want maxine to take a look in a minute burrows said just let me now todd said nausea fueling his impatience he raised his hand blindly and pushed at burrows the man moved aside maxine todd said im here todd beckoned in the direction of maxines voice come and look at me will you i want you to tell me what i look like he heard maxines heels on the polished wood floor hurry her step quickened now she was close by him well he said to be honest its hard to tell till he christ i knew it i fucking knew it he fucked me up wait wait maxine said calm down a lot of its just the ointments he put on you let him clean it off before we get hysterical todd reached out to her she caught hold of his hand its going to be okay she said though her grip was clammy just be patient why cant men be patient youre not patient he reminded her just let him work todd but youre not admit it all right im not patient burrows set to work again meticulously swabbing around todds eyes cleaning his gummed lashes the stink of cleaning fluid was sharp in his nostrils his sinuses ran and his eyes when he finally opened them were awash welcome back maxine said unknitting her fingers from his as though a little embarrassed by the intimacy it took a couple of minutes for todds sight to clear and another two for his eyes to become accustomed to the dimmed light in the room but part by part face by face the world came back to him the large halfblinded window and the rainlashed deck beyond it the expensive ease of the room the indian rug the leather furniture the calder mobile in yellow red and black which hung below the skylight burrows knitted brow and fixed nervous smile the nurse a pretty blonde woman and finally maxine her face ashen burrows moved away like a portrait painter stepping back from a canvas to check the effect hed achieved i want to see todd said to him give yourself a minute maxine said are you still feeling sick why is it going to make me heave no she said he almost believed her you just look a little puffy thats all and a little raw its not so bad you used to be such a good liar really she insisted its not so bad so let me look everyone in the room remained still will somebody get me a mirror okay he started to push himself up out of the chair ill get one myself stay where you are maxine said if you really want to see nurse whats your name karyn go up into the bedroom and youll find a little hand mirror there on the vanity bring it down it seemed to todd the girl took an eternity to fetch the mirror while they waited burrows stared out at the rain maxine went to refresh her stinger finally the girl returned her eyes were on burrows not on todd tell her to give it to me todd said go on burrows said the nurse put the mirror into todds hand he took a deep breath and looked at himself there was a moment as his eyes fixed on his reflection when reality fluttered and he thought none of this is real not the room nor the people in it nor the rain outside nor the face in the mirror especially not the face in the mirror it was a figment fluttering and fluttering and jesus he said like duncan mcfarlane look at me the strength in his hand failed him and the mirror dropped to the ground it fell face down the nurse stooped to pick it up but he said no leave it she stepped away from him and he caught a look of fear in her eyes what was she afraid of his voice was it or his face god help him if it was his face somebody open the blinds he said lets get some light in here its not a fucking funeral maxine went to the switch and flipped it the mechanism hummed the blind rose showing him an expanse of rainsoaked deck some furniture and beyond the deck the beach one solitary joggerprobably some famous fool like himself determined to preserve his beauty even in the pouring rainwas trudging along the shore followed by two bodyguards todd got up from his chair and went to the window then despite the presence of strangers he lay his hand against the cold glass and began to weep four burrows had brought both painkillers and tranquilizers that todd supplemented with a large order from jerome bunny a ratty little englishman whod been his supplier of illicit pharmaceuticals for the last four years under their influence todd spent the next twentyfour hours in a semisomnambulant state the rain was unrelenting he sat in front of maxines immense television screen and watched a succession of images of other peoples painhouses gone families divideddreamily wondering if any of them would exchange their misery for his every now and then a memory of the visage hed seen in the mirrorvaguely resembling somebody hed known but horribly wounded filled with pus and bloodwould swim up before him and hed take another pill or two or three and wash it down with a shot of single malt and wait for the opiates to drive the horror off a little distance the new dressings burrows had put on though as promised they indeed left his eyes uncovered were still oppressive and more than once todds hands went up to his face unbidden and would have ripped the bandages off had he not governed himself in time he felt grotesque like something from a latenight horror movie his facewhich had been his glory become some horrible secret festering away beneath the bandages he asked maxine what movie it wassome rock hudson weepiein which a man was covered up this way she didnt know and stop thinking about yourself for a while she said think about something else easily said the trouble was thinking about himself came naturally to him in fact it had become secondnature to him over the years to put all other considerations out of sight to care only about todd pickett and dempsey not to have done so would have meant a diminution of his power in the world after all hed been playing a game which only the truly selfobsessed had a chance of victory all others were bound to fall by the wayside now when it would have been healthier to direct his attention elsewhere hed simply lost the knack and he had no dog by his side to love him for being the boss whatever the hell he looked like late in the day maxine came back from her visit to the hideaway as she had now dubbed it with some good news the house in the hills was just as jerry brahms had advertised its the only house in the canyon she said which canyon i dont even think its got a name theyve all got names for gods sake all i can tell you is that its somewhere between coldwater and laurel to be perfectly honest i got a little lost following jerry up there he drives like the devil and you know my sense of geography who does the house belong to right now its practically empty theres some old stuff in therelooks like it goes back to the fifties maybe earlierbut nothing youd want to use ill have marco choose some furniture from the bel air house and move it over get you comfortable but really its ideal for what we need right now by the way ms bosch has been calling my office she got quite pushy with sawyer shes absolutely certain youre in hawaii screwing some starlet if thats what she wants to think you dont care not right now youre certain you dont want to see her christ see her no maxine i do not want to see her she was pretty upset thats because she wanted a part in warrior and she thought id get it for her okay end of discussion if she calls again tell her shes right im in hawaii fucking the ass off anyone you care to name manipulative little bitch so here maxine said she proffered an envelope whats this theyre the pictures i took of the hideaway he took the envelope itll be fine he said before hed even looked at the photographs you might be there for a few weeks i want you to be comfortable todd pulled out the photographs theyre not the best im afraid maxine said its one of those throwaway cameras and it was raining but you get the idea it looks big according to jerry they used to call them dream palaces all the rich stars had them its hokey but its got a lot of atmosphere theres a huge masterbedroom with a view straight down the canyon you can see century city probably the ocean on a clear day and the living rooms as big as a ballroom whoever built it put a lot of love into it all the moldings the doorhandles everything is top of the line of course it gets campy theres a fresco on the ceiling of the turret all these faces leaning over looking down at you famous movie stars jerry said i didnt recognize any of em but i guess they were from silent movies she paused waiting for judgment todd just keep looking at the pictures well maxine finally said too old hollywood for you no its fine anyway isnt that what i am now what old hollywood five jerry brahms had been a childactor in the late thirties but his career hadnt lasted into puberty hed been at his most picturesque as he like to put it at the age of nine or ten after which it had all been downhill todd had always thought of brahms as being slightly ridiculous with his overlycoifed silver hair his mockenglish diction and his unforgiving bitchiness about the profession to which hed once aspired but jerry knew his hollywood there was no doubt of that he lived and breathed the place its scandals its triumphs he was most informed about the golden age of tinseltown which coincided naturally enough with the years of his employment in matters relating to this period his knowledge was encyclopedic as hed proved three years before when todd had been looking for a new house jerry had volunteered his services as a location scout and after a week or two had taken todd and maxine on a grand tour of properties he thought might be suitable todd had not wanted to go he found jerrys chatter grating but maxine had insisted hell be heartbroken if you dont go shed said you know how he idolizes you besides he might have found something you like so todd had gone along and it had turned out to be quite a trip jerry had organized the tour as though he was entertaining royalty hed hired a stretch supplied a champagneandcaviar hamper from greenblatts in case they wanted to picnic along the way and a map of the city on which hed meticulously marked their route they went down to the colony in malibu they wound their way through bel air and beverly hills they looked at hancock park and brentwood their route plotted by jerry so that he could show off his knowledge of where the luminaries of hollywood had lived and died they passed by falcon lair on bella drive which valentino had built at the height of his fame they went to the benedict canyon drive home where harold lloyd had spent much of his life and past jayne mansfields pink palace which was as gaudy as ever and the house where marilyn and dimaggio had briefly lived in wedded bliss they visited homes occupied at one time or another by john barrymore ronald coleman hearsts widow marion davies clara bow lucille ball and mae west not all the houses were for sale nor open for inspection in some cases jerrys research had simply turned up a property close by or one that resembled the house in which some luminary had lived other properties were located in areas that had become shadows of their glamorous selves but jerry didnt seem to care or perhaps even notice the fact that stars whose faces had become legendarywhose names evoked lives of elegance and luxuryhad lived in these homes blinded him to the fact that there was often decay around them they were like sacred sites and he a pilgrim todd had found the tenderness with which he talked about these places and about the people whod once occupied them curiously touching four or five times during the trip jerry had directed the driver to a certain spot invited maxine and todd to get out of the limo in order to show them a certain view then presented them with a photograph taken on precisely the same spot sixty or seventy years before when many of the places they visited had been little more than an expanse of cactus and sand it had been an education for todd he hadnt realized until then how recent los angeles was nor how tenuous its existence was the greenery was as artificial as the stucco walls and the colonial facades the city was one enormous backlot fake and fragile if the water ever ceased to pump then this verdant world with its palaces and its swooning falls of bougainvillea would pass away as it turned out todd hadnt ended up buying any of the properties jerry had shown them that day which was probably for the best he finally decided to stay in his house in bel air but substantially remodel it it didnt matter jerry had said apparently reserving his opinion on whether todd would join the pantheon of guests nobody legendary had ever lived there once todd had said yes to the house in the hills it took a day to get the move to the hideaway properly organized a day which left todd spent sitting at the window of the malibu house staring at the pale reflection of his bandaged face in the rainspattered glass technically the painkillers burrows had given him should have left him without any discomfort whatsoever but for some reason even when supplemented by some of bunnys specialsnot a minute of that day passed without his being acutely aware of the pressure of the gauze and the bandages on his face he morbidly wondered if perhaps he wouldnt be left with this residue of feeling for the rest of his life hed heard of people whod had certain operations who were made much worse by the surgeons knife and indeed were never the same again the thought terrified him that hed done something completely irreversible but there was no use in regretting it all he could do now was hope to god that this unavoidable complication as burrows insisted it was would be quickly cured and hed have his face back intact he wasnt even hoping for improvement at this point just the old familiar todd pickett face would do fine creases laughlines and all in the early evening marco came to pick todd up having spent the morning moving some essentials over to the new house todd went with him in the sedan maxine and jerry followed on i got lost twice this morning marco said going back and forth from the old house to the new one i dont know why the hell it happened but twice i got all turned round and found myself back onto sunset again weird todd said there are no street signs up there no there arent many houses either which is what i like no neighbours no tour buses no fans climbing over the walls dempsey used to get them oh yes old dempsey was great remember that german huge guy climbs over the wall gets dempseys teeth clamped in his ass and then tries to sue you tries to sue me they chuckled at the incident for a moment then rode in silence for a while six so what exactly did jerry tell you about this place todd asked maxine as they stood outside the hideaway not much i told you hed played here as a kid yes i did well he said he had wonderful memories of the house that was about all maxine hadnt taken any pictures of the exterior it had been raining so hard that day now seen clearly for the first time the house appeared much larger than todd had anticipated perfectly deserving of the term dream palace he couldnt get a complete grasp of its size because the vegetation around it had been left to run wild a large grove of bamboo to the right of the front door had grown fully thirty feet its tallest stalks standing higher than the chimneystacks bougainvillea grew everywhere in lunatic abundance purple red pink and white and even the humble ferns planted in the shade of the perimeter wall had flourished there and grown antediluvian there was room beneath the fronds to stand with your hands raised and still not touch the nubby spores on their underbellies the house itself was palatial spanish in style with more than a hint of hollywood fantasy in its genes the stucco was a washedout pink the roof a washedout red there was a great deal of elaborate tilework at the front steps and around the windows the tiles themselves still bright blue and turquoise and white the complex interplay of their patterns lending a touch of moorish beauty to the facade the front door looked as though it had been purloined from the set of a medieval epic the kind of door douglas fairbanks senior might have slammed and bolted shut to keep out an army of evildoers it would have sufficed too in its enormity maxine had to push hard to open it and when it finally swung wide it did so not with a gothic creak but with a deep rumble as a system of counterweights hidden in the wall aided her labor very dramatic todd remarked playing it off in truth he was impressed by the scale of the place by its scale and theatricality but guileless enthusiasm hed had shamed out of him long ago it wasnt cool to like anything too much except yourself maxine led the way through the turret with its grandiose spiral staircase and its trompe loeil ceiling into the house the photographs shed taken had come nowhere near doing the place justice even stripped of most of its furniture as it was and in need of repair it was still nothing short of magnificent there was everywhere evidence of master craftsmen at work from the pegged wood floors to the elegantly carved ceiling panels from the exquisite symmetry of the marble mantels to the filigree of the wrought iron handrails only the best had been good enough for the man or woman whod owned this place marco had artlessly arranged a few items of todds furniture in the living room a little island of brittle modernity in the midst of something older and more mysterious todd made a mental note to give everything he owned away and start again in future he was going to buy antiques they went through to the kitchen it was built on the same heroic scale as everything else ten cooks could have happily worked in it and not got in one anothers way i know its all ridiculously oldfashioned maxine said but itll do for a little while wont it itll do just fine todd said still surprised at how much the place pleased him whats out back oh the usual a pool tennis courts and a huge koi pond probably a polo field for all i know any fish in the pond no you want fish its no big deal i can get koi for you if you want them just say the word i know but its not worth it ill be here a month and gone so take them with you and where would i put them okay maxine shrugged no fish she went to the kitchen window and continued her description of the real estate the whole canyon belongs to the house as far as i can see but the gardens spread down the hill an acre and a half and all the way up to the top of the hill behind us theres a guesthouse up there perhaps two i didnt go look i figured you wouldnt be having any visitors does jerry know anything about the history of the place im sure he does but to be honest i didnt ask what did you tell him about me i told him you had a stalker and she was getting dangerous you needed to get out of the bel air house for a while until the police had caught her frankly im not sure he bought it hes got to have heard the rumors i think wed be best letting him in on whats been happening weve had this conversation once hear me out will you if we make him feel like hes part of the conspiracy hell stay quiet just because he wants to please you hell only get chatty if he thinks we kept him out because we didnt trust him why the hell would he want to please me you know why todd hes in love with you todd shook his bandaged head which was a mistake the room around him swam for a moment and he had to grab hold of the table you okay maxine said he raised his hands palms out in mock surrender im fine i just need a pill and a drink i sent marco out to get some supplies but toddits not even noon so if i stay here and get shitfaced every day for the next month whos going to care find me something to drink will you what about jerry we didnt finish well talk about jerry some other time am i telling him or not i said i dont want to talk about it any more all right but if he starts to gossip dont say i didnt warn you if he tells the fucking national enquirer its my fault happy todd didnt wait for a reply leaving maxine to search for the liquor he wandered out to the back of the house the lawnwhich lay at the bottom of a long flight of steps from the house their railings entirely overtaken by vineswas the size of a small field but it had been invaded on every side by the offspring of the plants shrubs and trees which surrounded it many of them in premature flower bird of paradise trees twenty feet tall sycamore and eucalyptus rose bushes and foxgloves early california poppies shining like satin in the grass meadowfoam and corn lily hairy honeysuckle and wild grape golden yarrow blue blossom and red huckleberry and everywhere of course the ubiquitous pampas grass soft fleecy plumes swaying in the sun it was uncommon even uncanny verdancy todd strode across the lawn which was still wet from the rain down to the pool dragonflies flitted everywhere bees wove their nectar trails through the balmy air the pool was a baroque affair descending from the relatively restrained style of the main house into pure hollywood kitsch the model perhaps was b de mille roman a large mockclassical bronze fountain was set at the back of the pool the intertwined limbs of its figuresa seagod and his female attendantsrendered more baroque still by the tracery of living vines which had crept up over it a sizable conch in the seagods hands had once been a source of rejuvenating waters for the pool but those waters had ceased to flow a long time ago todd was mildly disappointed he would have liked to have seen sparkling blue water in the pool instead of the few inches of bottle green rainwater that were there at the bottom he turned and looked back towards the house it was still more impressive from this side than it had been from the front its four floors rising like the tiers of a wedding cake its walls lush with ivy in places and in others naked beyond it further up the hill todd could just see a glimpse of one of the guesthouse that maxine had mentioned altogether it really was an impressive parcel of land with or without the buildings had jerry shown it to him as part of the grand tour todd might well have been tempted to invest the fact that jerry hadnt done so probably meant that it had not belonged to anyone of significance though that seemed odd this wasnt just any hollywood showplace it was the crиme de la crиme a glorious confection of a residence designed to show off all the wealth power and taste of a great star by the time hed made his way back inside marco had turned up from greenblatts with a carload of supplies he welcomed his boss with his usual crooked smile and a generous glass of bourbon so what do you think of the old dark house you knowin a weird way i like it here really said maxine its nothing like your taste she was plainly still mildly irritated by their earlier exchange though for todd it was past history soothed away by his wanderings in the wilderness i never really felt comfortable in bel air he said that house has always been more like a hotel to me than a home i wouldnt say this place was exactly cozy maxine remarked oh i dont know todd said he sipped on his bourbon smiling into his glass dempsey would have liked it he said seven on thursday th of march maxine got a call that she knew was coming the caller was a woman called tammy lauper who ran the international todd pickett appreciation society which despite its high falutin title had its headquarters maxine knew in the laupers house in sacramento tammy was calling to ask a very simple question one that she said she was passing on to maxine from millions of todds fans worldwide where was todd maxine had dealt with tammy on many occasions in the past though if she possibly could she ducked the calls and let sawyer deal with them the trouble was that tammy lauper was an obsessive and though in the eight years shed been running the appreciation society though in that time shed done a great deal to support todds movies and could on occasion be a useful disseminator of deliberately erroneous information she was not somebody maxine had much time for the woman annoyed her with her perpetual questions about trivia and her unspoken assumption that somehow todd belonged to her when she was obliged to speak to the lauper womanbecause there was some delicate matter in the air and she needed to carefully modulate the flow of newsshe always aimed to keep the exchanges brief as courteous as possibletammy could be prickly if she didnt feel as though she was being given her duebut brief today however tammy wasnt about to be quickly satisfied she was like a terrier with a rat every time maxine thought shed satisfied the womans curiosity back shed come with another enquiry somethings wrong she kept saying todds not been seen by anyone usually when he goes away members of the society spot him and they report to me but i havent heard one word somethings wrong because i always hear im sure you do so whats going on youve got to tell me why should anything be going on maxine said doing her best to maintain her equilibrium todds tired and he needs a break so he went away for a few weeks out of state yes out of state out of the country im afraid he asked me not to say because weve got members all over the world i realize that but when he went on his honeymoon to morocco tammy went on i had six reports of sightings sometimes maxine said a trace of condescension creeping into her voice now todd likes to be out in public sometimes he doesnt and right now he doesnt but why would he mind being seen tammy went on if theres nothing wrong with him maxine hesitated wondering how best to calm the suspicions she was clearly arousing she couldnt just make an excuse and jump off the phone that would make the lauper woman even more curious than she already was she had to maneuver the conversation away from this dangerous area as carefully as possible ill tell you why she said dropping her voice a little as though she was about to share something of real significance with tammy hes got a secret project in the works oh tammy said she didnt sound persuaded this isnt warrior is it i read that script and no it isnt warrior its a very personal piece which todd is writing himself hes writing it todd is writing something he said in an interview with people last july he hated writing it was too much like hard work well i lied a little maxine said hes not doing the actual writing hes working with somebody on the project a very wellrespected screenwriter actually but hes pouring out his heart so itll be a very personal project there was a silence maxine waited had tammy taken the bait or not so this is autobiographical this movie i didnt say it was a movie maxine said taking some petty pleasure in catching tammy out it may end up on the screen but right now hes just working hard to get his feelings down he and the writer that is who is the writer i cant say you know it would make all this very much more believable if you gave me some more details tammy said that was it maxine lost her composure how dare this little bitch suggest her lies werent believable you know ive really said more than i should already tammy she snapped and ive got six calls waiting so if youll excuse me waitwhat am i going to tell the members what i just told you you swear todds fine good god how many times yes todd is perfectly fine in fact hes never been better she drew a deep breath and attempted to calm herself a little before she ended up saying something she regretted look tammy i really wish i could tell you more but this is a matter of todds privacy as im sure you understand he needs a little time away from the pressure of being a celebrity so he can work on this project and when hes finished im sure youll be one of the first to hear about it now really ive got to go one more question tammy said yes whats it called whats what called maxine replied playing for time the script or the book or whatever its going to be whats it called oh shit maxine thought now she was in deep well why the hell not give the damn woman a title shed lied herself into a hole as it was one more shovelful wouldnt hurt she pictured todd in an image now indelibly inscribed in her minds eye sitting waiting for burrows to start cutting away the bandages and the title came the blind leading the blind she said i dont like that tammy said already proprietorial neither do i maxine replied thinking not just of the title but of this whole sprawling exhausting mess trust me tammy neither do i tammy jayne lauper lived on elverta road in rio linda sacramento in a onestory ranchstyle house fifteen minutes from the sacramento international airport where her husband had worked for eight years as a baggage handler they had no kids nor any hope of having any this side of a miracle of biblical proportions arnie had a zero sperm count tammy didnt mind much just because god had given her breasts the size of watermelons didnt mean she was born for motherhood and of course the absence of children left plenty of space in the house for all the files relating to what arnie sneeringly called tammys little fan club it isnt a fan club tammy had pointed out countless times its an appreciation society arnie said tammy wasnt no appreciator she was a fan plain and simple and he knew every time theyd used to sleep together and she closed her eyes it was that dickhead pickett shed been imagining on top of her fat ass and that was the whole unvarnished truth of it when arnie got to talking like that tammy would just tune him out hed stop eventually when he knew he she wasnt listening go back to sitting in front of the tv with a beer the main center of the todd pickett appreciation societys operations was the front bedroom the room she and arnie slept in was considerably smaller but as shed pointed out to him it didnt really matter since all they did was sleep in it they still had a double bed though god knows why he never touched her and a couple of years back shed stopped wanting him to the third bedroom were used for storage files of clippings issues of the fanzine photographs and biographies to be distributed to new members copies of press kits from every film todd had ever made in twentysix languages downstairs in what would have been the family room she kept the collection this was made up of items related to todd and his career all of them relatively rare some oneofakind items hanging in zippedup plastic laundry bags were articles of clothing made for the cast and crew of his pictures on the mantelpiece still sealed in their boxes were six todd pickett dolls that had been the hot thing to own during his teenidol period the boxes signed by todd preserved in a vacuum pack were several unused latex makeup pieces for his oscarnominated performance as the maimed firefighter in the burning year she didnt ever look at those shed been warned that they deteriorated when they were exposed to sunlight the collection also contained a comprehensive library of scripts for his movies with all their addenda including one marked up in todds handwriting along with a complete set of novelizations of the movies leatherbound with gilt lettering there were also creditlistings on all the crews who worked with him costume sketches and callsheets and of course posters of every size and nationality if the smithsonian ever wanted to open a wing dedicated to the life and career of todd pickett tammy had once boasted they need look no further than her front room once shed attempted to enumerate the items she owned it was something in the region of seventeen thousand three hundred not including those pieces of which she had more than one copy it was to this shrine that tammy had come after her frustrating exchange with maxine frizelle she closed and locked the door and sat down to think after a few minutes turning over the conversation shed just had she went to the very back of the room and took from its place amongst the treasuretrove a box of photographs these were her special pride and joy pictures of todd which shed managed to buy from somebody whod known the still photographer on todds fourth picture life lessons this was todds comingofage picture the one in which hed changed from being a boy to being a man of course his smile would always be a boys smile that was part of its magic but after life lessons he went on to play tougher roles a homecoming soldier a firelighter a man wrongfully accused of his own wifes murder here then caught in the moment before his cinematic adulthood was the boyman of tammys dreams she had even purchased the negatives from which the series of pictures had been printed and along with them the assurance from the person shed got them from that they had been lost in the production offices before they were ever seen by the director the producer or by todd himself in short she had the only copies their rarity wasnt the reason she valued them so highly however what made them her special treasurethe quality that made her return to them over and over when arnie was out at work and she knew she had time for reveriewas the fact that the photographer had caught his subject unawares well shirtless and unawares todd was sleek and pale his body not heavy at all not all muscle and veins popping out just a nice ordinary body the body of the boy next door if the boy next door happened to be perfect she had never seen a body she thought so beautiful then there was his face oh that face shed seen literally thousands of photographs of todd in the last eleven yearsand to her adoring eyes he was handsome in every single one of thembut in these particular pictures he was something more than handsome there was a certain lost look in his eyes that allowed her to indulge the belief that if shed been there at that momentif hed seen her and looked at her with the same forsaken feeling in his heart as was in his eyeseverything in her life would have been different and maybe just maybe everything in his when she was thinking clearly she knew all this was romantic nonsense she was a plain woman and even though shed shed thirtytwo pounds in the last two years was still thirty overweight how could she hope to compare with the glossy beauties todd had romanced both on screen and off still she allowed herself the indulgence once in a while it made life in sacramento a little more bearable to know that her secret glimpses of todd were always there hidden away waiting for her and best of all nobody else had them they were hers and hers alone there was one other wonderful thing about the fourteen pictures they had been snapped in such quick succession that if she leafed through them fast enough she could almost create the illusion of movement she did that now while she thought about the way maxine had talked to her on the phone that nonsense about todd going away to write his life story or whatever shed said it was going to be it didnt ring true it simply wasnt like todd to be so inaccessible every vacation hed takenin india in new guinea in the amazon for gods sakehed been spotted somebody had had a camera and hed posed smiled waved goofed around it just wasnt like him to disappear like this but what could she do about it she wasnt going to get any answers out of anybody close to todd theyd all trot out the same story shed already exhausted her contacts at the studios all of whom claimed not to have seen todd in a while even over at paramount where he was supposedly making his next picture nobody had seen him in many months nor according to her most reliable source over there the secretary to sherry lansings assistant were there any meetings on the books either with todd or any of his production team it was all very strange and it made tammy afraid for her man suppose they were covering something up suppose thered been an accident or an assault and todd had been hurt suppose he was in a hospital bed somewhere on lifesupport his life slipping away while all the sons of bitches whod made fortunes off his talent were lying to themselves and anyone whod listen pretending it was going to be okay things like that happened all the time especially in hollywood everyone lied there it was a way of life her thoughts circled on these terrible images for an hour or more while she sat amongst her treasures at last she came to a momentous decision she could do nothing to solve this mystery sitting here in sacramento she needed to go out to california and confront some of these people it was easy to tell somebody a lie on the telephone it was harder to do when you were face to face with someone when you were looking into their eyes she took one last look through the sequence of photographs lingering on the last of the fourteen the one in which todds gaze was closest to making contact with the camera another shot and he would have been looking directly at her their eyes as it were would have met she smiled at him kissed his picture then put the photographs away tucked the box out of sight and went through to the kitchen to call arnie at the airport and tell him what she planned to do he was in the middle of his shift and couldnt come to the phone she left a message for him to call her then she made a reservation on southwest for the flight to los angeles and booked a room in a little hotel on wilshire boulevard which shed stayed in once before when shed come into la for a todd pickett convention the flight was scheduled at that afternoon and was to get into los angeles at but the departure was delayed for almost two hours and then they circled over lax for almost three quarters of an hour before they could land so it wasnt until halfpast seven that she stepped out of the airport into the warm sweetsmog air of her beloveds city she didnt know what she was going to do now she was here how or where she was going to begin but at least she wasnt sitting at home brooding she was closer to him here whatever maxine frizelle had said about him being off in some faraway place that was a lie tammy knew it in her bones he was here and if he was any in any trouble then by god she would do her best to help him because whatever anybody might say she knew one thing for certain there wasnt a soul on earth who cared for the wellbeing of todd pickett more than she and somewhere tucked away in a shameful corner of her head she almost hoped that there was some conspiracy here because that would give her a chance to come to his rescue to save him from people like frizelle and make him understand who really cared about him oh wouldnt that be something she didnt dare think about it too much it made her sick with guilt and anticipation she shouldnt be wishing anything but the best for her todd and yet the same thought kept creeping back that somewhere in this city he was waiting for hereven if he didnt know it yet waiting to be saved and comforted yes she dared think it perhaps even loved eight todd and marco had settled into life at the hideaway in the canyon quite easily todd occupied the enormous master bedroom which had an extraordinary view down the canyon on clear days of which there were many in that early march todd could sit at his window and watch the ocean glittering beyond the towers of century city on exceptional days he could even make out the misty shape of catalina island marco had taken a much smaller bedroom on the floor below with an adjacent silting room and did much as he had in the bel air home that is served with uncanny prescience the needs of his boss and having provided such services as were required then retreated into nearinvisibility the area was much quieter than bel air there seemed to be no through traffic on the single road that wound up through the canyon so apart from the occasional sound of a police helicopter passing over or a siren drifting up from sunset todd heard nothing from the city that lay such a short distance below what he did hear at night were coyotes who seemed to haunt the slopes of the canyon in significant numbers on some nights standing on one of the many balconies of his new mansion nursing a drink and a cigarette he would hear a lone animal begin its urgent yapping on the opposite slope of the canyon only to hear its call answered from another spot then another the din rising into a whooping chorus from the darkness all around him so that it seemed the entire canyon was alive with them theyd had coyotes up in bel air too of course their proximity to the house would always send dempsey into a frenzy of deepchest barking as though to announce that the dog of the house was much larger than he was in reality im surprised weve got so many coyotes up here marco said after one particularly noisy night youd think theyd go somewhere with a lot more garbage i mean theyre scavengers right maybe they like it here todd observed yeah i guess theres no people to fuck with them except us we wont be here long todd said you dont sound too happy about that well i guess i could get used to it here have you been up on the ridge yet no i havent had the energy you should go up there take a look theres quite a view the exchange brief as it was put the thought of a trip up the hill into todds head he needed to start exercising again as maxine had pointed out or he was going to find that his face was all nicely healed up and his body had gone to fat he didnt believe for a minute that his face was anywhere near being healed but he took her point he was drinking too much and eating too many elvis midnight specials for the good of his waistline his pants were feeling tight and his asswhen he glimpsed it in the mirrorwas looking fleshy in a while hed have to get back to some serious training start running every morning maybe have his gym equipment brought over from the bel air house and installed in the guesthouse but in the meantime hed ease back into the swing of things with a few exploratory walks one of which he promised himself would be up the top of the hill to see what the view was like when you got to the end of the road burrows and nurse karyn came every other day to change the dressings and assess the condition of his face though burrows claimed that the healing process was going well burrows claimed his manner remained subdued and cautious it was clear that the whole sorry business had taken a toll upon his confidence his sunbed tan could not conceal a certain sickliness in his pallor and the skin around his eyes and mouth taut from a series of tucks and tightenings had an unnatural rigidity to it like a teak mask under which another more fragile man was trapped superficially he remained unfailingly optimistic about todds prognosis he was certain there would be no permanent scarring indeed he was even willing to chance the opinion that things were going to work out as planned and that todd was going to emerge from the whole experience looking ten years younger so how long is it going to be before i can take off the bandages another week id say and after thathow long before im back to normal again i dont want to make any promises burrows said but inside a month is there some great urgency here yeah i want people to see me i want them to know im not dead surely nobody believes that burrows said todd summoned marco where are those tabloids you brought in he asked the doctors not been reading the trash in his waitingroom recently marco left the room and reappeared with five magazines dropping them on the table beside burrows the top one had a blurred black and white photograph of a burial procession obviously taken with an extremely longdistance lens the headline read superstar todd pickett buried in secret ceremony the magazine beneath had an unsmiling picture of todds exgirlfriend wilhemina bosch and announced as though from her grieving lips i never even had a chance to tell him goodbye and underneath a third magazine boasted that it contained todd picketts last words i saw christ standing at his deathbed claims nurse burrows didnt bother with the others who starts bullshit like this you tell me todd replied i hope youre not implying that it was somebody in my surgery because i assure you weve been vigorous yeah yeah yeah todd said youre not responsible for anything i know see i finally got smart i read the small print frankly i dont see where your problem lies all youd have to do is make one call tell them who you are and the rumors would be laid to rest and what would he say marco asked its obvious hed say im todd pickett and im alive and well thank you very much and then what todd said when they want to come to take a photograph to confirm that everythings fine or they want an interview facetoface face to face with this his face was presently unbandaged he stood up and went to the mirror i look like i went ten rounds with a heavyweight i can only assure you that the swelling is definitely going down its just going to take time and the quality of the new epidermis is firstrate i believe youre going to be very pleased at the end of everything todd said nothing for a moment then with a kind of simple sincerity hed seldomif everachieved in front of a camera he turned and said to burrows you know what i wish burrows shook his head i wish id never laid eyes on you you dickhead nine tammy knew only a very few people in los angeles all of them members of the appreciation society but she decided not to alert anybody to the fact that shed come into town theyd all want to help her with her investigations and this was something she preferred to do alone at least at the outset she checked herself into the little hotel on wilshire boulevard within a few hundred yards of the westwood memorial park where a host of stars and almoststars were buried or interred shed made her rounds of the famous who rested there on her last visit donna reed and natalie wood were amongst them so was darryl f zanuck and oscar levant but the parks real claim to famethe presence that brought sightseers from all over the worldwas marilyn monroe who was laid to rest in a bland concrete crypt distinguished only by the number of floral tributes it attracted the crypt beside it was still empty keptso it was saidfor the mortal remains of hugh heffner tammy had not much enjoyed her visit to the park in fact it had depressed her a little she certainly had no intention of going back this time it was the living she was concerned with on this visit not the dead when she was settled in she called arnie gave him her room number in case of emergency and told him shed be back in a couple of days at most she heard him pop a can of beer while she was talkingnot to judge by his slightly slurred speech his first of the night hed be fine without her she thought probably happier she ordered up some roomservice food and then sat plotting how shed proceed the next day her first line of enquiry would be the most direct shed go up to todds home in bel air and try to find out whether or not he was there his address was no secret in fact she had pictures of every room in the house including the ensuite bathroom with the sunken tub taken by the realtor when the house was still on the market though of course it had been remodeled since and its layout had probably changed of course her chances of even getting to the front doormuch less of seeing himwere remote but it would be foolish of her not to try maybe shed catch him going out for a jog or spot him standing at a window then all her concerns would be laid to rest and she would be able to go back to sacramento happy knowing that he was alive and well shed hired a car at the airport and had planned to drive up to bel air the evening she arrived but after the hassles of the delayed flight she was simply too tired so she went to bed at ten and rose bright and early the room service offered at the hotel was nothing specialand she liked a good breakfastso she crossed over wilshire and went into westwood village found herself a diner and ate heartily scrambled eggs bacon hash browns white toast and coffee while she ate she skimmed people and usa today both had pieces about the upcoming oscars which were now only three days away todd had never won an oscar but hed been nominated four years ago for lost rites one of his less popular pictures shed been very proud of him hed done fine work in the movie and shed thought he had a crack at winning watching the ceremony had been nearly impossible her heart had hammered so hard as susan sarandon whod been presenting the award had fumbled with the envelope tammy thought she was going to pass out from anticipation before the winner was even named and then of course sarandon had named the winner and it hadnt been todd the cameras had been on him throughout the whole envelopefumbling routine and thered been a moment between the naming of the winner and his applauding when his disappointment had been perfectly clear at least to someone who knew the language of his face as well as tammy shed only seen one of the movies in this years race and shed only gone to that because tom hanks was in it and he seemed such a likable man she skimmed the articles rather than reading them hoping maybe thered be some reassuring mention of todd but there was nothing breakfast finished she walked back to the hotel left a message for arnie at the airport just to say all was fine and then picked up a map at the front desk in case her sense of direction failed her thus prepared she set off for todds home it took twentyfive minutes driving through the heavy morning traffic to get up into the narrow winding streets of bel air there wasnt much to see most of the mansions were hidden behind high walls bristling with spikes and video cameras but there was no doubting the fact that she was in a very select neighborhood the cars parked on the narrow thoroughfares were all expensive on another street she encountered some glamorouslyhooded superstar out running a black limo following close behind presumably carrying the bottled water and the granola bars what must it be like she wondered as she drove to be so pampered and cosseted to know that if there was no toilet paper in the house no ice cream in the freezer then it was somebody elses damn job to go and get it never to have to worry about taxes or mortgage payments never to wake up at three in the morning and think who am i im nobody if i died tomorrow nobody would ready notice nobody would really care of course she knew there were plenty of responsibilities that came along with all this wealth and comfort and they took their toll on some folks it drove them to drink and drugs and adultery it was hard to be idolized and scrutinized but shed never had much sympathy for the complainers so people paid you millions to see you smile and it made you feel inadequate tough shit she found todds house readily enough there was no number but she recognized the castellated wall and the square lamps on either side of the gate she drove on up the street found a parking spot and wandered back towards the house trying to look as inconspicuous as any two hundred and threepound woman in orange polyester pants could when she reached the gates she saw that there was a car parked in the driveway twenty yards inside the gates its trunk open there was no sign of anyone loading or unloading she watched from the street for a minute or two her courage alternately rising then failing her she couldnt just go up to the gate and ring the bell what would she say hello im todds number one fan and i was wondering if he was feeling okay ridiculous theyd think she was a stalker and have her arrested in fact they might be watching her right now on a hidden camera calling the police she stood there quietly cursing herself for not having thought this through properly before she came up here she didnt know whether to stand her ground and make the best of this nightmarish situation or attempt to casually slip away then a door slammed somewhere out of sight she wanted to make a run for it but she too far from the car to make a quick retreat all she could do was stand there and hope to god there was nobody looking at the security monitors at that particular moment now came the sound of somebody whistling and seconds later the whistler himself stepped into view tammy recognized him instantly it was marco caputo todds assistant and bodyguard shed encountered the man twice before once at the premiere party for the burning year and the second time in las vegas when todd had been named actor of the year at showest shed very politely presented her credentials as the president of the appreciation society and politely asked caputo if she could have a minute to talk with todd on both occasions hed been rude to her the second time in fact hed called her a crazy bitch which shed complained to maxine frizelle about maxine had apologized in a halfhearted way and said it would never happen again but tammy wasnt about to put caputos temper to the test a third time especially under these dubious circumstances before he could look up and see her she backed off into the thicket of blackberry bushes that grew unchecked on the other side of the street she kept her eyes on him at all times he was too busy with his present labors to notice her thank god and now hidden in the bushes she had the perfect vantage point from which to observe him as he went back and forth between the house and the car he was loading his vehicle up with an odd assortment of things including several awards she knew belonged to todd he was also removing some other items a variety of fancy ornaments a marijuana plant in a pot some framed photographs all this plus nine or ten sealed cardboard boxes carefully placed in the trunk or on the back seat of his car there was no sign of todd through the process nor did she hear any exchange from inside the house if todd was here he was not engaged in conversation with marco but her instincts told her he was not here for fully a quarter of an hour she watched him work and finallyputting all the evidence togethershe came to the conclusion that she was witnessing an act of theft of course her dislike of the thief factored into her assessment but there was no doubt that caputo looked furtive as he went about his labors every now and then hed glance up as if he was afraid he was being watched and when he did she saw that his face was illshaven and his eyes heavy sleep wasnt coming too easily of late she had already decided what she was going to do well before hed finished with his felony shed follow him when he departed and find out where he was dropping off all his booty then shed call the police and have him arrested hopefully that would improve maxines low opinion of her she might even find herself trusted enough to be invited into the charmed circle around todd well perhaps that was a little too much to hope for but at the very least shed be stopping caputo profiting from his theft with the car now filled to capacity caputo slammed the trunk and headed back to the house presumably to lock up once hed gone tammy disentangled herself from the blackberry bushes and hurried back to her own car it was getting warm she felt sweat running from beneath her breasts and her underwear was bunched in the groove of her butt she turned the airconditioning to its coldest setting then drove on up the street a little way until she had sufficient room to turn around and came back down in time to see caputos black lexus easing out of the driveway he was the only occupant of the vehicle keeping her distance she followed the lexus down through the maze of bel airs walls and cameras to sunset boulevard she almost lost her quarry at the lights but luckily the eastbound traffic on sunset was heavy and with a little discourteous driving she was able to keep him in sight finally catching up with him again he drove with ease and impatience slipping lanes to overtake tardy drivers but she was a match for him wherever he was going she was going to be on his thieving tail she had no time to consult the maps shed picked up she was too busy keeping her eyes on him so when he suddenly swung a left and took off up into the hills again she instantly lost all sense of where they were headed the traffic soon grew sparse the streets narrow and serpentine once he halted at a stop sign and he looked back over his shoulder she was certain hed realized he was being followed and prepared herself for a confrontation but no something hed laid on the back seat had moved it seemed and he was simply leaning over to reposition it the job done he then proceeded on his way and she continued to follow at a discreet distance the road wound so tightly on itself as it ascended that she let him slip out of sight several times rather than risk his realizing he was being pursued but she didnt fear losing him unlike bel air which was made up of a warren of small streets the canyon into which they were climbing seemed to have only one thoroughfare and they were both on it what little sign of habitation she sawa wall and occasionally a gate in a wall suggested this was not particularly wellfancied real estate which was surprising given its location the trees had been allowed to grow over the road in some places intertwining their branches to form a leafy vault overhead in one spot where a number of tall palm trees grew close to the road fallen fronds lay in a brittle carpet on the potholed tarmac she began to get just a little anxious although she reassured herself that she was just a couple of minutes drive away from sunset this felt like a very different world a backwater where who knew what went on that very fact of course supported her shadier suspicions this was a perfect place for an illegal transaction there didnt appear to be anybody here to witness caputos dealing except of course herself the black lexus had been out of sight for quite a while when as she turned a corner she came upon it parked so badly that she might have ploughed into the back of it had she not acted quickly to avert the collision she swung wide of it glancing back to see caputo manually opening a pair of immense gates the thief started to look round at her but she put her foot on the accelerator and was out of sight before he could fix his gaze she drove on a considerable distance but the road came to a deadend which left her with two options one to turn round and make a conspicuous retreat past the gates so that he was certain shed gone or to hope that the urgency of his mission would make him careless about her presence and by the time shed trekked back to his thieves lair she would have been forgotten she decided on the latter shed come too far to turn and run off now with her tail between her legs the first thing she noticed when she got out of her car was the deep hush of the canyon though the bel air house was nicely situated away from the din of any major thoroughfare shed still been aware that she was in the middle of a city but here the only sound was the music of birds and insects in the grass she was careful not to slam the door leaving the key in the car and the door just slightly ajar in case she needed to make a fast getaway she headed back down the street to the gate there were no cameras mounted along the perimeter this time which surprised her but then perhaps she was walking into a nest of infamous felons and everyone in the vicinity knew to keep their distance if soif the people marco was doing business with were real villainsthen she was in trouble she was alone up here and nobody knew where shed gone this is insanity she thought to herself as she walked but she kept on walking the prospect of coming out of this the unlikely heroine was simply too attractive to be turned down yes there was a risk but then perhaps it was time she took a few instead of hiding away in her house and doting on her picture collection she was in the thick of things now and she wasnt going to allow herself to turn her back on this adventure if she didif she got in her car and drove awaywouldnt she always wonder how different things might have been if for once in her life shed had the courage of her instincts arnie had always called her a dreamer and maybe he was right about that maybe shed been living in a dream world for too long with her little museum of photographs to dote on hopingthough it could never happen of coursethat one day when she flicked through the pictures todd would look at her and smile at her and invite her into his world to stay it was a silly dream and she knew it whereas being here now walking on the hard street in the hot sun with an old cracked wall to the left of herall that was real perfectly real so perhaps today was the day when the photographs became real too the day when she finally found her way to a man of flesh and blood to a todd who would return her look finally see her and smile at her the thought made her quicken her step and she arrived at the gates breathing a little faster exhilarated by the prospect that with the hazards she imagined the house contained there was one possibility she could not properly imagine the image of her idol appearing before her and her with so much to say she wouldnt know where to begin ten she scanned the area around the gates in search of the inevitable security cameras but to her surprise found none they were either extremely well concealed or else the owners of this house were so certain that their canyon was safe from visitors that they didnt feel the need of them more surprisingly still the gates had no locks she was able to push one of them open wide enough for her to slip through she could see some of the house from where she stood though it was mostly hidden by the great riot of shrubs and trees that lined the curving driveway caputos car was parked close to the front door the trunk was open and he was now unloading his loot she wished shed brought a camera then she could have simply photographed him in the middle of his illicit transaction and left with her evidence but as it was she felt obliged to get a little closer and find out who he was dealing with if she didnt have some further evidence it was going to end up being his word against hers and she after all was the trespasser here her accusations werent going to carry much weight unless she could be very specific about what she had witnessed she waited until caputo had gone into the house and then crept towards the front door covering perhaps half the distance between door and gate before the thief strode out of the house again and returned to the car she ducked for cover behind a bird of paradise its sickly sap gummy beneath her heels from there she watched while caputo hauled another load of booty up out of the trunk as he did so there was a shout from inside the house the voice curiously muted marco this pictures cracked shit marco set down the box he was lifting from the trunk and went back to the doorstep as he did so the owner of the picture and of that curiously muffled voice came out of the house the sight of him made tammys heart quicken first he was shirtless his slacks hanging low on his hips his torso was tanned but far from trim he looked to have a body that had once been well cared for but was now quickly going to seed the muscles of his upper arms were soft and he had the beginnings of lovehandles spilling over his belt his face was swathed in bandages they werent tight to his skull like the bandaging on a mummy they were more irregular patches of gauze held against his cheeks and brow and jaw and neck with lengths of bandaging running all the way around his head to secure them and locks of his lush dark hair stuck up out of the bandages like tufts from the pate of a clown all in all that was what he resembled with his illfitting pants and his little paunch something from a circus part clown part freak he lifted up the picture for marco to see look its just the glass thats cracked easy fix youre careless i said id get it fixed boss thats not the point youre fucking careless only as the clown returned into the house dropping the offending picture against the doorjamb for marco to pick up did tammy realize who shed just seen it was todd oh my lord it was todd standing there on the doorstep with his face all bandaged up and his stomach hanging over his trousers tammy heard herself gasping she put her hand over her mouth to silence the sound but she neednt have bothered the mens fractious exchange had escalated into an argument loud enough to drown out any noise she might make youre so fucking clumsy some of the stuff slipped off the back seat thats all no big deal it was an accident well theres too many fucking accidents around here for my liking heyi said im sorry its a picture of the house where i was born yeah well ill get a new frame for it on monday the exchange about the broken glass apparently came to a halt there tammy watched while caputo stood on the step staring into the house muttering something under his breath whatever it was it wasnt for todds ears he was just quietly letting off steam he leaned on the car lit a cigarette and soothed himself with a smoke tammy didnt dare move even though caputo wasnt looking directly at her there was a better than even chance that hed catch sight of her if she broke cover all she could do was stay where she was her mind filled with feverish explanations for what shed just seen obviously something horrible had happened to todd but what her first thought was that one of his exgirlfriends had tried to harm him either that or thered been some kind of accident whatever it was he was in terrible pain or else why would he be acting the way he just had her heart went out to him and to be stuck up here in this godforsaken place with only that cretin caputo for company it would drive anybody crazy finally caputo dropped his cigarette ground it out and went back to his work tammy waited until hed disappeared inside the house and stepped out of her hiding place what now back to the gate up the street to her car and away clearly that was the most sensible thing to do but that would mean leaving without finding what was wrong with her poor todd she couldnt do that it was as simple as that she couldnt do it she was going to have to find a way into the house and then discover some means to speak to him before caputo intervened obviously the front door wasnt the way to go not with the thug standing right there she was going to have to try around the back she retraced her sticky steps a few yards and then crossed to the corner of the house a paving stone path led down the flank of the house it was a narrow steep descent and it plainly hadnt been used in many years roots had cracked the stones and shrubbery choked the path in several places it took her fully ten minutes to make her cautious descent but it delivered her into a far more beautiful spot than shed expected somebody had once created a wonderful garden back here and now with spring early this year throughout the state the place was glorious everywhere there were bursts of brilliant colorand hummingbirds going from flower to flower and butterflies drying their newlyexposed wings to the sun the beauty of the place put all thoughts of jeopardy out of tammys head at least for a few moments she made her way through the bushes to what had once been an enormous lawnthough there were so many wild flowers in the tall grass and so much grass sprouting in the border that lawn and border had become virtually indistinguishableand looked back up at the house her gaze going from window to window balcony to balcony to see if there was anybody watching her she saw nobody so she grew a little more confident and strode out into the middle of the lawn so that she could get herself a good look at the house it was much larger than shed assumed from the front and even in its dilapidated state it was an elegant place the curves of its balconies echoing one another the ironwork of its railings delicate that said it was a strange house for todd to be living in she knew how hard hed worked to perfect his residence in bel air so why was he here there could only be one explanation he was in hiding he didnt want anyone to see him in his wounded state she understood the logic of that there were some peoplesome of his fanswho wanted to think he was perfect luckily she wasnt one of those people far from it the fact that he was here all locked away hurting and angry made her feel all the more love for him if she got a chance shed tell him so if hed let her shed peel those stifling bandages off his face she didnt care what he looked like underneath it was still her todd wasnt it still the man she idolized for once the fact that her breasts were too big would be a godsend theyd be a comfortable place for him to lay his hurt head she could rock him and keep him there safe and sound from the corner of her eye she saw something move in the foliage the blissful imaginings fled very slowly she looked towards the shrubs where shed seen the motion the sun was bright the shadows dark and solid the leaves shook in the light breeze was that what shed seen the leaves shaking apparently so for there was nothing else visible she returned her gaze to the house looking for the best way for her to get in there were no open windows on the garden levelat least none that she could seeand the doors all looked to be securely locked she pushed her way through a line of shrubs so as to see if the house was any more vulnerable elsewhere but the foliage grew thicker around her as she proceeded and then she somehow managed to become disorientated because when she turned back to try another way she found that shed lost sight of both the lawn and the house she felt like alice suddenly shrinking away the flowers around her were huge like sunflowers only purple and scarlet and the scent they gave off was achingly sweet they grew so tall however and in such preternatural numbers that she could not see the house at allnot a chimney pot not a balcony her only hope was to make a guess at the direction in which the house lay which she did plunging on through the enormous blooms but her guesswork was hopelessly amiss the shrubbery simply thickened the sunflowers giving way to bushes whose branches carried bellshaped yellow blossoms almost the size of her head she couldnt yell for help of course that would bring caputo running she had no choice but to head on in the same hopeless fashion until at last the thicket cleared somewhat and she had sight of the sky again emerging from the shrubbery she was instantly on her guard in case shed come to a place where she could be spotted but she neednt have worried her travels had brought her down the hill and put a line of cypress trees between herself and the house only one reasonably sensible option presented itself directly ahead of her was a narrow pathwayas overgrown as the one that had brought her down the side of the house she had no idea where it led but it was a pathway it implied that others had been here before her perhaps in the same predicament and this trail of trodden ground marked their exit if it had worked for them why not for her pulling pieces of twig and blossom from her hair and blouse as she went she followed the path she suddenly had a mental picture of herself in her present state what a sight she must be stumbling out of the greenery like some crazed explorer what the hell was she thinking of out there on the open street it had been easy to talk herself into this trespass now she was beginning to think the whole idea wasnt so smart it wasnt the fact that she was lost in the environs of the house that discomfited her shed find her way back to the street eventually nor was she particularly concerned about the threat posed by caputo not now that she knew todd was here caputo might yell a bit and threaten her with the police if she didnt leave but he was more bark than bite no what had brought her to a halt was the distinct sense that she wasnt alone out here in the undergrowth there was somebody close by she couldnt see anybody but the feeling was too strong to be ignored she slowly started to turn on her heel viewing the scene around her whoever you are she said doing her best to keep her voice as quiet and nonconfrontational as possible please show yourself there was a motion in the undergrowth five or six yards from where she stood somebodyor somethinghad apparently moved from their hiding place there was more than one creature in the vicinity she guessed it was several there was foliage moving all around her now as though those hiding in the shrubbery were getting ready to show themselves she started walking again faster than before and her walking brought her into a place where the shrubbery cleared a little presenting her with a most unexpected sight there were perhaps seven or eight cages arranged on either side of a wide flagged walkway they varied in size the largest might have housed two horses and left some room for maneuver the smallest was perhaps half that size vines had wrapped themselves around the bars and fell here and there in tattered green curtains as though to conceal what lay inside the cages in fact there was nothing to conceal the occupants of this menagerie had long since disappeared she moved down the walkway cautiously increasingly certain that her stalkers were matching her motion step by step on the other side of the cages some of the cages had high wooden bars which suggested theyd housed small monkeys others were built more robustly their bars twice or three times the thickness what kind of animal had been held in a cage like this it was too small to comfortably accommodate a rhinoceros or even a bear or tiger and in a day rife with unanswered questions here was another one what had happened to the occupants of this tawdry private zoo was there a graveyard somewhere in the thicket where the animals had been laid to rest or had their owner set them free to roam the canyon she was almost at the end of the walkway now the final cage on her right was in a much better state than the others foliage had been interwoven with the bars so cunningly that there was practically nothing of the interior visible its gate which was similarly covered stood a little ajar tammy peered in the air inside smelled of some subtle perfume its source the candles which were set in a little cluster at the far end of the cage there was a small cot set against the wall to her right somewhat incongruously made up with two oversized red silk pillows and a dirty yellow comforter there was a chair and a tiny table on the other side of the cage and on the table paper and pen beside the cot there was an upended wooden box which also functioned as a table books were piled high upon it but her attention didnt linger on the books it was drawn to the cluster of candles at the far end of the cage there was a kind of altar there roughly made set on a few pieces of wood raised up on rocks in the middle of the altar was what tammy first thought was a piece of sculpture representing the face of a beautiful young woman when she got closer to it however she saw that it was a lifemask the mouth carried an ohsosubtle smile and there was a slight frown on the subjects otherwise perfect brow such beauty whoever this woman wasor had beenit was easy to understand why shed been elected for this place of honor in the candlelight it was the kind of face that made you gape at its perfection the kind the camera loved ah now the mysteries of this house and place began to seem more soluble was this beauty the owner of this oncegreat house remembered here by some obsessive fan was this shrine made out of devotion for a woman whod walked in these gardens once upon a time tammy took another step towards the altar and saw that besides the lifemask there were a number of other smaller items set there a scrap of red silk one edge of it hemmed a cameo brooch with the same womans face carved in creamy stone a little wooden box scarcely larger than a matchbox which presumably held some other treasure and lying flat beneath all of these a cutout paper doll about twelve inches tall of a woman dressed in the frilly underwear of a bygone era the paper from which the doll was made had yellowed the colors of the printing faded it was something from the twenties tammy guessed her knowledge of that era of cinema was sketchy but the three faces one of cardboard one of plaster one of stone teased her she knew the woman whose image was thricefold copied here shed seen her flickering black and white picture on some latenight movie channel she tried to put a name to the face but nothing came despairing of the puzzle she took a step back from the altar and as she did so she felt a rush of cool air against the back of her neck she turned completely unprepared for what met her gaze a man had come into the cage behind her entering so silently he was literally a foot from her and she hadnt heard his approach there were places in the leafed and barred roof where the sun broke through and it fell in bright patches upon him one of them fell irregularly upon his face catching both his eyes and part of his nose and the corner of his mouth she saw immediately that it wasnt caputo it was a much older man his eyes despite the sun that illuminated them gray cold and weary his hair what was left of it grown out to shoulder length and quite white he was gaunt but the lack of flesh on his skull flattered him he looked she thought like a saint in her grandmothers old bible which had been illustrated with pictures by the old masters this was a man capable of devotion indeed addicted to it he raised his hand and put a homemade cigarette to his lips then with a kind of oldfashioned style he flicked open his lighter lit the cigarette and drew deeply on it and who might you be he said his voice was the color of his eyes im sorry tammy said i shouldnt be here please he said gently let me be the judge of that he drew on the cigarette again the tobacco smelled more pungent than any cigarette shed ever inhaled id still like your name tammy lauper like i said youre sorry yes you dont mean to be here no you got lost i daresay its so easy in the garden i was looking for todd ah the stranger said glancing away at the roof for a moment the cigarette smoke was blue as it rose through the slivers of sun so youre with mr picketts entourage well no not exactly meaning i justwell he knows me but he doesnt know youre here thats right the mans gaze returned to tammy and he assessed her his gaze though insistent oddly polite what are you to our mr pickett he said a mistress of his once tammy couldnt help but smile at this first the very thought of it then the word itself mistress like the flick of his lighter it was pleasantly oldfashioned and rather flattering i dont think todd pickett would look twice at me she said feeling the need to be honest with this sad grey man then that would be his loss the man replied the compliment offered so lightly that even if it wasnt meant it was still beguiling out of nowhere she remembered a phrase her mother had used to describe jimmy mackintosh the man shed eventually divorced tammys father to pursue he could charm the birds of the trees that one shed never met a man with that kind of charisma before in the flesh but this man had it though their exchange so far had been brief and shallow she knew a birdcharmer when she met one may i ask ask away who are you by all means one name deserves another im willem zeffer im pleased to meet you tammy said again im sorry she made a halfhearted glance over her shoulder at the altar i shouldnt have come in here you werent to know its easy to get lost in thisjungle we should have it all cut back he smiled thinly you just cant get the staff these days that woman tammy said the one in the mask in the mask zeffer said oh i see yes in the mask who is she he stepped to the side in order to have a dear view of the altar and what was upon it she was an actress he explained many many moons ago i thought i recognized her her names katya lupi yes the name rang a bell but tammy still couldnt name any of the movies this woman had been in was she very famous very shes up there with pickford and swanson and theda bara or she was shes dead no no just forgotten at least thats my impression i dont get out into the world any more but i sense that the name katya lupi doesnt mean very much youd be right well shes lucky she still has her little dominion here in coldheart canyon coldheart thats what they called the place she was such a heartbreaker you see she took so many loversespecially in the early yearsand when she was done with them she just threw them aside were you one of them zeffer smiled i shared her bed a little when i first brought her to america but she got tired of me very quickly what then i had other uses so she kept me around but a lot of the men who loved her took her rejection badly three committed suicide with bullets a number of others with alcohol some of them stayed here where they could be close to her including me its foolish really because theres no way back into her affection why would you want to beback i mean tammy said she must be very old by now oh time hasnt staled her infinite variety as the bard has it shes still beautiful tammy didnt want to challenge the man given that he was plainly besotted with this lupi woman but the idol of his heart must be approaching a hundred years of age by now it was hard to imagine how any of her beauty remained well i guess i should be getting along tammy said she gently pressed past zeffer who put up no resistance and stepped out of the cage onto the walkway it was so quiet she could hear her stomach rumble her westwood breakfast seemed very remote now as did the little diner where shed eaten it zeffer came after her out into the open air and she saw him clearly for the first time he had been extremely handsome once she thought but his face was a mess he looked as though hed been attacked punched repeatedly raw in places pale and powdery in others he had the appearance of a man who had suffered intensely and kept the suffering inside where it continued to take its toll she couldnt make quite so hurried an attempt to abandon him now that shed seen him plainly he seemed to read her equivocation and suggested that she stay are you really in such a hurry he looked around him as he spoke he seemed to be reading the peculiar stillness in the air perhaps we could walk together a ways it isnt always safe up here before she could ask him what he meant by this he turned his back to the door of the cage and picked up a large stick that was set there the way he wielded it suggested hed used it as a weapon in the past and had some expectation of doing so again now animals she said he looked at her with those sorrowful gray eyes of his sometimes animals yes sometimes worse i dont understand perhaps with respect it would be better not to try he advised the stillness seemed to be deepening around them the absence of sound becoming heavier if that were possible she didnt need any further encouragement from zeffer to stay close to him whatever this stillness hid she didnt want to face it alone just take it from me that coldheart canyon has some lessthanpretty occupants something behind the cages drew zeffers attention tammy followed the direction of his gaze what were the cages for she asked him katya went through a phase of collecting exotic animals we had a little zoo here a white tiger from india though he didnt live very long later there was a rhinoceros that also perished wasnt that cruel keeping them here i mean the cages look so small yes of course it was cruel shes a cruel woman and i was cruel for doing her bidding i have no doubt of that i was probably unspeakably cruel in my casual way but it takes the experience of living like an animal he glanced back at the cage to realize the misery they must have suffered tammy watched him scrutinizing the shrubbery on the far side of the cages whats out there she said is it animals that come here zeffer said his voice suddenly dropping to an urgent whisper quickly though she still saw nothing in the shrubbery she did as she was told as she did so there was a blast of icy air down the narrow channel between the cages and she saw several formshuman forms but distorted as though they were in a windtunnel their mouths blown into a dark circle lined with needle teeth their eyes squeezed into dotscome racing towards her dont you dare she heard zeffer yell at her side and saw him raise his stick if he landed a blow she didnt see it the breath was knocked from her as two of her attackers threw themselves upon her one of them put a hand over her face a spasm of energy passed through her bone and brain erupting behind her eyes it was more than her mind could take she saw a white light like the light that floods a cinema screen when the film breaks the cold went away in the same instant sounds and sights and all the feelings they composed gone the last thing she heard dying away was willem zeffers voice yelling damn you all then he too was gone in the passageway in front of katyas longabandoned menagerie willem zeffer watched as the forces that had broken cover carried tammy lauper away into their own horrid corners of the canyon leaving himas he had been left so often in this godless placehelpless and bereft he threw the stick down on the ground his eyes stinging with tears then the strength ran out of him completely and he went down on his knees at the threshold of his hovel cursing katya she wasnt the only one to blame of course he had his own part to play in this tragic melodrama as hed admitted moments before but he still wanted katya damned for what shed done as he was damned for the death of tigers and rhinoceros and the murder of innocent women part four live after fame one three days after tammy had pursued marco caputo up sunset boulevard and into the mysterious arms of coldheart canyon was oscar night the night of nights the show of shows when billions of people across the world turned their eyes on tinseltown and tinseltown did a pirouette and a curtsey and pretended it was a lady not a fivebuck whore todd had known from the start that there was no chance of his attending the ceremony though he could now see that his wounded face was indeed healing properly it was plain that he was in no condition to step into the limelight anytime soon he had briefly considered hiring one of the great makeup men of the city to disguise the worst of the discoloration but maxine quickly dissuaded him such a plan would require them to share their secret with somebody else and there was always the chance that however good the coverup was the illusion of perfection would be spoiled under the blaze of so many lights all it required was one lucky photographer to catch a crack in the painted mask and all their hard work would be undone the rumormill would grind into motion again anyway she reminded him you loathe the oscars this was indeed true the spectacle of selfcongratulation had always sickened him the ghastly parade of nervous smiles as everyone traipsed into the dorothy chandler pavilion the shrill laughter the sweaty glances then once everyone was inside the circus itself the lame jokes the gushing speeches the tears the ego there was always a minute or two of choreographed mawkishness when the academy carted out some antiquated star and gave them a last chance to flicker occasionally when the taste level plummeted further than usual the academy chose some poor soul whod already been stricken by a stroke or was in the early stages of alzheimers thered be a selection of clips from the poor victims great pictures then fumbling and bewildered he or she would be led out to stand alone on the stage while the audience rose to applaud them and you could see in their eyes that this was some kind of hell to have their finest moments thrown up on a screentheir faces strong and shiningand then have the spotlight show the world what age and disease had done to them youre right hed said to maxine i dont want to be there so why if he truly didnt want to be there was he sitting at his bedroom window tonight staring down the length of the canyon towards the city feeling so damn sorry for himself why had he started drinking and drinking hard at noon and by twothirtywhen he knew the first limousines were beginning to roll up to the pavilionwas he in the depths of despair why he asked himself would he want to keep company with those hollow sour people hed fought the battle to get to the top of the hollywood hill long ago and hed won it hed had his face plastered up on ten thousand billboards across america across the world hed been called the handsomest man in the world and believed it hed walked into rooms the size of football fields and known that every eye was turned in his direction and every heart beat a little faster because hed appeared just how much more adulation did a man need the truth another hundred rooms filled with people stupefied by worship would not be enough to satisfy the hunger in him nor another hundred hundred he needed his face plastered on every wall he passed his movies lauded to the skies his arms so filled with oscars he couldnt hold them all it was a sickness in him but what was he to do there was no cure for this emptiness but love love in boundless amounts the kind of love god himself would be hardpressed to deliver as the cloudless sky darkened towards night he started to pick out the klieg lights raking the clouds not from the pavilion itself but from the many locations around the city where his peers both prizewinners and losers would in a few hours come to revel members of the press were already assembling at these sacred sitesmortons spagos the roosevelt hotelready to turn their cameras on the slick and the stylishly unkempt alike a smile a witticism a look of glee from those burdened with victory theyd have it all in the morning editions picturing the scene was too much for him he got up and went down to the kitchen to fix himself another drink by now he was on the second cycle of intoxication having drunk himself past the point of nausea by midafternoon he was moving inexorably towards a deep luxurious drunkenness the kind that flirted with oblivion hed suffer for it for whatever part of tomorrow he saw of course and probably the day after that he was no longer young enough or resilient enough to shrug off the effects of a binge like this but right now he didnt give a rats ass he simply wanted to be insulated from the pain he was feeling as he opened the immense fridge to get himself ice he heard or thought he heard somebody a woman say his name he stopped digging for the ice and looked around the kitchen was empty he left the fridge open and went back to the door the turret was also deserted and the dining room dark the empty table and chairs silhouetted against the window he walked on through it into the living room calling for marco he flipped on the light the fiftylamp chandelier blazed illuminating an empty room there were several boxes of his belongings sitting there still unopened moved from bel air but still unpacked but that was all he was about to go back to the kitchen assuming the voice hed heard alcoholinduced when he heard his name called a second time he looked back into the dining room was he going crazy marco he yelled there was a long empty moment somewhere in the darkness of the canyon a solitary coyote was yelping then came the sound of a door opening and he heard marcos familiar voice yes boss i heard somebody calling in the house yeah i thought so a womans voice marco appeared on the stairs now looking down at his employer with an expression of concern you okay yeah i just got unnerved is all you want me to go check around yeah i guess so i dont even know where it was coming from but i heard somebody i swear marco whod emerged from his bedroom in his boxers headed back upstairs to get dressed todd went back to the kitchen feeling a little stupid there wasnt going to be anybody here inside the house or out every stalker every voyeur every obsessive was canvassing the crowds around the pavilion looking for a way to slide past the security guards under the velvet rope and into the company of their idols they werent wasting their time stumbling around in the darkness hoping for a glance of todd pickett all fucked up nobody even knew he was here for christs sake worse nobody cared as he returned to the business of making his drink he heard marco coming down back the stairs and was half tempted to tell him to forget it but he decided against it no harm in letting one of them feel useful tonight he dropped a handful of icecubes into his glass and filled it up with scotch took a mouthful topped it up took another mouthfuland the voice came again if there had been some doubt in his head as to whether hed actually heard the call or simply imagined it there was now none somebody was here in the house calling to him it seemed to be coming from the other side of the hallway he set his drink down on the counter and quietly crossed the kitchen the turret was deserted there was nobody on the stairs either above or below he took the short passageway down to what marco had dubbed the casino an immense woodpaneled room lit by a number of lowslung lights which indeed looked as though it had been designed to house a roulette wheel and half a dozen poker tables judging by the distance of the voice it seemed the likeliest place for whoever had spoken to be lurking as he walked down the passageway it briefly occurred to him that to make this investigation without marco at his side was foolishness but the drink made him bold besides it was only a woman hed heard he could deal with a woman the door of the casino stood open he peered in the windows were undraped a few soft panels of gray light slid through them illuminating the enormity of the place he could see no sign of an intruder but some instinct instructed him not to believe the evidence of his eyes he wasnt alone here the skin of his palms pricked so curiously did the flesh beneath his bandages as though it were especially susceptible in its newborn state whos there he said his voice less confident than hed intended at the far end of the room one of the pools of light fluttered something passed through it raising the dust whos there he said again his hand straying to the light switch he resisted the temptation to turn it on however instead he waited and watched whoever this trespasser was she was too far from him to do any harm you shouldnt be in here he said gently you do know that dont you again that subtle motion on the other end of the room but he still couldnt make out a figure the darkness beyond the pool of light was too impenetrable why dont you step out where i can see you he said suggested this time he got an answer i will she told him in a minute who are you my names katya how did you get in here through the door like everybody else she said her tone was one of gentle amusement it would have annoyed todd if there hadnt also been a certain sweetness there he was curious to see what she looked like but the more he pressed her he thought the more shed resist so he kept the conversation off the subject and casually wandered across the immaculately laid and polished floor as he talked it must have been hard to find me he said not at all she said i heard you were coming from jerry you know jerry oh yes we go way back he used to come up here when he was a child you made a good choice with him todd he keeps secrets really i always thought he was a bit of a gossip it depends if its important or not he never mentioned me to you did he no you see oh yes and hes dying i suppose he didnt mention that either no he didnt well he is he has cancer inoperable he never said a thing todd said thinking not only of jerry but of sick silent dempsey well why would he to you of all people he idolizes you her familiarity with jerry and her knowledge of his sickness only added to the puzzle of her presence did he send you up here todd said no silly the woman replied he sent you ive been here all the time you have where oh i mostly stay in the guesthouse she spoke so confidently he almost believed her but then surely if she were occupying the guesthouse brahms would have warned maxine he knew how important todds security was why would he let maxine see the property and not mention the fact that there was somebody else living in the canyon he was about halfway across the room now and he could now see his visitors outline in the darkness her voice had not misled him she was a young woman elegantly dressed in a long silver gown highlighted with sinuous designs in gold thread it shimmered as though it possessed a subtle life of its own how long have you been staying here he said to her a lot longer than you she replied really well of course when i first met jerry id been heretwenty twentyfive years this was an absurd invention of course even without seeing her clearly it was obvious she was less than thirty probably considerably less but you said jerry was a boy when you met him todd said thinking hed quickly catch the woman in her lie he was so you cant have known him i know it doesnt seem very likely but things are different here in the canyon youll see if you stay that is and i hope you will you mean buy the house no i mean stay why would i do that he said there was a moments pause then finally she stepped into the light because i want you to she replied it was a moment from a movie timed to perfection the pause the move the line and the face that was from a movie too in its luxury in its perfection her eyes were large and luminous green flecked with lilac their brightness was enhanced by the darkness of her eyeshadow and the thickness of her lashes neither her nose nor her mouth were delicate her lips were full her chin robust her cheekbones high almost slavic her hair was black and fell straight down framing her face she wore plenty of jewelry and it was all exquisite one necklace lay tightly in the valley of her throat anothermuch much looserfell between her breasts her earrings were gold her braceletsseveral on each wristall elaborately wrought yet she carried all this effortlessly as though shed been wearing a queens ransom in jewelry all her life im sure you could find plenty of company besides me todd replied im sure i could she replied but i dont want plenty of company i want you todd was totally bewildered now no part of this puzzle fitted with any other the woman looked so poised so exquisite but she spoke nonsense she didnt know him she hadnt chosen him hed come up here of his own free will to hide himself away yet she seemed to insinuate that he was here at her behest and that somehow she intended to make him stay it was all pure invention still she didnt look crazy anything but she looked in fact as though shed just stepped out of her limo at the pavilion and was about to walk down the red carpet to a roar of adulation from the crowd he wouldnt have minded being beside her either if she had been taking that walk they would have made quite a couple you havent looked around the house very much she said how do you know ohi have eyes everywhere she teased if youd been in some of the rooms in this house id know about it believe me i dont find any of this very comforting he said i dont like people spying on me i wasnt spying she said her tone going from pleasing to fierce in a heartbeat well what would you call it id call it being a good hostess making sure your guest is comfortable i dont understand no she said more softly now you dont but you will when weve had a chance to spend some time with one another youll see whats really going on here and whats that she halfturned from him as though she might leave which was the last thing he wanted her to do you know maybe wed be better leaving this for another night she said no he said hurriedly she halted but didnt turn back im sorry he said they were rare words from his mouth truly she said still she didnt turn he found himself longing to feel her gaze on him as thoughabsurd as this wasshe might go some way to filling the void in him please he said im truly sorry all right she said apparently placated she looked back at him youre forgiven for now so tell me what ive missed in the house oh all that can wait at least give me a clue have you been downstairs i mean all the way down to the bottom no then dont she said lowering her head and looking up at him with a veiled gaze ill take you there myself take me now he said thinking it would be a good opportunity to find out how real all her claims were no not tonight why not its oscar night so so its got you all stirred up look at you you think you can drink the pain away it doesnt work everyone heres tried that at some point or other everyone in the canyon there are a lot of people here who are feeling exactly like you tonight and hows that oh just wishing theyd had a few prizes for their efforts well they dont give oscars to actors like me why not i guess they dont think im very good and what do you think he mused on this for a moment then he said most of the time im just being me i guess thats a performance katya said people think its easy but its not being yourselfthats hard it was strange to hear it put that way but she was right it wasnt easy playing yourself if you let your attention drop for a moment there was nothing there for the camera to look at nothing behind the eyes hed seen it in his own performances and in those of others moments when the concentration lapsed for a few seconds and the unforgiving lens revealed a vast vapidity i know how it hurts she said not to be appreciated i get a lot of other stuff you know the other stuff being money yes and celebrity and half the time you think it doesnt matter anyway theyre all ignoramuses at the academy voting for their friends what do you want from them but youre not really convinced in your heart you want their worthless little statues you want them to tell you they know how much you work to be perfect he was astonished at this she had articulated what hed felt on a decade of oscar nights an absurd mixture of contempt and envy it was as though she was reading his mind how did you figure all that out because ive felt the same things you want them to love you but you hate yourself for wanting it their love isnt worth anything and you know it but you still want it you still want it damn meaning yes yes thats it you got me it felt good for once to be understood not the usual nodding whateveryousaymrpickett bullshit but some genuine comprehension of the mess inside him which made the mystery of its source all the stranger one minute she was telling him lies the next she was seeing into his soul if you really do own this house he said why dont you live in it because there are too many memories here she said simply good and bad i walk in here and she smiled though the smile was thin its filled with ghosts so why not move away out of coldheart canyon i cant are you going to tell me why another time this is a bad time to tell that story she passed her delicate hand over her face and for a moment as the veil of her fingers covered her features he saw her retreat from her beauty as though for a moment the performance of selfhood was too much for her you ask me a question he suggested her hand dropped away the light shone out of her face again you swear youll answer me truthfully if i do sure swear i said so does it hurt behind the bandages oh you said youd answer me i know and i will its uncomfortable ill tell you that but it doesnt really hurt anymore not like it used to i just wish id never messed with this i mean why couldnt i be happy the way i was because nobody is were always looking for something we havent got if we werent we wouldnt be human is that why you came spying on me he said matching her mischief with some of his own looking for something you havent got im sorry it was rude of me watching you i mean spying youve as much right to your privacy as i have to mine and its hard to protect yourself sometimes you dont know whos a friend and whos not that can make you crazy her eyes flashed and the playfulness was back then again sometimes its good to be crazy yes oh sure sometimes its the only thing keeps you sane youre obviously talking from experience of getting crazy once in a while sure im talking from intimate experience care to give me an example you dont want to know really you dont some of the things ive done in this very room tell me i wouldnt know where to begin her gaze flitted off around the room as though she was looking for some cue for her memories if it was an act it was a very good one in fact this whole performance was looking better and better finally she said we used to play poker here sometimes roulette marco and i figured that out sometimes she said her gaze returning to him i was the prize you me i dont think i understand you understand perfectly well youd give yourself to the winner see you understood i didnt do it every night im not that much of a slut she was smiling as she spoke lapping up his disbelief she began to walk towards him slowly matching her approach to the rhythm of her words but on the nights when you need to be crazy what did you give them a kiss pah a kiss as if id be satisfied with so little no down on the floor in front of the losers thats what id give them like dogs if we felt like it the way she stared at the ground as she spoke it was clear she was remembering something very specific the subtlest of motions went through her as though her body was recalling the sensation of pressing back against a man to take him all of him inside her supposing somebody won that you didnt like there was no such man not here in my house they were all gods beautiful men every single one some of them were crude at first but i taught them she was watching todd closely as she spoke measuring his response you like hearing this he nodded it wasnt quite the way hed expected this conversation to go but yes he liked her confessions he was glad his pants were baggy now that she was so close to him or shed have seen for herself how much he liked them so let me be sure i got this right the winner would fuck you right here on the ground not on the bare boards there used to be carpets beautiful persian carpets and there were silk cushions red ones which i kept in a heap over there i like to make love amongst cushions its like being held in somebodys hand isnt it she opened her cupped hand in front to demonstrate the comfort of it in gods hand she lifted the bed of her palm in front of his eyes and then without warning she reached out and touched his face he felt nothing through the bandages but he had the illusion that her hand was like a balm upon his cheek cooling his raw flesh does that hurt no do you want me to go on telling you yes please you want to hear what i did on the cushions yes but first i want to know who no not who why why lord in heaven why would i fuck because i loved it it gave me pleasure she leaned closer to him still stroking his cheek he could smell her throat on the breath she exhaled the air for all its invisibility was somehow enriched by its transport into her and out again he envied the men whod taken similar liberties in and out in and out wonderful i love to have a mans weight bearing down on me she went on to be pinned like a butterfly open and then when he thinks hes got you completely under his thumb roll him over and ride him she laughed i wish i could see the expression on your face its not pretty under there he paused a chilling thought on his lips the answers no she said the answer to what have i spied on you while your bandages were being changed no i havent good he took a deep breath wanting to direct the conversation away from talk of what was behind his mask go back to the game he said where was i riding the lucky sonofabitch horses dogs monkeys men make good animals women too sometimes women got to play not in here im very oldfashioned about things like that in romania a woman never played cards romania thats where youre from yes a little village called ravbac where i dont think any woman had ever had pleasure with a man is that why you left one of many reasons i ran away when i was barely twelve came to this country when i was fifteen made my first picture a year later what was it called i dont want to talk about it its forgotten so finish telling me about riding the men what else is there to say it was the best game in the world especially for an exhibitionist like myself you too what about me youve done it in front of people surely dont tell me you havent i wont believe you what the hell this woman had him all figured out pinned like a butterfly there didnt seem to be much purpose in denying it yes ive had a few public moments at private parties are you good it depends on the girl she smiled i think youd be wonderful with the right audience she said her hand dropped from his cheek and she started to walk back across the room weaving between imaginary obstacles as she picked up her erotic tale some nights i would simply walk naked amongst the tables while the men played they werent allowed to look at me if they looked i would thrash them and i mean thrash i had a whip for that i still have it the teroarea the terror sothat was one of the rules no looking at the prize no matter what it did to tempt them she laughed you can imagine i had a hundred ways once i had a little bell hooked through the hood of my clitoris tinkling as i walked somebody looked i remember and oh they suffered she was at the mantelpiece now reaching up and under the fireplace and took a long silverhandled switch from its hiding place she tested it on the air and it whined like a vengeful mosquito this is the teroarea i had it made by a man in paris who specialized in such things my name is chased into the handle she passed her thumb over the letters katya lupescu it says actually it says more it says this is her instrument to make fools suffer i regret having that written there really why because a man who takes pleasure in being given pain is not a fool hes simply following his instincts wheres the foolishness in that youre big on pleasure todd said she didnt seem to understand what he meant she cocked her head puzzled you talk about it a lot twice ive mentioned it she said but its been in my mind a little more than that why dont be coy she said a little sternly or ill beat you i might not like that oh you would really he said with just a touch of anxiety in his voice he could not imagine having that thing her terror give him pleasure however expertly it was wielded it can be gentle if i want it to be that he said gentle oh yes she made a scooping motion with her free hand if i have a mans sex in my palm here he got an instant and uncannily sharp picture of what she had in mind her victim on all fours and that scooping motion of hers the taking up of his cock and balls ready for her completely vulnerable completely humiliated hed never let a woman do anything like that to him however much she promised it was to give him pleasure i can see youre not convinced she said even when i dont have your face to look at so youll just have to take it on trust i could touch men with this and theyd shoot like sixteenyearolds even valentino valentino and he was queer rudolph valentino yes you didnt know he was that way no its justhes been dead a long time yes it was sad to lose him so quickly she said she obviously had no difficulty agreeing with him about how long the great lover had been deceased even though it made nonsense of her story we had a great party for him out on the lawn two weeks after hed been taken from us she turned away from him and laid the switch back on the mantelpiece i know you dont believe a word of what ive told you youve done the mathematics and none of its remotely possible she leaned on the mantelpiece her chin on the heel of her hand what have you decided that im some kind of trespasser a little sexually deranged but essentially harmless i suppose something like that hmm she mused on this for a moment then she said youll change your mind eventually but theres no hurry ive waited a long time for this this you us she left the thought there to puzzle him a moment then she turned the dusting of melancholy that had crept into her voice over the course of the last few exchanges brushed away she was bright again gleaming with harmless troublemaking have you ever done it with a man oh jesus so you have he was caught there was no use denying it onlytwice or three times you cant remember okay three times was it good ill never do it again so i guess thats your answer why are you so sure theres some things you can be that sure of he said then a little less confidently arent there even men who arent queer imagine other men sometimes yes well perhaps youre the exception to the rule perhaps youre the one the canyon isnt going to touch she started to walk back towards him but dont be too certain it takes the pleasure out of things maybe you should let a woman take charge for a while are we talking about sex valentino swore he only liked men but as soon as i took charge dont tell me he was like a naughty schoolboy no like a baby her hand went to her breast and she squeezed it catching the nipple in the groove between her thumb and forefinger as though to proffer it for todd to suckle he knew it wasnt smart to show too much emotion to the woman if there was some genuine streak of derangement in her it would only empower her more but he couldnt help himself he took half a step backwards aware that the trenches of his mouth were suddenly running with spit at the thought of her nipple in his mouth you shouldnt let your mind get between you and what your body wants she said she took her hand from her breast the nipple stood hard beneath the light fabric i know what my body wants really she said sounding genuinely surprised at the claim you know what it wants deep down all the way down to the very darkest place he didnt reply she reached out and took gentle hold of his hand her fingers were cold and dry his were clammy what are you afraid of she said not me surely im not afraid he said then come to me she told him softly ill find out what you want he let her draw him closer to her let her hands move up over his chest towards his face youre a big man she murmured her fingers were at his neck now whatever she was promising about discovering his desires he knew what she wanted she wanted to see his face and though there was a part of his mind that resisted the idea there was a greater part that wanted her to see him for better or worse he let her hands go up to his jawline let her fingers rest on the adhesive tape that held the mask of gauze against his wound may i she asked him is this what you came here to do she made a small totally ambiguous smile then she pulled at the tape it came away with a gentle tug he felt the gauze loosen he stared down into her face wonderingin this long moment before it was done and beyond savingif she would reject him when she saw the scars and the swelling a scene from that same silent horror movie hed seen in his minds eye many times since burrows had done his brutal work flickered in his head katya as the appalled heroine reeling away in disgust at what her curiosity had uncovered he the monster enraged at her revulsion and murderous in his selfcontempt it was too late to stop it now she was pulling at the gauze coaxing it away from the hurts it concealed he felt the cool air upon his wounds and cooler still her scrutiny the gauze dropped to the floor between them he stood there before her more naked than hed ever been in his lifeeven in nightmares of nakedness more nakedawaiting judgment she wasnt horrified she wasnt screaming wasnt flinching she simply looked at him without any interpretable expression on her face well he said he made a mess of you no doubt about that but its healing and if my opinion is worth anything to you id say youre going to be fine better than fine she took a moment to assess him further to trace the line of his jaw the curve of his temple but its never going to be perfect she said his stomach lurched here was the heart of it the bitter part nobody had wanted to admit to him not even himself he was spoiled perhaps just a little but a little was all it would take to shake him from his high perch his precious face his golden face the beauty that had made him the idol of millions had been irreparably damaged i know katya said youre thinking your life wont be worth living but thats just not true how the hell do you know he said smarting from the truth angered by her honesty because i knew all the great stars in the silent days and believe me the smart oneswhen they werent making the money any longerjust shrugged and said okay ive had my time what did they do then listen to yourself theres life after fame sure itll take some getting used to but people have perfectly good lives i dont want a perfectly good life i want the life i had well you cant have it she said very simply it was a long time since somebody had told todd pickett that he couldnt have something and he didnt like it he took hold of her wrists and pulled her hands away from his face a quick fury had risen in him he wanted to strike at her knock her stupid words out of her mouth you know you are crazy he said didnt i tell you she said making no attempt to touch him again some nights im so crazy im ready to hang myself but i dont you know why i made this hell for myself so its up to me to live in it isnt it he didnt respond to her he was still in a filthy rage about what shed said do you understand what im saying i think ive had it with your advice for the night he said so why dont you just go back wherever you came from in midsentence he heard marco calling boss are you okay where the hell are you he looked towards the door half expecting to see marco already standing there he wasnt todd then looked back at katya or whoever the hell she was the woman was retreating from him shaking her head as if to say dont tell its okay he yelled to marco where are you im fine go make me a drink ill meet you in the kitchen katya had already retreated to the far end of the room where the shadows from which she had originally emerged were enclosing her wait todd said his fury not yet completely abated he wanted to make sure the woman didnt leave thinking she would be allowed to come back come stalking him while he slept damn her but she had turned her back on him now ignoring his instruction so he went after her a door opened in the darkness ahead of him and he felt a wave of nightair cool and fragrant come in against his face he hadnt known that there was a door to the outside of the house at the far end of the casino but she was out through it in a heartbeat and by the time he reached the door she was gone leaving the shrubs shed brushed as she ran shaking he stepped over the threshold and looked around attempting to orient himself the path katya had taken led up the hill winding as it went back to the guesthouse no doubt that was where the crazylady was in residence shed made herself a nice little nest in the guesthouse well that was easily fixed hed just send marco up there tomorrow to evict her boss he walked back into the casino and stared down at the expanse of floor where shed had him picturing her making love hed believed her too a little at least his dick had marco was at the other end of the room what the hells going on he said todd was about to tell him there and thenabout to send him up the hill to oust the trespasserbut marco was bending down to gingerly pick something up from the ground it was todds discarded bandages you took em off he said yeah the rage hed felt started to seep out of him now as he remembered the tender way shed looked at him not judging him simply looking what happened boss i found another door he said rather lamely was there somebody here marco said i dont know he said maybe i was just wandering around and i came down here the door was open no no todd said he closed the door with a solid slam i just tried it and it was unlocked it needs a new lock then marco said his tone uncertain as though he was suspicious of what he was being told but playing along yes it needs a new lock okay they stood for a moment at opposite ends of the room in silence are you all right marco said after a pause yeah im fine you know pills n liquorll be the death of you im hopin todd replied his joviality as forced as marcos okay if you say youre okay youre okay im okay marco proffered the bandages what do you want me to do with these what do you think todd said getting back into the normal rhythm of their exchanges now the door was closed the woman and the path and the nodding shrubs were out of sight whatever shed said he could forget at least for tonight burn them wheres that drink im going to celebrate what are you celebrating me losing those damn bandages i looked like god knows what burrows might want you to keep em on fuck burrows if i want to take the bandages off its my choice its your face yeah todd said staring again at the ground where the crazy woman had claimed shed laid her body imagining her there its my face two maxine came up to the house the following afternoon to tell todd about the oscar festivities reporting it allthe ceremony itself then the partieswith a fine disregard for his tenderness several times he almost stopped her and told her he didnt want to hear any more but the dregs of curiosity silenced him he still wanted to know whod won and whod lost thered been the usual upsets of course the usual grateful tears from the usual surprised ingenues all but swooning away with gratitude this year thered even been fisticuffs an argument had developed in the parking lot at spagos between quincy martinaro a young fasttalking filmmaker whod made two movies been lionized and turned into a legendary ego all in the space of fifteen months and vincent dinny a vicious writer for vanity fair whod recently profiled martinaro most unflatteringly not that dinny was a paragon himself he was a waspish embittered man in his late sixties whohaving failed in his ascent of the hollywood aristocracyhad turned to writing about the towns underbelly nobody could have given a toss for his pieces had they not carried a certain sting of truth the piece on martinaro for instance had mentioned a certain taste for heroin which was indeed the mans vice of choice so who won todd wanted to know quincy broke two fingers when he fell against his car and dinny got a bloody nose so i dont know who won its all so ridiculous acting like children did you actually see them fighting no but i saw dinny afterwards blood all over his shirt there was a pause i think he knows something what he was quite civilized about it you know how he is shriveled up little prick he just said to me i hear todds had some medical problems and now youve got him under lock and key and i just looked at him said nothing but he knows this is so fucked i dont know how we deal with it frankly sooner or later hes going to suggest a piece to vanity fair and theyre going to jump on it so fucked todd said more quietly what the hell did i do to deserve this maxine let the question go then she said oh by the way do you remember tammy lauper no she runs the fan club oh yeah fat is she fat shes practically obese did she come to the office no i got a call from the police in sacramento asking if wed seen her shes gone missing and they think i might have absconded with her i dont know what they think the point is you havent seen her up here nope maybe over in bel air i havent been over in bel air ask marco yeah well i said id ask you and i asked todd went to the livingroom window and gazed out at the bird of paradise trees that grew close to the house they hadnt been trimmed in many years and were topheavy with flowers and rotted foliage their immensity blocking his view of the opposite hill but it didnt take much of an effort of imagination to bring the canyon into his minds eye the palmtrees that lined the opposite ridge the pathways and the secret groves the empty swimming pool the empty koi pond the statues standing in the long grass he was suddenly seized by an overwhelming desire to be out there in the warm sunshine away from maxine and her brittle gossip i gotta go he said to maxine go where i just gotta go he said heading for the door wait maxine said we havent finished business cant it wait no im afraid this part cant todd made an impatient sigh and turned back to her what is it ive been doing some thinking over the last few days about our working relationship what about it well to put it bluntly i think its time we parted company todd didnt say anything he just looked at maxine with an expression of utter incomprehension on his face as though shed just spoken to him in a foreign language then after perhaps ten seconds he returned his gaze to the birds of paradise you dont know how wearying it gets maxine went on waking up thinking about whether everythings okay with todd and going to sleep thinking the same damn thing not having a minute in a day when im not worrying about you i just cant do it anymore its simple as that its making me ill ive got high blood pressure high cholesterol ive made you a lot of money over the years todd broke in to observe and ive taken care of you its been a very successful partnership you made me rich i made you famous you didnt make me famous well if i didnt id like to know who the hell did me todd replied raising the volume of his voice just a fraction its me people came to see its me they loved i made myself famous dont kid yourself maxine said her voice a stone there was a long silence the wind brushed the leaves of the bird of paradise trees together like the blades of plastic swords being brushed together wait todd said i know what this is about youve got a new boy thats it isnt it youre fucking some kid and im not fucking anybody todd you fucked me twice a long time ago i wouldnt do it today well just for the record neither would i maxine looked at him coldly thats it ive said what i needed to say she went to the door todd called after her why do it to me now why wait till im so fucking tired i can hardly think straight his voice continued to get louder creeping up word on word syllable on syllable and then screw me up like this dont worry ill find somebody else to look after you ill train them youll be taken good care of its not like im walking out on you yes you are he turned to look at her finally the blood had rushed to the surface of his halfmended face it was grotesquely red you think im finished so youre leaving me to be crucified by every piece of shit journalist in the fucking country maxine ignored the outburst and picked up what she was saying ill find somebody to take over wholl protect you better than i can because im just as tired as you are todd then im going to have one last party down at the beachhouse and get the hell out of this city before it kills me well im not going to let you go oh now dont start threatening im not starting anything im just reminding you weve got a contract im not going to allow you to make a fortune out of me and then just walk away when things get difficult you owe me i what whatevers on the contract another two years i cant do it i wont do it then ill sue your ass for every fucking cent you earned off me you can try and ill win like i said you can try if you want all our dirty washing dragged out for everyone to see then do it i guarantee youll come out looking worse than i will ive covered for you so many times todd and you signed a confidentiality agreement if you break it ill sue you for breaking that too who cares nobody gives a rats ass about me im just a professional parasite youre the movie star youre the allamerican boy the one with the reputation to lose she paused then murmured almost ruminatively the tales i could tell i can tell just as many theres nothing anyone can call me that i havent been called a hundred times i know everyone says im a cunt thats what they say right how can you work with that fucking cunt if i have to hear it in a courtroom one more time i can take that as long as when its all over i dont have to hear your whining and complaining any more okay todd said if thats the way you want to play it maxine headed for the door for your information she said i could go down to lax right now and i could fill a limo with kids who have ten times your talent theyre all coming here looking to be the next tom cruise the next leonardo dicaprio the next todd pickett pretty boys with tight asses and nice abs wholl end up most ofem selling their tight asses on santa monica boulevard the lucky onesll end up waiters if i wanted to i could make any one of them a moviestar maybe not a star like you but then again maybe bigger right face right time right movie some of its luck some of its salesmanship the point is i sold you todd i told people you were going to be huge and i said it so often that it became the truth and you were so sweet back then sonatural you were the boy next door and yesfor your informationi was a little in love with you like everyone else but it didnt last long you changed i changed we both got rich we both got greedy she put her hand to her mouth and gently passed her fingers over her lips but you know what todd neither of us was ever happy am i right you were never happy even when you had everything youd every dreamed of wanting whats your point i dont know what the point is she said softly i guess thats the problem in a nutshell isnt it i dont know what the point is she stared into middle distance for a while youll be fine todd she said finally things will work out better without me youll see ill find someone to take care of you eppstadtll find a movie for you and youll be back in front of the cameras in a few months looking perfect if thats what you want why wouldnt i want that he said to her she looked at him wearily maybe because none of its worth a damn he knew he had a riposte for that he just couldnt figure out what it was at that particular moment and while he was trying to figure it out maxine turned her back on him and walked out he let her go what was the use of a feud that was for the lawyers besides he had more urgent business than trading insults with her he had to find katya the afternoon sun was not just warm it was hot and the foliage was busy with hungry hummingbirds and the canyon was quiet and perfect he threaded his way through the overgrown bushes past the tennis courts and the antique sundial up towards the guesthouse the gradient became quite steep after a time the narrow steps decayed by time and neglect so that in some spots theyd collapsed completely after a while he realized the path had divided at some earlier point and that hed taken the wrong turning the mistake took him on a picturesque tour of the gardens hidden places bringing him first to a small grove of walnut trees in the middle of which stood a large gazebo in an advanced state of disrepair and then into a garden within a garden bounded by an unkempt privet hedge here there were roses or rather the remains of last years blooms the bushes fighting for space and strangling each other in the process there was no way through the thorny tangle to pick up the path on the other side so he was obliged to try and get around the garden from the outside staying close to the hedge it was difficult to do though the plants he was striding through didnt have thorns they were still unruly and wild twigs and dead flowers scraped at his face his shirt was quickly soiled his sneakers filled with stony dirt by the time he got to the other side of the garden and took to the path again he was short of breath and patience and had two dozen little nicks and scratches to call his own his wanderings had brought him to a spot that offered a spectacular view he could see the big house below him surrounded by palms and birds of paradise he could see the baroque weathervane on the top of the gazebo hed passed on his way here and the orchid house which he had come upon on one of his earlier trips around the garden all this bathed in clear warm california light the crystalline light which had brought filmmakers here almost a century before not for the first time since coming to the house he had a pleasurable sense of history and a measure of curiosity as to the people who might once have walked here talked here what ambitions had they plotted as they ambled through these gardens had they been sophisticates or simpletons what little he knew about old hollywood hed heard from jerry brahms which meant hed only ever really been halflistening but he knew enough to be certain those times had been good at least for a man like himself douglas fairbanks and rudolph valentino charlie chaplin the barrymore clan and all the rest had been like royalty lording it over their new dominion in the west a beancounting prick like eppstadtwith his demographics and his endless corporate maneuveringwould have had no power in the world this canyon still preserved having caught his breath he now continued his ascent the shrubbery became denser the closer he got to the guesthouse he would have needed a machete to hack through it efficiently but lacking one had to do with a branch he picked up on his way the flowers gave up their perfume as he beat his way through them and he recognized their scent it was her scent the scent on katyas skin did she walk naked amongst them he wondered pressing the flowers against her body now that would be a sight to see the thought of this had stirred him up he actually had a hardon not an everyday order of hardon either but the kind that was so strong it actually hurt it was a long time since hed had a woodie so fierce and it added immeasurably to his sense of wellbeing with the guesthouse now in view he pressed towards his goal feeling curiously happily adolescent so what the hell if maxine was deserting him what the hell if hed never be a golden boy again he was still alive and kicking still had a stick in his hand and a woodie in his pants and the thought of katyas flower bath in his minds eye the thicket had finally thinned and he was at last delivered onto a small unkempt lawn the house before him was a twostory affair built in the same style as the main house simply on a much more modest scale above the door set into the stucco was a single tile with a man on a horse painted upon it he glanced up at it for only a moment then he pressed his flattened hand down the front of his jeans to push his erection into a less obvious position on the clock and knocked on the madwomans door three there was no reply from within nor any sound of movement in response to his knocking he knocked a second time and thenafter a short pausea third still there was no response so he tried the latch the door was unlocked he pushed it open and stepped out of the sunlight into the cool interior of the house at first glance he assumed that hed misunderstood what katya had told him and the house was not occupied after all merely used as a storage space of some kind the room before him which was large and highceilinged was little more than a junkroom filled with furniture and bricabrac but as his eyes became more accustomed to the murky light after the blaze of sun outside he began to make sense of what he was seeing yes the place was overfilled but the contents of the room were far from junk on the wall to the left hung an enormous tapestry depicting a scene of medieval revelry on the wall opposite was a series of white marble basreliefs that looked to have been filched from a roman temple in the far corner close to a great oak door were more slabs of stone these carved with hieroglyphics there was an elegant chaise longue in front of the massive fireplace and a table its legs elaborately carved with baroque grotesqueries stood in the middle of the room all of this had presumably been removed from the big house at some point but that hardly explained the strange confusion of periods and styles moving deeper into the room todd called out again to announce his presence again there was no reply he didnt linger now to study the furniture or the antiquities but crossed the room to the large oak door here again he knocked but receiving no reply he turned the carved handle and pushed the door open given its size hed expected it to be heavy but it wasnt on the other side was a wide hallway the walls of which were hung with white masks no not masks lifecasts white plaster faces all caught with that expression of eerie enforced repose that such masks always wore hed had similar things made of his own face by special effects men once for the facewound in gunner once for a bullet wound it was an eerie experience to look at the finished work this is what ill look like when im dead hed thought when hed been shown the final results there were thirty or forty masks displayed on the wall mostly of men he thought that he vaguely recognized some of the faces but he couldnt have put names to any of them they were all handsome some of them almost beautiful he remembered katyas crazy talk about the parties shed had in the house how shed seduced valentino was this collection the inspiration for that fantasy had she dreamed of fucking the famous because she had plaster copies of their faces up on her wall the door at the other end of the wall of lifemasks was like the last deceptively light this time he paused to puzzle out why and examining it a little more closely had his answer it was fake the large rusted nails werent iron at all but carved and stippled wood the patina of antiquity had been achieved by a skilled painter it was a door from a movieset all illusion and if the doors had been made that way what about the tapestry and the basreliefs and table carved with grotesqueries they were all most likely fakes stolen off a backlot or bought from a studio firesale none of it was real he pushed the door open and came into a second room this one much smaller than the first but just as cluttered on the wall opposite him hung a large mirror its gilt frame elaborately carved with naked figures men and women knotted together in configurations which looked both sensual and tormented he seldom let a mirror go by without putting it to use and even nowknowing he wouldnt like what he sawhe paused and assessed his reflection he was a sad sight his clothes in disarray from his trip through the shrubbery his face like an inept copy of its finer self he wondered if perhaps he shouldnt turn back he was in no condition to present himself to katya even as he was thinking about this the door to the left of the mirror creaked a little andcaught by the windopened a couple of inches forsaking his sorry reflection he went to the door and peered into the room beyond the sight before him put all thought of retreat from his mind inside was an enormous fourposter bed its columns decorated in the same lushly erotic style as the gilded frame of the mirror a swathe of dark purple velvet hung in ripe folds like a halfraised curtain the red pillows heaped on the bed were just as excessive creamy silk fringed with lace the sheet which was also silk was pulled back so that the sleeper was left uncovered it was katya of course there she lay facedown her hair unloosed her body naked he stood at the door enraptured the pillow she lay on was so soft and deep that her face was almost concealed but he could still see the high curve of her cheek the tender pink of her ear was she awake behind her pale lids he wondered her nakedness a deliberate provocation he suspected not there was something too artless about the way her legs were splayed too childlike about the way her hands were tucked up against her breasts and the final proof she was snoring if this was indeed a performance then that was a touch of genius the perfectly human thing which made all the rest so believable his eyes went to the cleft of her buttocks to the gloss of the hair that showed between her legs he was suddenly stupid with lust he took a step towards the bed the floor creaked under his weight but thankfully the noise wasnt loud enough to stir her he continued his approach his gaze fixed upon her face looking for the merest flutter of a lash but there was none she was deeply asleep and dreaming he was close enough now to see that her eyes were in motion behind her lids watching something happening in another place at the bedside he dropped down onto his haunches his left knee popping loudly there was a faint dusting of gooseflesh on her limbs he saw he couldnt resist the temptation to reach out and touch her skin as though he might smooth the gooseflesh away with his fingertips surely she would wake now he thought but no she slept on the only sign that she might be surfacing from sleep was the slowing of the motion of her pupils the dream was leaving her or she was departing from the dream he was suddenly alarmed what would she think if she woke to find him this close to the bed his intent so unquestionably voyeuristic perhaps he should go quickly before she woke but he couldnt bring himself to move an inch all he could do was kneel there like a suppliant his heart beating furiously his face a furnace then in her sleep she murmured something he held his breath trying to catch the words it wasnt english she was speaking it was an eastern european language probably her native romanian he could make no sense of what she was saying of course but there was a softness to the syllables a neediness which suggested they were supplications she turned her face up from the pillow and he saw that her expression was troubled her brow was furrowed and there were tears welling beneath her lids the sight of her distress bothered him it brought back memories of his mothers tears which hed watched her shed so often as a child tears shed by a woman left to raise her sons alone tears of frustrated rage sometimes but more often tears of loneliness dont he said to her softly she heard him speaking it seemed her entreaties grew quieter then she said willem no the frown nicking her brow deepened and her lids began to flutter she was waking up now no doubt of that he got to his feet and began to retreat to the door keeping his eyes fixed on her face only when he reached the door did he finally regretfully relinquish sight of her and turn away as he slipped through the door he heard her speak wait she said he was sorely tempted to exit rather than turn and face her but he resisted his cowardice and looked back towards the bed she had pulled the sheet a little way up to partially cover her nakedness her eyes were open and the tears her dreams had induced were now running down her cheeks despite them she was smiling im sorry todd said for what coming in here uninvited no she said sweetly i wanted you to come still i shouldnt have stayedwatching you its just that you were talking in your sleep well its nice to have somebody listening she said its a long time since anyone was with me when i slept she wiped the tears from her cheeks are you all right he asked her yes im fine were you having a bad dream i cant remember she said glancing away from him he knew from his acting coach what such glances indicated a lie she knew exactly what shed been dreaming about she just didnt want to tell him well that was her business god knows everybody was allowed their share of secrets what time is it she said he glanced at his watch almost fourthirty you want to go for a walk before it gets too dark she said sure she threw off her sheet and got up out of bed glancing up at todd as she did so as though to assure herself of his scrutiny im going to bathe first she said would you do me a little favour in the meantime sure go back to the gaming room where we met last night and dont tell me fetch your whip she smiled you read my mind as long as you promise not to be beating me with it nothing could be further from my mind she said okay ill get itbut no beating take your time theres still plenty of light in the sky he left her feeling oddly lightfooted pleased to have an errand from her what did that say about her relationship he wondered as he ran that he was naturally subservient ready to do her will at the snap of her fingers well if so so he found his way back down to the big house without difficulty marco heard him in the gaming room heavyfooted as ever and came to see what all the noise was about you okay thats all you ever ask am i okay yes im better than okay good only i heard from maxine fuck maxine so it doesnt bother you no we had a good run together now its over he picked up the switch from the mantelpiece what the hell is that what does it look like he beat the air two or three times the switch was beautifully balanced he could imagine learning how to use it with considerable cunning perhaps she would let him stroke her body with it marco studied him in silence for a few moments then he said you never told me why you took your bandages off were they too tight i didnt take them off she took them off whos she the woman who owns this house katya lupescu im sorry youve lost me todd smiled no more explanations he said youll meet her later i gotta go he left marco standing at the door with a befuddled expression on his face and headed out into the light again climbing the slope towards katyas house aware that he was behaving like a man whod just been given a new lease on life he didnt call her name as he entered this time he simply made his way through the rooms of fake relics the sound of running water came from the room adjacent to the bedroom apparently katya was still running her bath he paused and looked around the bedroom there were several enormous posters on the wall which he had not noticed until now framed posters onesheets for movies many decades old to judge by the stylized graphics and the yellowing of the paper they were printed on the same image dominated all seven posters that of a womans face she was represented in two of them as a waif a childwoman lost in a predatory world but in the others shed matured beyond the orphan and these were the images that reminded him of the woman hed met last nightan exquisite femme fatale glowering from the frames as she planned her next act of anarchy there was of course no question who the woman was her name was on the posters big and bold the sorrows of frederick starring katya lupi the devils bride starring katya lupi she is destruction starring katya lupi what the hell was he to make of this new piece of evidence of course it was possible that katya had paid to have seven posters representing fictitious films printed on aged paper and framed to look like objects of antiquity but it wasnt very likely was it possible this katya lupiwho bore such a resemblance to the katya he knewwas hardly the same woman at all but a granddaughter with an uncanny resemblance to her older relative it was a more plausible solution than any other he could think of certainly the flawless woman hed seen naked minutes before her face without so much as a wrinkle upon it could not be the woman whod starred in these movies there had to be some other explanation he was about to call out and announce his presence when he heard a soft intake of breath echoing off the bathroom walls he went quietly to the door and glanced in in a large oldfashioned ceramic bath halffilled with water lay katya her legs spread her hips lifted clear of the water so that he could see how her fingers slid inside her her eyes were closed not for the first time this afternoon todd could feel the head of his dick tapping out the rhythm of his pulse against the inside of his pants but he had no desire to interrupt katyas game he was perfectly happy to watch her her face in ecstasy her breasts clearing from the water as her body arched her legs lifted up and straddling the sides of the bath the mysteries of who she was and how she came to be here suddenly seemed absurdly irrelevant what the hell did it matter look at her did you bring it hed had his eyes on her cunt but when he looked back up at her face she was staring at him her expression fierce with need the teroarea did you bring it he was mortified with embarrassment but plainly she couldnt have cared less she had other priorities yes he said showing her the switch i brought it so use it what she lifted her hips even higher spreading her legs to give him a full view of her sex it was ripened by her own touches but also he knew from the anticipation of his return touch it she said lightly his target stood proud of its hood presented for his delectation please she begged he took four steps to the bottom of the bath keeping his eyes fixed upon her he felt the weight of the switch in his hand hed never done anything remotely like this before but something about the way her body was contorted to offer her sex up to him lent him confidence are you ready just do it he lifted the terror her clitoris looked as hard and as red as a ruby he lay the switch on it with a short little stab that made her sob again she demanded immediately the ruby was already a little redder again she said he struck her again twice three times four and five and six while every muscle in her body went rigid so as to be his perfect target more he said there were tears on her face but she simply growled at him between gritted teeth he took it to mean yes and went to work again until the sweat was running from his face and down his back his breath was rough with exertion but she would not let him stop her gaze her sneer her offered body spoke the same demand and he dutifully answered it over and over and over and suddenly her eyes rolled up in her head her mouth opened he could barely make sense of the words they were so thick with feeling again her pupils had almost gone from sight once he lifted the terror which for all its litheness its lightness suddenly felt brutal in his aching hand her body had started to shake he was shaking too now but the terror had its own imperative down it came once more she let out a cry that sounded more like something a bird would utter than a woman then her limbs lost their solidity and her legs slipped gracefully off the sides of the bath a tiny plume of crimson tinted the water he dropped the switch and retreated to the door in a kind of childish terror at what hed done and at how much it had aroused him katyas eyes had closed the expression on her face was one of childish contentment an infant sleeping in the arms of innocence he slid down the doorframe into a squatting position and there exhausted by the intensity of the previous minutes he must have briefly fallen asleep because when he opened his eyes again the water was still moving but katya had vacated the tub vacated the bathroom too in fact he didnt have to get up to find her he merely had to swing his head round to see that she was sitting on the edge of the bed her legs open looking at her reflection in the long oval mirror the expression of contentment had not left her face but now there was a little smile on her lips too she had a wide repertoire of smiles he thought or at least it seemed hed seen a lot in the short time theyd known one another there was her teasing smile her mischievous smile her dark smile her dry smile this one had a little of everything in it she knew he was watching her so there was something of her performance smile in it but it certainly wasnt phony how fake could someone be when shed just let her body lead her into such extremes surely he was one of a rare order of men those to whom shed given herself in that profound way he thought of the tinted blood rising up between her legs and felt a peculiar mingling of retroactive alarm and exhilaration that theyd come through it together their first shared insanity whoever she was trespasser lunatic stalker star all other possible definitions paled before this she was the woman who had taught him how insignificant the flesh between his legs was when it came to the pleasuring of certain women come here she said he pushed himself up off the doorframe and went over to her let me see she said unbuckling his pants i came i know his trousers were massively too big which was the way he liked to wear them as soon as his belt was unbuckled they fell down he was afraid his dick would make a sorry show by now shriveled up in a crinkled skin of dried semen but no his erection had been so furiously hard it remained quite impressive even though it was sodden he could not imagine any other woman with whom hed had sex taking such guileless pleasure in the perusal of his quarterhard dick nor would any of those women have leaned forward as katya now did and kissed it may i look at you he said she assumed he didnt mean her face she spread her legs he hoisted his pants back tip and went down on his knees does it hurt he said yes she said she put her hand on the back of his head gently pressing him towards her body look inside me she said dont be afraid you did it see what you did he could see without opening her up her whole pubic region was puffy and inflamed go on look she said enjoy what you did he gently parted her labia which were sticky beneath his fingertips not blood not sweat just the natural juices of an aroused body you see she said pressing his fingers deeper into her she was like a furnace in there youve got thoughts going round in your head you never imagined having am i right he replied by gently scooping her juices out on his fingers and putting them deep into his mouth you want to lick me out he shook his head im afraid id draw more blood maybe id like that give me time she took his fingers out of his mouth and replaced them with her tongue youre right she said when theyd finished kissing weve got all the time in the world she stood up he stayed where he was at her feet still not quite believing theyd come so far so fast it isnt a dream she said reading his doubts as shed read so many other thoughts of his in the last twentyfour hours sometimes it seems that way but thats just the canyon he held onto her leg for a moment kissing the inside of her thigh we were going to walk remember she said you still want to oh yes id love to its a perfect night for introductions part five desire one the canyon had once been a kind of eden for zeffer its bowers had been places of comfort an escape from a world that was growing too tawdry too quickly for his taste but that was many many years ago now he hated his sometime paradise it was a place of confinement and punishment a lush hell made all the more agonizing because he knew that just beyond the perimeters his mistress katya had set were streets that hed once driven around like a lord the passage of years had transformed them of course probably out of all recognition seven decades was a long time and if he climbed the southern flank of the canyon and stood on the ridgewhich was on the very limits of his proscribed domainthen he could see the towers of what looked to him like a city within a city where in his day there had been little more than a dirt road and some sagebrush they had owned land down there he and katya once upon a time probably the lawyers had taken their profits and died by now but then he couldnt remember signing papers over to any other authority so it was just possible then if someone was to question who owned the land on which that gleaming city stood the paper trail would lead back to katya lupescu and willem matthias zeffer there had been a time when katya had been quite acquisitive shed been rich and the land had been cheap so shed had him buy large plots of it hundreds of acres in fact as an investment shed got the idea from douglas fairbanks and mary pickford who had also made large purchases saying with considerable foresight that as long as there was a hunger for people to be distracted from their unhappiness there would be a need for this new world of theirs this hollywoodland it followed then that the ground on which that new world was built would only grow in value many times zeffer had been tempted to leave the canyon and venture down the hill to discover what it all looked like now but he didnt dare katya had told him plainly what the consequences would be if he ever tried to leave there would be no way back for him she would see to it that he was torn limb from limb by those amongst the haunters of these hills who were loyal to her the creatures she referred to as los ninos the children he didnt doubt that she would enforce the edict she knew what power she held and how to keep it his death would be a fine lesson for those amongst the dans here who were less than loyal and muttered their unrest in the ears of coyotes and plotted the undoing of their mistress they called her by many names in many languages being men and women who had come from all over the world and now in this strange afterlife were returning to the tongue they knew best to some she was la catin the bitch to others she was simply the duchess of sorrows but none of these namecallers dared confront her whatever they whispered whatever they plotted they were too afraid of what they would lose if they went up against her and failed to win the day not only did they hope for her clemency at some time in the future but they prayed with all their hearts that theyd be let back into the house so that they could once more venture down the stairs into the devils country where they had once tasted something that was in their blood now permanently and could not be satisfied except by more of the same he understood their hunger he shared it and if she would let him back into the house then all the agonies of this halflife of his would be erased all pain forgotten all need dispatched but willem had few hopes of such clemency katya was crazy she always had been of course indeed in earlier times it had been part of her glamour wasnt that part of what had made her so incredible to watch up there on the screen a gleam of madness always lit up the eyes of her characters whatever she was playing her innocents were crazy with their sinlessness just as the vamps she played later were maddened by their sin of all the names that she was called it was cesar romeros nickname that suited her best la puta enojada the mad bitch that was the name zeffer used when he talked about her katya la puta enojada but bitch or no mad or no she had the reins and that was that she was not going to wither any time soon thanks to the machinations of that damnable room nor was she likely to get up one morning and vacate her canyon she was just as afraid of the world beyond its perimeters as he was in truth for all her bombast and her brutality it was fear that shaped her life fear of living fear of dying fear of staying fear of going fear of remembering and yes fear of forgetting but every now and again even in this despairing paradise there would come a glimpse of hope a hint of a chance that things might finally change for the better such hints and glimpses usually appeared in the form of interlopers people whose unplanned presence in the canyon had the potential to subtly change the balance of power in la puta enojadas feudal realm there had been perhaps a dozen such opportunities during in the time in which zeffer had been a prisoner of the canyon all in their way dangers to the status quo and all carefully managed by katya so as to prevent the destruction of her autocracy the most notable until now had been the appearance of a runaway child one jerry brahms who had fled his minders into the canyon ignorant of the mysteries he was treading amongst hed almost brought her down that one coming into the house without anyone realizing he was there and getting his fingers into places they had no business being opening doors letting the ghosts sniff the hunt the fact that he was a child had made her indulgent of his mistakes rather than have him killed katya had let him live brought him to her bosom in fact it was an act of trust that had served her well as the years had passed brahms the boy had became brahms the man and his loyalty had remained unwavering zeffer had never entirely understood what had happened between them but he had his suspicions katya had shown brahms pleasures that had marked him as hers forever that meant most likely that she had taken him down to see the hunt once youd walked in the devils country smelt its ancient air you belonged to that place in some unspeakable way it owned you he didnt need to look any further than his own body for evidence of this since katya had forbidden him to enter the housekeeping him from close proximity to the tileshe had started to look and feel his true age his hair had turned white his bones and joints ached perpetually why was he surprised nobody lived forever not movie goddesses nor the men who served them and certainly not houses however much rapture they contained every facade cracked finally and crumbled and went away to dust it was only a question of time which thought brought him back to the newest trespasser in their sealed world the most promising opportunity for an undoing of longheld certainties hed seen in many years she was a strong one this bigboned bigbreasted woman with her unhappy eyes she was trouble thank god under the right circumstances a woman like that could do all kinds of mischief if of course she was still alive shed been snatched away by los ninos the corrupt children of the canyon offspring of unsavory couplings between animals and ghosts zeffer had witnessed such intercourse many times over the years vile marriages between ghost women and coyotes ghost men and deer or dogs even once a woman and a bird somehow such consummations were often fruitful though the birthings were not anything he could have imagined until he laid eyes on them the animals who produced infants this way almost always died in the process every now and again he would come upon one of their rotted carcasses on the hillside and hed know that another hybrid had been added to that unholy tribe the revenant women who allowed such congress these women seemed to show no signs of trauma when the birth was over their bodies being less than flesh and more than ether malleable mendable but that was not to say their matings were without consequence these ghosts were also the wildest in his experience the most prone to sudden violence the beast had got into them in more ways than one they were touched by a kind of rabidity which was in distressing contrast to what remained of their elegance their glossy skins were pulled tight over something feral and their beauty could not conceal it women who had once been household namesparagons of elegance and sophisticationwalking on all fours their gait crabbed their speed uncanny baring their perfect teeth in the thicket and yelping like coyotes whod just come upon a fresh kill there was reason then for him to believe the interloper had not survived her abduction if theyd caught up with her los ninos might have toyed with her for awhile but they were stupid things and their attention spans were short it would not take them long to decide that thered be more sport in hurting the woman than in teasing her and once her blood began to run theyd become frenzied and fall upon her taking her limb from limb that was his fear the source of his hope that he had not heard any deathcries in the canyon since shed been gone it was a tiny reason to believe that something good might come of the womans arrival here but he had to have some little measure of hope or there was nothing so in the absence of hearing the womans screams he allowed himself to believe that there was one in the canyon who would might the undoing of katya lupi two tammy was indeed alive she knew she was alive because she was hungry it was the only thing about her present condition which she really recognized the rest was a kind of feverdream filled with blurred horrors remote pieces of what might be real and what she hoped to god were not she had been carried by her abductors to the far end of the canyon where there was no sign of any habitation the area was pretty much jungle dense thickets of barbed shrubs overshadowed by stands of immense shaggy palms there was no way to climb up any of these trees to escape those whod brought her here nor was there any way to move more than a few steps through the thicket so she was left with only one option she had to confront her abductors it was her mothers gift to her this evenheadedness in circumstances that would have brought lesser minds to the point of collapse edith huxley lauper had been uncannily calm and the more panicky people around her had become the calmer shed get it made her an ideal nurse which was the work shed done all her life she soothed the hurt she soothed the dying she soothed the bereft everythings fine she would say in that soft voice of hers and by some miracle everyone would believe her very often because people believed her the panic ceased and everything was fine it was a kind of selffulfilling prophecy so now sitting in the thicket in the midst of this fever dream with its voices and its faces and its stink she repeated ma edies mantra to herself over and over everythings fine everythings fine everythings fine waiting for it to turn out true her head still throbbed from the white light that had wiped out the world before her abduction and her stomach was certainly in need of filling but she still had all her limbs for which she was grateful and a voice in her throat so once shed calmed herself down she started to talk to whatever it was that had come after her her volume quiet but her tone insistent enough that she would not be mistaken for somebody who was afraid id like to get back to the house now she said to them so will one of you please escort me she scanned the bushes they were watching her she could see the glitter of their eyes the gleam of their teeth what were they they didnt seem quite substantial she had the feeling that their flesh was not as solid as hers as real perhaps yet theyd possessed enough strength to remove her from the vicinity of zeffers cage to this corner of nowhere so they werent to be disrespected do you understand me shed said keeping her tone even i need to go back to the house off to her left she saw a motion in the thicket and one of the creatures approached her coming close enough that for the first time shed had a proper view of one of the abductors it was a female no doubt of that and vaguely related to a human being the creatures naked body was scrawny her ribs showing through flesh that seemed to be covered with light graysilver hair the front limbs were extremely delicate and she surely had hands and fingers not pads and claws but the back legs were as crooked as a dogs and rather too large for the rest of her anatomy so that squatting her proportions were almost froglike but the head that was the worst of her her mouth was nearly human as was her nose but then the skull curved and suddenly flattened so that her eyes which were devoid of whites and set to either side of the skull like the eyes of a sheep stuck out black and shiny and stupid she turned her head and stared at tammy with her shiny eyes then from those human lips came the scraps of a voice its no use to beg she told tammy we eat you tammy took this in her stride or at least did all she could to give that impression im not begging you for anything she said very calmly and youre not going to eat me oh said another voice this time over to her right tammy moved slowly so as not to invite anything precipitous she looked at the second speaker wholike the femalehad come closer to her she guessed this was a male one of the creatures whod snatched her away from between the cages he had a head of ungainly size and shape his nose flattened out like the nose of a bat his mouth wide and lipless only his eyes were human and they were unexpectedly and exquisitely blue what shall we do with you then he said to tammy the slits of his nostrils flattening as he inhaled her scent help me she said the male lowered his lumpen head and stared at her from under the weight of his brow i need to get back to the house tammy said you know the lady said the female what lady in the house a third voice now a thin reedy voice in the darkness behind the female kat ee a the voice said katya tammy said yes said the male katya he had come closer to her and was now sniffing around her hair she didnt protect herself even though flecks of his cold phlegm were hitting her neck and face she just kept her focus as best she could perhaps these freaks for all their bizarrity knew something about why todd was here if she was going to free him she had to know what she was freeing him from what do you want with katya tammy said keeping her options open as to whether she knew the woman or not at the mention of katyas name a series of little convulsions had taken over the female she threw back her head showing a throat as lovely as garbos after a moment the convulsions subsided once they were governed the woman gave tammy her answer she is the one who has the hunt there wasnt much illumination to be had from this but tammy pursued the questioning not hoping for much what hunt she asked keeping her voice low and even the devils hunt said the male still close to her you seen it the female said no tammy replied liar if id seen it id tell you id seen it but i havent you been in the house no i havent tammy said why is this hunt youre talking about in the house the hunts in the house this part was even more puzzling than the earlier stuff plainly her sources were not terribly reliable were they referring to some sort of game that katya played have you ever been in the house she asked them no said the female but you want to go oh yes she said i want to see how it is well tammy said perhaps i could help you get into the house the female regarded her warily moving her head back and forth to assess tammy with both eyes its not possible she said why not it was the male who answered and the phrase he used was powerful but incomprehensible death at the threshold he said there were mutters and growls from others in the undergrowth at the mention of the threshold she had no doubt that for all their apparent strength these creatures were deathly afraid of the house and no doubt of its mistress has this woman katya done you some harm she asked the female the creature shook its wretched head kill her one day you want to kill her yes why the woman just stared her stare containing a profound distrust not just of tammy or indeed of katya of the world but of being alive it was as though every breathing moment was conditional an agony and despite the brutal foulness of the things appearance tammy felt some measure of sympathy for it maybe i could get this katya to come out tammy suggested the male growled deep in his chest youd do that tammy was ready to make any promise right now to get out of her present predicament she nodded there was a long moment in which the freaks did not reply then glancing around the company of her fellows as if to check that she would not be challenged the female caught hold of tammys wrist and pulled her up out of the thicket were going tammy said yes yes the female replied quickly though quickly she didnt get any argument from tammy who was happy to be on her way whatever dangers the house held they could hardly be worse than staying out here in the open the day was quickly passing away it would soon be dark and judging by the repeated glances the woman gave the sky she too was cognizant of the failing light after the third or fourth glance tammy couldnt help but ask her what she was so nervous about peacock she said a peacock there had been peacocks here it wasnt so surprising on second thoughts it fitted with the extravagance of the place but they belonged on wellclipped lawns not in this jungle of thorns and flowers and even assuming the bird could push its way through the thicket without being stripped of all its finery what could it do if did catch up with them they had bad tempers she remembered reading once but they were nervous things shed just shoo it away nothing to be scared of tammy said the woman gave her another disconcerting sideways look the male meanwhile came up beside tammy and stared at her breasts not about to be intimidated tammy she stared back there was something vaguely recognizable in this freak a cast to his features which reminded her of somebody famous who the hell was it some movie star was it victor mature yes it was victor mature it was uncanny the lookalike meanwhile leaned forward hooked a long cold finger through a hole in tammys blouse and before she could do a damn thing about it tore the light cotton blouse away from her skin you keep away from me she told the offender he bared his teeth at her pretty boobies he said what the forbidding grimace had transformed into a weird version of a smile titties he said he reached out and touched the side of her breast with his open palm stroking it jugs knockers baby feeders tammy added figuring it was better to play along with the joke however witless fun bags he grinned almost moronically she wondered just for a moment if that was the answer to this mystery that these pitiful remnants of humanity were cretins mongols retards the children of hollywood parents who could not bear the idea that theyd produced such freaks and given them over to somebody whod simply dumped them in the empty canyon no that was ridiculous atrocities like that didnt happen in this day and age it was unthinkably callous but it did go some way to explaining the curious passages of starry flesh and bone she kept seeing garbos throat on the woman victor mature in this breastobsessed male udders he said jigglies she countered chichis kazooms oh she had a million so presumably did every woman with larger than average breasts in america it had started when she was twelve when thanks to an unfortunate hormonal trick she was walking around with a bosom that would have looked just fine on a bigboned twentytwoyearold suddenly men were looking at her and the dirty words just came tumbling out of their mouths she went through a phase when she thought every man in sacramento had tourettes syndrome never mind that the girl with the hooters was twelve men got diarrhea of the mouth at the sight of large breasts she had them called everything the twins skinpillows her rack her set her mounds her missiles her melons her milkmakers at first it upset her to be the object of fun but after a while she learned not to listen to it anymore unless some unusual name came along to swell the lexicon like global superstars or bodacious tatas both of which had brought a despairing smile to her face of course in two years time all her girlfriends had got bosoms of their own wait the female had halted its body suddenly besieged by nervous tics whats wrong tammy said the woman governed her little spasms and stood still listening then pointed off to her right and having pointed she quickly bounded away dragging tammy after her as they fledand thats what it was suddenly fleeingtammy glanced back over her shoulder they were not taking this journey unaccompanied there was a contingent of freaks coming after them though they were keeping their distance but it was not the freaks however that the female was so afraid of it was something else what tammy gasped what peacock the woman replied she didnt speak again she simply let go of tammys arm and threw herself into the cover of the thicket tammy turned and turned again looking for the creature that had caused this unalloyed panic for a moment she saw nothing and all she heard was the sound of the female racing off though the thicket then almost total silence nothing moved in any direction and all she could hear was a jet high high above her she looked up yes there it was crawling across the pristine blue leaving a trail of vapor tinted amber by the setting sun she was momentarily enchanted removed from her hunger and her aching bones beautiful she murmured to herself the next moment something broke cover not more than ten yards from her this time tammy didnt stand there mesmerized as she had at the cages she threw herself out of the path of the shape that was barreling towards her it was the bizarrest of the all the freaks shed encountered like all its kin it had some of her own species in its genes but the animal it was crossed withyes a peacockwas so utterly unlike a human being that the resulting form defied her comprehension it had the torso of a man and the stickthin back legs scaly though they were also belonged to a human being but its neck was serpentine and its head no larger than a fist its eyes were tiny black beads and between them was a beak that looked as though it could do some serious damage having missed her on the first assault it now turned around and came at her again loosing a guttural shriek as it did so she stumbled backwards intending to turn and run but as she did so it raised its body up and she saw to her disgust that it underbelly was made exactly like that of a man and that it was in a state of considerable arousal the moment of distraction cost her dearly she fell back against a blooming rhododendron bush and lost her footing in a midst of pinkpurple blossom she cursed loudly and coarsely grabbing onto whatever she couldblossom twig rootto haul herself up as she attempted to do so she saw the creature slowly lower its sleek turquoise head and one of its scaly forelimbswithered remnants of arms and handswent to its chin where it idly scratched at a flea then while she struggled like an idiot to get back on her feet the creature lifted up its backside and spread its glorious tail by some quirk of genetics it had inherited its fathers glory intact the tail opened like gods own fan compensating for every other grotesque thing about the beast it was beautiful and the creature knew it tammy stopped struggling for a moment thinking perhaps she could talk some sense into this thing look at you she said was there brain enough in that little skull to understand that it was being flattered she frankly doubted it but the creature was watching her now its head cocked to one side she kept talking telling it how fine it looked while tentatively reaching around to find a branch large enough to carry her weight so that she could pull herself to her feet the creature shook its tail the feathers hissing as they rubbed against one another the iridescent eyes in their turquoise setting shimmered and then without warning it was on her it moved so suddenly she didnt have a chance to clamber out of its way she fell back into the blossoms for a second time and before she could raise her arms to ward it off the peacock came down against her body trapping her she felt its erection against her body and its wizened hands clawing at her breasts its beak snapped above her face threatening her eyes for a moment she lay still afraid of what it would do to her if she resisted it but then it began to thrust its hips against her and a spasm of revulsion overcame her better judgment she reached up and caught hold of the things neck just below the head her fingers digging deep into its blotchy corrugated flesh even so it continued to grind its body against her she raised her other hand to join the first and started to strangle the thing still it pumped on as though so stupefied with lust it was indifferent to its own jeopardy she pressed hard on its throat dosing off its windpipe its grindings continued unabated she pressed harder and harder still then it seemed to reach a point of no return and a series of shudders passed through its body she felt something wet spurting on her belly where its rhythms had pushed up the rags of her blouse oh god she said you filthy dirty its climax over it belatedly seemed to realize that it couldnt breathe and started to thrash about its claws raked her breasts which stung like fury but she refused to let go of its scrawny throat if she gave it an inch it would surely kill her her only hope was to dig deep and hold on until the thing lost consciousness but it was easier said than done the birds orgasm hadnt exhausted its energies it thrashed maniacally beating its stunted wings against the blossoms so that a blizzard of pink petals came down upon them like confetti tammy kept her teeth and her hands locked together while the wouldbe rapists panic became a frenzy it was making ghastly guttural noises now its mottled tongue sticking straight out of its mouth spittle fell on her upturned face stinging her eyes she closed them and kept on clutching while the peacock clawed and flapped and thrashed the struggle had already gone on for three or four minutes and her strength was giving out the pain from her scratched breasts was excruciating and her hands were numb but by degrees the birds rallies lessened she didnt relax her grip on it however suspicious that if she did so it would recover itself somehow and renew its attack she held on to its silken throat while its wings slowed their moronic flapping she opened her eyes the expression on the creatures face suggested that it was close to death its tongue lolled against its lower beak its gaze was unfocused most telling of all its glorious tail had drooped to the dirt still she held on pressing her thumbs hard against its windpipe until every last twitch had gone out of it only then did she let go not with both hands but with one and started to pull herself up from beneath the body of the creature she felt its semen cold on her belly and her own blood hot on her breasts a fresh wave of repugnance passed through her but she had survived that was the point this creature had done its worst and shed overcome it grabbing hold of a branch she pulled herself to her feet the peacock hung from her hand its body sprawled on a bed of fallen blossoms a spasmodic rattle passed through its gleaming tail feathers but that was the last of it she let it go it dropped to the ground its head resembling some absurd little sock puppet that its owner had abandoned in the grass the rest of its body a grotesque amalgam of forms i killed you tammy said softly you sonofabitch she lifted her gaze and surveyed the bushes around her all this had been witnessed she knew the creatures that shared this beasts grotesque tribe were all out there in the twilight watching their battle she could not see those who were scrutinizing her not even the gleam of a tooth or eye but she knew they must be thinking twice about attacking her on the other hand she was seriously weakened if they were to launch such an assault she would be lost her energies were all but spent she looked down at her bosom her blouse was in rags and her skin had been deeply scored by the freaks claws she touched the wounds they stung but the blood would soon start to clot she wasnt a bleeder luckily but she was going to need something to clean the wounds if they werent to become infectedgod knows what kind of shit and dirt the creature had had beneath its clawswhich meant finding her way as quickly as possible back to the house to clean running water and fresh dressings but there was one other matter to deal with before she moved from this place a bit of cleaning up that couldnt wait until she had water she picked up a fistful of grass and wiped her belly removing as best she could the remnants of the creatures semen it took more than one fistful to do the job but when she had cleaned herself she left the body where it lay and went on her way she listened as she went for the sound of pursuit the rustle of leaves the snapping of twigs but she heard nothing either the rest of the freakish clan had decided she was too dangerous to pursue given that shed just slaughtered one of their more fearsome members or else the game of pursuit no longer amused them and theyd gone back to whatever crimes they committed in the stinking darkness tammy didnt much care as long as they left her alone she thought they could do what the hell they liked three tell me about all the stuff in the guesthouse todd asked katya as they walked where does it all come from the large tapestry in the living room was made for the sorrows of frederick which was a terrible picture but the designs were magnificent the castle they made for the banquet scene you never saw anything so grand in your life and all the egyptian stuff was from nefertiti you played nefertiti no theda bara played nefertiti because the front office said she was a bigger star than i was i played her handmaiden i didnt mind that much because in my mind it was a better role theda just vamped her way through her part oh lord she was bad but i got a little chance to act in the end nefertiti had my lover killed because he was in love with me not her so i threw myself off a boat into the nile and drowned i suppose so either that or i was eaten by crocodiles she laughed i dont know anyway i got some of my best reviews for nefertiti somebody said i could have stepped right out of history the evening was beginning to draw on as they walked taking the simple and relatively direct path which todd had failed to find on his way up it was the first night in a long time that todd hadnt sat at his bedroom window drinking brooding and popping pills what about the bed todd said where did that come from that was from the devils bride a horror movie no it was this strange picture directed by edgar kopel very shocking for its time the bed was supposed to have been owned by the devil you see carved to his design and then the hero who was played by ronald coleman inherits it and he and his bride use it for the bridal bed but the devil comes for the bride and then all hell breaks loose what happened in the end the devil gets what he wants you me i dont think that would work for modern audiences oh it didnt work in they stayed away in droves they walked on for a while in silence finally katya said whats troubling you i cant make sense of what youre telling me the pieces dont fit and it frustrates you yes maybe its best you just dont think about it how can i not think about it he said this place you the posters the bed what am i supposed to make of it all make whatever pleases you she said whys it so important that you have an explanation for everything i told you things are different here she caught hold of his hand and they stopped walking there were insects in the grass all around them making music overhead the stars were coming out their patterns as familiar as the din of cicadas and tonight as strange his doubts were contagious the fact that he didnt understand how it was possible this woman could have lived the life she claimed to have lived spread confusion into every other sign the world brought him what was he doing here in between the music in the grass and the brightening stars he suddenly seemed to understand nothing his face throbbed and his eyes stung its all right she said softly theres nothing to be afraid of im not afraid he said it was the truth in a way what he felt was not fear it was something far more distressing he felt lost cast off from every certainty but then he looked at her face at her perfect face and he felt a calm come over him so what if he was adrift so were they both and wasnt it better to be with her sharing her gentle madness than to be alone in this unforgiving world he leaned towards her and kissed her on the lips nothing overtly sexual just a tender kiss what was that for she asked him smiling for being here even though you think im a lunatic i didnt say that no but you think it dont you you think im living in a fantasy land im taking your advice he replied im making whatever i like of it and i like being here right now with you so the rest can go to hell the rest out there he said waving his arm in the general direction of the city the people who used to run my life to hell with them to hell with them katya laughed i like that she said returning his kiss in the midst of their laughter where now he said down to the pool she replied you know the way trust me she said kissing him again this time he didnt let her escape so lightly but returned her kiss with some force his hand slipped up into her hair and made a cradle for her head she put her arms around his waist pressing so hard against him it was as though she wanted to climb inside his skin when they broke the kiss they gazed at one another for a little time i thought we were going walking he said so we were she said taking his hand again the pool yes do you want to go back to the house plenty of time for that later she said lets go down to the pool while theres still some light so they continued their descent hand in hand they said nothing now there was no need across the other side of the canyon a lone coyote began to yap his voice was answered by another higher up on the ridge behind them then another two in the same vicinity and now another and another until the entire canyon was filled with their glorious din when todd and katya reached the lawn there was a small scrawny coyote loping across it giving them a guilty backward glance as he disappeared into the undergrowth as he vanished from sight the pack ceased its din there were a few moments of silence then the insects took up their music again its sad the way things have declined katya said looking at the sight before them the starlight was forgiving but it couldnt conceal the general condition of the place the statues missing limbs or toppled over and buried in vines the pavement around the pool cracked and mossy the pool itself stained and stinking whats that todd said pointing out the onestory mockclassical structure halfhidden by the cypresses around the pool thats the pool house i havent been in there in a very long time i want to see it it was a larger building than it had appeared from the front and uncannily bright there were several skylights in the ceiling which ushered in the brightness of moon and stars their light bouncing off the silky marble floor in the centre stood a cocktail bar with mirrors of marbled glass behind the glass shelves after all these years there were dozens of bottles on the shelvesbrandies whiskies and liqueurs you used the pool a lot todd said we had the best poolparties in hollywood their voices echoed off the glacial walls as they spoke coming back to meet them and the people who came here knew katya said they knew letting the thought go unfinished she moved past him to the bar what did they know he said not to make any judgments she replied she slipped behind the bar and began to survey the rows of bottles i dont think we should try drinking any of that stuff he said ive got fresh booze in the house if thats what you want she didnt reply simply continued to survey the selection finally she decided upon one of the brandies and taking the bottle by the neck she pulled it forward there was a grinding noise from behind the mirror as some antiquated mechanism was activated then the mirror slid sideways three or four feet revealing a small safe todd was intrigued he hopped over the bar to get a better look at what katya was up to she was working on the tumble lock he could hear a faint clicking as she flipped it back and forth whats in there he said we used to have a book we zeffer and i we just kept it for fun a book of what of party pieces she said with a little smile who did what to whom and how many times youre kidding she turned the lock one more time and then pushed down on the handle and pulled the door there was a cracking sound as the decayed rubber seal broke then the door swung wide are there any candles she said to him look in the cupboard there between the columns will you todd did as he was instructed and found several boxes of plain white candles on the shelves one was open and the heat of many summers had turned the contents into a single boxshaped slab of white wax but the contents of the other two boxes were in better condition under the first layer which was partially melted there were salvageable candles he set up six of them on the bar seating them in their own dribblings so that they wouldnt fall over their flickering yellow light flattered the marble interior and by some strange arrangement of the walls it seemed he heard the whispering of the flames multiplied indeed they almost sounded like voices uncannily so he looked around halfexpecting to see somebody flitting between the columns ah voilб said katya reaching into the depths of the safe she brought a small thick book out of the little safe along with a sheaf of photographs and set them all down on the bar in the light from the candles the book looked like a journal bound in dark red leather when she opened it he saw that its handwritten contents were arranged symmetrically two columns to each page take a look she said obviously delighted with her find he picked up the book and flicked through it almost threequarters of its pages were written on sometimes in the twocolumn configuration sometimes simply filled up from top to bottom he turned to a page of the former variety on the left hand side of the pages was a column of names on the right hand a column that was far harder to make sense of occasionally there were names but more often letters and symbols some of them resembling obscure mathematical equations his puzzlement amused her think of it as a history book she said offering a teasing smile along with the clue a history of what of better times todd flipped through the pages now and again amongst the names he came upon some he knew norma talmadge theda bara john gilbert clara bow all movie stars of another era you knew all these people he said to her yes of course this was the place to come when you wanted to have some fun every weekend wed have parties sometimes in the pool sometimes in the house sometimes wed have hunts all through the canyon animal hunts no people hunts people treated like animals we whipped them and we chained them up andwell you can imagine im beginning to wow you had charlie chaplin up here i see yes he came up here often he used to bring his little girls little girls he liked them young todd raised a quizzical eyebrow and you didnt mind i dont believe in thou shall not thats for people who are afraid to follow their own instincts of course when youre out there in the world youve got to play by the rules or youll spend your life behind bars theyd lock you up and throw away the key but this isnt the world this is my canyon they called it coldheart canyon because they said i have a soul like ice but why should i care what people say let them say whatever they want to say as long as their money pays for the little luxuries in life i want my kingdom to be a place where people could take their pleasures freely without judgment or punishment this is eden you see only theres no snake no angel to drive you out either because you did a bad thing why because there were no bad things literally none she looked at him her stare luminous oh you mean murder perhaps we had one or two murderers here and we had sisters whod fucked their brothers and sons who fucked their mothers and a man who liked having children suck him off what ha now youre shocked his name was laurence skimpell and he was as handsome a man as ive ever met he had a contract at warner brothers and they were going to make him a star a big star then this woman turns up at the studios with a child who she said was skimpells warner brothers have always been very loyal they offered the woman money said theyd put the child up for adoption but as she got up and left she said you dont understand this isnt his offspring this is his lover oh jesus christ that was the last we ever heard of laurence skimpell thats a ridiculous story i dont believe a word of it she laughed as though perhaps this time she was inventing a little youre in here he said coming to some mentions of katya lupi and theres a long list of men oh that was a competition we had you had all these men it was my canyon it still is i can do what i like here so you let people do what they wanted more or less she returned to the book you see the symbols beside the names todd nodded somewhat tentatively the conversation had taken a turn he was by no means certain he liked it was one thing to talk about freedom in coldheart canyon it was another to have her boasting about babies sucking dicks all the symbols mean something different she said look here that squiggle there that means snakes that knotted rope that means being bound up the more knots in the rope the more bound the person likes to be soherebarrymorehis rope has six knots in it so he liked to be very well tied up and then theres a little flame beside him that means he liked to be burned when he was sober in the end i stopped inviting him because he got so drunk and so abusive he wasnt any fun ah so you did make a judgment she considered this for a moment yes i suppose i did did he spoil the secret once you didnt invite him anymore did he start telling everyone about what it was like up here of course not what was he going to say even he had a reputation to keep besides half of hollywood swam in that pool at one time or another and the other half wished they could nobody said anything but everybody knew whatexactly that there were orgies here that women got fucked with snakes all of that yes but mostly that people came back from coldheart canyon spiritually changed you mean that spiritually yes spiritually dont look so surprised the flesh and the soul are tied together todd looked confused louise brooks said to me once theres nothing they can give that would be worth my freedom she parried with the rest of us but in the end she gave it all up and moved away she said they were trying to take her soul by boring her to death so she gave up making movies indeed she did but louise was a rare example you know what usually happens you get addicted and the studio knows youre addicted you need your hit of fame every couple of years or you start to feel worthless isnt that right so as long as they can keep giving you a little time in the spotlight theyve got you in their pocket todd continued to flip through the book as katya spoke as much because he didnt want to meet her gaze as because he was interested in the pages all that she said was true and it hurt to hear it especially when he had done himself so much harm because of his appetite for the spotlight a sound behind him he looked up at the mirror behind the bar it wasnt his wounded face that caught his eye however it was a motion of something or somebody passing by the door i think theres somebody out there he whispered katya looked unsurprised of course they know were here she took the book from his hand and closed it for him let me introduce you to them she said wait he reached for the photographs that katya had also brought out of the safe they still lay where she had put them on the top of the bar you dont need to look at those now katya said i just want to take a peek he began to flick through the sheaf of photographs there were probably forty or so most in worse condition than the book the prints made hastily and poorly fixed so that large parts of the image had faded to speckled sepia or to black but there were still sizeable portions of many of the photographs visible and the scenes they depicted confirmed every obscene or outlandish detail shed offered they werent simply images of men and women coupling but pictures of the most extreme forms of sexual gratification in one a naked man was bound to a metal chain the cords that held him biting deep into his flesh a woman wearing just a black brassiere was flogging his chest and his groin assuming this wasnt a setup then the woman was doing her victim some serious hurt there was blood running down his chest and stomach from blows shed delivered there and there appeared to be welts on his thighs and his dick which stood testament to the pleasure he was taking in this in another picture some way down the pile the same man had been redeemed from his bondage and lay on the paving stone beside the pool while another woman squatted over him and loosed a stream of urine on his wounds to judge by the expression on the masochists face this hurt more than the whipping his teeth were gritted his body locked as though he were only just holding back an unmanly scream wait i know who that is todd said thatschrist it cant be it is he was always the good guy well sometimes good guys like getting pissed on and her she was always so sweet in her movies whats her name always the victim well that was part of the game you got to play in the canyon up here you do the things the studios wouldnt let you do rub your face in the dirt for a while and then on monday morning you could brush your teeth and smile and pretend you were allamerican again thats all people want an illusion you can do what the hell you like out of sight just dont spoil their dreams they want to believe youre perfect and its hard to put on a perfect face every day without going crazy up here nobody was perfect and nobody cared jesus todd said coming across a picture of scatology whos the pooper katya turned the picture round to get a dearer view of the womans face that was edith vine at least that was her real name i cant remember what they called her she had a seven year contract with rko but they never made a star out of her maybe they were afraid one of these would leak out and theyd lose their investment no she just kept getting pregnant she was one of those women who just had to look at a man and bam she was eating anchovies and ice cream so she kept getting abortions two three a year and her body went to hell where did she end up oh shes here katya said we dont just take the famous up here in the canyon we take the failures too without fully understanding what hed just been toldperhaps not entirely wanting totodd moved on to another picture a man whod played cowboys most of his life was the centre of attention all laced up in a girdle that made his waist as narrow as any showgirls thats one for the family album he liked to be called martha when he was dressed like that it was his mothers name in fact i think it was his mothers corset todd laughed though he wasnt sure where the laughter was coming from perhaps it was simply that the parade of perversions was so excessive there was nothing to do in the end but laugh christ whats that a jar of bees and claudettes breast she liked to get stung she would scream like her lungs were going to give out but then shed have somebody pick the stings out with their teeth fuck and shed be so wet you could fill a shotglass from what came out of her it was too much he put the photographs down bees piss corsets and they were only the pictures he could make sense of there were plenty more that defied easy comprehension arrangements of limbs and faces and artifacts which he had no appetite to interpret before he left them where they lay there was one question remaining that he simply had to ask are you in any of these well im in the book arent i so all that stuff you were telling me in the gaming room about offering yourself to the winner all that was true all that was true just how far did you go she turned the photographs over putting their excesses out of sight as far as you want she said smiling then just a little further she unnerved him and she knew it she took hold of his hand come on she said lets go outside were missing the dusk four they were too late it had been twilight when theyd entered the pool house now it was night but that wasnt the only change that had taken place in the time theyd lingered there the air todd breathed when he stepped outside again was something more than a little colder a little darker than it had been though there was no wind still he felt movement around and against him a delicate touch on his arm on his shoulder something touching the back of his head he looked at katya there was precious little light out here but he could see her face with curious clarity almost as though it were lit from within her expression was one of considerable pleasure say hello todd she told him who to oh come on stop pretending to yourself you know theyre here there was something brushing his cheek lightly he flicked it away as though it might be a moth though he knew it wasnt i dont understand whats going on he said his words a kind of plea hed thought earlier that he could do without answers that having her here was enough now he was discomfited again he wanted some explanations for these mysteries which multiplied every time he turned round first katya and her stories of the gaming room then the guesthouse and the lifemasks and the posters then the bath and the terror now this the pool house and its history of debaucheries locked away for posterity and as if all that werent enough theyd stepped out into these mothwing touches against his cheek his arm his groin he wanted to know what it all meant but he was afraid of the answer no that wasnt it he was afraid he already knew the answer you dont need me to tell you whats going on here katya said echoing his thoughts you can feel them cant you oh god yes he could feel them these werent moths or mosquitoes around him they were people people hidden in the air say it ghosts yes of course ghosts oh jesus the canyons full of ghosts i dont believe in ghosts you dont have to believe she said its nothing to do with believing or not believing theyre here all around you just let yourself see them you know theyre here of course he knew in his gut hed known all along there was some mystery like this waiting in the wings and what katya said about belief was right whether he believed in the life everlasting or not was a grand irrelevance the dead were here he could feel their fingers their breaths their stares and now as they pressed closer he began to see them he had to work up some spit before he could speak again why can i see you and im only now seeing them he asked because im not dead todd and if youre very good in a little while ill show you why youre going to like it too my special room at the mention of the room the air or rather those who moved invisibly through it became agitated the number of touches that todd felt doubled tripled apparently katya felt them too and she was somewhat irritated by them calm down calm down she said there were subtle smears of light in front of todd as though the emotion the ghosts were feelingspurred by katyas mention of the roomwas causing them to show themselves he thought he saw a face in one of the smears or some part of a face a row of perfect teeth the gleam of a bright blue eye the more he thought he saw the more there was to support his suspicion the smears grew more cogent painting the forms of faces and shoulders and hands they lasted only a little timelike fireworks bursting into glorious life then dying awaybut each time one was ignited its life lasted a little longer and the form it etched in the darkness made more sense to him there were people everywhere around him not just a few dozens of them the ghosts of parties past lining up to touch the living you begin to see them dont you katya said yes he replied breathlessly i dobeginto see them pretty people more than pretty beautiful and in many cases famous one womanwas it jean harlowwandered in front of him with her glittering dress torn away to expose her breasts she was come and gone so quickly it was hard for todd to be sure but she seemed to have bitemarks on her flesh clustered around her nipples shed no sooner passed from sight than two figures tied together with ropes that went from neck to neck came into view both were male both were naked both shone with a mixture of sweat and blood this would have been distressing enough but it was their smiles their lunatic smiles which made todd flinch sal and jimmy katya said they fool around like that all the time its a little lynching game he pulled his hand out of hers this is too much its all right she said theres nothing to be afraid of he waved them away like a child trying to ward off nightmares i dont want to see them laughter came out of the darkness to meet his demand the ghosts were apparently much amused their laughing made faces blossom all round him several he could name famous beauties returned to their perfection this bizarre afterlife as though theyd remembered themselves as their public would have willed them to be merle oberon and george sanders mary pickford and veronica lake todd started to retreat up the lawn still waving them off the phantoms came in giddy pursuit all right enough katya yelled at them i said enough her word was apparently law even in such stellar company as this the laughter rapidly subsided and the divine faces stopped pressing toward him he took the moment to hasten his retreat turning his back on the assembly and hurrying back in what he hoped was the general direction of the house his thoughts were in chaos it seemed at that moment that his life since burrows had been one long downward spiral into a kind of insanity wait love katya had come after him her voice as pliant as ever she caught up with him im losing my mind he murmured his hands went to his face pressing his fingers into his tender flesh as though the pain might help drag him back from the brink youre not crazy youre just seeing things clearly for the first time well i dont want to see them why not isnt it reassuring to know that death means nothing that theres life after death pleasure after death pleasure you call that he glanced back at the pool house where hed seen the excesses of so many of these people recorded for posterity we had no shame then we have even less now as if to prove katyas point there was an eruption of libidinous laughter from somewhere nearby and todd followed the sound to see a woman tied up in the trees naked but for a long string of pearls which ran like converging rivulets between her breasts her wrists were bound together and her arms lifted high above her head so that she hung her pale body shaped like a bow her toes grazing the ground it was she who was laughing despite the apparent vulnerability of her situation there was a man on the ground between her legs licking the base of her feet while another standing behind her and massaging her breasts bit into the tender flesh of her shoulder and neck the hands went from her breasts down to her groin and parted her lips of her pussy from which came a shimmering arc raining down onto the man adoring at her feet the recipient began to masturbate obviously moved to feverpitch by the shower aware of katyas gaze todd glanced over at her would you like to fuck her she said the girl was beautiful with long red hair and that frothy laugh of hers which sounded so very much more innocent than what she was up to shes yours if you want her ava the girl looked up this is todd katya said hello todd go on katya said dont worry im not going to get jealous id like to see how you give pleasure to a woman despite the hint of judgment in this remark todd might have taken the opportunity to have the woman if the man at avas feet hadnt suddenly began to moan and raising his hips off the ground ejected a copious load of semen the sight of this eruption was enough to keep todd at bay another time he said to ava moving away she called after him but he didnt look back theres plenty more where she came from katya said catching up with him her hand casually brushed the front of his pants as though to make the point that she knew he was aroused you should go to one of them she said why just to see what its like fucking a ghost if you want to put it that way i dont know its weird im not sure her hand went back to his hardon yes you are you love the idea her hand went from his groin to his wrist which she caught hold of drawing him away from ava into a kind of bower lined with honeysuckle and nightblooming jasmine their mingled perfumes so strong they were practically intoxicating it was darker here than it had been under the trees where ava hung but todd could see bodies on the ground in various combinations of coupling somebody reached down from a branch overhead and ran his or her fingers through todds hair someone else came up behind him and pulled his shirt out from his trousers again he looked for katya and again found her close by smiling katya a girls voice off to the right and todd saw a naked young woman being carried towards katya on the shoulders of three men one at her head the other two supporting her knees in such a way as to hold her legs wide open even in the dim light todd could see what a gloriously tender sight the girl presented she had been shaved between her legs making her look even younger than she was which was surely less than twenty lick me katya she said her voice dreamy will you please nobody does it to me like you lick me deep katya glanced round at todd do you mind help yourself he replied as though the girl was a plate set before her katya smiled her hands going up to the insides of the girls thighs venturing up to the spot where they met but then before they quite reached the place and offered any satisfaction retreated again it was a tantalizing game and it drove the girl crazy with anticipation oh please she said please katya please todd stepped a little to the side so as to have a better view of what was unfolding here katya had very quickly bared her breasts so that now as she approached the divide of the girls legs her nipples stroked her partners thighs her hands were delicately parting the girls labia as though investigating the most exquisite of flowers todd could feel the blood thumping at his groin was there no end to katyas capacity to surprise him whenever he thought he was beginning to get a grasp of the woman she changed the rules in some subtle fashion and found a new way to astonish him was this really the same woman hed discovered in bed a while ago looking like a disheveled angel katya glanced back at him one last timejust to be sure that he was indeed watching herthen she applied her mouth to the girls flesh the recipient of this tonguing let out a long contented sigh stretching out on her bed of hands opening her legs a little wider katya proceeded to press deeper into her advancing with lickings and nibblings occasionally seeming to murmur against the womans sex the girl was no longer relaxed she had grabbed fistfuls of the hair of the men who supported her knees pulling herself up almost into a sitting position one moment then falling back her body convulsed with little shudders her tiny nipples hard her flat belly shiny with sweat katya slowly escalated the sensations she was inducing in the womans body until her victim was thrashing and sobbing beneath the tiniest of touches somewhere in the midst of this another occupant of the bower on her knees in the shadows beneath the spreadeagled girl came forward and freed todds erection from his pants he didnt attempt to dissuade her the girl took him into her throat and kept him there the mingling of the sight of katya working on the girl and this new sensation was almost too much for him he had to gently ease himself out of the girls mouth so as not to lose control too quickly she seemed to get the message because she crawled away beckoning him to follow he pulled off his shoes and socks and then hauled down his trousers stepping out of them as he followed he doubted katya had noticed what he was up to she was too deeply engaged in driving her partner to distraction the girls sobs of pleasure were the loudest sound in the vicinity at ground level beneath the spread shadow of the ecstatic girl was a subworld of shadowy bodies touches and whispers there were probably a dozen men and women down here variously intertwined todd felt their hands at his backside his face his erection heard an appreciative coo from someone who weighed the mass of his balls and the girl whod beckoned to him grazing his lips with hers saying something he couldnt catch he lost sight of her for a little while then he heard her ahead of him gasping with delight somebody had got their hands on her before him he felt a spasm of possessiveness and crawled on over a couple of sweating bodies to catch up with her hed got it into his head that the nameless girl was his for the having and he wasnt about to be denied her she wasnt hard to find in fact she found him catching hold of his hand and drawing him towards her the shadow of katyas sobbing victim spilled across much of her body but her face lay clear of it and todd saw that this girl whod gobbled him down so gluttonously looked barely old enough to be out of her parents charge she was dark dark skin dark hair dark eyes and she was already lying back on a bed of bodies she pulled him eagerly towards her and cupped his face with her hands bringing his mouth to hers there was some confusion of bodies around and beneath her but he was too turned on to pay much attention to such details he kissed the girl and the girl returned his kiss lavishly was there something in her kisssome subtle tang to the juices of her mouth some coldness to her lipswhich would have given away the fact that she was a spirit not that he could tell if anything she was hotter than most women hed been naked with almost feverish and despite the fact that his eyes had for so long failed to see the ghosts in the canyon sheand all of those around himnow seemed absolutely solid his dick had lost none of its rigidity through this fumbling pursuit the fact that the air was humid and pungent with the heat given off these spiritforms only aroused him more katya had prepared him well with her talk of shamelessness he wanted the girl and she wanted him what else mattered he put the head of his cock into her she lifted her legs a little to help him there was undoubtedly somebody else beneath her but he or she didnt seem to care that he was kneeling on them all the way she insisted he slid into her as she instructed all the way to the root and began to work his hips against her her cunt was as agile as her throat he felt a counterrhythm moving beneath his dick passing through the lower half of her vulva the sensation was like nothing hed ever experienced before after just a few strokes he was brought to the edge he slowly pulled out of her to be sure he didnt ejaculate too quickly you like that she said putting her hand down between her legs and guiding him back in yes i like it a lot good but go slowly please he let her take him inside again and she threw back her head expelling a sigh of satisfaction go on she said her eyes fluttering closed all the way both of you both he thought raising his head from her breast and as he formed the question he felt an arm twice three times as thick as hers and deeply muscled reach over and grab his neck he lifted his head as best he could and saw the face of a man over the girls shoulder she was apparently lying on him her back against his chest he was black and handsome even in the shadows shes good he said smiling yeah tentatively todd reached down into the moist muddle between their legs he felt himself hard as ever and then further back buried in the girls ass the other mans dick so that was what he had been feeling as he moved inside her it wasnt a muscular contraction it was the black man sliding in and out of her in any other situation he would have been repulsed would have pulled out and retreated but this was the canyon katyas eden without the serpent the part of him that would have been revolted had been sweated out of him it only made him harder thinking about the woman being sandwiched between him and the other man the fine sheath of her muscle dividing the two of them he brought his hand up from the swamp between their legs and grabbed hold of the black mans wrist tightening the threeway knot the man laughed you like that he said i like that good he said licking the girls neck but keeping his eyes fixed hungrily on todd cause we like to get real crazy todd had found the rhythm of this now and together they played her until she started to scream with ecstasy somewhere in the midst of this the girl katya was pleasuring began to utter gutwrenching cries a little time later katya must have had mercy on her and allowed her to be carried off because when todd was next getting close to coming he looked away from the blissedout faces beneath him and saw katya sitting amongst the jasmine and the honeysuckle with a young man lying naked at her feet covering them with reverential kisses she was watching todd her expression inscrutable somebody lit a cigarette for her todd smiled at her and thenbefore she could choose either to return the smile or ignore ithe fell back into the bliss of his mйnageаtrois thinking that if this was what sex with the dead was like then the living had a lot to learn five tonight was one of those nights when marco had decided to get drunk an honourable occupation as his father had always said he didnt like to drink in company in truth he didnt much like company people in this town were full of bullshit and marco didnt want to hear it hed come out to los angeles after his career in professional wrestling had come to a premature conclusion halfthinking he might have a crack at acting then someone had suggested that personal security might be a good job for a man like himself since he not only looked intimidating but had the moves to back up his appearance so marco had joined an agency and after working for a succession of spoiledbrat moviestars who treated him as though he was something theyd just found on their shoe he was ready to head for home then within days of his planned departure the job with todd pickett had come along it turned out to be a perfect match he and todd hit it off from the start they had the same taste in girls cars and whisky which was more or less the contents of marcos fantasy world tonight he wanted a girl and was tempted to go out hit the clubs on the strip see if he got lucky if not there was always the credit card he had no qualms about paying for sex it certainly beat the fivefingered widow but before he went out he always liked to get mellow with a whisky or two it made him more sociable besides there was something strange about the house tonight though he didnt know what earlier on hed been tempted to go out and take a look around just to be sure they didnt have any intruders but by now the whisky had got him feeling too lazy to be bothered fuck it they should get another dog dempsey had been a great early warning system as soon as anyone came anywhere near the house hed go crazy tomorrow marco thought as he headed down from his bedroom to get a fresh bottle of whisky hed talk to todd again about buying a pup using the security angle to get past todds loyalty to dempsey he found the whisky and poured himself a glass taking it neat in one swallow then he looked at his watch it was eleventwenty hed better get moving los angeles was an early town hed discovered especially midweek if he didnt hurry hed be too late to catch any of the action he started back upstairs to fetch his wallet but halfway up he heard a noise at the bottom of the stairwell it sounded like a door opening and closing boss he yelled down is that you there was no reply just the door continuing to open and close though there was no wind tonight to catch it huh he said to himself he went up found his wallet picked up his whisky glass from the kitchen on the way back down and descended the stairs there were plenty of places around the house he hadnt explored one of them was the very lowest level of the house which jerry had told him were just storerooms nor had he advised using them they were damp and anything put down there would be mildewed in a month he said a few steps from the bottom of the stairs marco emptied his glass and set it down he was now drunk he realized as he stood upright not paralytically just nicely pleasantly toasted smiling a little smile of selfcongratulation for having achieved this blissful state he continued down it was cold here in the bowels of the house but it wasnt the damp cold that jerry had warned him about this was an almostbracing cold like a late autumn night in his home town of chicago he went down the little corridor that led from the bottom of the stairs at the end of which was the noisy door which had brought him down here what the hell was making it open and close that way he felt the answer on his face the closer he got to the door there was a wind blowing down here unlikely as that seemed and it smelled not of small mildewed rooms but of wide green spaces for the second time in this journey marco said huh he pushed open the door there was complete darkness on the other side but it was a high wide darkness his gut told him and the wind that gusted against him camethough this was beyond reasonacross a stretch of open land he wished he hadnt drunk the whiskies now wished he had his senses completely under his control so that he could assess this phenomenon clearly he put his hand around the corner of the door looking for a light switch there wasnt one or at least there wasnt one his fingers could find never mind this would be a mystery for tomorrow for now hed just close the door and go back to his drinking he reached in and caught hold of the doorhandle as he clasped it there was a flicker of light in the depths of the room no not of light of lightning a fragmentary flicker which was followed by three much longer flashes in such quick succession they were almost a single flash by it he saw the space from which the wind came and had his instincts confirmed wide it was and high the thunderhead which spat the lightning was miles away across a landscape of forest and rock oh jesus marco said he reached out for the doorhandle caught hold of it and slammed the door closed there was a lock but no key still it seemed firmly enough closed at least until hed found todd and shown him he started yelling todds name as he ran up the stairs but there was no reply he went to the master bedroom knocked and entered the room was empty the french doors to the balcony open the drapes billowing he went to the balcony the wind that was moving the drapes was a california wind warm fragrant gentle it was not remotely like the wind that had blown against his face in the room below that was a wind from a different country todd was not on the balcony but once marco was out there he heard the sound of voices from somewhere in the canyon womens voices mostly laughing and lights running between the trees sonofabitch marco said the boss was apparently having a party and he hadnt invited marco the evening was getting stranger by the minute he went downstairs through the kitchen and out to the back door anxiety had soured the drink in his stomach and as he opened the back door a wave of nausea suddenly overcame him he had no time to get outside he puked on the threshold the force of the feeling enough to fold his legs up beneath him he gazed weakly down at the splattered whisky and meatballs on the ground his eyes vaguely comprehending the intricacy of five nails that were driven into the partially rotted wood of the threshold then from the darkness on the other side of the threshold there came a soft infinitely sorrowful voice the voice of a lost girl let me in she said marco looked up his head still spinning there was more vomit gurgling in his belly he could feel his system preparing to revolt again he tried to make sense of the girl who just begged entrance to the house narrowing his eyes to see if he could separate her from the shadows there she was a young woman with a face that his sickened eyes could not entirely fix nor be certain of but who seemed to be more than passingly pretty she had long blonde hair and pale almost white skin and as suited her tone of supplication she was on her knees her pose a mirror image of his own she was wearing what appeared to be a mans shirt which was unbuttoned had marco been feeling more like himself he might have hoped to persuade her to take the shirt off before he took pity on her but the nausea overwhelmed all other responses the girls nearnakedness only made his belly churn harder he looked away from her hoping to postpone the next bout of vomiting until she was out of sight she plainly took his averted eyes as a sign of rejection please she said to him again i just want to get back into the house you have to help me im in no condition he started looking up at her to try and communicate with the expression just how dire he felt but the few words hed begun to say were enough to bring about a sudden and calamitous change in her she let out a shriek of frustration and rage volume and shrillness uncanny he felt his gorge rising and as the womans din reached its inhuman height he puked up what was left of his dinner the worst was over now but there was more to come from the woman outside feeling his stomach settling he chanced a look up at her it was an error she was still letting out the remnants of that godless shriek of hers and it seemedat least to marcos sickened and bewildered eyesthat the noise was taking some grotesque toll on her body her facewhich had been so beautiful just minutes beforehad become a grey smeared form her forehead swollen so that she looked cretinous her eyes pulled into empty slits her mouth running with saliva from its turned down corners her oversized shirt of hers had fallen open to reveal breasts that were gray scraps of dead flesh hanging on the cage of her bones beneath them he seemed to see her innards in frenzied motion as though she had snakes nesting in her it was too much for marcos already traumatized senses he didnt give any further thought to finding toddchrist todd was probably part of this insanity with his heels sliding in the mess hed made he hauled himself to his feethalf expecting the abomination on the other side of the threshold to come after him but for some reason she kept her distance her transformation now so far advanced she was completely unrecognizable as the woman hed first laid eyes on he retreated down the passagewaystill assuming this nightmare might come after him but she matched his retreat with one of her own melting into the shadows marco wasnt reassured shed probably gone to find others he didnt want to be here when they came back he raced into the kitchen and picked up his car keys which were on the table he gave a moments consideration to the possibility of lingering to wash his face and hands but he decided to forego cleanliness in favour of making a fast exit he drove down the serpentine road that led out of the canyon as if he were being pursued by a horde of demonwomen and without even thinking about it took the same route hed taken with todd countless times up onto mulholland drive he opened the window as he drove so as to have a sobering breeze blowing against his face but it had very little effect there was too much alcohol in his blood and too much panic inflaming that alcohol to make him a safe driver on such a notoriously tricky and dangerous stretch of road he didnt care he just wanted to put some distance between himself and that damn canyon as fast as possible on one of the hairpin bends his clammy hands slid on the wheel and he momentarily lost control of the car he was a good enough drivereven in his present stateto recover quickly and things might have been fine had another speedfreak not come barreling round the corner in the opposite direction the other driver took quick evasive action and was away round the bend before marco lost what little control he had the wheel slipped through his hands and his drinkslurred foot was too slow on the brake to stop the car from skewing round squealing loudly there was no barrier between the road and the drop not even a wooden fence the front half of the vehicle went over the edge and there it lodged for a moment finely balanced between solid asphalt and oblivion marco muttered a little prayer but god wasnt listening the car tripped forward and slid off the road into darkness it was a straight drop of perhaps forty or fifty feet the vehicle didnt hit solid ground however it fell into the massive boughs of a sycamore tree which was large enough to hold the car nose down in its branches marco was thrown against the windshield through it he could see the yard in which the sycamore stood there was a party going on down there the pool was illuminated its bright turquoise water twinkling lanterns hung in the bushes all around swaying in the breeze marco had time to grasp the prettiness of all this then something ignited in the engine and the fumefilled air around him became a sheet of lurid orange flame it enveloped him completely the first burst of heat enough to sear the clothes from his body and set his hair and flesh alight blindly he fumbled for the handle of the door and pulled on it the rush of air only excited the flames further through the stench of gasoline and burning plastic he could smell the sickening tang of his own body being cooked still he fought to escape and gravity was on his side the car was so positioned that he had only to lean forward and fall out through the open door the sycamores boughs slowed his descent but once he was dear of them there was an eighteen foot drop to the polished mexican pavers around the pool he scarcely felt the impact the fire had completely traumatized his nerveendings nor could he see anything his eyelids had been fused shut by the heat he could still hear though he wouldnt make much sense of the garbled cries of the people who had gathered to witness his agonies there was one person in the crowd who was willing to do more than stand and watch him burn marco felt arms grab hold of him heard his savior yelling something about the pool then he was in freefall again as the man whod picked him up threw him into the water the flames were instantly extinguished but the cure was too much for his flesh to endure the sudden shock of cold after the blistering heat of the fire sent his body into systemic failure his last breatha bubble of heated airescaped from his cooked lungs then he sank to the bottom of the pool even so the people around the pool didnt give up on him three of the partygoers dived into the pool and brought his blackened firewithered body up from the bottom he was tenderly rifted onto the side of the pool where one of the girls attempted to breathe some life back into him but it was a lost cause the man whod made such a dramatic entrance into the gathering was dead and beyond hope of saving this was not quite the end of events along that stretch of mulholland drive however just a few hours later as the first light of dawn was breaking a jogger who ran a twomile route along the drive daily rain or shine saw a light on the road close to the place where marcos tires had left their blackened imprint on the asphalt apparently aware that it had an unwanted witness the mysterious luminescence rose up into the brightening air and was gone the following evening paul booth the man whod had the courage to carry the burning body of marco caputo to the poolwent out into the back yard alone he was in a melancholy state of mind the party hed thrown the previous night had been in honour of his little sisters sixteenth birthday some celebration alice had barely stopped crying since he could hear her now sobbing in the house he took out the halfsmoked reefer hed been saving for a happier occasion and lit it up as he drew on the pungent smoke he looked up and saw a patch of luminous air lingering at the edge of the pool it had no discernible shape it was simply a gentle brightness which would have been invisible half an hour before when the sun had still been up he watched the brightness as it hung there for ten perhaps fifteen seconds then he nipped out his reefer pocketed it and went back inside to find someone to tell he found his father and together they emerged into the backyard the light had already gone from beside the pool there paul said pointing up at something that could have been the light hed seen now up on mulholland drive but it could just as easily have been the light of a car coming round the treacherous corner of the road and anyway it had gone in a heartbeat leaving both father and son doubting what theyd seen six in the depths of the canyon no more than half a mile from the pool and the lawn and the tree where ava hung tammy lay in the dirt and waited for the end shed done all she could do to survive she had eaten berries and licked the dew off leaves shed fought off the feverdreams which threatened to claim her consciousness shed forced herself to walk when she had no strength left in her limbs it had tricks this canyon ways to lead you round and round in circles so that you burned up all your energies coming back to the place youd started from it put colors before your eyes that were so bewitching that you ended up turning round and round on the spot to catch them like a dog chasing its own tail and sometimes it went into your head and found the voices there that were most comforting then made them call to you arnie and the man who used to do her drycleaning in sacramento mr obrien whod always had a smile and a wink for her and todd of course her beautiful hero todd calling out to her just to make her stumble a few more steps she hadnt quite believed any of these voices were real but that hadnt stopped her following them back and forth around and aboutvoices and colorsuntil at last she had no strength left in her body and she fell down so now she was down and she was too weak to get up again too damn heavy ever to get her fat ass up and moving at the back of her head was the fear that the freaks would come and find her but they didnt come at least by daylight perhaps she thought they were waiting for darkness meanwhile there were plenty of things that did come flies dragonflies hummingbirds all flitting around as for the summonings from arnie and mr o brien and todd once she was down on the ground none of these came either the canyon knew it had her beaten all it had to do was wait and shed perish where she lay the day crept on in the middle of the afternoon she fell into a stupefied daze and when she woke experienced a short and surprising burst of renewed ambition to save herself after much effort she managed to get to her feet and started to walk in what she thought was the direction of the house but after ten minutes the canyon seemed to realize she was up and walking and it began its little tricks afresh the colors came back so did the voices she fell to her knees crying begging it to leave her alone but it was merciless the voices were louder than ever yelling incoherently in her head the sky was every color but blue okay she said okay okay just leave me alone to die i wont get up again i promise i swear just leave me be it seemed to get the message because by degrees the yelling receded and the colors dimmed she lay back in the foliage and watched the sky darken the stars emerge birds flew overhead returning to their nests before the onset of night she envied them just a little but then what did she have to go home to in truth a house in the suburbs shed never really loved a husband the same what a mess shed made of her life what a ridiculous empty mess all that time wasted doting on a man shed seen on a screen hours spent flicking through her treasures fantasizing never really living that was the horror of it she was going to die and shed never really lived the sky was almost lightless now she could barely see her hand in front of her face she let her eyes slide closed draping the stars in the grass around her the cicadas sang a rhythmical lullaby suddenly somewhere not very far off there rose an unholy din part howl part yelp part laughter her eyes sprang open the hairs at her nape stood on end was this a farewell performance by the canyon one last attempt to squeeze her wits dry no no this wasnt for her benefit it was too far away up at the house yes that was it somebody up at the house was having one hell of a party curiosity got the better of her fatigue tammy pushed herself up onto her knees and attempted to figure out where the cacophony was coming from there was light visible between the trees flickering but not flames this was too cold a light to be fire perhaps this wasnt a party after all the din was as nasty as it was raucous who the hell could be making such a noise the freaks perhaps it seemed the likeliest source she pictured them laying siege to the house oh god in heaven suppose theyd gone after todd sniffed him out in his weakened state and attacked him the thought of harm coming to him was unbearable even now it forced her to get up off the ground something she couldnt have done on her own behalf for a few seconds she stood with legs wide planted uncertain whether she was going to fall down again then she told herself to move and much to her surprise her body obeyed the instruction her legs felt like lead and her head as light as a helium balloon but she managed to stagger five or six steps without falling down the noise from the house had subsided somewhat but the lights were still visible between the trees she paused for a moment to catch her breath and while she did so she studied the lights trying to make sense of them was it possible what she was seeing were people yes it was several of the figures had slipped away from the immediate vicinity of the house and were coming closer to her some were zigzagging through the trees as though they were engaged in a game of some kind what sort of creatures were these she wondered that capered like children playing but had such luminescence about them she stumbled on another two or three steps but her body wasnt going to carry her much further she knew it was only a matter of time before she fell down again and next time she knew she wouldnt have the strength to pick herself up then very close by she heard the sound of something moving through the thicket she looked in the direction of the sound an animal perhaps a coyote or tammy she held her breath not quite daring to believe that she recognized the voice its willem he said her legs almost gave out from sheer gratitude he came out of the bushes and caught hold of her before she fell im heavy she warned him im strong he said so she let him take her weight sinking against his chest as she relinquished herself to him she heard a little girl somewhere nearby sobbing pitifully she was about to ask who the hell it was making such a noise when she realized it was her own voice its all right zeffer said im here now everythings going to be fine she wasnt sure that she believed him it sounded like a bad piece of dialogue to her but this was no time to be judgmental hed come to look for her and she was grateful she put her head on his chest like a bmovie heroine snatched from the jaws of death and laughing then sobbing then laughing again let him put his arms around her and rock her awhile seven finally it had not been todd whod lost control but her other lover i canthold backmuch longer he said the girl was beyond giving even the most rudimentary instructions she lay in a daze of pleasure her legs hoisted up by todd so that he could see the wonderful machinery of their interconnected anatomies are you ready the other man said to him his face was liquid shadow his eyes wild you say the word lift her legs higher todd did as he was instructed noticing as he did so that their game had brought all the other games in the immediate vicinity to a halt everyone was watching the spectacle their gazes ravenous the girls eyes were closed but there was no doubt that she had achieved and was sustaining some state of sexual nirvana there was a gioconda smile on her wet lips and when on occasion her lids did flutter open only the whites of her eyes were visible the girls other lover had one hand on her face a thumb pressed between her lips but his other hand was gripping the muscle that ran from todds nape to his shoulder gripping it so hard it hurt todd was glad of the pain it was just enough to keep him distracted from emptying himself the mans eyes opened wide oh yeah he bellowed and todd came the closest hed ever come to feeling another mans orgasm the girl opened her eyes and looked at todd you too she said no said another voice todd looked up it was katya who had spoken she was looking at him with an appreciative smile on her face clearly shed enjoyed watching the mйnageаtrois but it was clear she now wanted todd to leave the game gotta go he said to the girl she put her hand down between their legs as though to hold him inside sorry he said and pulled out of her as he stood up there was a light patter of applause from the vicinity of the bower quite the performer katya said as she stood up she had his pants he started to put them on pressing his dick out of sight you can come back and find them again another night katya said as she hooked her arm through todds and escorted him away from the place it seemed the scene in the nightblooming jasmine had begun a chain reaction amongst the ghosts as they walked through the warm darkness he saw orgiasts on every side involved in pleasuring themselves and one another clothes had been shed in the grass or hung in the branches like halloween spooks kisses were being exchanged murmurs of passion as hed already discovered death had done nothing to dim the libidos of these people though their dust and bones lay in cold tombs and mausoleums across the city their spirits were very much in heat here and as katya had told him nothing was forbidden it was only curious to see so many familiar faces amongst the orgiasts faces he associated with everything but this comedians and adventurers and players of melodrama but never naked never aroused and again as had been true in the bower what he would have turned away from in revulsion in the company of the living intrigued and inflamed him here amongst the famous dead was that gary grant with his trousers around his ankles and randolph scott paying tribute below was that jean harlow lying on one of the lower boughs of a tree with her foot running up and down the erection of a man standing devotedly by there were others many others he only halfrecognized or didnt recognize at all but katya supplied names as they wandered back to the house gilbert roland and carole lombard frances x bushman and errol flynn a dozen times seeing some coupling in progress he wanted to ask was that soandso three of four times he did when the answer was consistently yes he gave up asking as for what was actually going on well the pictures in the pool house had given him a good idea of how wild things could get and now he was seeing those excesses proved in the flesh for just about every sexual peccadillo was being indulged somewhere in the canyon tonight nor did todd discount the possibility that even more extreme configurations than those he could see were going on in the murk between the trees given what hed ended up doing after only a short night here imagine the possibilities an occupant in the canyon might invent with an indeterminate number of nights to pass knowing you were dead but denied a restingplace what new perversions would a soul invent to distract itself from the constant threat of ennui at last the crowd of fornicators thinned and katya led himby a path he hadnt previously seen it being so overgrownback to the big house what i am about to show you she warned him as they went will change your life are you ready for that is it something to do with why youre here why im here why theyre here why the canyon is the most sacred place in this city yes all of the above then show me he said im ready she took a tighter hold of his hand theres no way back she warned him i want you to understand that there is no way back he glanced over his shoulder at the partygoers cavorting between the trees i think that was true a long time ago he said i suppose it was katya replied with a little smile and led him out of the darkened garden and back into her dream palace eight im hungry tammy told zeffer cant we get some food from the house before we leave you really want to find todd zeffer said admit it no i dont care she stopped herself in midlie well maybe a little she said i just want to check that hes all right i can tell you the answer to that hes not all right hes with her frankly that means you may as well forget about him when katya wants a man katya gets him were you married to her i was married when i met katya but i never became her husband she never wanted me i was just there to serve her right from the start to make her life easier todds a different story shes going to suck him dry like a vampire you mean tammy said after all shed seen the idea didnt seem so preposterous shes not the kind who takes your blood shes the kind who takes your soul but she hasnt got todd yet has she tammy said i mean he could still leave if he wanted to i suppose he could zeffer said his voice laced with doubt but tammy i have to ask you why do you care about this man so much whats he ever done for you it took tammy a few moments to muster a reply i suppose if you look at it that way he hasnt done anythingtangible hes a movie star and im one of his fans but i swear willem if he hadnt been around over the last few years i would have had nothing to live for you would have had your own life your marriage youre clearly a sensible woman i never wanted to be sensible i never really wanted to be a wife i mean i loved arnie i still do i suppose but its not a grand passion or anything it was more a convenience thing it made things easy when taxtime came around so what did you really want for yourself for myself you wont laugh i wanted to be the kind of woman who comes into a room and instantly everybodys got something to say about her thats what i wanted so you wanted to be famous i guess that was part of it you should ask katya about fame shes always said it was overrated how did we get off the subject of todd because its impossible to help him let me just go into the house and talk to him for a while and maybe get something to eat while im there havent you seen enough of this place to be afraid of it yet zeffer said im almost past being afraid tammy replied it was the truth shed seen her share of horrors but shed lived to tell the tale they were twenty yards from one of the several staircases that ran up from the garden into the house please she said to zeffer i just want to go inside and warn him if that doesnt work ill leave and ill never look back i swear zeffer seemed to sense the power of her will on the subject he put up no further protest but simply said you realize if you get in katyas way i cant step in to help you i have my own allegiances however foolish you may think they are then ill make sure i dont get in her way tammy said im not even supposed to go into the house believe it or not not allowed on the furniture either if youre saying im little better than her dog youre right but its my life i made my choices just as you made yours he sighed there are some days when i think hard about killing myself just to be free of her but it might not work i might slit my throat and wake up back where i started her dead dog instead of her living one tammys gaze slid past him to study the luminous people playing between the trees the sight should have astonished her but shed seen too much in the last little while for this to impress her much the scene before her was just another piece of the canyons mystery are they all dead she asked in the same matteroffact way shed sustained through much of their exchange all dead you want to go look he studied her hesitation you do but you dont want to admit to it its all right theres a little voyeur in everybody if there wasnt thered be no such thing as cinema he turned and looked towards the flickering figures weaving between the trees she used to have orgies all the time in the golden age and i liked nothing better than to pick my way amongst the configurations and watch but not now no theres only so much human intercourse anyone can watch do they look horrible oh no they look the way they looked at the height of their beauty because thats the way they want to remember themselves perfect forever or at least for as long as god allows this place to last tammy caught the apocalyptic undertone in this what do you mean she said that sooner or later therell be an end to this endless indulgence a day of judgment if you will and i think he dropped his voice to a whisper though there was no one nearby you may be its deliverer me she also dropped her voice why me its just a hunch a piece of wishful thinking if you like theyve had their time and i think some of them know it theyre a little more desperate than they used to be a little more shrill why dont they just leave ah we had to come to that at last the reasons very complex and to tell you the truth i would not really know where to begin let me put it this way they are afraid that if they leave this canyon they may break the spell that keeps them in their strange state of perfection and do you believe that yes i believe it theyre prisoners here beautiful prisoners a few minutes after katya and todd had left the party out on the nightlawn a whisper went amongst the revenants and one by one they gave up their pleasures whatever theyd been and turned their hollow gazes towards the house there are only so many times you can play out the old flesh games without losing interest in them yes you could add piquancy if you introduced a whip or some rope you could mate with somebody of your own sex but all of it grew wearying with repetition no feast can ever be so tempting that finally the act of eating doesnt lose its appeal sooner or later even the most ambitious glutton must crawl away and seek the solace of the vomitorium it was the same for the ghosts theyd been here in the presence of their own perfection for decades and now it meant nothing to them theyd seen that beauty denied and debauched theyd seen it locked in every configuration lust could devise and there was nothing left to surprise them the presence of living flesh in the form of todd pickett might momentarily reignite some old flames but the conflagration quickly died away once he was removed from their company now their eyes went to the house and though they said nothing the same thought went through all their melancholy heads maybe tonight something would change maybe tonight with this man in her company the queen of sorrows would make a mistake a few of them began to move in the general direction of the house attempting to seem casual but fixing their silvery eyes on their destination a bank of cloud had come in off the pacific and covered both moon and stars on the ridge of the opposite side of the canyon some of the grotesque offspring of these weary beauties began a wordless howling in the darkness the sound was loud enough to carry down the hill to sunset and the beverly hill flats several valets parking cars for a private party on rexford drive paused to comment on the weird din from up in the hills a couple of patients close to death at cedarssinai called for their priests a man who lived next door to the house on van nuys where lyle and eric menendez had murdered their mother and father decidedhearing the soundto give up screenwriting and move back to wisconsin todd heard it too of course what in gods name is that he and katya were deep in the bowels of the house in a place he had never known existed much less explored take no notice katya told him as the noise came again even louder and more plaintive whatever it is its out there its not in here with us she took hold of his arm and kissed his cheek he could smell ava on her his erection still throbbed are you ready she said to him ready for what they were approaching a door just a little smaller than the front door and similarly medieval in style on the other side of that door is something that was given to me a long time ago it changed my life as i told you it will also change yours when you first get in there its bewildering you just have to trust me im going to be with you all the time even if you cant always see me and i swear no harm is going to come to you you understand me todd this is my house even this place which will seem very remote from everything youve seen so far is also mine he didnt know quite what to make of any of this but his curiosity was certainly piqued so dont be afraid she told him i wont be he said wondering what kind of game she was playing now she who knew so many what did she have up her sleeve as had happened so many times now she read his thoughts this isnt a game she said or if it is its the most serious game in gods creation there was surely a trace of condescension here but what the hell im ready he said she smiled in half an hour youll realize what an absurd thing it is youve just said she told him why because nobody can be ready for this then she pushed open the door before tammy went to find todd she had to eat had to so while todd was stepping over the threshold into a place that would change his life tammy was in the kitchen three stories above at the open fridge gorging on whatever her hands found cold chicken potato salad some chinese takeaway do we have to do this now zeffer said looking around nervously she could come in here at any minute yes well let her im hungry willem in fact im fucking starving give me a hand here will you what do you want something sweet then im done he dug around on the inner shelves of the fridge and found an almostintact cherry pie the sight of which made tammy coo the way most women cooed when they saw babies zeffer watched her with an expression of bemusement on his face she was too hungry to care she lifted a slice of pie to her mouth but before she could get it to her tongue zeffer caught hold of her wrist what she said listen tammy listened she heard nothing so she shook her head listen he said again and this time she heard what he was drawing her attention to the windows were shaking so were the doors the cutlery on the sink was rattling as were the plates in the cupboards she let the slice of pie drop from her fingers her appetite suddenly vanished whats going on she wanted to know theyre downstairs zeffer said his voice tinged with superstitious awe todd and katya theyve gone downstairs what are they doing there you dont want to know zeffer said hurriedly please i beg you lets just go the windows were shaking with mounting violence the boards creaked beneath their feet it was as though the entire structure of the house was protesting about whatever was happening in its midst tammy went to the kitchen sink ran some cold water and washed the food from around her mouth then she skirted around zeffer and headed to the door that led to the turret and the staircase wrong direction zeffer said he pointed to the other door thats the safest way out if todds down there then thats the way i want to go tammy said as she spoke she felt a blast of chilly air coming up from below it smelled nothing like the rest of the house nor of the gardens outside something about it made the small hairs at her nape prickle she looked back down at zeffer with a question on her face i think i need to tell you whats down there before you take one more step he said outside the spirits of the dead waited and listened they had heard the door that led into the chamber of the hunt opened they knew some lucky fool was about to step into the devils country if they could have stormed the house and slipped through the door ahead of him they would have gladly done so at any price but katya had been too clever she had put up defenses against such a siege five icons beaten into the threshold of each of the doors that would drive a dead soul to oblivion if they attempted to cross they had no choice therefore but to keep a respectful distance hoping that some day the icons would lose their terrible potency or that katya would simply declare an amnesty upon her guests and tear the icons out of the thresholds allowing her sometime lovers and friends back inside meanwhile they waited and listened and remembered what it had been like for them in the old days when theyd been able to go back and forth into the house at will it had been bliss back then all you had to do was step into the devils country and you could shed your old skin like a snake theyd come back to the chamber over and over so as to restore their failing glamour and it had dutifully soothed away their imperfections made their limbs sleek and their eyes gleam all this was kept secret from the studio bosses of course and when on occasion a goldwyn or a thalberg did find out katya made sure they was intimidated into silence nobody talked about what went on in coldheart canyon even to others that they might have seen there the stars went on about their public lives while in secret they took themselves up to coldheart canyon every weekend and having smoked a little marijuana or opium went to look at the hunt knowing that they would emerge rejuvenated there was a brief golden age when the royalty of america lived a life of nearperfection sitting in their palaces dreaming of immortality and why not it seemed they had found the means to renew their beauty whenever it grew a little tired so what if they had to dabble in the supernatural for their fix of perfection it was worth the risk thenbut inexorablythe golden age began to take its toll the lines theyd driven off their faces began to creep back again deeper than ever their eyesight started to fail back they went into the devils country desperate for its hearing power but the claim of time could not be arrested terrible stories started to circulate amongst the lords of tinseltown nightmare stories somebody had woken up blind in the middle of the night it was said somebody else had withered before her lovers appalled eyes fear gripped the golden people and anger too they blamed katya for introducing them to this ungodly panacea and demanded that she give them constant access to the house and the hunt she of course refused this quickly led to some ugly scenes people started appearing at the house in the canyon in desperate states of need beating at the door to be let in katya hardened her cold heart against them however realizing she would soon be under siege she hired men to guard the house night and day for several months through the spring and summer of she and zeffer lived in near isolation ignoring the entreaties of her friends who came begging for an audience with her and for a chance to see the devils country she refused all but a very few in fact nobody truly understood what was happening in the bowels of the house why should they they were dealing in mysteries even old father sandru who had sold zeffer the piece did not understand but their eager flesh had discovered what the dry intellect of metaphysicians had not like opium addicts denied their fix they went blindly after the thing that would heal their pain without needing to understand the pharmacology that had driven them to such desperation for a time they had been happy in the canyon they remembered happy in katyas house happy looking at the pictures of the hunt on the tiled walls which had moved so curiously before their astonished eyes so it followeddidnt itthat if they kept returning to the canyon and into that strange country of tile and illusion they would be happy and healthy again but katya wouldnt let them she was leaving them to suffer denied the only thing they wanted of course katya was no more knowledgeable about the alchemy at work in her dream palace than those in her doomed circle she knew that the gift of healing and the fever of need that followed was all brought about by being in the devils country but how it worked or how long it would operate before its engines were exhausted she had no idea she only knew that she felt possessive of the room it was hers to give and take away as her will desired needless to say the more tearful visitors she had at her gates the more letters she received the less inclined she was to invite in those whod written them partly because she was afraid of the depth of addiction she had unleashed in these people partly because she was anxious that the power of the devils country might not be limitless and she was not about to be profligate with a power that she needed as much as they there might come a time she supposed when she would need the healing effects of the house purely for herself and when that time came shed be covetous of every wasted jot of it this wasnt something she could afford to be generous with not any longer it was her life she was playing with here her life everlasting she needed to preserve the power she had locked away below ground for fear one day its sum was the difference between life and death and thenas though things were not terrible enoughthey had suddenly got worse it began on monday the rd of august with the sudden death of rudy valentino only three weeks before he had managed to get past the guards in coldheart canyon and had pleaded with katya to let him stay with her he didnt feel good he told her he needed to stay here in the canyon where hed spent so many happy times and recuperate she told him no he became aggressive told herhalf in italian half in englishthat she was a selfish bitch wasnt it time she remembered where she came from he said she was just a peasant at heart like him just because she acted like a queen didnt make her one to which shed snappily replied that the same could not be said for him hed slapped her for that remark shed slapped him back twice as hard always prone to sudden emotional swings valentino had promptly started to bawl like a baby interspersing his sobs with demands that she please god have mercy on him im dying he said thumping his gut with his fist i feel it in here she let him weep until the carpet was damp then she had had him removed from the house by two of her hired heavies and tossed into the street it had seemed like typical rudy melodrama at the time im dying im dying but this time hed known his own body better than shed given him credit for he was the first to pay the ultimate price for visiting the devils country three weeks after that tearful conversation he was dead the hoopla over valentinos sudden demise hid from view a series of smaller incidents that were nevertheless all part of the same escalating tragedy a minor starlet called miriam acker died two days after rudy of what was reported to be pneumonia she had been a visitor to the canyon on several occasions usually in the company of ramon navarro pola negrianother visitor to the canyonfell gravely ill a week later and for several days hovered on the brink of death her frailty was attributed to grief at the passing of valentino with whom she claimed to have had a passionate affair but the truth was far less glamorous she too had fallen under the spell of the hunt and now though she denied it was sickening in fact death took an uncommonly large number of hollywoods luminaries in the next few months and for every one who died there were ten or twenty who got sick and managed to recover though none were ever possessed of their full strength or flawless beauty again the coincidence was not lost on either the fans or the journalists a harvest of death is sweeping hollywood film photoplay morbidly announced as star after star follows the greatest star of all rudolph valentino to the grave the idea that there was some kind of plague abroad caught the publics imagination and was fed voraciously by those whod predicted for reasons of their own that judgment would eventually fall on tinseltown preachers whod fulminated against the sinners of the new sodom were now quick to point out the evidence in support of their grim sermons and the public whod a decade before taken pleasure in crowning actors as the new royalty of america were now just as entertained by the spectacle of their fall from grace they were fakes and foreigners anyway it was widely opined no wonder they were falling like flies theyd come here like plaguerats in the first place hollywood was going to hell in a handcart and it didnt matter how rich or beautiful you were there was no escaping the cost of the high life up in the canyon katya dared believe she was safe shed added three german shepherd dogs to the retinue guarding her and she had men patrolling the ridges and the roads that led to the canyon night and day it was such a strange time the whole community was unsettled there was talk of lights being seen in the sky especially in the vicinity of deathsites a number of small cults came into being all with their own theories of what was happening the most extreme interpreted these lights as warnings from god the end of the world was imminent their leaders announced and people should prepare themselves for the apocalypse others interpreted the lights more benignly they were messengers from god this faction claimed angels sent to guide the deceased out of the coil of mortal confusions into the next life if this was the case then these heavenly presences were not happy that hell now had a stronghold in the canyon though the dead came there the lights did not indeed on several occasions they were seen at the bottom of the hill three or four of them gathered in a cloud of luminescence plainly unwilling to venture into the canyon for her part katya took such reports as evidence that her defenses were working nobody could get into her precious canyon or such was her conviction in fact her sense of security like so much else in her increasingly fragile life was an illusion one evening walking in the garden the dogs suddenly got crazy and out of the darkness stepped rudy valentino he looked entirely unchanged by death his skin as smooth as ever his hair as brilliantly coifed his clothes as flawless he bowed deeply to her my apologies he said for coming here i know im not welcome but frankly i didnt know where else to go there was no hint of manipulation in this it seemed to be the unvarnished truth i went home to falcon lair rudy went on but its been trampled over by so many people it doesnt feel as though its mine any more pleasei beg youdont be afraid of me im not afraid of you katya replied quite truthfully there were always ghosts in my village we used to see them all the time my grandmother used to sing me to sleep and shed been dead ten years but rudy lets be honest i know why youre up here you want to get in to see the hunt just for a little while no please no she said waving him away i really dont want to hear any more of this why dont you just go back to sicily costellaneta wherever im sure theyll be pleased to see the ghost of their favorite son she turned her back on him and walked back towards the house she heard him following on after her his heels light on the grass but solid enough its true what they said about you cold heart you say whatever you like rudy just leave me alone he stopped following her you think im the only one he said to her his words brought her to a halt theyre all going to come up here in time it doesnt matter how many dogs you have how many guards theyll get in your beautiful canyons going to be full of ghosts stop being childish rudy she said turning back to look at him is that how you want to live katya like a prisoner surrounded by the dead is that the life you had in mind for yourself im not a prisoner i can leave whenever i want to and still be a great star no to be a star you will have to be here in hollywood so so you will have company night and day the dead will be here with you night and day we will not be ignored you keep saying we rudy but i only see you the others will come theyll all find their way here sooner or later did you know virginia maple hanged herself last night you remember virginia or perhaps you dont she was i know virginia and no i didnt know she hanged herself nor frankly do i much care she couldnt take the pain the pain of being kept out of this house being kept away from the devils country its my house i have a perfect right to invite whoever i like into it you see nothing but yourself do you oh please rudy no lectures on narcissism not from you of all people i see things differently now oh im sure you do im sure you regret every selfobsessed moment of your petty little life but thats really not my problem now is it the color of the ghost before her suddenly changed in a heartbeat he became a stain of yellow and gray his fury rising in palpable waves off his face i will make it your problem he shrieked he strode towards her you selfish bitch and what did they call you she snapped back powderpuff was it it was an insult she knew would strike him hard just the year before an anonymous journalist in the chicago tribune had called him a pink powder puff why didnt somebody quietly drown rudolph guglielmi alias valentino years ago hed written rudy had challenged the man to a boxing match to see which of them was truly the more virile the journalist had of course never shown his face but the insult had stuck and hearing it repeated now threw valentino into such a rage that he pitched himself at katya reaching for her throat she had halfexpected his phantom body to be so unsubstantial that his hands would fail to make any real contact but not so though the flesh and blood of him had been reduced to an urn full of ashes his spiritform had a force of its own she felt his fingers at her neck as though they were living tissue they stopped her breath she was no passive victim she pushed him back with the heel of one hand raking his features from brow to midcheek with the other blood came from the wounds stinking faintly of bad meat a disgusted expression crossed valentinos face as he caught a whiff of his own excremental self the shock of it made him loose his hold on her and she quickly pulled away from him in life shed remembered hed always been overly sensitive to smells a consequence perhaps of the fact that hed been brought up in the stench of poverty his hand went up his wounded face and he sniffed his fingers a look of profound revulsion on his face she laughed out loud at the sight valentinos fury had suddenly lost its bite it was as though in that moment he suddenly understood the depths to which the devils country had brought him and then out of the darkness zeffer called what the hells going on out he didnt finish his question hed seen valentino oh jesus christ almighty he said hearing the lords name taken in vein valentinogood catholic boy that he wascrossed himself and fled into the darkness valentinos vengeful prediction proved entirely accurate in the next few weeks the haunting of coldheart canyon began at first the signs were nothing too terrible a change in the timbre of the coyotes yelps the heads torn off all the roses one night the next all the petals off the bougainvillea the appearance on the lawn of a frightened deer throwing its glassy gaze back towards the thicket in terror it was zeffers opinion that they were somehow going to need to make peace with our unwanted guests as he put it or the consequences would surely be traumatic these were not ethereal presences he pointed out wafting around in a hapless daze if they were all like valentino then they posed a physical threat they could murder us in our beds katya he said to her valentino wouldnt maybe not valentino but there are others plenty of others who hated you with a vengeance virginia maple for one she was a jealous woman remember and then to hang herself because of something you did to her i did nothing to her i just let her play in that damn room a room which you brought into our lives zeffer covered his face i knew it would come down to that eventually yes im responsible i was a fool to bring it here i just thought it would amuse you she gave him a strangely ambiguous look well you know it did how can i deny that it still does i love the feeling i get when im in there touching the tiles i feel more alive she walked over to him and for a moment he thought she was going to grant him some physical contact a stroke a blow a kiss he didnt really mind anything was better than her indifference but she simply said you caused this willem you have to solve it but how perhaps if i could find father sandru hes not going to take the tiles back willem i dont see why not because i wont let him christ willem ive been in there every day since you gave me the key its in my blood now if i lose the room itll be the death of me so well move and well take the room with us its been moved before well leave the ghosts behind wherever the hunt goes theyll follow and sooner or later theyll get so impatient theyll hurt us zeffer nodded there was truth in all of this bitter though it was what in gods name have we done he said nothing we cant mend katya replied you should go back to romania and find sandru maybe theres some defense we can put up against the ghosts where will you stay while im gone ill stay here im not afraid of rudy valentino dead or alive nor that idiotic bitch virginia maple if i dont stay theyll find their way in would that be such a bad thing why not let them share the place we could make a pile of them on the lawn and no that room is mine all of it every damn tile the quiet ferocity with which she spoke silenced him he just stared at her for perhaps a minute while she lit a cigarette her fingers trembling finally he summoned up enough courage to say you are afraid she stared out of the window almost as though she hadnt heard him when she spoke again her voice was as soft as it had been strident a minute ago im not afraid of the dead willem but i am afraid of what will happen to me if i lose the room she looked at the palm of her hand as though she might find her future written there but it wasnt the lines of her hand she was admiring it was its smoothness being in the devils country has made me feel younger willem it did that to everybody younger sexier but as soon as its taken away yes youll get sick im never going to get sick she allowed herself the time for a smile perhaps im never going to die dont be foolish i mean it so do i dont be foolish whatever you think the room can do it wont make you immortal the wisp of a smile remained on her face wouldnt you like that willem no just a little bit i said no he shook his head his voice dropping not any more meaning what what do you think i mean this life of oursisnt worth living there was a silence between them it lasted two three four minutes rain began to hit the window fat spots of it bursting against the glass ill find sandru for you willem said finally or if not him somebody who knows how to deal with these things ill find a solution do that she said and if you cant dont bother to come back part six the devils country one todd knew the mechanics of illusion passably well hed always enjoyed watching the special effects guys at work or the stuntmen with their rigs and now there was a new generation of illusionists who worked with tools that the old matte painters and modelmakers of an earlier time could not even have imagined hed been in a couple of pictures in which hed played entire scenes against blank green screens which were later replaced with landscapes which only existed in the ticking minds of computers but the illusions at work in this room of katyas were of another order entirely there was a force at work here that was both incredibly powerful and old even venerable it did not require electricity to fuel it nor equations to encode it the walls held it with possessive caution beguiling him by increments at first he could make virtually no sense of the images it simply seemed that the walls were heavily stained then as his eyes became accustomed to reading the surface he realized he was looking at tiles and that what hed taken to be stains were in fact pictures painted and baked into the ceramic he was standing in a representation of an immense landscape which looked more realistic the longer he looked at it there were vast expanses of dense forests there were stretches of sundrenched rock there were steep cliffwalls their crannies nested by fearless birds there were rivulets that became streams in turn converging into glittering rivers which wound their way towards the horizon dividing into silverfringed deltas before they finally found the sea such was the elaboration of the painting that it would take many hours of study perhaps even days to hope to discover everything that the painters had rendered and that would only have been the case if the pictures had been static which as he was now astonished to see was not the case there were little flickers of motion all around him a gust of wind shook the tangle of a thicket one of those fearless birds wheeled away from the cliffface three hunting dogs sniffed their way through the undergrowth noses to the ground katya todd said there was no reply from behind him so he looked back she wasnt there nor was the door through which hed stepped to come into this new world there was just more landscape more trees more rocks more birds wheeling the motion multiplied with every flicker of his gaze there were ripples on the rivulets and streams there were clouds over the sea being hurried along by the same wind that filled the sails of the ships that moved below there were men too all around riders moving through the forest some solitary some in groups of three or four one procession of five horses mounted by richly attired men parading solemnly between the trees and fishermen on the banks of the streams and on little boats bobbing around the sandbars at the delta and in one place inexplicably two men laid out naked on a rock and in another far more explicable another pair hanging from a tree while their lynchers sat in the shade of the old tree theyd put to such guilty use and looked out at the rest of the world as they shared a flagon of beer again he looked around for katya but she wasnt to be seen but shed said shed be close by even ifas nowhe couldnt see her the room he began to understand had control of his eyes he found his gaze repeatedly led away from where she might be led skyward to gawk at some passing birds led into the forest where animals he could not name moved as if in some secret ceremony and others fought and others lay dead and still others were being born and still he kept looking and still he kept seeing and though there were horrors here to be sure nothing in him made him want to leave off his seeing there was a curious calm upon his soul a kind of dreamy indifference to his own situation if hed reasoned this out perhaps he would have concluded that he wasnt afraid because none of this could possibly be real but he did not reason it out he was beyond reasoning at that moment beyond anything indeed but witnessing he had become a living instrument a fleshandblood camera recording this wonderland he kept turning on his heel counterclockwise as sights caught his attention off to his left and left again and left again everything here had a miraculous shine to it as though whatever divinity had made it had an army of workers at his or her command perpetually polishing the world every leaf on every tree had its gloss every hair on every mammal and every scale on every reptile had its sheen every particle of dirt down to the shit from the fleainfested backside of a boar had a glamour all of its own a rat sniffing in the carcass of a gored hound came away with drops of corruption on its whiskers as enchanting as a lovers eyes the earth at his feet was a surfeit of glories a worm his heel had halfkilled was lovely in its knotted agonies nothing was inconsequential here except perhaps todd pickett and if that was the case then he wasnt about to dispute the point he would not wish anything here other than the way it was includingfor the first time in his lifehimself this thoughtthat he was finally at peace with himselfcame over him like a breaking wave cooling a long and exhausting fever if he was nothing here he thought except the eyes with whichthese strangenesses could be glorified then that suited him fine and if in the end the witnessing burned him up and made an end to him that was fine too perfectly fine to die here watching this shining world it would hear no complaint from him you like it ah there was katya off to his right a little distance staring up at the glamorous sky he followed her gaze and saw something hed missed until now the sun was threequarters eclipsed by the moon that was why the light was so peculiar here it was the light of a world in permanent semidarkness a murk which had inspired everything that lived here to catch its own particular fire to snatch every last gleam of light out of the air and magnify it to be its own exquisite advertisement yes he said to her hearing something very close to tears in his voice i like it very much not everybody does of course she said glancing over at him some i brought here were so afraid that they ran and of course thats not a very smart thing to do here why not she wandered over to him assessing him as she did so as though to see if he was telling the truth and that he really liked what he saw apparently satisfied she laid a light kiss on his cheek it almost felt as though she was congratulating him coming here had been a test he realized and hed passed you see over there just beyond the hill the deep forest there yes then you also see the horsemen coming through the trees theyre the reason we shouldnt run they are why theyre hunters the duke goga who leads them counts all these lands as his own theyre getting closer yes they are how is that possible what do you mean i mean how is it possible that theyre getting closer to us theyre in the walls is that what you think she said coming closer to him is that what you really believe he stood still for a moment and listened to his heart what did his heart tell him the wind gusted cold against his face it was not a californian wind overhead the sun remained eclipsed though he knew there was no possible way to see the sky from this deep a place in the house im in another world good she said and its real again good and does it trouble you to be in the middle of such a mystery no he said i dont know why and im not sure i care she put her arms around him holding him tighter than shed held until now and looked deep into his eyes looking deeper than shed ever looked it doesnt matter my love whether its in my head or your head or the head of god or the devil or the devil it doesnt matter not to us she spoke the last three words as a near whisper close to his ear he kissed her he realized now how cannily shed led himteasing him with outlandish visionsghosts and ungodly pleasures slowly deconstructing his beliefs about what was real and what was not all in preparation for this wonder of wonders nothing matters to us huh he said between kisses were above it all she said as she spoke she put her hand down between his legs he was like a rock you want to make love to me of course i do you want to go back up to bed no i want to do it right here he pointed to the hard ground at their feet again she laughed this newfound fire in him seemed to entertain her she lifted up her dress so that he could have sight of her she was naked lie down he told her she did so without a second instruction lifting and parting her legs as she lay at his feet so that he should have full disclosure of her she ran her hand over herself into the groove and out again wet to touch her anus he could hear the rhythm of the hunters horses in the ground underfoot duke goga and his party were getting closer todd glanced up towards the trees he could no longer see the men the forest had become too deep but they were nearby no matter he could watch the hunters another day right now he had sport of his own he unbuttoned his pants and let his dick spring out katya sat up instantly and took it in her hand rubbing it so big maybe it was maybe it wasnt he liked the fact that she said it and there was an appetite for it in her eyes the likes of which hed never seen on a womans face before she started to pull on his cock not to pleasure him simply to bring him down to her into her he went down on his knees between her legs such was the lightness of her dress that it could be lifted up almost to her neck to expose her belly and breasts he put his face down against her flat stomach licking her navel then going up to her breasts it had always been a fantasy of his to wash a woman with his tongue every inch of her from the corners of her eyes to the cleft of her buttocks simply to be her servant bathing her with his tongue this was the woman he would realize that fantasy with he knew this was the woman he would realize every fantasy with and hers was the body with which he could play freely doing anything his heart desired anything that was the only word of this sexual delirium that escaped him anything but she seemed to know what it meant because she raised his face from her breasts and smiled at him yes i know she said anything you want and for me anything you want yes she took hold of the collar of his shirt and drew his face closer to hers they kissed while she moved beneath him seeming not to care about the hard dirt against her naked buttocks her naked back he had his hands either side of her to support himself but that was all he needed to do she was perfectly capable of doing the rest she lifted her hips a little and caught the head of his cock between her labia then sighing she delivered herself up and upon it in one sweet motion now she put her arms around his neck and let out a most extraordinary sigh a sound of complete abandonment todd looked down at her face with something that began to feel like helpless adoration the polishers whod put a shine on everything in this strange world must have saved their best labors for her the down on her cheek the dark curve of her lashes the fabulous hierarchy of lilacs and blues and turquoise in her eyes all were perfect she was almost unbearably beautiful his eyes stung at the sight of her i love you he said the words came out with such ease that they were said before he had chance to spoil them by making a performance out of them of course hed said it before plenty of times but never like this it sounded for the first time simple simple and true she raised her head from the ground until her lips were almost touching his i love you too she whispered yes you know i do youre the one ive waited for todd all these years ive been patient because i knew youd come she pressed her hips up towards him sheathing him completely then still holding onto him she began to pull herself off him a little way just until the head of his dick was about to find the air then smothering it again down to the root there was a heavy reverberation in the ground todd could feel it through his palms the hunters he said yes she said as though this was of little consequence gogas close we should stay very still until hes passed by she drew todd down on top of her he couldnt see the huntsmen yet but the noise was getting louder nevertheless the reverberations made the little shards of rock around her head decorated with tiny fragments of fossil dance finally they came into view rising over the crest of a hill some twentyfive or thirty yards from where they lay locked together there were five of them in the dukes party and they looked as though theyd been riding for a very long time their horses shone with sweat and the menall of whom were dressed in tattered tunicsshowed signs of extreme fatigue but even their exhaustion had a kind of livid beauty to it their skin was as bright or brighter than the bone that it concealed their eyes which were sunk deep in their sockets had a fevered brilliance in them todd wasnt surprised they looked so harried given the orders of beast hed glimpsed here yes there were wild pigs and stags but there were other kinds of creature far less easily categorized things that looked as though the devil had had a hand in their design lethal quarry no doubt indeed there were signs that the party had been recently attacked one of the horses had a number of deep gashes on its rump and its rider had dearly suffered in the encounter his left arm hung limply and a large dark bloodstain had spread from a place under his arm across a third of his upper body his lips were drawn back from his teeth in pain his eyelids drooping even if katya hadnt named the leader it would have been clear to todd that he was of a higher social standing than his companions his horse a more finely bred animal than those the others rode its mane and tail braided as for the man himself he was almost as beautifully coifed as his mount his full dark beard wellshaped his long hair a good deal cleaner than that of his companions but these cosmetic polishes aside he was in no better shape than his fellow riders his eyes were sunk deep into his skull and his body for all the upright position he held in his saddle was full of little tics as though he were uncomfortable in his own skin in his left hand he held the reins of his horse his right rested on the golden pommel of his sword ready to unsheathe the blade in a heartbeat todd had never played in a medieval moviehis face was far too contemporary and his acting skills too rudimentary for an audience to believe him as anything but a modern man but hed seen his share of epics the kind heston had made in the fifties and early sixties all rhetoric and posestriking the men approaching them looked nothing like the wellfed heroes of those epics their bodies were wizened their looks so intense they looked more like escaped lunatics than hunters goga raised his right hand and with a silent gesture slowed the advance of the party the mensensing their leaders apprehensionproceeded to scan the landscape around them looking for some sign of their enemy whoever or whatever it was todd stayed very still just as katya had instructed had these men been gunslingers he would have described them as triggerhappy plainly they were nervous and exhausted not men to meddle with but even as he lay there barely daring to breathe he felt katya reach down between his legs and proceed to stroke his balls he gave her an astonished look which she returned with a mischievous little smile she stroked him back to full erection and then subtly maneuvered her body so that he was once again fully sheathed by her the sensation felt even more extraordinary than it had a few minutes before without seeming to move her hips she contrived to make waves of motion move up and down her channel massaging him all the while the horsemen approached and the closer they came the more desperate they looked these were men who apparently lived in a constant state of fear to judge by their expressions one of the dukes four followers the oldest and the most scarred mumbled a prayer to himself as he rode and in his hand he clutched a plain wooden cross which more than once he kissed for comforts sake todd was somewhere between ecstasy and panic he didnt dare move even if hed wanted to katya meanwhile was free to play havoc with his nerveendings he didnt move his hips he didnt need to she had all the moves her internal manipulations were becoming more elaborate all the time driving him closer and closer to losing control todd had always been a noisy lover sometimes embarrassingly so now the best he could do was bite his lip until he tasted blood and will himself not to let a sound escape him the horsemen were so close now that he did not dare move his head to look at them but he could just see them from the corner of his eye the duke gave an order in romanian stai nauzi ceva the men brought their horses to a halt the duke no more than four yards from where todd and katya lay on the ground had it not been for the fact that the eclipse rendered the light here so deceptive the pair would surely have been seen and dispatched a single blade skewering them both in an instant but as far as todds limited vision could tell the men were looking further afield for their quarry scanning the distant landscape rather than the ground yards from their horses hooves there was another exclamation from the duke and this time a response from one of his men todd had the impression that they were listening for something he listened along with them what could he hear nothing out of the ordinary the cry of birds wheeling overhead the coarse breathing and snorting of the horses the slap of the reins against their massive necks and closer by the breathing of the woman beneath him anda smaller sound stillthe rhythmical click of a beetle as it made its clockwork way over the small stones close to his hand in his minds eye all of this around the tender place where their bodies met the bird and the horse and the stones and the beetle orbiting his pleasure he saw her smile beneath him and with the tiniest contraction of her vulva she brought him to the point of no return there was a flash of brightness in his head which momentarily washed everything out she came back out of the fog to meet him with her eyes halfclosed her pupils so full beneath them that they seemed to edge out the whites then her lids fluttered closed completely and he started to spurt into her he could not have stopped crying out if his life had depended on it no it did and still he let out a sob of relief there was a shout the duke was issuing an order it made no sense to todd but he looked up anyway as his body continued its spastic motion emptying itself into her the man whod dismounted was now striding towards them unleashing his sword the duke spoke again cine sunt acesti oameni he obviously wanted to know who the hell these people were because by way of reply there were shrugs from the other men the last spasm passed through todds body and with it went the idiot sense of his own inviolability the bliss was gone he was empty and mortal again the man with the sword put his boot into todds side it was a hard kick and threw him off katya he rolled over in the dirt which got a laugh from the youngest of the men seeing the lovers wetly parted thus the duke was issuing further orders and in response another of the riders dismounted his sword drawn todd spat out a mouthful of earth and made an attempt to push his rapidly wilting erection back into his pants before it became a target katya was still lying on the ground the first of the men whod dismounted was standing over her his sword dropped so that its point hung no more than two or three inches above her pale slender neck the first word out of todds mouth was please the nobleman was looking at him with a strange expression on his face part amusement part suspicion i dont know if you can understand me todd said to him but we meant no harm he glanced down at katya who was staring up at the blade he doesnt know what youre saying she said let me try she spoke now in the language of the lord doamne eu si prietenul meu suntem vizitatori prin locurile astea nam sttut ca este proprietatea domniei tale todd looked and listened wondering what the hell she was saying but her explanation whatever it was didnt seem to be making any great change in their circumstances the sword was still at her throat while the second horseman was now within two or three yards of todd waving his own blade around in a highly menacing fashion todd glanced up at the duke again the trace of amusement todd had thought hed seen there had gone there was only suspicion now it crossed todds mind that perhaps it had been an error for katya to speak in the mans tongue that perhaps shed only deepened his belief that these lovers were more than overheated trespassers he felt a prick in the middle of his chest the cold point of the sword was pressed into his skin a small pool of blood was already coming from the spot spreading through the weave of his shirt katya had stopped talking for a momenttodd thought perhaps she realized she was doing more harm than goodbut now she began again making whatever pleas she could the man on the braided horse raised his hand liniste he said hed obviously told her to shut the hell up because that was exactly what she did there was a sound on the wind and it instantly had all of the noblemans attention somewhere not so far away a baby was crying a mournful wail of a sound thatthough it was surely humanreminded todd of the noise the coyotes would make some nights in the canyon after a few moments of listening the duke let out a stream of orders lasatii pe cai alai copilul the two men whod been threatening katya and todd sheathed their swords and returned to their mounts the babys cry seemed to falter for a moment and todd feared it would fade completely and the swordsmen would return to their threats but then the infant seemed to find a new seam of grief to mine and the wail rose up again more plaintive then ever the men were exchanging more urgent words and pointing in the direction from which the sound was coming este acolol grabitiva in padure copilul este оn padure katya and todd were summarily forgotten the horsemen were by now all remounted and the duke was already galloping away leaving his weary company to follow in his dust todd felt a curious sense of betrayal the kind felt when a story takes an unanticipated turn that he should have come into this halfeclipsed world and been made to bleed at the point of a sword seemed absolutely apt that the man whod threatened him had ridden away to pursue a crying baby did not what the hell is going on he said as he bent to help katya up off the ground they heard qwaftzefoni the devils child she said who she looked back in the direction of the riders they were already halfway to the line of densely packed trees from which the pitiful summons had seemed to come receding into the quarterlight as though being steadily erased its a long story she said i heard it first when i was a childand it used to frighten me yes he said oh yes well todd said a little impatiently are you going to tell me i dont know if itll frighten you he wiped the blood from the middle of his chest with the heel of his hand there was a deep nick in his chest which instantly welled with blood again tell me anyway he said two though it had been zeffer whod offered the explanation of what lay down in the guts of the house tammy opened the conversation with a question that had been niggling at her since shed first come into this place she returned to the kitchen table where shed been eating her cherry pie sat down and said what are you afraid of i told you twice three times i shouldnt be in here shell be angry that doesnt answer the question katyas just a woman for gods sake let her be angry you dont know what she can be like why dont you try telling me then maybe ill understand tell you he said flatly as though the request was impossible how can i tell you what this place has seen what i was what she was try i dont know how he said his voice getting weaker syllable on syllable until she seemed sure it would crack and break he sat down at the table opposite her but he said nothing all right tammy said let me give you a hand she thought for a moment then she said start with the house tell me why it was built why youre in it why shes in it back then we did everything together who is she ill tell you who she was she was katya lupi a great star one of the greatest some would once have said and in its day this house was one of the most famous houses in los angeles one of the great dream palaces and the rest of the canyon is hers too oh yes its all hers coldheart canyon thats what they called it she had a reputation you see for being a chilly bitch he smiled though there was more rue in the expression than humor it was deserved and the things out there which things which things tammy said a little impatiently the freaks the things that attacked me those those are the children of the dead you say these things so casually the children of the dead believe it or not the dead dont have kids in sacramento they just rot away quietly well its different here willem i dont care how different it is the dead cant have children you saw them believe your eyes tammy shook her head not in disbelief rather in frustration how could it be that the rules of the world worked one way in one place and so very differently in another the truth is i dont know zeffer said answering her unspoken question over the years the ghosts have mated with the animals and the results are those things maybe the dead are closer to the condition of animals i dont know i only know its real ive seen them youve seen them theyre hybrids sometimes theres a kind of beauty in them but mostlyugly as sin all right so i buy the hybrids but why here is it her in a roundabout way i suppose he mused for a moment and thenapparently with great effort as though since theyd come into the house a lifetime of suffering had caught up with himhe got to his feet he went to the sink and turned on the faucet running the water hard then cupping his hand he took some up to his lips and drank noisily this done he turned off the faucet and looked over his shoulder at her i know in my heart you deserve to know everything after all youve been through youve earned the truth he turned fully to her but before i tell you let me say im not sure i understand any of this much more than you do well i understand nothing tammy said he nodded well then how do i start this ah yes romania he put his hand up to his face and wiped some water off his lower lip katya was born katya lupescu in romania a tiny village called ravbac and in the summer of just after wed built this house i went back with her to her homeland because her mother was sick and was not expected to live more than another year shed been brought up in utter poverty abuse and poverty but now she was a great star coming home and it was extraordinary really to see how she had transformed herself from these beginnings to the woman shed become anyway there was a fortress close to the village where katya was born and it was run by the order of st teodor who made it their business to protect the place when we arrived katya and myself had both been given a tour but she wasnt very interested in the old fortress and priests with halitosis neither was i frankly but i wanted to leave her with her family to talk over old times so i went back to the goga fortress a second day the monk who took me round made it dear that the order had fallen on hard times and the brothers needed to sell off what they could tapestries chairs tables it was all up for sale frankly i didnt care for much of it and i was about to leave then he said let me show you something special really special and i thought what the hell ten more minutes and he took me down several flights of stairs into a room the likes of which id never seen before what was in there it was decorated with tilesthousands of tilesand they were all painted so when you walked into the room it was almost as thoughno it was as though you were walking into another world he paused contemplating the memory of this awed by it still after all these years what kind of a world tammy asked him a world that was both very real and completely invented it had space for sky and sea and birds and rabbits but it also had a little pinch of hell in the mix just to make things more interesting for the men who lived in that world what men well one man in particular his name was duke goga and he was there in the walls on a hunt that would last until the end of time the man on the horse katya said was the duke i got that todd said he lived a long time ago im not sure of exactly when when youre a little child you dont listen to those kind of details its the story you remember and the story was this one day in autumn the duke went out hunting which he did all the timeit was his favorite thing to doand he saw what he thought was a goat trapped in a briarthicket so he got off his horse telling his men that he wanted to kill this animal himself he hated goats having been attacked by one and badly hurt as a baby he still had scars on his face from that attack and they ached in the cold weather all of which served to keep his hatred of goats alive perhaps it was a petty thing this hatred but sometimes little things can be the unmaking of us theres no doubt that goga would not have pursued his goat as far as he did had he not been injured as a child and thento make matters worseas he approached the animal history virtually repeated itself the animal reared up striking the duke with its blackhoof and cracking his nose the goat then ran off goga was furious beside himself with fury to have been mistreated by a goat twice he got straight back on his horse blood pouring from his broken nose and went after the animal riding hard through the forest to catch up with it his entourage went with him because they were bound to follow the duke wherever he went but they were beginning to suspect that there was something strange about where they were headed and that it would be better for them all if they just turned round and rode back to the fortress but goga wouldnt do that of course not he was determined to chase down the animal that had struck him he wanted revenge on the thing he wanted to stick his sword through it and cut out its heart and eat it raw that was the kind of rage he was in so he kept riding and his men out of loyalty kept following further and further from the fortress and the paths they knew into the depths of the forest steadily even the duke began to realize that what his men were whispering was right there were creatures here lurking about the likes of which god had not made he could see things between the trees that didnt belong in any of the bestiaries he had in the fortress strange ungodly creatures as katya told her story todd glanced at the dark mass of trees into which goga and his men had just ridden was that the deep wood she had just described surely it was the same horsemen the same trees in other words he was standing in the middle of katyas story sothe duke kept riding and riding driving his poor horse as he followed the leaping goat deeper and deeper into the forest until they were in a place where there were certain no human being had ever ventured before by now all the men even the most loyal the bravest of them were begging the duke to let them turn back the air was bitter and sulfurous and in the ground beneath the horses hooves the men could hear the sound of people sobbing as though living souls had been buried alive in the black smoking dirt but the duke would not be moved from his ambition what kind of hunters do you call yourselves he said to his men if you wont go after a goat wheres your faith in god theres no danger to us here if our hearts are pure so on they went the men quietly offering up prayers for the safety of their souls as they rode and eventually after a long chase their quarry came in sight again the goat was standing in a grove of trees so old they had been planted before the flood in the tangled roots of which grew mushrooms that gave off the smell of dead flesh the duke got off his horse drew his sword and approached the goat whatever thing you are he said to the animal breathe your last nice line todd remarked the animal reared up as though it was going to strike the duke with its hoof a third time but goga didnt give it the opportunity he quickly drove his sword up into the belly of the animal as soon as it felt the sword entering its flesh the goat opened its mouth and let out a pitiful wail katya paused here watching todd waiting for him to put the pieces together oh christ he said like a baby exactly like a baby and hearing this pitiful human sound escaping the animal goga pulled his sword from the goats body because he knew something unholy was in the air have you ever seen an animal slaughtered no well theres a lot of blood a lot more than you think theres going to be it was like that now yes the goat was thrashing around in a pool of red its back legs kicking up the wet dirt so that it spattered goga and his men and as it did so it started to change into what katya smiled the smile of a storyteller who had her audience hooked by some unexpected change of direction into a little child she said a boy a naked little boy with a nub of a tail and yellow eyes and goats ears so now the duke is looking down at this goatboy twitching in the mud made of dirt and blood and the superstitious terror which his men had felt finally seizes hold of him too he starts to speak a prayer ttal nostru care ne eti in ceruri sfineascase numele tu fie imprtia ta facse voia ta precum оn cer aa si pe pmnt todd listened to the unfamiliar words knowing in the cadence that what katya was reciting was not just any prayer it was the lords prayer pвinea noastr cea de toate zilele dneo nou azi si ne iart nou greselile noatre he scanned the landscape as he heard the prayer repeated nothing had changed since hed first set eyes on the place the light of the eclipse held everything in suspension the trees the ships the lynchers at their tree the rush of pleasure hed experienced when he first arrived had diminished somewhere in the midst of katyas taletelling in its place there was now a profound unease he wanted to stop her telling her story but what reason could he give that didnt sound cowardly so she continued the duke retreated leaving his sword stuck deep in the body of the goatboy he intended to climb back onto his horse and ride away but his steed had already bolted in terror he called to one of his men to dismount so that he might have the mans horse but before the fellow could obey the rock beneath their feet began to shake violently and a great chasm opened up in the ground in front of them the men knew what they were witnessing this was the very mouth of hell gaping in the earth beneath their feet it was thirty forty feet wide and the roots of those ancient trees lined it like the veins of a skinned body smoke rose up out of the maw stinking of every foul thing imaginable and a good deal that was not it was such a bitter stench that the duke and his men began to weep like children halfblinded by his own tears and without a horse goga had no choice but to stay where he was on the lip of the hells mouth close to where his victim lay he tore his gloves from his hands and did his best to clear the tears from his eyes as he did so he saw somebody coming up out of the earth it was a woman he saw with hair so long it trailed the ground fully six feet behind her she was naked except for a necklace of white fleas with eyes that burned like fires in their tiny heads thousands of them moving back and forth around the womans neck and up over her face busy about the business of prettifying her she was not looking at the duke her blackred eyes which had neither lashes nor brows were on the goatboy in the time it had taken for the mouth of hell to open the last of the boys life had poured out of him now the childs corpse lay still in the wet dirt you killed my child the woman said as she emerged from the infernal mouth my beautiful qwaftzefoni look at him barely a boy he was perfect he was my joy how could you do such a heartless thing at that moment one of the horsemen behind the duke attempted to make an escape spurring his horse but the goatboys mother raised her hand and at her instruction a gust of wind came up out of the depths of hell so strong that it drew her hair around her and forward like a thousand filament fingers pointing towards the escaping man he didnt get very far the wind shed summoned was filled with barbs like the vicious seedlings of ten thousand flowers they spiraled as they flew and they caught the dukes man in a whirling of tiny hooks blinded by the assault the man toppled from his horse and attempted to outrun the barbs but they were fastened onto him and their motion continued circling his body so that the mans flesh was unraveled like a ball of red twine he screamed as the first circling took off his skin and redoubled his shrieks when a second cloud of barbs caught his naked muscle and repeated the terrible cycle having drawn off a length of the mans tissue they described a descending spiral around him leaving the victim clear for a third and fourth assault his bone was showing now his screams had ceased he dropped to his knees and fell forward in his own shreddings dead overhead carrion birds circled ready to gorge themselves as soon as the body was abandoned this man is the lucky one amongst you the woman said to the duke he has escaped lightly the rest of you will suffer long and hard for what you have done today she looked down at the goatboys corpse her hair crawling around her heels to fondly touch the body of the child the duke fell to his knees knotting his hands together to make his plea lady he said to her in his native tongue this was an accident i believed the boy to be an animal he was running from me in the form of a goat that is his fathers chosen form on certain nights the woman replied goga knew of course what was signified by this only the devil himself took the form of a goat the woman was telling him that she was lilith the devils wife and that the child he had killed was the devils own offspring to say this was not good news was an understatement the duke concealed his terror as best he could but it was terror he felt to be standing on the lip of hell accused of the crime before him was a terrifying prospect his soul would be forfeit he feared all he could do was repeat what hed said i took the boy to be a goat this was a grievous error on my part and i regret it with all my heart the woman raised her hand to silence him my husband has seventyseven children by me qwaftzefoni was his favorite what am i supposed to tell him when he calls for his beloved boy and the child does not come as he used to the duke had barely any spittle in his throat but he used what little he had to reply i dont know what you will say you know who my husband is dont you and dont insult me by pretending innocence i think he is the devil maam the duke goga replied that he is the woman said and i am lilith his first wife so now what do you think your life is worth goga mused on this for a moment then he said christ save my soul i fear my life is worth nothing so said zeffer gogas hunt was painted on every wall of this room not just the walls the ceiling too and the floor every inch of the place was covered with the genius of painter and tilemaker it was astonishing and i thought youd give this astonishing thing to the woman you idolized yes thats exactly what i thought after all it was utterly unique something strange and wonderful but that wasnt the only reason i wanted to buy it now i look back the place had a power over me i felt stronger when i was in that room i felt more alive it was a trick of course the room wanted me to liberate it how can a room want anything tammy said its just four walls believe me this was no ordinary room zeffer said he lowered his voice as though the house itself might be listening to him it was commissioned i believe by a woman known as the lady lilith the devils wife this was a different order of information entirely and it left tammy speechless in her experience so far shed found the canyon a repository of grotesqueries no doubt but theyd all been derived from the human however muddied the route but the devil that was another story deeper than anything shed encountered so far and yet perhaps his presence or the echo of his presence was not so inappropriate wasnt he sometimes called the father of lies if he and his works belonged anywhere hollywood was probably as good a place as any did you have any idea what you were buying she said to zeffer i had a very vague notion but i didnt really believe it father sandru had talked about a woman whod occupied the fortress for several years while the room was made and you think this woman was lilith i believe it was zeffer said she made a place to trap the duke in you see no i dont see the duke had killed her beloved child she wanted revenge and she wanted it to be a long agonizing revenge but it had been an accidentan honest error on the dukes partand she knew the law would not allow her to take the soul of a man who killed her child why would she care about the law it wasnt our human law she cared about it was gods law which governs earth heaven and hell she knew that if she was going to make the duke and his men suffer as she wished to make them suffer she would have to find some secret place where god would not think to look a world within a world where the duke would have to hunt forever and never be allowed to rest now tammy began to understand the room she murmured was her solution and if you think about it its a piece of genius she moved into the fortress claiming that she was a distant cousin of the missing duke and where was he anybodys guess maybe she held him in his own dungeons until the hunting grounds were ready for him then she brought tilemakers from all over europedutch portuguese belgians even a few englishmenand painters again from every place of excellenceand they worked for six months night and day to create what awaits you downstairs it would look like the dukes hunting groundsat least superficially there would be forests and rivers and somewhere at the horizon thered be the sea but she would play god in this world shed put creatures into it that she had conjured up from her own personal menagerie monsters that the painters in her employ would render with meticulous care and then shed take the souls of the duke and his menstill living so that she remained within the lawand shed put them into the work so that it would be a prison for them there they would ride under a permanent eclipse in a constant state of terror barely daring to sleep for fear one of her terrible beasts would take them of course thats not all thats on the walls down there her influence invaded the minds of the men who worked for her and every filthy forbidden thing theyd ever dreamed of setting down they were given the freedom to create nothing was taboo they took their own little revenges as they painted particularly on women some of the things they painted still shock me after all these years are you certain all of this is true no its mostly theory i pieced it together from what i researched certainly duke goga and several of his men went missing during an eclipse on april th the body of one of them was found stripped of its skin thats also documented the rest of the party were never found the duke had lost his wife and children to the plague so there was no natural successor he had three brothers however andagain this is a matter of documented historythey gathered the following september almost six months to the day after the dukes disappearance to divide their elder brothers spoils it was a mistake to do so that was the night the lady lilith took occupancy of the goga fortress she killed them no they all left of their own free will saying they wanted no part of owning the fortress or the land but were giving it over to this mysterious cousin in their brothers name they signed a document to that effect and left all three were dead within a year by their own hand and nobody was suspicious im sure a lot of people were suspicious but lilithor whoever she wasnow occupied the fortress she had money and apparently she was quite liberal with it local merchants got rich local dignitaries were rather charmed by her if the reports are to be believed where did you find all these reports i bought most of the paperwork relating to the fortress from the fathers they didnt want it i doubt they even knew what most of it was and to tell the truth a lot of it was rather dull the price of pigs carcasses the cost of having a roof made rainproofthe usual domestic business so lilith was quite the little housemaker i think she was indeed i believe she intended to have the fortress as a place she could call her own somewhere her husband wouldnt come couldnt come perhaps i found a draft of a letter which i believe she wrote to him to the devil tammy replied scarcely believing she was giving the idea the least credence to her husband zeffer replied obliquely whoever he was he tapped his pocket i have it here you want to hear it is it in english no in latin he reached into his jacket and took out a piece of muchfolded paper it was mottled with age take a look for yourself he said i dont read latin look anyway just to say you once held a letter written by the devils wife go on take it it wont bite tammy reached out and took the paper from zeffers hand none of this was proof of course but it was more than a simple fabrication that much was clear and hadnt she seen enough in her time in the canyon to be certain that whatever was at work here was nothing she could explain by the rules shed been taught in school she opened the letter the hand it had been written in was exquisite the ink though it had faded somewhat still kept an uncanny luster as though there were motes of motherofpearl in it she scanned it all the way down to the immaculate and elaborate lilith that decorated the bottom portion of the page so she said handing it back her fingers trembling slightly what does it say do you really want to know yes zeffer began translating it without looking at the words plainly he had the contents by heart husband she writes i am finding myself at ease in the fortress goga and i believe will remain here until our son is found so she didnt tell him apparently not zeffer scanned the page briefly she talks a little about the work shes doing on the fortressits all very matteroffactthen she says do not come husband for you will find no welcome in my bed if there is some peace to be made between us i cannot imagine it being soon given your violations of your oath i do not believe you have loved me in many years and would prefer you did not insult me by pretending otherwise huh whatever the source of the letter its sentiments were easily understood tammy herself might have penned such a letterin a simpler style perhaps and a little more viciouslyon more than one occasion god knows arnie had violated his own vows to her several times shamelessly zeffer folded the letter up so you can make what you want of all this personally i think its the real thing i believe this woman was lilith and that she stayed in the fortress to work on her revenge where neither god nor her husband would come and bother her certainly somebody created that room and it was somebody who had powers that go far beyond anything we understand what happened when she was finished tammy asked she packed up and disappeared got bored perhaps went back to her husband or found a lover of her own the point is she left the fortress with the room still intact and with goga and his men still in it and thats what you bought thats what i bought of course it took a little time to realize it but i purchased a little piece of hells own handiwork and let me tell youto make light of all this for a momentit was hell to move there were thirty three thousand two hundred and sixtyeight tiles they all had to be removed cleaned numbered packed away shipped and then put up again in exactly the same order that theyd been assembled in i timed it so that the work could be done while katya was off on a world tour publicizing one of her pictures it must have driven you half crazy i kept thinking about how much pleasure katya would derive from the room when it was finished i was oblivious to the human cost i just wanted katya to be astonished and then to look at mewhod given her this giftwith new eyes i wanted her to be so grateful so happy shed fling herself into my arms and say ill marry you thats what i wanted but thats not the way it turned out no of course not what happened did she dislike the room no she understood the room from the beginning and the room understood her she started to take people down there to show the place off her special friends the ones who were obsessed with her and there were plenty of those men and women both theyd disappear down there for a few hours these were people she was having sex with yes you said both men and women preferably together thats what she liked best a little of both and did everybody know about her tastes of course nobody cared it was rather chic at the time for women anyway the nancyboys like navarro and valentino they had to cover it up but katya didnt care what people thought especially once she had the room it changed her it changed everyone who went into it myself included it changed our flesh it changed our spirits how all you have to do is look at me to see how i changed i was born in but i dont look it thats because of the room it has energies you see painted into the tiles i believe its liliths magic in the tiles she used her infernal skills to lock the duke and his men and all those animals into the illusion thats strong magic the monks knew that but they had the good sense to keep their distance from the place so did everyone who went down there stay young oh no by no means it affected everyone a little differently some people simply couldnt take it they went in for a minute and they were out again in a heartbeat why its the devils country tammy believe me it is tammy shook her head not knowing what to believe so some people left because they thought the devil was in there thats right but most people felt some extra burst of energy when they went in the room maybe they felt a little younger a little stronger a little more beautiful and what was the price of it all good question he said the fact is everyones paid a different price some people went crazy because of what they saw in there a few committed suicide mostwent on living feeling a little better about themselves for a while at least then the effect would wear off and theyd need to come back for another fix i knew a number of opium addicts in my life one of them was a russian designer anatole vasilinsky ever heard of him tammy shook her head no real reason why you should he worked for the ballet russes under diaghilev a brilliant man but completely enslaved to the poppy as he used to call it he came to the house only once and of course katya showed him the room i remember the look on his face when he came out he looked like a man whod just seen his own death he was stricken clammywhite shaking i must never come here again he said i dont have enough room in my life for two addictions it would be the death of me thats what the room was of course an addiction it addicted the flesh by making you feel stronger sleeker it addicted the spirit by giving you visions so vivid they were more real than real and it addicted the soul because you didnt want any other kind of comfort once youd been in the room prayer was no use to you laughter was no use to you friends ideals ambitionsthey all seemed inconsequential in that perpetual twilight when you were here you thought all the time about being there again tammy shook her head there was so much here to try and make sense of her mind was reeling do you see now why you must leave and forget about todd hes seen the room thats where she took him are you sure hes down there right now zeffer said i guarantee it where else would she take him tammy got up from the table the food had done her good though she still felt a little lightheaded she was considerably stronger theres nothing heroic about sacrificing yourself for him zeffer pointed out he wouldnt do it for you i know that zeffer followed her to the kitchen door so dont leave while you can tammy i beg you leave ill lead you out of the canyon and you can go home home tammy said the word the idea seemed hollow valueless there was no home for her after this or if there was it wasnt the one shed had arnie the little house in sacramento how could she even think of going back to that i have to find todd she said thats what i came here to do without waiting for zeffer to lead her or escort her she left the kitchen and went to the top of the stairs he called after her another attempt at persuasion no doubt or some more fancy storytelling but she ignored him this time and started down the stairs three katya had a little more of her story still to tell my life is worth nothing the duke had told the devils wife he who had led armies and triumphed in his crusades against the infidel now found his life was at an end and why because he chased and killed what he took to be a goat it was an accident he said his fury at the injustice of this suddenly getting the better of him i demand to be seen by some higher judge than you there is only one higher lilith replied and thats my husband the duke met her cold gaze the profundity of his terror paradoxically making him brave there is a god in heaven he said is there now said lilith are you certain i saw him only once the day he made me since then he has never shown his face this is the devils country goga my lord lucifer rules here or in his absence me i doubt your god will stretch out his hand to save your soul then i shall ride out of here the duke replied you saw what happened to your comrade ill do the same to you before you reach your horse ill have you wailing like a baby at my feet goga wasnt a stupid man he knew there was no use in contradicting the woman hed already seen one of his men horribly slaughtered by her he would surely follow if he attempted to escape all he could do was throw himself upon liliths mercy he went down on his knees and composing himself as best he could he addressed her please gentle lady listen to me im listening i have lost children of my own all six of them dead by the plague and my wife the same way i know the pain you are suffering and im sick that i was its cause but whats done is done i made a mistake that i bitterly regret but how can i take it back had i known i was on your husbands land i would not even have hunted here lilith looked at him for a long while assessing the worth of his appeal well hereafter my lord she said finally it is my pleasure that you and your men will hunt here always another bitter breath up out of hell to accompany these words the womans long hair rose up around her body a few of its strands grazing gogas upturned face get back on your horses hunters lilith said return to your hunt there are boar in the thicket waiting to be driven out there are birds in the trees ready to be shot while they sing kill them at will as it pleases you to do so there will be no charge for your sport the duke was astonished to hear this mild invitation after all that had just taken place and thinking perhaps his plea for clemency had carried some weight with lilith he very slowly got to his feet thanking her its most kind of you he said to invite me to hunt and perhaps another day i will come back here and accept your invitation but today my heart is heavy as well it might be the woman replied so i think instead i will return to the fortress and no she said raising her hand you will not return to the fortress you will hunt i could not madam really i could not sir she replied with a little inclination of her head you misunderstood me you have no choice you will hunt and you will go on hunting until you find my son a second time and bring him back to me i dont understand a second time she pointed to the corpse of the goatchild which lay in its cooling blood her hair drifted over the sprawled cadaver lightly touching the boys chest and stomach and private parts much to the dukes astonishment the child responded to his mothers caresses as the hair touched his chest his lungs drew a little breath and his peniswhich was disproportionately large for one his agegrew steely take your sword out of him lilith instructed the duke but the duke was too terrified at this scene of infernal resurrection to go near the boy he kept his distance filling his breeches in fear you men are all the same lilith said contemptuously you find it easy enough to drive the sword in but when it comes to taking it out you cant bring yourself to do it she stepped into the puddle of her sons blood and reached to take hold of the sword the boys eyes flickered open as he felt his mothers hand upon the pommel then he lifted his hands and caught hold of the blade with his bare palms almost as though he were attempting to keep her from extracting it still she pulled and it slowly came out of him slowly mama the goatboy said his tone almost lascivious it hurts mightily does it child lilith said twisting the blade in the wound as though to perversely increase her childs distress he threw back his head still looking at her from the bottom of his eyes his lips drawn back from his little pointed teeth and this she said turning the blade the other way does this bring you agony yes mama she twisted it the other way and this finally it was too much for the child he let out a hissing sound and spat from his erection several spouts of semensits sharp stink made the dukes eyes sting lilith waited until the boy had finished ejaculating then she drew out the sword the goatboy sank back on the wet earth with a look of satisfaction on his face thank you mama he said as though well pleasured by what had just happened the wound on his belly was already closing up the duke saw it was as though it were being knitted by agile and invisible fingers so too the wounds on his hands incurred when he had seized the blade in a matter of perhaps half a minute the goatboy was whole again so if the child wasnt dead todd said why was the duke guilty of murdering him katya shook her head hed committed the crime the fact that the boy was an immortal was academic hed murdered the child and had to be punished for it todds gaze went again to the trees where the duke and his men had disappeared picturing the look of hope that had appeared on the mens faces when theyd heard the sound of the childs cries now all that made sense no wonder theyd ridden off so eagerly they were still hoping to find the boy and earn their release from the devils country a wave of claustrophobia came up over todd this was not the limitless landscape it had first appeared to be it was a prison and he wanted to be free of it he turned and turned again looking for some crack in the illusion however small but he could find none despite the immensity of the vistas in all directions and the height of heavens above him he might as well have been locked in a cell his breath had quickened his hands were suddenly clammy which ways the door he asked katya you want to leave now yes now its just a story she said no its not i saw the duke we both saw him its all part of the show katya said with a dismissive little shrug calm down theres no harm going to come to us ive been down here hundreds of times and nothing ever happened to me you saw the duke here before sometimes never as close as we saw today but there are always hunters well ask yourself why are there always hunters why is there always an eclipse i dont know why do you always do the same thing in a movie every time it runs so things are exactly the same every time you come here like a movie not exactly the same no but the suns always like that threequarters covered and the trees the rockseven the ships out there she pointed to the ships its always the same ships they never seem to get very far so its not like a movie todd said its more like times been frozen she nodded i suppose it is she said frozen in the walls i dont see any walls theyre there katya said its just a question of where to look how to look trust me you want me to trust you todd said then get me out of here i thought you were enjoying yourself the pleasure went out of it a while back todd said he grabbed her arm hard come on he said i want to get out she shook herself free of him dont touch me that way she said her expression suddenly fierce i dont like it she pointed past him over his right shoulder the doors over there he looked back he could see no sign of an opening just more of the devils country and now to make matters worse he once again heard the sound of hooves oh christ he glanced back towards the trees the duke and his men were riding towards them emptyhanded theyre coming back to interrogate us todd said katya did you hear me we need to get the hell out of here katya had seen the horsemen but she didnt seem overly unnerved she watched them approaching without moving todd meanwhile made his way in the general direction of the door or at least where she had indicated it stood he scanned the place looking for some fragmentthe corner of the doorframe the handle the keyholeto help him locate it but there was nothing having no other choice he simply walked across the stony ground his hands extended in front of him after proceeding perhaps six strides the empty air in front of him suddenly became solid and his hands flattened against cold hard tile the instant he made contact the illusion of the painters trompe loeil was broken he could not believe he had been so easily deceived what had looked like infinite penetrable reality two strides before now looked absurdly fake stylish marks on pieces of antiquated tile plastered on a wall how could his eyes have been misled for an instant then he looked back over his shoulder to call katya over and the illusion in which she stood was still completely intactthe expanse of open ground between where they stood and the galloping horsemen apparently a quarter mile or more the trees beyond them twice that the sky limitless above illusion he told himself all illusion but it meant nothing in the face of the trick before him which refused to bow to his doubt he gave up trying to make it concede and instead turned back to the wall his hands were still upon it the tiles still laid out under his palms which direction did the door lie in right or left he called to katya what the door is it to the right or left she took her eyes off the riders and scanned the wall he was clinging to left she said casually hurry then they didnt find the child forget about them he told her if she was attempting to impress him with her fearlessness she was doing a poor job he was simply irritated shed shown him the way the room worked for gods sake now it was time to get out come on he cried as he called to her he moved along the wall a step to his left then another step keeping his palms flat to the tiles every inch of the way as though defying them to play some new trick or other but it seemed that as long as he had his hands on the tilesas long as he could keep uppermost in his mind the idea that this was a painted world it could not start its trickeries afresh and on the third or was it fourth step along the wall his extended hand found the doorjamb he breathed out a little sigh of relief the doorjamb was right there under his hand he moved his palm over it onto the door itself which like the jamb was tiled so that there was no break in the illusion he fumbled for the handle found it and tried to turn it on the other side tammy had found her way along the passageway and chosen that precise moment to turn the handle in the opposite direction oh jesus todd said its locked you hear that tammy gasped thats todd todd yeah its me whos this tammy its tammy lauper are you turning the handle yeah well let go of it let me try todd let go tammy turned the handle before she opened the door she glanced back at zeffer he was still one flight up the stairs staring out of the window the dead she heard him say what about them theyre all around the house ive never seen them this close before they know there are people passing back and forth through the door thats why do i open the door todds on the other side are you sure its todd yes its todd hearing his name called todd impatiently yelled from the other side yes its me and katya will you please open the fucking door tammys hands were sweaty and her muscles weary the handle slid through her palm i cant open it you try todd struggled with the handle from his side but what had seemed as though it was going to be the easiest part of the procedure was proving the most intractable it was almost as though the room didnt want him to leave as though it wanted to hold on to him for as long as possible to exercise the greatest amount of influence over him to addict him second by second sight by sight he glanced back over his shoulder katya was staring up at the sky moving her hands down over her body as though she was luxuriating in the curious luminosity of this enraptured world for a moment he imagined her naked cradled in the heavenly luminescence but he caught himself in the midst of the fantasy it was surely just another of the rooms tricks to keep him from departing the damn place probably had a thousand such sleightsofmind sexual philosophical murderous he closed his eyes hard against the seductions of the country and put his head against the door the tile was clammy like a living thing tammy he said are you still here yes when i count three i want you to push got it got it okay ready ready one two three she pushed he pulled and the door fell open presenting todd with one of the odder juxtapositions hed witnessed in his life in the hallway on the other side of the door stood a woman who looked as though shed gone several rounds with a heavyweight boxer there were bloody scratches on her face neck and arms her hair and clothes were in disarray in her eyes she had a distinctly panicked look he recognized her instantly she was the leader of his fan club a woman called tammy lauper yes the missing tammy lauper how the hell had she got up here never mind she was here thank god i thought something terrible had happened to you lauper said give it time he quipped behind him he heard the horsemen approaching he glanced around calling again to katya hurry up will you when he returned his gaze to tammy it was clear that shed taken in as best her disbelief would allow the incredible sight over his shoulder her eyes were wide with astonishment her jaw slack so this is what it looks like yes he said to her this is it tammy threw a look back at a stooped older man standing on the stairs behind her he looked almost incapacitated with fear but unlike tammy whose expression was that of someone who had never seen anything like this before it was todds sense that her companion knew exactly what he was seeing and would have liked nothing better than to have turned right there and fled then todd heard katya calling from behind him naming the man zeffer she said the word freezing the man where he stood katya he said inclining his head katya came up behind todd pressing him aside in order to cross over the threshold she pointed at the trespasser as she did so i told you never to come back into this house she yelled at zeffer didnt i he flinched at this though it was difficult to believe she posed much physical threat to him she summoned him down the stairs come here she said you worthless piece of shit i said come here before he could obey her tammy intervened its not his fault she said i was the one who asked him to bring me down here katya have her a look of complete contempt as though anything she might have to contribute to the conversation was worthless whoever the hell you are she said this is none of your business she pushed tammy aside and reached out to catch hold of zeffer he had dutifully approached at her summons but now avoided her grasp she came after him anyway striking his chest with the back of her hand a solid blow and another and another as she struck him she said i told you to stay outside didnt i the blows were relatively light but they carried strength out of all proportion to their size they knocked the breath out of him for one thing and shed come back with a second blow before hed drawn breath from the first which quickly weakened him tammy was horrified but she didnt want to interfere in case she simply made the matter worse nor was her attention entirely devoted to the sight of todd or to the assault upon zeffer her gaze was increasingly claimed by the sight visible through the open door it was astonishing despite the fact that zeffer had told her the place was an illusion her eyes and her mind were wholly enamoured by what she saw the rolling forest the rocks with their thickets of thorn bushes the delta and the distant sea it all looked so real and what was that some creature that looked like a feathered lizard its coxcomb yellow and black scuttled into view and out again it halted seeming to look back through the door at her a beast that belonged in some book of medieval monsters than in such proximity to her she glanced back at zeffer who was still being lectured by katya with the door open and the visions beyond presented to her she saw no reason not to step over the threshold just for a moment and see the place more plainly after all she was protected against its beguilements she knew it was a beautiful lie and as long as she remembered that then it couldnt do her any harm could it the only thing in the landscape that was real was todd and it was to him that she now went crossing the dirt and the windblown grass to go to him the feathered reptile lowered its coxcomb as she crossed the ground and slunk away disappearing into a crack between two boulders but todd wasnt watching animallife he had his eyes on several horsemen who were approaching along a road that wound through a dense stand of trees they were approaching at speed kicking up clods of earth as they came were they real tammy wondered or just part of the landscape she wasnt sure nor was she particularly eager to put the question to the test yet with every passing second she was standing in this world the more she felt the power of the room to unknit her doubts she felt its influence seeping through her sight and her skin into her mind and marrow her head grew giddy as though shed downed two or three glasses of wine in quick succession it wasnt an unpleasant sensation by any means especially given the extreme discomfort of the last few hours she felt almost comforted by the room as though it understood how shed suffered of late and was ready to soothe her hurts and humiliations away it would distract her with its beauty and its strangeness if she would only trust it for a while tammy she heard zeffer say behind her his voice was weak and the effect his summons had on her was inconsequential she didnt even acknowledge it she just let her eyes graze contentedly on the scene before her the trees the horsemen the road the rocks soon she knew the riders would make a turn in that road and it would be interesting to see how their image changed when they were no longer moving in profile but were coming towards her she glanced back over her shoulder it wasnt far to the door just a few yards her eyes didnt even focus on whatever was going on in the passageway it seemed very remote from her at that moment she looked back towards the horsemen they had turned the corner in the road and were now coming directly towards the spot where todd and she stood it was the oddest visual spectacle shed ever witnessed to see them growing larger as they approached like illustrations emerging from a book the landscape around them seemed to both recede and advance at the same moment as they approached its motion throwing them forward as the ground beneath their horses drew back like a retreating wave it was an utterly bewildering spectacle but its paradoxical beauty enthralled her all thought of zeffers summons or indeed his safety were forgotten it was as though she was watching a piece of film for the first time not knowing how the mechanism worked upon her she felt todd throw her a sideways glance time to go he said the earth beneath their feet reverberated as the horsemen approached theyd be at the door in thirty or forty seconds come on he said yes she murmured im coming she didnt move it wasnt until todd caught hold of her arm and pulled her back towards the door that she eventually obeyed the instruction and went even then she kept looking back over her shoulder astonished i dont believe what im seeing she said its all real trust me on that he said they can do you harm they had reached the threshold now and she reluctantly allowed herself to be coaxed back over it and into the passageway she was amazed at the speed with which the room had caught her attention made itself the center of her thoughts even now it was still difficult to focus her attention on anything but the scene beyond the door but finally she dragged her eyes away from the approaching horsemen and sought out zeffer he had fallen to his knees three or four yards from the door putting up no defense against katyas assault i told you didnt i she said slapping his head i never wanted to see you in this house ever again you understand me ever again im sorry he said his head bowed i just brought i dont care who you brought this house is forbidden to you yesi know his acquiescence did nothing to placate her the reverse in fact it seemed to inflame her she kicked him you revolt me she said he bent over as though to present a smaller target to her she pushed him hard and he fell she moved in to kick him again aiming for his face but at that moment tammy saw what she was about to do and let out a cry of protest leave him alone she said katya turned what you heard me leave him alone katyas beauty was disfigured by the naked contempt on her face she was breathing heavily and her face was flushed ill do what it suits me to do in my own house she said her lip curling and no fat ugly bitch like you is going to tell me otherwise tammy knew plenty about katya lupi by now of course her intimidating reputation went before her but at that moment seeing zeffer lying on the floor and hearing what the woman had just said any trace of intimidation was burned away by a blaze of anger even the glories of the devils country were forgotten at that moment she walked straight towards katya and pushed her hard laying her hands against the bitchs little breasts to do so katya was clearly not used to being manhandled she came back at tammy in an instant dont you dare touch me she shrieked then she backhanded tammy a clean wide strike tammy fell back the metallic tang of blood in her mouth there were three sickening heartbeats when she feared the force of katyas blow was going to knock her unconscious darkness pulsed at the corners of her vision but she was determined not to be floored by one blow even if it did have something more than ordinary human force behind it as she suspected it did she reached out for something to steady her and her hand found the doorjamb as she caught hold of it she glanced back over her shoulder remembering her proximity to the strange beauty of the devils country but the power of the rooms illusion had been momentarily knocked from her head the walls were simply covered in tiles now there were trees and rocks and a painted river on those tiles but none of it was so finely rendered that it could have been mistaken for reality the only part of the scene before her that was real was todd who was still lingering at the threshold apparently he could see what tammy could not because at that moment he threw himself over the threshold like a man in fear of something coming close on his heels he caught hold of the doorhandle and started to pull the door closed but as he did so katya came back into view and blocked the door with her foot dont close it she told todd todd obeyed her he let go of the handle the door struck katyas leg and bounced open again now the machinations of the room began to work on tammy afresh the gloomy air seethed and the shapes of four horsemen appeared out of the murk still riding towards the door the leaderthe duke tammy thought this is the dukepulled hard on the reins to slow his mount the animal made a din as though its primitive gaze was failing to make sense of what it was ahead of it rather than advance any further it came to a panicked halt throwing up clods of dirt as it did so goga jumped from the saddle shouting a number of incomprehensible orders back at his men who had also brought their animals to a stop they proceeded to dismount there were whispers of superstitious doubt between the men plainly whatever they were witnessing they could make little or no sense of it that fact didnt slow their advance however they dutifully followed their leader towards the door swords drawn by now tammy had recovered sufficiently to grab hold of todds arm and pull him back from the threshold come away she urged him he looked round at her she was probably more familiar with his face and with his limited palette of expressions than she was with her own but shed never seen the look of stupefaction he wore right now the veins at his temples were throbbing his mouth was slack his bloodshot eyes seemed to have difficulty focusing on her she tugged harder on his arm in the hope of shaking him out of his stupor behind him she could see the horsemen approaching the door their step more cautious now that they were almost at the threshold having stopped the door from being closed katya had stepped away from it leaving todd the closest of them all to the horsemen so close in fact that had the duke so chosen he could have lunged from where he stood and killed todd with a single stroke he did not do so however he hung back from the door eyeing it with suspicion and awe though none of the light from the hallway seemed to illuminate the world on the other side of the doorway tammy could see the mans face quite clearly his severely angular features his long braided beard black shot through with streaks of gray his dark heavylidded eyes he was by no means as beautiful as todd had once been but there was a gravitas in his physiognomy which todds cornfed charm could never have approached no doubt he was responsible for all manner of crimesin such a landscape as hed ridden who would not lay claim to their share of feloniesbut in that moment in the midst of a dark journey of her own tammy would have instinctively preferred the eloquence of this face for company than todds easy beauty indeed if she had ever been in love with todd pickettwhich by many definitions she hadshe fell out of love with him at that moment comparing his face with that of duke goga and finding it wanting that was not to say that she didnt want todd safe from this place from the house and all its inhabitants especially katya so she hauled on his arm again yelling for him to get away from the door and this time her message got through to him todd retreated and as he did so katya caught hold of zeffer by the hair and lifted him up tammy was too concerned with reclaiming todd from the threshold to do anything to save zeffer and zeffer in turn did nothing to save himself he simply let the woman he had adored pick him up and with the same nearly supernatural strength tammy herself had felt just moments before katya pitched zeffer through the open door the horsemen were waiting on the other side swords at the ready only now as he stumbled across the ground before them did zeffer raise his arms to protect himself against the swordsmen whether the duke took this harmless motion as some attempt at aggression and reacted to protect himself or whether he simply wanted to do harm tammy would never know the duke lifted his sword and brought it down in a great swooping arc that cut through the meat of zeffers right hand taking off all four of his fingers and the top half of his thumb blood spurted out from the wounds and zeffer let out a cry that was one part disbelief to two of agony he stared at his maimed hand for a moment then he turned from his mutilator and stumbled back towards the door for an instant he lifted his eyes and his eyes met tammys they had a moment only to look at one another then duke goga came at zeffer again and drove his sword through the middle of his back there was a terrible cracking sound as the blade cracked zeffers breastbone and then the point emerged from the middle of his chest zeffer threw back his head and caught hold of the edge of the door with his unmaimed hand he had his eyes fixed on tammy as he did so as though he was drawing the power to do whatever he was planning to do from her there was a long moment when in fact he did nothing only teetered on the threshold his eyelids growing lazy thensummoning one last herculean effort of willhe gave tammy a tiny smile and closed the door in her face it was like being woken from a dream one moment tammy had been staring into zeffers stricken face while the men closed in on him from behind and the sky seethed overhead the next the door had shut this terrible vision out and she was back in the little hallway with todd at her side the sight of zeffers execution had momentarily distracted katya from any further mischief she was simply staring at the door as though she could see through it to the horror on the other side tammy didnt give her a chance to snap out of the trance she started up the stairs pulling todd after her christ todd muttered to himself christ oh christ oh christ five stairs up tammy chanced a backward glance but katya was still standing in front of the door what was she thinking tammy wondered what have i done did a woman like that ever thinkwhat have i done with zeffer gone she would be alone in coldheart canyon alone with the dead not a pretty prospect perhaps she was regretting just a little and while she regretted tammy continued to haul todd after her up the stairs six steps now seven eight nine now the escapees were on the halflanding through the window off to their left tammy could see the sight that had held zeffers attention just minutes before the occupants of coldheart canyon pressing against the glass why didnt they simply break in she wondered they werent after all insubstantial they had weight they had force if they wanted to get in so badly why didnt they simply break the glass or splinter the doors the question went from her head the next instant driven out by a wail of demand from below todd it was katya of course she had finally stirred from her fugue state and was coming up the stairs after them speaking in her sweetest voice her comehither voice todd where are you going tammy felt nauseous katya could still do them harm she still had power over todd and she knew it that was why she put on that little girl questioning voice todd katya said again wait darling if she let go of him tammy guessed he would obey katyas request and then theyd be lost katya would never let him go shed kill him rather than let him escape her a second time there wasnt much advice tammy could give to todd except dont look back he glanced at her his expression plaintive it made her feel as though she were leading a child rather than a grown man we cant just leave her here he said after what she just did dont listen to her katya said her voice suddenly a sirensong the littlegirl lightness erased in favor of something more velvety she just wants you for herself todd frowned you cant leave me todd and then more softly still i wont let you leave me just remember what she did down there tammy said to todd zeffer was a nuisance katya said she was getting closer tammy knew her voice had dropped to a sultry murmur i never loved him todd you know that he hung around causing trouble listen to me you dont want to go with this woman look at her then look at me see what a choice youre making tammy halfexpected todd to obey katyas instruction but todd simply studied the stairs as they climbed which under the circumstances was a minor triumph perhaps he still had the willpower in him to resist katya tammy thought he wasnt her object yet even so the murdering bitch wasnt ready to give up todd katya said now casual as though none of this was of any great significance will you turn round for a moment just for a moment please i want to see your face before you go thats not asking much now is it just one more time i cant bear it please toddicantbear it oh lord tammy thought shes turning on the tears she knew how potent a welltimed flood of tears could be her sister had always been very quick to turn on the waterworks when she wanted something and it had usually done the trick please my love it was almost believable the words catching in her throat the soft sob dont go i wont be able to live without you they were still a few strides from the front door then once they were out they had to get along the pathway and onto the street somehow she doubted katyas power extended far beyond the limits of the house the canyon might have been hers once upon a time but shed lost control of it in the decades since her heyday now it belonged to the ghosts and the animals and the bestial offspring of both still coaxing todd after her tammy made her way across the hallway to the front door behind them katya kept up her tearful appeals declarations of love interspersed with sobs then more appeals for him to turn around and look at her you dont want to go she called to todd you know you dont especially with her lord todd look at her you really want that finally tammy snapped how the hell do you know what he wants bitch she said turning to look round at the woman on their heels because were soulmates katya said her eyes were swollen and red tammy noted with some satisfaction and there were tears pouring down her face her mascara was running down her pale cheeks in two black rivulets he knows its true katya went on weve suffered the same way havent we todd remember how you said it was like i was reading your mind and i said it was because we were the same deep down remember that ignore her tammy said they were no more than three strides from the front door but katyarealizing she was close to losinghad one last trick up her sleeve one final powerplay if you step out of this house she said to todd then its over between us do you understand me if you stayoh if you stay my darlingthen im yours im yours body and souli mean it body and soul but if you go itll be as though you never existed finally something she said carried enough weight to stop todd in his tracks ignore her tammy said please you know i can do that katya went on todd turned and looked back at her which was exactly what tammy was praying he wouldnt do katya was standing in the darkness close to the top of the stairs but the shadows did not conceal the fierce brilliance of her stare her eyes seemed to flicker in the murk as though there were flames behind them now she had succeeded in making him look at her again she softened her tone she certainly had quite a repertoire tammy thought first demands then pleas and sirensongs then tears and threats now what i know what youre thinking she said ah mind reading youre thinking that youve got a life out there and its calling you back tammy was puzzled this sounded like a selfdefeating argument youre thinking you want to be back in the spotlight where you belong while katya talked tammy made a momentous decision she let go of todds hand shed done all that she could if after all this todd decided that he wanted to turn back and give himself to the wretched woman then there was nothing more tammy could do about it he was a lost cause she crossed swiftly to the front door and opened it the first tug was a little difficult then the door swung open easily majestically there were no ghosts on the threshold only the refreshing night air sweetened by the scent of nightblooming jasmine behind her in the house katya was finishing her argument the fact is she said theres nothing out there for you now do you understand me todd theres nothing tammy stepped out onto the front steps she looked back at todd in time to catch a look of pitiful confusion on his face he literally didnt know which way to turn dont look at me tammy said to him its your choice his expression became still more pained that wasnt what he wanted to hear look youre a grown man tammy said if you want to stay with her knowing what shes capable of then you stay i hope youll be very happy together todd katya murmured she stepped out of the shadows now choosing her moment as ever beautifully the demonic katya the woman whod thrashed zeffer then thrown him to goga had vanished completely in her place was a sad gentle womanor the appearance of suchwho opened her arms to todd like a loving mother come back to me she said he made the tiniest nod of his head and tammys heart sank he started to turn his back on the door but as he did so there was a sudden and furious eruption of noise from the depths of the house somebody in the devils country was beating on the door a furious tattoo it came at the perfect moment at the sound from below todd seemed to snap out of his mesmerized state and instead of heading for katyas open arms he began to retreat towards the door you know what he said to katya i cant take this place any longer im sorry ive got to get out katya flew at him her arms outstretched her eyes wide no she cried i want you here it was more than todd could take he backed away from her and stumbled out over the step finally tammy said he grabbed hold of her hand get me the fuck out of here he said this time there was no hesitation in his voice no turning back they ran to the gate and out into the street not stopping for a moment tammy slammed the gate loudly not so much because she felt it would keep the bitch from following but because it made the point to the entire canyon that they were indeed out of the house and away my cars up the road she told todd though of course it was now three days since shed left it and there was no guarantee it would still be sitting there and the keys what about the keys had she left them in the ignition she thought she had but she was by no means certain so much had happened to her in the intervening time she had no clear memory of what shed done with the keys im assuming youre going to come with me she said to todd he looked at her blankly to the car she said for emphasis yes its up the street yes i heard you well shall we go then he nodded but he didnt move his gaze had drifted back to the house leaving him to stare tammy set off up the road to where shed left the car there was neither moon nor stars in the sky just a blanket of ambertinted cloud she soon lost sight of todd as she headed up the benighted road memories of her nightjourney through the place with all its attendant miseries and hallucinations rose up before her but she told herself to put them out of her head she was going to be out of this damn canyon in a few minutes long before it got back into her mind again and started its tricks the car when she reached it was unlocked she opened the door and slipped into the drivers seat fumbling for the ignition yes the keys were there thank you god she said with a late show of piety she turned on the engine and switched on the headlights they lit up the whole street ahead she put the car into gear and brought the car roaring around the corner todd had wandered out into the middle of the road and she could have ploughed into him had he not stepped out of her way but at least the distracted look had gone from his face when he got into the car there was a new and welcome urgency about his manner were out of here he said i thought for a moment that you were planning to stay noi was just thinkingabout what a fool id been well stop thinking for a while tammy said itll slow us down she put her foot down and they sped off down the winding street about halfway down the canyon he said do you think shes going to come after us no tammy said i dont think her pride would let her she had no sooner spoken than something sprang into the glare of the headlights todd let out a yelp of surprise but tammy knew in a heartbeat what it was one of the hybrids shed encountered on the slopes it was ugly even by the standards of its malformed breed a loping pasty thing with the flesh missing from the lower half of its face exposing a sickly rictus tammy made no attempt to avoid striking the beast instead she drove straight into it the moment before it was struck the thing opened its lipless mouth horribly wide as though it thought it might scare the vehicle off then the front of the car struck it and its body rolled up onto the hood momentarily sprawling over the windshield for a few seconds tammy was driving blind with the face of the beast grotesquely plastered against the glass then one of her more suicidal swerves threw the thing off leaving just a smudge of its pale yellow fluids on the glass very quietly todd said what the fuck was that ill tell you some other time tammy said and leaving the explanation there she proceeded down the winding road in uncontested silence bringing them finally to some anonymous but lamplit street and so out of the entrails of coldheart canyon and back into the city of angels part seven the alist one in march of jerry brahms had bought a small two bedroom apartment a block or two within the gates of hollywoodland a neighborhood created in the twenties which encompassed a large parcel of land in the vicinity of the hollywood sign the house had cost him nineteen thousand seven hundred dollars a relatively modest sum for a place so pleasantly situated back then hed still indulged the fantasy that one day hed meet a soulmate with whom he would one day share the house but somehow his romantic entanglements had always ended poorly and despite three attempts to bring someone in the chemistry had failed miserably and each time hed sent the man to be on his way and hed ended up alone he no longer hoped for an end to his solitude even the most optimistic of the cancer doctors whod seen him gave him at best a year the tumor in his prostate was now inoperable and spreading for all his love of the dreamy faroff days of hollywood jerry was a practical man andat least when it came to himselfremarkably unsentimental the prospect of dying did not move him particularly one way or another he was not afraid of it nor did he welcome the eventuality it would simply happen sooner rather than later sometimes when he got melancholy he contemplated suicide and in preparation for such a moment had amassed a considerable number of sleeping pills sufficient he felt sure to do the job but though he had very bad days now when the pain were so nearly overwhelming that he thought hard about tying up all the loose ends of his life and simply knocking back the pills with a strong bloody mary somehow he could never bring himself to do it he had a sense of unfinished business though he could not quite work out what the business might be his parents were long since dead his only sibling a sister also passed away tragically young of his few friends there were few that he cared to say anything of any great profundity to if he slipped away thered be little by way of tears just some fighting over his collection of movie memorabiliawhich hed never had evaluated but was probably worth half a million dollars at auctionand a few tearsodden bitchy remarks at mickeys when he was gone lord knows hed made enough of those kinds of remarks in his life hed been the kind of queen with a feline answer to just about anything in his heyday but there was no joy in that kind of thing anymore his style of queendom was long out of fashion he was a dinosaur with prostate cancer soon to be extinct lately hed found that his condition made him vulnerable to every little sadness that touched his world the passing of todds dog dempsey had left him in tears all day though he barely knew the animal and then the death of marco caputo such a senseless waste of life he hadnt ever been close friends with caputo but on those few occasions when hed met the man caputo had always been polite and professional rare enough in these days of mediocrity the funeral had not done justice to the man in jerrys opinion it had been small todd of course was not on hand though maxine was there as his representative jerry took the opportunity to ask her how much longer she thought the stalker business would be going on for were the police trying to catch this woman and prosecute her or was poor todd just going to have to sit it out maxine said she didnt know she wouldnt be dealing with todds affairs for very much longer she told him it was a waste of time and energy the conversation the tiny disinterested congregation the coffin and the thought of its unviewable contents all sent jerry back home to his apartment in a blacker mood than usual but even so even on a day when it seemed that all decency and all hope had gone from the world he found it impossible to take his stash of pills and finish the business why for gods sake something nagged at him that was all he knew something told him wait just a little longer its not over the operaqueens of his acquaintance used to say til the fat lady sings well somewhere deep in his soul he knew that the fat woman still had an aria up her sleeve so he kept on living which was often a wearisome business all the while waiting for whatever it was that was nagging at him to make itself apparent finally on the night of march st it did the circumstances were peculiar he had a dream so powerful that it woke him this in itself was odd because he usually went to bed with a couple of scotches to wash down his sleeping pills and as a consequence seldom woke but he woke tonight and the dream hed dreamed was crystal clear he had dreamed that he was sitting on the toilet of all places in a state of agonizing constipation as he sat there he realized that there were wooden boards on the floor of his toilet not tiles as there were in life and the cracks between the boards were so wide that he could see right down into the apartment below except that it wasnt another apartment it wasin the strange logic of this dreamanother house nor was it just any house it was katyas dream palace that was spread below him and as he realized this the gaps between the boards grew wider so that he dropped down between them slowly as though he were featherlight and there he was in katyas house in coldheart canyon he pulled up his pants and looked around the dream palace was in a state of considerable disrepair the windows were broken and birds flew in and out shitting on the fancy furniture a coyote skulked around in the kitchen looking for scraps and outside in the tree there were dozens of little redandblackstriped monkeys chattering and screeching this was not so fanciful a detail as it might have seemed to someone whod not known the house as he had in its heyday there had been monkeys thereescapees from katyas private menagerie and for a while it seemed the climate suited them and they would proliferate but after a year or two some virus had decimated them something about the place in its present condition made him want to leave he knew however that he couldnt not without paying his respects to the lady of the house so rather than wait for her to show herself he went to look for her figuring that the sooner he found her the sooner hed be released from this dream he started up the stairs there were flies crawling on the ground beneath his feet so densely assembled and so sluggish that they refused to move as he ascended obliging him to crush them under his bare feet as he climbed the door to the master bedroom was open he stepped inside somewhat tentatively he had only been into the room once before he remembered it as being large but here in his dream it was immense the drapes were partially drawn and the sunlight that streamed between them was a curious color almost lilac there was an enormous but extremely plain bed in the room and sitting on the bed was the only woman besides his mother whom jerry had loved katya she was naked ormore correctly statedunclothed ninety percent of her bodys surface was covered with large snails the common tortoiseshell variety that every gardener curses they were moving all over her skin they were on her face on her breasts and belly on her thighs and shins her hair was matted with their silvery trails and thirty or forty of them were arranged on her head like a grotesque crown her legs were open and they were also investigating the crevice between her thighs as is so often the case in dreams he saw all this with horrid particularity saw the way their boneless greygreen bodies extended from their shells as they moved over katyas skin their horns extending tentatively as they advanced then retracting as they encountered an obstaclea nipple an ear the knuckle of her thumbonly to stretch out again when they were certain there was no danger in the encounter without speaking katya looked down and very delicately plucked one of the creatures off her breast then she spread her legs a little wider so that jerry had an even more intimate view of her private parts he was no connoisseur but even he could see that there was a certain prettiness to the configuration of her labia she had the pussy of a young girl putting her hands down between her legs she spread her lips and delicately applied the snail shed taken from her breast the flesh there jerry watched with a kind of appalled fascination as it responded to its new perch expanding its horns and investigating her katya sighed her eyes fluttered closed then suddenly they opened again when they did they were fixed on him with startling fierceness there you are jerry she said her voice full of the music he remembered from his childhood the kind of bittersweet music by which he had judged the voice of every woman hed met since later hed learned that silent movie stars had been notorious for having voices that precluded them from careers in the sound cinema but katya had been one of the exceptions to that rule she had the slightest foreign inflection otherwise she spoke with a beguiling elegance i need help she said to him jerry will you come to the house please i am alone here utterly alone what happened to todd he said to her he walked out on me i cant believe that well its true he did are you going to choose between him and me no of course not he was just another empty shell jerry there was no substance to him and now im alone and its worse than death his dreamself was about to get clever and ask her how she could possibly know what death felt like but then he thought better of asking her perhaps she did indeed know it wasnt beyond the bounds of possibility hed never understood exactly how her life had worked up there in the house in the canyon but he suspected there were terrible secrets in that place what do you want me to do he asked her come back up to the canyon she said that was the end of the dream at least as he remembered it when he woke the image of her body covered with snails disgusted him of course especially its sexual details had she conjured that in dispatching this dream or had he dug it out of the recesses of his own subconscious whichever it was it had done its duty making certain he understood the pitiful state she was in all through the following day as he went about his choresdown to the market back from the market cooking himself chicken eating the chicken washing the plate from which hed eaten the chicken talking with luis who lived below about how the apartments all needed painting and who was going to talk to the manager because it had to be done soon and so on and so forththrough all of this he kept thinking about the dream and whether it was really trying to tell him something or not out of the blue he said to luis do you believe in dreams luis who was a plump amicable man whod been in christopher street the night of the stonewall riots in full drag or so he claimed like how he said give me an example like you have a dream and it seems like its telling you something oh yeah ive had those and were they like i had a dream in which my mother told me to get out of this relationship i was in with a guy i dont know if you met him ronnie i remember ronnie well he was a sonofabitch he used to beat me up hed get drunk on tequila and beat me up whats this got to do with the dream i told you my mother said throw him out in the dream she said throw him out or hell kill you what did you do i threw him out i mean i was ready to do it anyhow the dream just confirmed what id been feeling did he just go no he got physical and we ended up fighting and luis pulled up his sleeve exposing a six inch scar pale against his mocha skin it got nasty he did that we were fighting and i fell on a glasstopped coffeetable i needed sixteen stitches by the time i got back from the hospital the motherfucker had gone hed taken all my shoes and they werent even his size so you do believe in dreams sure i believe whyd you want to know im trying to figure something out well you want my opinion dreams can be useful doing that sometimes then again sometimes theyre full of shit it depends on the dream you know how i know my momma got really sick with pneumonia and she was in the hospital in new york and i had this dream and she was telling me she was fine there was no need to spend the money and fly out east because she was going to get better next day she was dead jerry went back to his apartment and thought about his dream some more and about what luis had said gradually it crept up on him why he was being so reluctant about the decision he was afraid that if he went up to it would be the end of him hed seen so many movies in which the queen ended up dead in the second act superfluous to the real heart of the story wasnt that him hadnt he lived his life at the edge of katyas grand drama never important enough to be at the heart of things if events in were indeed coming to an endas it seemed they werethen what was the likelihood of his surviving to the final reel little or none and yet if this was the inescapable truth of his life then why fight it why lock himself away in his little apartment watching gameshows and eating frozen dinners for one when the only drama hed ever really been a part of was playing out to its conclusion twenty minutes drive away wasnt that just throwing more time away waste on waste damn it he would go hed obey the summons of the dream and go back to coldheart canyon this course determined he set about preparing himself for an audience with the lady katya he chose something elegant to wear his linen suit his best italian shoes a silk tie hed bought in barcelona to add just a touch of color to the otherwise subdued ensemble with his clothes chosen he showered and shaved and thenhaving worked up a bit of a sweat shavingshowered again it was late afternoon by the time he started to get dressed it would soon be cocktail hour up in coldheart canyon tonight at least katya would not have to drink alone two about the time jerry brahms had been waking up from his dream of katya and the snailswhich is to say just half an hour before dawntammy and todd were slippingquietly quietly she kept sayinginto the little hotel where tammy had been staying the last few days had provided tammy with a notable range of unlikely experiences but surely this was up there amongst the weirdest of themtiptoeing along the corridor of her twostar hotel with one of the most famous celebrities in the world in tow telling him to hush whenever his heel squeaked on a board the rooms chaos she warned him as she let him in im not a very tidy person i dont care what it looks like todd said his voice so drained by exhaustion it had no color left in it whatsoever i just want to piss and sleep he went directly into the bathroom and without bothering to close the door unzipped and urinated like a racehorse just as though the two of them had been married for years and he didnt give a damn about the niceties telling herself she shouldnt be taking a peek tammy did so anyway where was the harm he was bigger than arnie by a couple of sizes he shook himself wetting the seat and went to the sink to wash splashing water on his face in a halfhearted fashion i keep thinking he called through to her can you hear me yes i can hear you fine i keep thinking this is all a dream and im going to wake up he turned the water off and came to the door towel in hand he patted his wounded face dry very gently but then i think if this was a dream when did it begin when i first saw katya or when i first went up to coldheart canyon or when i woke up from the operation and it had all gone wrong he tossed the towel onto the floor of the bathroom something else arnie always did it used to irritate the hell out of tammy forever chasing around after her spouse picking up stuff hed dropped towels in the bathroom socks and skidmarked underwear in the bedroom food left out of the refrigerator where the flies could get at it why were those habits so hard for men to change why couldnt they just pick things up and put them away in their proper place todd was still talking about when his dream had begun hed decided it started when burrows put him under youre not serious she told him absolutely all this he made an expansive gesture that took in the room and tammy is part of the same hallucination me included sure todd youre being ridiculous tammy said youre not dreaming this and neither am i were awake were here here i dont mind todd said looking around the room i can take being here but tammy if this room exists then so does all that shit we saw up at katyas house and im not ready to believe in that he bit his nails as he spoke pacing the floor you saw what was in the room not really i mean i saw the man who killed zeffer and the ghosts you saw the ghosts yes i saw them and worse and you believe all thats real whats the alternative ive told you its all just some hallucination im having i think id know if i was having an hallucination have you ever done lsd really good lsd or magic mushrooms no see you do some of that stuff and its like you never look at the real world the same way again you can never really trust it i mean its all consensual reality anyhow right i dont know what the hell that is its a phrase my dealer uses jerome bunny is his name hes a real philosopher it isnt just drugs with him its a way of looking at the world and he used to say we all just agree on whats real for convenience sake i still dont get it tammy said wearily well he used to explain it better anyway i thought you didnt do drugs you said in people you were horrified to see what drugs had done to friends of yours did i name anyone robert downey jr was one a great actor you said killing himself for the highs you said well i dont fry my brains every night like robert did i know my limits a little pot a few tabs of acid he stopped looking a little irritated anyway i dont have to justify myself to you i didnt say you did quoting me well thats what you said well its bullshit its his life he can do what the hell he likes with it where did all this start anyhow you saying oh yeah were having this dream together because that way doesnt exist cant exist its all something invented i mean how can any of that be real i dont know said tammy flatly but whatever you say about dreams or consenting reality or whatever it was that place is real todd its up there in the hills right now and shes there too and shes planning her next move you sound very sure he was studying his reflection in the mirror of the dresser as he talked to her i am sure shes not going to let go of you shell find a way to get you back look at me he said i think you look fine im a mess burrows fucked it all up his hands went up to his face its gotta be a dream he said returning to his old theme i cant look like this in the real world i do tammy said considering her own unhappy reflection i look like this she pinched herself im real she said yeah he said softly i know who i am i know how i got here where i came from where my husband works your husband yes my husband why are you surprised a woman with my dress size has got a husband well i have his names arnie and he works at sacramento airport and you dont know anything about him do you no so you cant have dreamed him can you no see thats my life my problem whys it a problem because he drinks too much and he doesnt love me and hes having an affair with this woman who works at the fedex office no shit is he the violent type he would be if i let him but you dont i fractured one of his ribs the last time he tried something stupid like that he was drunk but thats no excuse so why do you stay with him you really want to know yeah sound like you mean it i mean it if i tell you youve got to promise me one thing whats that promise first shit i promise scouts honor whyd you stay with him because being alone is the worst especially for a woman i walked out on him two and a half years ago when i found out about one of his women but after a month i had to go back to him being on my own made me crazy i made him tell me he was sorry for humiliating me and that hed never do it again but i knew that wasnt true men cant help being pigs its the way god made them and i suppose women are bitches most of us me included but sometimes you need to be a bitch so you can get through the day and katya i wondered how long it would take you to get round to her tammy said well ill tell you how much of a bitch she was you know the man she threw into the room todd nodded his name was zeffer he was the man who made her into a moviestar thats the kind of woman she was there was another side to her believe me dont tell me she loves dogs wait he said wearily waving away her cynicism im trying to explain something here i dont want to hear about her kinder gentler side why not because shes a bad woman todd they named coldheart canyon after her for gods sake did you know that anyway were neither of us going back up there agreed todd didnt reply he simply stared at the faded photograph of the hollywood sign that hung above the bed didnt somebody throw themselves off that he said finally yeah her name was peg entwistle she was a failed actress did you hear what i said tammy said about what neither of us is going back up to see katya again agreed youre not going to try and sneak back up there the moment my backs turned why would it matter so much if i did he said his belief that all this was a dream seemed to have lost credibility in the last few minutes youre never going to see me again after this anyway it was true of course this was the first and last time shed sit in a motel room and have a conversation with todd pickett but it still stung her to hear it said hurt she stumbled after a response it only matters because i want the best for you then move over he said coming to the bed and let me lie down and sleep because thats what i want right now she got up off the bed you not going to sleep he said there isnt room for both of us sure there is lie down and get some rest well talk about this when weve got some sleep he slipped off his shoes and lay down placing one of the paperthin pillows beside the other so theyd both have somewhere to lay their heads go on he said lie down i wont bite you do know how weird all this is for me dont you which part the girl the house the devils wife no you and me together in one bed dont worry im not going to be making sexual advances i know that im just suggesting we get some sleep yeah well okay but its still weird you know you used to be somebody i idolized with a heavy emphasis on the used to be todd said opening one eye and looking at her dont be so sensitive no i get the message it was the same when i met paul newman in the flesh he closed his eye again i always used to think he was the coolest of all the cool guys he had those iceblue eyes and that easy way of his words were getting slower dreamier walking into a roomand i used to thinkwhen im famous the words trailed away todd he opened his eyes a fraction and looked at her between the lashes what was i saying never mind she said to him sitting on the bed go to sleep no tell me what was i saying how much you wanted to be like paul newman oh yeah i just used to practice my newman act for hours on end the way everything he did was so relaxed sometimes he looked so relaxed you couldnt believe he was acting at all it looked soeasy while he talked tammy took off her own shoes and then lay down beside todd he didnt even seem to realize she was there beside him his monologue continued though it became less coherent as sleep steadily made his tongue more sluggish when i met himfinally met himhe wassosmall his conclusion reached he began to snore gently tammy sat up on her elbows and looked at him lying there wondering how she would have felt if shed been told a few days ago that shed be sharing a bed with todd pickett it would have made her heart jump a beat to even contemplate the possibility and yet here she was lying down beside him and she felt nothing nothing except a vague irritation that she was not going to get a fair share of the bed with him sprawled out over it oh well she had no choice she could either sleep on the bed with mr heartthrob or take the floor she closed her eyes she was exhausted sleep came in a matter of moments there were no dreams three while the two mismatched adventurers slept in the subterranean murk of room in the wilshire plaza hotel a sleep too deep to be called comfortable too close to death in factthe city of los angeles got up and went about its daily business there was profit to be made there were movies being shot all over the city joyless little pornos being made in ratty motels witless spectacles with budgets that could have supported small nations made on the soundstages of culver city and burbank penniless independent films about the lives of hustlers whores and penniless filmmakers shot wherever a room could be found and the actors assembled some would go onto glory even the pornos had their nights of prizegiving now when the lucky lady voted best cocksucker was called to the podium to humbly thank her agent her mother and jesus christ but the fictions whether sex or sciencefiction were not the only dramas that would be played out today this was a city that made its profit by selling dreams not least of itself and so every day young hopefuls arrived by bus and by plane to try their luck and every day a few of those dreamers having been here a few months realized that their place in the food chain of fame was lower than a piece of weekold sushi it was not going to happen for them they werent going to be the next meryl streep the next todd pickett the next jim carrey theyd have to wait another lifetime for their slice of fame or the lifetime after that or the lifetime after that and for some it wasnt news they could bear to take home with them better to buy a gun and go back to your one room apartment and blow out your brains hed had two lines in one of the lethal weapon movies which hed told everyone in stockholm ohio was the beginning of a great career but the lines had been cut and for some reason hed never caught a directors eye ever again not once in six years since hed had those two lines had he been called back for an audition the bullet was kinder than the silent phone his death didnt make the news the suicide of one rod mccloud did but only because hed thrown himself off a bridge onto the and brought the morning traffic in both directions to a halt for an hour mccloud had actually won an oscar hed been the corecipient of the coveted little icon fourteen years earlier there hadnt been time for him to reach the microphone and thank his agent and jesus christ the orchestra had started playing the exit music before the man in front of him had finished giving his thanks then it was too late at noon another suicide was discovered that of a man who unlike mccloudwho had been sixtyonewas still at the beginning of his life two years ago justin thaw had been named by vanity fair the most powerful agent in la under twentyfive and had been groomed by the greatest of the citys agentdeities as the inheritor of his chair made a noose and hanged himself in his brothers garage leaving a suicide letter that was arranged as a series of bulletpoints for maximum clarity he could no longer fight his addiction he said he was too tired of feeling as though he was a failure just because he was hooked on heroin he was sorry for all the heartless things hed said and done to those he loved it had been the drug doing the drug saying but it was he who was sorry and he who was glad to be leaving today because life wasnt worth the effort anymore he was wearing the ten thousand dollar suit hed had made for himself in milan the shoes hed purchased in rome and a pair of adult diapers the news of justins death would spread quickly and a few executives doors would be closed for a while giving the man behind them a moment to remember the occasions theyd got high with justin and wonder whether it wasnt time they asked for help from narcotics anonymous then the phones from their powerful contemporaries started to ring again and the pressure of the day meant that meditation had to be put off for a while they took a snort or two of coke put justin out of their minds and got on with the dealmaking they could think about him again at the funeral speaking of which the ashes of one jennifer scarscella were on a chicagobound plane that afternoon headed for interment in the city of her birth jennifer had died nine months ago but her body had only recently been found and identified in the la morgue she had left home seven years before without telling her parents where she was headed though it wouldnt have been hard for the scarscellas to figure out that their daughter had left to try her luck in tinseltown all shed ever wanted to do was be a movie star she had been murdered by her boyfriend because shed refused he said to take a role in an xrated movie he was now in jail and jennifer was going home having kept her ambitions high and died for doing so and so the day went on the shadows of the city lengthening as the sun began to drop from its highpoint at noon at a little after four there was a crisis at warners when a set under construction caught fire gutting an entire sound stage and badly damaging two adjacent sound stages nobody was killed but there were still grim faces in the boardroom that afternoon insurance would cover the reconstruction of the stages but the set had been built for the warners christmas offering dark justice with an elaborate postproduction schedule for the picture that required the main shoot to be over in a months time things looked bad there had been a great deal of creative debate about the script which had no less than fourteen writers presently attached to it arbitration by the writers guild would thin those numbers but nothing would make the calculation look any better if the picture missed its christmas release date which it now looked likely to do two executives received calls from their superiors in new york pointing out that if they hadnt warred so much about the script the picture would have been shot by now and the agonizingly slow postproduction underway instead they had a smoking shell of a building where the big scenes were to have been shot starting in two days there was a fiscal disaster in the offing and certain people should be ready to hand in their resignations before they were embarrassed into leaving by the imminent and unflattering analysis as to why ninety pages of dialogue about a man who dressed up as a jaguar to fight the villains of some fictional metropolis could not have been agreed on earlier when there was four and a half million dollars worth of writing talent on the job the observation that were not making fucking citizen kane here dropped from several mouths that day more often than not from men who had never seen kane nor would have cared for it even if they had by five with the freeways bumper to bumper as people got out of town for the weekend there were a plethora of accidents but nothing of consequence scripts were delivered for the weekend read writers crossed their fingers and hoped that somebody would read what theyd slaved over without kids fighting at their feet or their dick in somebodys mouth or a smudge of coke on their nose plans were made for weekend adulteries those letters of resignation were penned by smiling assistants and through it all todd and the woman who had once idolized him slept side by side in the stale darkening air of room four tammy woke first rising up out of a dream of the very room in which she was sleeping except that all the furniture had for some unfathomable reason been piled against one end of the room including the frame of the bed in which she was sleeping leaving her on a mattress on the floor when she woke of course nothing had changed it was still an ordinary room with one extraordinary element surreal in its lack of likelihood the sleeping figure of todd pickett there he was sprawled across threequarters of the bed his head deep in the pillow his facehis poor wounded facefree it seemed of troubled dreams what she would have given once upon a time for a moment like this a chance to lean over and kiss him awake but shed lost faith in such fairystories shed seen too much of their dark side and she never wanted to go there again even for the kissing of princes better to let them wake of their own accord dragonbreath and all she glanced at the cheap digital clock on the bedside table it was fivetwentyone in the afternoon surely that couldnt be right that they slept for almost eleven hours and todd still sleeping well the latter she could believe she knew from her years with arnie how some men loved to sleep in arnies case hed loved it more than anything else more than eating more than drinking certainly more than sex she left todd to it went into the tiny bathroom and switched on the light god she looked terrible how had he ever consented to get into the same bed as her she started her cleanup by vigorously scrubbing her teeth then ran the shower very hot the way she liked it even when she felt clean and got in oh it felt good the soap smelled flowery and the cheap shampoo didnt work up a satisfying lather but she was happy nevertheless getting herself clean for the first time in days washing off the freaks the ghosts the dirt the darkness by the time she drew back the plastic curtain the steam was so dense she could barely see across the bathroom to the door but it was being opened that much she could see and there was todd standing looking at her she grabbed the towel off the sink where shed left it and used it as best she could to cover her considerable nakedness good morning he said good afternoon she replied it isnt almost fivethirty she said theres a clock beside the bed why dont you go look and close the door after you i gotta take a leak first im sorry but i gotta let me get out first just dont look he said unzipping himself she drew the shower curtain back and continued to dry herself while for the second time in the last twelve hours she heard the solid splash of him emptying his bladder he took an age by the time he was finished she was almost done drying herself okay im done he said with evident relief does this place have room service yes you want something to eat this was no time to be ladylike she told herself im starving she said what do you want just food nothing fancy i shouldnt think theres much danger of that she waited until shed heard the door click closed then she pulled the shower curtain back and finished off drying her nooks and crannies she could hear his voice as he ordered food on the phone it sounded like the soundtrack of a todd pickett movie playing on the television next door stepping out of the bath she cleared a hole in the steamedup mirror with the ball of her hand and regarded her reflection balefully she was cleaner but that was about the only improvement she opened the door a crack i need some dean clothes todd was sitting on the bed hed finished making his order and had turned on one of the late afternoon chat shows you can come in here and get dressed he said not turning from the screen i wont look she discarded her sodden towel and ventured in sorting through the meager contents of her suitcase for something presentable i ordered club sandwiches todd said that was pretty much all they had and coffee fine as she pulled on her underwear she glanced up at the television a woman in a red polyester blouse three sizes too small for her was complaining vociferously to the host of the show that her daughter who looked about eleven went out every night dressed like a cheap little slut i love this shit todd said peoples lives tammy replied i guess theyre happy they get their fifteen minutes did you like yours i got more than fifteen he said i didnt mean to offend you i was just asking sure i enjoyed it who wouldnt the first few times youre in a restaurant and a waiter recognizes you or somebody sends over a drink you get a buzz out of that in fact you feel like youre the only person who matters his voice trailed away the daughter on the screen who had the seeds of whoredom in her prepubescent features was telling the audience that if she wanted to dress like a slut that was her business and anyway who did she learn it from she stabbed her finger in the direction of her mother who did her best to look virtuous but given what shed chosen to do with her hair makeup and outfit didnt have a chance todd laughed then went back to what he was telling tammy the whole look at me im a star thing gets old pretty quickly and after a while you start to wish people didnt know who you were really actually its more that you want to be able to turn it on or off oh shit look at this the sluttish daughter was now up off her chair and attempting to attack her mother luckily there was a security man ready to step in and stop her unluckily he wasnt quite fast enough to do so the girl threw herself upon her mother with such violence the womans chair topped over and the security man who had by now taken hold of the girl to keep her from doing harm fell forward too so that chair mother daughter and security man ended up on the studio floor together todd continued to talk through it there are days when you really want to feel good about yourself you want to be recognized you want people to say i loved your movie so much i saw it six times and then there are other days when its a curse to have people know who the hell you are because theres no privacy no way to just go out and be yourself everything becomes a performance he pointed at the brawlers on television look at these stupid bitches what are they going to say when their friends see this he pondered his own question for a moment then he said actually i know exactly what theyre going to say theyre going to say did you see me on the tv thats all that matters not did you see me being smart or looking beautiful just did you see me he watched the womens antics for a while longer shaking his head then he glanced over at tammy and said ive been thinking maybe im done with the movies or movies are done with me its time to buy a ranch in montana and raise horses really tammy had finally got dressed and came to sit down on the unmade bed beside todd youre going to retire he laughed whats so funny oh just hearing the word retire at thirtyfour i thought you were thirtytwo your bio i lied oh but im still young right i mean thirtyfour is still young a mere kitten i just cant face the idea of that circus for one more day he turned off the television the room was suddenly very silent after a few moments tammy said are we going to talk about it or not todd stared at the blank television she couldnt see his expression but she was certain it was just as vacant as the screen the canyon todd she said again are we going to talk about what happened in the canyon or not yes he replied finally i suppose so last night you said it wasnt real i was tired so its real i knew last night i was talking bullshit he kept his back to her through this as though he didnt want to let her see his incomprehension as though it were something to be ashamed of you saw more than i did she said to todd so youve probably got a clearer idea of whats going on and you talked to katya yes and what did she tell you she told me the room downstairs had been given to her by zeffer yes i know that part then what are you asking me for he said you probably know as much as i do what about maxine what about her she must have checked out the house for you yeah she took photographs maybe she has some answers maxine he got up off the bed and went to the table to pick up his cigarettes he took one out of the packet and lit it inhaling deeply as soon as shed moved me into that fucking house she told me she didnt want to manage me any longer he said there was a knock at the door room service tammy opened the door and an elderly man who frankly looked as though this might be the last club sandwiches and coffee he delivered tottered in and set the laden tray on the table i asked for extra mayonnaise todd said here sir the old man proffered a small milk jug into which several spoonfuls of mayonnaise had been deposited thank you its all fine tammy said todd went into his jeans pocket and pulled out a bundle of notes he selected a twentymuch to the antiquated waiters delightand gave it to the man thank you very much sir he said exiting rather faster than hed entered in case the man in the filthy jeans changed his mind they set to eating you know what todd said what i think i should go and see maxine ask her what she knows face to face maybe this was all some kind of set up if you get her on the phone shell lie youve had that experience several times where does she live well shes got three houses a house in aspen a place in the hamptons and a house in malibu oh how she must suffer tammy said teasing a piece of crispy bacon out of her sandwich and nibbling on it only three houses how does she manage so eat up well just drop in on her both of us both of us that way she cant tell me im crazy what i saw you saw actually i saw some shit you didnt see well well be sure to get some answers from her are you certain you want me to come theres safety in numbers todd said drink your coffee and lets get going five katya hadnt wasted any time weeping over todds departure what was the use shed shed more than her share of tears over men and their betrayals across the years what good had any of her weeping ever done her besides it wasnt as if shed truly lost the man hed simply drifted away from her for a few hours that was all shed get him back humbled and begging to be returned into her company after all hadnt she let him kiss her hadnt she let him fuck her there in the devils country he could never forget those memories oh he could try he could put a hundred women a thousand between the two of them but it wouldnt work sooner or later hed come crawling back to her for more of what only she could give him and nothing that fat bitch of a woman whod coaxed him away could say would keep him from coming back a man like todd had nothing in common with a creature like that he understood the world in ways she could not even guess at what hope did she have of seeing with his eyes even for a moment none she was a workhorse todd had lived with beauty too long to put up with the presence of something so charmless for very long after a few hours of her clumsy company hed be off she had only one fear that owing to the artful way her canyon had been hidden he wouldnt be able to find his way back to her the city had never been a simple place even during the years shed lived in it it was easy to get lost or distracted how much more complicated would it be now especially for someone like her poor todd whose soul was so muddled and confused she knew how that felt to have everyone falling over themselves to adore you one moment and the next to find that those same people had given their devotions over to somebody else it turned everything upside down when that happened nothing made sense anymore you started looking around for something to hold on to something firm and solid that wouldnt be taken away in such a mood of desperation it was possible you could make a mistake choose the wrong person to believe in the wrong path to follow even now he could be moving away from her the more she contemplated that prospect the more it became apparent that she was going to have to go and find him the idea of venturing out of her canyon filled her with a mingling of fear and anticipation the world the great wide world it was three quarters of a century since shed stepped beyond the bounds of the canyon and though shed had plenty of clues as to the way things had changed from those whod come here after their decease it would still be an intimidating experience for her to venture out there even on a mission of love but what other choice did she have without him her hopes were in ruins she had to go and find him it was as simple as that and on the way back once they were together again maybe shed have the strength of heart to visit some of the places shed known and loved in her youth just to see how time had altered them but then again perhaps that wouldnt be such a good idea it troubled her enough to look out of the window and see the stretches of land that had been dust roads and shacks and orange groves in her time now completely transformed into towers of steel and glass what if she were to discover that some precious place shed loved had been desecrated rendered unrecognizable though she liked to think she was fearless in truth time was taking its toll on the resilience of her soul but then of course this whole quest was a test of her strength wasnt it venturing beyond the perimeters of her canyon beyond the reach of the magic that had preserved her perfection was gambling with her life she had no way of knowing for certain but she guessed that the further she ventured and the longer she remained away from the canyon from the house and all it contained the more vulnerable shed be to the longpostponed indignities of old age after all a beneath this veneer of youth she was a methuselah how long could she afford to be out in the raptureless world before the shell cracked and the crone inside the hag that the devils country had obscured with its magic was unveiled it was terrifying but in the end it came down to this finding todd was worth the risk if she survived the journey they would come back to the canyon and initiate a new golden age it wouldnt be like the previous age of gold with its foolish excesses this would be a more profoundly felt time when instead of using the devils country like a cross between a twobit ghosttrain ride and a fountain of youth it would be respected as the mystery it was despite the perverse pride shed taken in showing todd the orgiasts in the canyon and in letting him share their excesses katyas appetite for the witless hedonism of the twenties had long since passed away and though todd had happily played the sensualist she was sure that he too had seen enough of the tawdriness of such spectacles it was time they behaved as owners of something genuinely marvelous and treated it respectfully together they would begin an exploration of the world lilith had made katya had never possessed the courage to explore as it deserved to be explored road by road grove by sacred grove certainly shed seen plenty there over the years that had inflamed her sexual self and she would not scorn such spectacles if they came on them again but these were other sights designed to arouse the spirit not the loins and it was to those places she wanted to take todd there were enough diversions and wonders to keep them enchanted for decades to come though the heavens were fixed in the same configuration whenever she visited the country there was nevertheless evidence that the earth was still obeying some of its ancient rhythms there was for instance in the swamp a manmade lake perhaps half a mile wide which seemed to have been for many generations the place where a certain species of eel the infants silverblue with great golden eyes came in their millionseach no longer than her little fingerbut sufficient in number that they filled the place of their birth to brimming when they spawned for a daywhen the larval eels appearedthis genesis bowl as katya had named it was a feasting place for birds of every kind who were literally able to walk on the squirming backs of their feast taking all they could before lifting off and retiring to the nearest branch to digest their mighty meal the next day the genesis bowl was empty but for a few thousand runts that had perished in the exodus and were being picked up by carrion cows and wild dogs she wanted to show this glorious spectacle to todd wanted to wade into the living mass of baby eels and feel them against her naked flesh on another day they might to a place she knew where there was a beast that spoke prophetic riddles which had twice engaged her in conversation which she knew would make sense if she had the education to decode its strange poetry it had the body of a huge bird this tiddler with a mans head and it sat close to the ground with a vast array of glittering gifts around the base of its tree offered for its prophecies shed come to it a year ago with some jewelry she had worn in nefertiti is it real the gift you give me the creature whose name was yiacaxis had asked her no she had admitted i am an actress these baubles are what i wore when i was an actress then make them real for me yiacaxis had said clicking his old grey tongue against his cracked beak play me the scene in which you wore them it was silent she said thats good he replied for i am very deaf in my old age she shed most of her clothes and put on the jewelry then she played the scene from nefertiti in which she discovers that her lover is dead by the order of the envious queen and she kills herself out of tragic longing for him the old birdman wept freely at her performance im pleased it moved you so much katya had said when she was done i accept your offering the creature had replied and i will give you your answer but you dont even know my question yet yiacaxis clicked and cocked his head i know you wonder if there will ever be a love worth dying for in your life is that your question yes she said she would perhaps not have asked it that way but the prophet was notoriously shorttempered with those who attempted to press him there are two multitudes he said one within you one without should he love you enough to name one of these legions then you will live in bliss with the other of course she desperately wanted to ask him what this meant but the audience was apparently already over for yiacaxis was raising his black wings which were lined with little knots of human hair tied up in ribbons that had longago lost their colour thousands of locks of hair in wings that spread perhaps twenty feet from tip to tip without further word he closed them over his melancholy face and the shadows of the tree seemed to close around him a second time so that he was invisible perhaps if she had the courage she would go back to yiacaxis with todd and ask him another question or this time todd should do the asking and when they had questioned the prophet bird and seen half a hundred other wonders in the devils country katya would take todd to a certain ship with which she was familiar which had surely been made for a king it was so finely wrought it had foundered on some rocks along the shore and there it had been left high and dry many years ago for some reason no looter had ever attempted to despoil this sublime vessel perhaps because they feared some royal revenge the only damage done to the vessel was the breaking of its hull by the rocks and the inevitable deterioration of its exterior paintwork by wind and rain inside it remained a place of incomparable luxury its beautiful carved bed heaped with white furs the wine still sweet in its flagons the tinder in its fireplace still awaiting a flame she had often fantasized about taking a lover to the ship making love to him on the furs if they were lucky the wind would get up when they were cradled in the comfort of one anothers arms the wind would whistle in the ropes and the scarlet sails would billow and they would imagine as they made love that they were on a voyage to the edge of the world it would be naive to speak lovingly of the devils country without allowing that it had its share of horrors there were species in the forests and the ravines and the black silent pools between the rocks that had been invented by some benighted mind there were terrible arenas where monsters were goaded to perform acts of horrible violation upon women and sometimes upon men and even children but having viewed several of these spectacles herself she could not deny that they were perversely arousing some had the rigor of ceremonies others seemed to be simple arenas of cruelty where anything might be viewed if it was paid for the point was that shed seen so little and that there was so much for her to see a private wonderland where she and todd could go adventuring whenever they tired of the canyon they could explore it to its very limits and when they were weary and needed to sleep they could simply step through the door and lock it and retire to bed like any loving pair and sleep peacefully in one anothers arms but first she had to find him and to find him she needed a chauffeur only one man fitted that bill jerry brahms they had known one another for so many years that was why shed sent out the dreamsummons to him he was loyal he would come without fail it was only a matter of time before he turned up at the house ready to do her bidding he was probably on his way up even now it didnt take her long to dress she had wardrobes full of gowns designed by some of the greatest names in hollywood history but they were all too showy for this modest adventure so she chose conservatively an immaculatelytailored black dress she kept her hair simple and her makeup discreet she was all dressed and ready to go but there was still no sign of jerry thinking that perhaps hed mistakenly assume she would wait for him in the big house she decided to wander down through the twilight to look for him if he hadnt arrived then shed wait for him at the front gate so that thered be no chance of their missing one another it was a walk shed taken countless times of course though the pathway rose and dipped she could have done it in safety blindfolded the night wasnt as clear as it had been when she and todd had come out walking there were rainclouds banked in from the north and the air was sultry it was going to be one of those nights when you longed for a heavenandearthshaking thunderstorm the kind she remembered from her childhood but such events were rare in los angeles all the great storms shed seen here had been cooked up by lighting men and rainmachines pure artifice she knew she was being watched as she walked there wasnt a movement she made in the open air that the ghosts or their halfbreed children did not observe they had even made spyholes in the walls of her little house she knew they watched her at her toilette they watched her as she read and daydreamed they watched her as she slept shed several times attempted to stop them and punish their voyeurism but every time zeffer plugged up the holes more appeared and finally shed given up the game as fruitless if they wanted to watch her while she slept then let them go ahead indeed until todd had come into her life the idea of having somebody to watch over hereven if their motives were as hard to calculate as those of her voyeurswas close to comforting needless to say there was also a measure of danger in the proximity of these revenants katya didnt doubt that there was amongst their number some who would gladly have seen her dead blaming her for the fact that their afterlife in was a pitiful thing of course she didnt blame herself if her guests hadnt been so hungry to taste the pleasures of the devils country then they wouldnt be so obsessively drawn to it but as long as they kept a respectful distance then she would not persecute them they had their journey she had hers she had reached the unkempt lawn and paused there to take in the spectacle of the house the windchimes rang on four or five balconies lending their beauty to the grand facade as she listened to their music she heard sounds from the thicket on the other side of the lawn she glanced back there was still sufficient light in the evening sky to see the motion in the blossomladen branches there were several creatures following her she guessed she watched the bushes for half a minute until the motion died down it wasnt unusual for creatures to follow her when she went out walking but there was something different about this or was it that she was different that tonight she was alive as shed not been alive in many years her heart quickened by love and that they sensed a new vulnerability in her she didnt like that the last thing she wanted was for them to imagine they could intimidate her or somehow wrest a little power from her love might have made her step a little lighter but she was still the queen of coldheart canyon and if they pushed her she would respond with her old severity as she watched the thicket the last of the light went from the sky and the darkness revealed several bright points of light in the bushes where the revenants were standing watching her even after all these years she could still be discomfited by a sight like this by the fact that the dead were around her in such numbers enough she thought to herself and turning on her heel hurried towards the stairs that led back up to the house as she did so she heard the swish of grass against swiftly running limbs they were coming across the lawn in pursuit of her she picked up her pace until she reached the relative safety of the stairs behind her a soft voice sounding as though it came from a palate full of pulp and disease said let us in there was a moments silence then another said we just want to come back into the house we wont do any harm said a third please let us in shed been wrong about the numbers of revenants assembled here she slowly realized she thought thered been perhaps ten but there were two or three times that number out there in the darkness whatever the decayed and corrupted condition of their palates they all attempted to say the same thing let us in let us in let us in she would have ignored them once upon a time turned her back on their pleas and climbed the stairs but she was changing katya the heartbreakerthe woman whod never given a damn for what anybody wanted but herselfwas rapidly becoming a thing of the past if she was going to come back with todd and live here they couldnt live the idyllic life she had in mind while these hungry souls waited outside even with the five iron icons hammered into the threshold of each of the doors and in the sills of even the smallest windows their presence preventing the dead from ever setting foot in the house the occupants were in a state of siege it was no place to have a honeymoon she raised her hand to silence their murmuring listen to me she said the chorus began to subside im going to be leaving the house for a few hours katya said her voice a little tentative at the beginning but gaining strength as she proceeded but when i come back i intend to make some changes i dont want you living in misery that has to stop she started to turn away intending to leave the statement there but some of her congregation didnt want to let her go without hearing something more specific in her reply what changes are you going to make someone demanded is that you roman katya said scanning the crowd the speaker didnt have time to identify himself there were more questions somebody wanted to know why she was leaving somebody else demanded to know how long they would have to wait listen to me listen to me she said quieting the rising hubbub i understand that you all want to come into the house but i dont think you understand the consequences well take them whatever they are somebody said there was a general murmur of agreement to this if thats what you want katya replied i will consider it when i get back what if you dont come back trust me i will trust you oh please the mocking voice emerged from a bitter painted face amongst the crowd you tricked us all why the hell should we trust you now theda katya said i dont have the time to explain right now well you hold on honey because we want some answers weve had years of waiting to go back into that room then you can afford to wait a few hours more katya replied and without waiting for theda bara to come back with a retort she turned and headed on up the steps to the top of the flight there was a momentjust a quarter of a beat there at the top of the stairswhen she thought shed misjudged her audience and theyd come up the stairs after her their patience finally exhausted but theyd stayed below even theda perhaps somebody had caught hold of her arm to keep her from doing something stupid katya opened the back door stepping over the threshold occasionally in the last several decades one of the assembly outside had taken it into their heads to test the power of the icons zeffer had brought back from romania and had personally hammered deep into the wood the five icons were called zeffer had told her the iron word it was powerful magic designed to drive off anything that did not belong beside cot or hearth katya had never actually witnessed what happened when one of the phantoms had tested the threshold shed only heard the screams and seen the looks of terror on the faces of those whod goaded the victim of the trespasser himself nothing remained except a rise in the humidity of the air around the threshold as though the revenant had been exploded into vapor even these traces lingered for only a moment as soon as the air cooled the witnesses retreated from the door looks of terror still fixed on their faces she had no idea how the iron word worked she only knew that zeffer had paid a member of sandrus scattered brotherhood a small fortune to possess the secret and then another sum to have the icons created in sufficient numbers that every door and window be guarded it had been worth the investment the iron word did its job katya felt like her mother whod always boasted that she kept a clean house of course mother lupescus definition of moral cleanliness had been purely her own you could fuck her twelveyearold daughter for a small coin but you could not say christ when you were shooting your load between her tiny titties without being thrown out of the house and in her turn that twelveyearold had grown up with her own particular rules of domestic cleanliness in short the dead did not cross the threshold you had to draw the line somewhere or all hell would break loose on that mama lupescu and her daughter would have agreed she got herself a cup of milk from the refrigerator to calm her stomach which always troubled her when as now she was unsettled for some reason or another then she went through the house taking her time passing from one room to another and as she came to the front door she heard the sound of a car coming up the street she stepped outside and walked along the front path until she reached the pool of light from the cars headlights is that you jerry a car door opened yes its me he said was i expected you were well thank god for that she went to the little gate and stepped out onto the narrow sidewalk jerry had got out of the car he had a barelysuppressed look of shock on his face seeing her step beyond the bounds of her little dominion for the first time are we actually going somewhere he asked her i certainly hope so she said playing it off lightly she could not completely conceal her unease however it was there in her eyes but there was also something else in her glance besides the unease something far more remarkable a kind of sweetness even innocence she looked like a girl out on her first prom night tiptoeing to the edge of womanhood amazing jerry thought knowing all that he knew about katyaall that shed done and caused to have doneto be able to find that look in her memory banks and put it up there on her face so that it looked as real as it did that was a performance where will i be taking you tonight maam jerry asked her im not exactly sure you see were going to be looking for somebody are we indeed and may i take a guess at who katya smiled too easy she said well find him for you dont you worry you were the one who got him to come up here in the first place jerry so youre the matchmaker and thank you from both of us thank you its been quite a remarkable time for me jerry i never thought id ever fall in love again and with an actor she laughed youd think id have learned by now i hope its a happy mistake oh it is jerry its perfect hes perfect is he for me yes perfect for me so will you be joining him somewhere yes but youre not exactly sure where thats right well im going to hazard a guess and say hes at maxines because i know shes having a big bash tonight do you want me to call her and ask her if hes there maybe tell her im bringing a special guest no i think its best we just do this quietly dont you however you prefer tonights your night i dont want any big hoopla katya said i just want to find him for a moment the illusion disappeared completely and reality showed itself the desperate hunger of a woman who needed to find the love of her life not tomorrow or the day after but tonight she had no time to waste this woman no time for error or procrastination shall we go she said ready when you are she went to the car and started to fumble with the doorhandle please jerry said allow me he came round to the passenger side and opened the door thank you jerry how nice oldfashioned manners she said she got in into the car in one elegant movement jerry closed the door and went to the drivers side she was trembling he saw just the slightest tremor its going to be all right he reassured her when he was settled in beside her is it she said with a smile too tentative to survive more than a breath yes its going to be fine hes the one jerry todd is the one if he were to turn me down hes not going to do that now is he jerry said hed be a fool to say no to you and whatever else todd is hes no fool so find him for me will you yes maam then i can start to live again six it had taken todd a few minutes to get used to sitting behind the wheel of the old lincoln sedan which marco had chosen many years before as the vehicle in which he preferred to anonymously chauffeur todd around sitting in the seat adjusted for marcos huge frame made him realizefor the first time in the chaotic sequence of dramas that had unraveled since marcos sudden deathhow much he would miss the man marco had been a stabilizing influence in a world that was showing signs of becoming more unstable by the hour but more than that hed been todds friend hed had a good nose for bullshit and hed never been afraid of speaking his mind especially when it came to protecting his boss there would come a time todd had promised himself when he would sit down and think of something to do that would honour caputos name hed been no intellectual so the founding of a library or the funding of the caputo prize for scholastic achievement wouldnt really be pertinent it would need some serious thought to create a project that reflected and honored the complexity of the man youre thinking about marco caputo tammy said as she watched todd adjust to the spatial arrangements of the drivers seat the way you said that it didnt sound as though you liked him very much he was rude to me on a couple of occasions tammy said making light of it now it was no big deal the fact is he was more of a brother to me than my own brother he replied and im only now realizing how much i took him for granted christ first i lose my dog then my best buddy dempsey yeah he died of cancer in february im sorry todd turned on the ignition his thoughts were still with marco you know what i think he said what i think that the night he got killed he wasnt just drunk he was panicked and drunk you mean hed seen something yes thats exactly what i mean hed seen something up at the house and was running away he drew a loud breath through his nose okay enough of the detective work we can do some more of that when all this is over right now were heading for malibu on the way down to the ocean todd provided tammy with a little portrait of where they were going she knew about the colony of coursethe guarded community of superstars who lived in houses filled with picassos and miros and monets with the everunpredictable pacific a few yards from their back door andjust a jump across the pacific coast highwaythe malibu hills which had been the scene of countless wildfires in the hot season and mudslides in the wet what she didnt know was just how exclusive it was even for those who were powerful enough to write their own rules in any other circumstances i was planning to buy this house next door to maxines place way back todd told her but my lawyerwho was this wily old fart called lester mayfield said youre going to want to rip out that concrete deck and take off the old shingle roof arent you and i said you betcha and he said well dream on buster cause they wont let you youll spend the next ten years fighting with the colony committee to change the color of your toilet seat so i didnt buy the place theyve lightened up on the rules a lot since then i guess somebody must have pointed out that they were preserving some pieces of utter shit who ended up buying the house next door to maxine ohhe was a producer had a deal with paramount made some very successful movies for them then the irs taps him on the shoulder and asks why he hasnt paid his taxes for six years he ended up going to jail and the house stood empty nobody else bought it no he wanted to be back making movies when he got out of the slammer which is what he did went straight back into the business made six more huge movies and he still snorts coke from between the tits of loose women bob graydons his name isnt he the one who had an artificial septum put in his nose because hed had the real thing eaten away by cocaine thats bob whered you hear that oh the national enquirer probably i buy them all in case theres something about you not that i believe everything i read she added hurriedly just the juicy bits well after a time you get a feeling about whats true and whats not true care to give me an example no go on thats not fair im screwed whatever i say no wait heres one about two years ago they said you were going into a private hospital in montreal to have your dingaling enlarged my dingaling you know what i mean do you say dingaling to arnie it is arnie isnt it yes its arnie and no i dont say dingaling tell me about him there isnt much to tell whyd you marry him tell me that well it wasnt because of the size of his dick dick thats what you call it dick i guess i do tammy said amused a little embarrassed to have let this slip anyway back to the story in the enquirer they said you were in montreal getting your thingieyour dickmade bigger except i knew that wasnt true how come it just didnt make any sense not after the articles id read about you go on todd said fascinated wellyou know i read everything thats ever been written about you everything in english and then if theres a really important interview in say paris match or stern i get it translated jesus really what for so i can keep up with your opinions andsometimes in the foreign magazines they write the kind of things you wouldnt read in an american magazine one of them did a piece about your lovelife about all the ladies youd dated and the things theyd said about you my acting no yourother performances youre kidding no i thought you knew about these things i thought you probably signed off on them if i read every article in every magazine youd never make another movie exactly so go back to the article the ladies talking about me what does that have to do with the story in the enquirer oh just that here were all these women talking about you in bedand a few of them were not exactly happy with the way you treated thembut none of them said even vaguely intimated that i had a small dick right so i thought theres no way hes gone to montreal to have his dingaling enlarged because its just fine as it is now can we move on or shall i throw myself out of the window from sheer embarrassment todd laughed you are an education do you know that i am you are in a good way oh yeah its all good its all fine you realize of course that theres stuff being written about you right now a lot of people upset and worried why because nobody knows what happened to you there are plenty of people fans of yours like me who think of you practically as a member of the family todd did this todd did that and now suddenly todds missing and nobody knows where hes gone they start to fret they start to make up all kinds of ridiculous reasons i know i did its not that theyre crazy no look i dont think you or any of them are crazy or if you are its a good crazy i mean what you did last nightnone of my family would have done youd be surprised how many people love you they love something but i dont think its me tammy why not well for one thing if you could get inside here in my head with todd pickett you wouldnt find much worth idolizing you really wouldnt i am painfully excruciatingly ordinary my brother donnie on the other hand hes worth admiring hes smart hes honest i was just the one with this he turned on his smile as he drove and gave her the benefit of its luminosity then just as easily he turned it off see you learn to do that he went on its like a faucet you turn the smile on and people bathe in it for a while then you turn it off and you go home and wonder what all the fuckin fuss was about its not like i deserve the adulation of millions i cant act and ive got the reviews to prove it he chuckled at his selfdeprecation thats not mine he said it was victor mature okay so youre not the best actor in hollywood youre not the worst either no i grant you theres worse a lot worse all right a lot worse still doesnt make me a good actor he obviously wasnt going to be moved on the subject so tammy left it where it was they drove on in silence for a while then he swung the mirror round and checked out his face you know im nervous why in case theres anybody at maxines place he went back and forth between studying his face and checking the road you look fine tammy told him i guess its not so bad he said assessing his features you just look a little different from the way you used to look different enough that people will notice tammy couldnt lie to him sure theyll notice but maybe theyll say you look better i mean when everythings properly healed and youve had a months vacation you will come in with me wont you to see maxine my pleasure mind if i smoke he didnt wait for a reply he just rolled down the window pulled out a battered pack of cigarettes and lit up the rush of nicotine made him whoop thats better okay were going to do this you and me were going to ask maxine a lot of very difficult questions and figure out whether shes lying to us or not they had reached the pacific coast highway and the roar of the traffic through the open window made any further talk impractical for a time they drove north for perhaps five miles before coming off the pch and heading west the area wouldnt have been tammys idea of idyllic somehow shed imagined malibu being more like a little slice of hawaii but in fact it was just a sliver of real estate two or three houses deep with the incessant din of the pacific coast highway on one side and a narrow strip of beach on the other theyd scarcely driven more than a quarter of a mile when they came to the colony gates there was a guardhouse and a single guard who was sitting with his booted feet up beside a small television the set went off as soon as they drove up a broad smile appearing on the mans face hey mr pickett long time no see ron mman how goes it it goes good it goes good the guard was clearly delighted that his name had been remembered are you going to ms frizelles party ohyeah todd said throwing a panicked glance at tammy were here for that thats great he peered past todd at the passenger and this is oh this is tammy tammy ron ron tammy tammys my date for the night good goin ron said to no one and about nothing in particular just a general california yeasaying to the world let me just call ms frizelle and tell her youre on your way down nah todd said sliding a twenty dollar bill into rons hand were going to surprise her no problem ron said waving them by good to see you by the way it took tammy a moment to realize that ron was talking to her its always good to meet a new friend of mr picketts there didnt seem to be any irony in this it was a genuine expression of feeling well thank you tammy said thrown a little offkilter by this fuck shes having a party todd said to her as they left the guardhouse behind them so so therell be lots of people looking at me theyve got to do it sooner or later todd stopped the car in the middle of the street i cant im not ready for this yes you are the more you put it off the more difficult its going to be todd sat there shaking his head saying no no i cant do it tammy put her hand over his im just as nervous as you are she said feel how clammy my hand is yeah but we said wed get answers and the longer we take to ask her the more lies shell have ready you do know her dont you he said shes my nightmare really why because she stood between me and you huh silence so what are we going to do tammy said finally shit i dont want to do this so that makes two of us but i know i know if we dont do it nowall right you win but i will beat the living shit out of the first person who says one word about my face they drove on the houses they were driving past far more modest in scale and design than shed expected there was very little here of the kitsch of beverly hills no fauxfrench chateaux sitting side by side with fauxtudor mansions the houses were mostly extremely plain boxlike in most cases with very occasional architectural flourishes they were also very close to one another you wouldnt get much privacy there tammy commented i guess everybody just pretends not to look at everybody else or they just dont care thats more like it they just dont care thats the connection between you and katya isnt it youve both been looked at so muchand the rest of us dont know what that feels like it feels like somebodys siphoning out your blood pint by pint not good no not good they rounded a corner bringing their destination into view the partyhouse was decorated with thousands of tiny white twinkle lights as were the two palm trees that stood like sentinels to left and right of the door christmas came early this year tammy remarked apparently there were uniformed valets working the street taking cars from the guests and spiriting them away to be parked somewhere out of sight are you sure youre ready for this todd asked tammy no more than you are want to go one more circle around the block yes uhoh too late two valets were coming at the car bearing what must have been burdensome smiles as the doors were opened todd caught tight hold of tammys hand dont leave my side he said promise me you wont i promise she said and raising her head she put on her best impersonation of someone who was rich famous and belonged at todd picketts side todd relinquished the keys to the valet may i assume this is your first alist hollywood party in the flesh todd said to tammy you may well then this could be a lot of fun in a grotesque theres a shark in the swimming pool sort of way seven there came a point as jerrys car was carrying katya out of for the first time in the better part of three quarters of a century when her fears seemed to get the better of her jerry heard a voice as dry as a husk out of the darkness behind him im sorryi dont know that i can do this do you want me to turn around he asked her i will if you want me to there was no reply just the soft sound of frightened weeping i wish zeffer was still here why was i so cruel to him none of this seemed to be for open discussion it was more like a private confessional why am i such a bitch jesus jesus everything ive ever loved she stopped herself and looked up at jerry catching his reflection in the mirror dont mind me its just a crazy old woman talking to herself maybe we should go back and find mr zeffer he could come with you i realize there was some bad blood between you zeffers dead jerry i lost my temper with him and you killed him no i left him in the devils country wounded by one of the hunters lord jerry brought the car to a halt he stared out of the window horrified what would you like me to do he said after a while if you cant go on without him i mean take no notice of me katya said after a short period of reflection im just feeling sorry for myself of course i can go on what other choice do i have she took another moment to study the passing world its just that its been a long time since i was out in the real world this isnt the real world its la she saw the joke in that they laughed together over the remark and when their laughter had settled into smiles he got the car going again down the hill at some unidentified point between the place where her faith had almost failed her and sunset boulevard they crossed the boundary of coldheart canyon their destination was already decided of course so there wasnt much reason to talk as they went jerry left katya to her musings he knew his hollywood history well enough to be sure that she would be astonished by what she was seeing in her time sunset boulevard had been little more than a dirt track once it got east of what was now doheny thered been no century city back then of course no four lane highways clogged with sleek vehicles just shacks and orange groves and dirt ive been thinking katya said somewhere around sepulveda about what me and my wickedness your what your wickedness yes my wickedness i dont know why it came into my mind but it did if i think about the women ive played in all my really important pictures they were all wicked women poisonous adulterers one who kills her own child really unforgivable women but dont most actors prefer to play bad characters isnt it more fun oh it is and i had a lot to inspire me inspire you as a child i saw wickedness with my own eyes i had its hands on me worse it possessed me her voice grew cold and dark my mother ran a whorehouse did i ever tell you that and when i was ten or so she just decided one night it was time to make me available to the customers jesus thats what i said to myself every night i said jesus please help me jesus please come and take me away from this wicked woman take me to heaven but he never came i had to run away three times i ran away and my brothers found me and dragged me back once she let them have me as a reward for finding me your own brothers five of them christ anyway i succeeded in escaping her eventually and when youre a thirteenyearold and youre out in the world on your own you see a lot thirteenyearolds shouldnt have to see im sure you did so i put all that i saw into those women thats why people believed in them i was playing them for real she fumbled at the inside of the door is there some way to open this window oh yes its right there a little black button push it down she pushed and opened the window a crack thats better she said you can have it all the way down no this is fine ill take it in stages i think yes of course going back to the pictures i wonder if youd do me a favor when we get back to the house of course what in my bedroom in the guesthouse there are six or seven posters from those early films of mine ive had them up there for so long all around the bed i think its time i got rid of them will you burn them for me are you sure you want them burned theyre worth a fortune then take them for yourself put them up for auction and the bed you want the bed too there isnt room for it in my apartment but if you want me to get rid of it for you yes please no problem if you make some money from it then spend it enjoy it thank you no its me who should be thanking you youve been a great comfort tome may i ask you why why what why are you getting rid of all that stuff now because everythings changed for me that woman i used to be has gone so are all the things she stood for they were just films they were more than that they were my memories and nows the time to let go of them i want to start over with todd jerry drew a deep breath to reply to this but then thought better of it and kept his silence katya was acutely aware of every nuance in her immediate locality however even this say whats on your mind she said its none of my business say it anyway go on well i just hope youre not relying too much on todd pickett you know hes not all that reliable none of them are these younger guys theyre all talk hes different i hope so we cant ever know why things happen between two people but when it feels right you have to go with your instincts if hes so right for you why did he run out on you that was my fault not his i showed him some things which were more than he was ready to see i wont make that mistake again and then he had some woman with him tammy somebodyorother who was just trying to steal him away do you know her tammy no i dont know a tammy oh wait i do i had a call from the police in sacramento she went missing and they called you why because i know todd apparently this tammy woman runs his fanclub katya started to laugh thats all she is to him she said apparently she runs his fanclub thats my understanding so theres no romance between them no i dont even think they really know one another well that solves that it does and it doesnt jerry said cautiously she still persuaded him to go with her then its up to me to persuade him to come home katya purred she pressed her window button and kept it down until the window was entirely open jerry caught a glimpse of her in the mirror the last of her caution and her fear had evaporated she was luxuriating in the warm wind against her face eyes closed hair shining how much farther she asked him without opening her eyes another ten minutes i can smell the ocean well were at fourth street four blocks over theres the beach i love the sea todd has a yacht did you know that its docked in san diego you see perfect she opened her eyes catching jerrys gaze in the mirror demanding a response from him yes its perfect he said she smiled thank you she said for what for everything bringing me here listening to me indulging me when things have settled down and todd and i have made the canyon a more civilized place were going to start inviting people over just a few special friends to share the beauty of the place you never saw the house at its best but you will it is magnificent oh im sure and thats how its going to be again after tonight magnificent magnificent eight this was tammys cinderella moment her dream come true all right perhaps all the details werent perfect she could have looked a little more glamorous and she would have liked to have lost another twentyfive pounds and they could have been coming in through the front door instead of slipping in at the side to avoid the photographers but she was happy to take what fate was giving her and fate was giving her a chance to walk into an alist party on the arm of todd pickett everywhere she looked there were famous faces famous smiles famous gazes famous figures swathed in gowns by famous designers famous fools making jokes that had everyone in their circle breathless with laughter famous powerbrokers telling tales of how theyd made a million in a minute and the less famous wives of these powerbrokers listening with their lids halfclosed because if they had a buck for every time theyd heard these tired old tales theyd be able to divorce their deadweights of husbands and hanging on the arms of the famous were younger men and women who watched their companions with the kind of eyes tammy was reserving for the hors doeuvres there was appetite in those eyes one day those gazes seem to say i will have all that you have i will own cars and yachts and palaces and houses i will have a small vineyard in tuscany and a large ranch in big sky country there will be no door that will be closed to me no ear that will not attend to my concerns when i drop my purse somebody will pick it up for me when my car is empty of gas it will be miraculously filled if the drink in my hand is getting low it will be replenished without my requesting it when i am hungry somebody will make food that will be so exquisitely shaped every mouthful is like a little meal unto itself in fact the food was drawing her attention about as much as the famous faces shed never seen such exquisite little confections and each one had a description proffered by its server much of which was so remote from tammys experience she didnt understand it slices of rare marinated this on slices of smoked that drizzled with oh what the hell shed take two no make that three it was only fingerfood for gods sake and she was hungry to wash it all down shed accepted a bellini from a dazzling waiter as soon as shed stepped inside and it tasted so sweet and harmless she downed twothirds of her glass before she realized how potent it was in truth however it would scarcely have mattered if shed downed five bellinis and fallen flat on her face she was invisible as far as these people were concerned the glacial beauties and their handsome swains the dealmakers and the wordsplitters none of them wanted to concede her ragged presence in their gilded midst so they simply looked the other way once or twice she caught the tail of a mystified glance laid upon her but these were from amateurs at the game to the true professionals which is to say most of the people in this assemblyshe was simply a nonpresence she could have been standing right in their line of vision and somehow their gaze would have slid off her and around her anything to avoid seeing her she caught tight hold of todds hand so much for the cinderella fantasy it was a nightmare much to her delight todd clutched her hand in return his palm was pouring sweat theyre all looking at me he said leaning close to her no theyre not hi todd hi jodie good tosee that they say hi then they move on shes gone already hi steven when are you too late hes off its fucking uncanny wheres maxine i havent seen her yet shes probably out back she likes to sit and hold court at these things she says only hostesses circulate and shes not the hostess fuck no these arent her guests theyre her supplicants tammy had seen some attractivelooking hors doeuvres sailing by ill have one of those she said tapping the waiter on the shoulder if you dont ask in this place she explained as she took three you dont get are they good what do i know theyre filling a hole very slowly doesnt anybody have any appetite around here not publicly to get to the back of the house he had led her into a larger roomwhich despite the fact that it was packed with guestswas almost as hushed as a library a few people looked round at todda few even attempted tentative smilesbut nobody made any move to break off their whispered exchanges and approach him for which tammy was grateful the density of famous faces was much the same in here as it had been next door this really was the crиme de la crиme the people who could get a studio to spend several million dollars developing a script by simply hinting that they might be in it when it was finished the names above the tide that audiences knew so well they only used an actors given name when they were talking about the show bruce and demi and brad and tom and all the rest next year some portion of the crowd would have slipped onto the blist after a dud or two but tonight they were at the top of their game famous amongst the famous tonight there wasnt an agency in the city that wouldnt have signed them on the spot or a latenight talkshow that wouldnt have bumped einstein van gogh and the pope to have them on they were american royalty the way that pickford and fairbanks had been royalty in the early years yes there were more crowns now more thrones but there were also more fans in every corner of the world men and women ready to fawn and obsess in short none of these were people who hurt for want of admiration they had a surfeit of it the way the rest of the world had a surfeit of creditcard debt it was harder in this more denselypopulated space for people not to concede the presence of todd who took hold of several unoffered hands and grabbed a couple of shoulders as he crossed the room determined that nobody get away with pretending they hadnt seen him and when a fragment of conversation did spring up as it occasionally did todd very rapidly made certain that tammy was introduced into the exchange you dont need to do that tammy said after the third such occasion yes i do todd replied these sonsabitches think they can look the other way and pretend you dont exist well fuck em ive starred in movies with some of these assholes movies you paid your seven bucks to see and they were mostly shit pictures so i figure they owe you a sevenbuckhandshake she laughed out loud thoroughly entertained by his heretical talk whatever happened after this she thought shed at least have this extraordinary memory to treasure walking arminarm with the only man shed ever really loved through a crowd of fools knowing that even if they didnt look at her they still knew she was there and when shed gone shed be somebody theyd never be able to figure out which suited her just fine let them wonder it would give them something to do when they were studying their reflections in the morning theres maxine todd said didnt i say shed be holding court it was a couple of years since tammy had seen maxine frizelle in the flesh in that time she had projected upon the woman an aura of power which in truth she didnt possess she was smaller and more fretfullooking than tammy remembered the way she was perched in a highbacked chair her bare feet off the ground was presumably designed to give off the aura of childlike vulnerability but in fact suggested just its opposite the pose looked awkward and artificial her gaze was woozy rather than happy and her smile completely false todd let go of tammys hand are you doing this on your own from here she said to him i think i ought to tammy shrugged whatever you want i mean its going to be difficult yeah she said the observation given credence by the frigid stare they were getting from the patio shes seen you tammy said she smiled in maxines direction the woman was getting up off her chair her expression more bemused than angry she leaned over and whispered something to the young man at her side he nodded in response and left the patio heading indoors and weaving his way through the partygoers towards tammy and todd tammy grabbed hold of todds hand again you know what she said what i was wrong were going to do this together nine out on the street katya let the valet open the car door for her her eyes fixed on the house into which she was about to make an entrance a hundred thoughts were crowding into her head at the same time all demanding attention would anybody recognize her jerry had told her many times her films remained widely seen and appreciated so it was inevitable somebody was going to figure out who she was on the other hand it had been the style in those days to slather your face in makeup so perhaps nobody would think to associate her with the high style of those movies nor of course would anybody assume that the katya lupi of the sorrows of frederick or nefertiti could possibly resemble the young woman she still seemed to be so again perhaps her fears were groundless and if somebody did recognize her against all the odds then shed swiftly find some witty riposte about the brilliance of modern science and let them wonder if she sent a few admirers off shaking their heads mystified by her untouched beauty would that be such a bad thing she had nothing to fear from these people she was beautiful and beauty was the only certain weapon against a brutal mind or a stupid world why should that power have deserted her she looked around subduing a little burst of panic to find that jerry was not at her side im here he said sauntering over from a very handsome and now welltipped valet ive been getting the scoop todd arrived a few minutes ago her face blossomed hes here hes here she was suddenly like a little child i knew this was going to work she said i knew i knew then just as suddenly a doubt is that woman with him tammy lauper yes she is i want you to separate them just like that yes she said deadly serious do whatever you have to do i just want you to part them so that i can talk to todd on his own as soon as i get a chance to do that the three of us can be out of here suppose he wants to stay with her no amongst his friends he cant she said he wont want to when he sees me hell just come youll see her confidence was beguiling whether it was fake or not she took his arm and they headed into the house if jerry had been expecting some grotesque echo of sunset boulevard he was pleasantly disappointed katya met the cameras at the door with an expression of familiarity on her face as though she were saying to the world oh there you are she let go of his hand at the threshold and like a ship that suddenly finds the wind again and remembers what it has to do effortlessly she turned and the cameramen got greedy for her the flashes a blinding barrage and she bathing in me light as it glazed her bones and filled her eyes of course none of them knew who the hell she was so they were reduced to snapping their fingers and calling miss uh over here miss but she knew her job she gave them all something wonderful something miraculous and just as the frenzy was approaching its height abruptly refused to continue thanking them all and sweeping away into the house leaving them begging for more this sudden burst of activity had attracted attention of course half the faces in the room were turned towards the door when katya entered wondering who the hell could have just arrived when it turned out to be a woman they did not even know the house became a gallery of whispers jerry stayed two or three steps behind katya as she crossed the room so he was able to see the range of responses her presence created envy more than anything particularly on the faces of women who assumed they were katyas contemporaries who was this woman who was as young or younger than they were prettier than they were getting all the attention they should have been getting on the faces of the young men there was similar questions being silently asked why is this damn woman more perfect than i am why does she have more eyes undressing her than i do then there was that other contingent of young men who were simply calculating their chances of getting across the room to her side with a drink or a witty pickup line before the opposition katya played it perfectly she was careful not to lock eyes with anyone so that she didnt get caught up in a conversation she wanted no part of she looked back at jerry who pointed on across the room towards todd and there he was standing on the patio with maxine they were in the midst of what looked to be a very unpleasant exchange she was shaking her head turning away from him he was following her poking her in the shoulder like a kid whos not getting his mothers full attention she ignored his importuning and headed down a flight of stairs which led off the other side of the patio down onto the beach the argument between todd and maxine had not gone unnoticed by the other occupants of the room ever since todds appearance at the party all other subjects of whispered conversation had fallen by the wayside it was pickett the guests were talking about they were chiefly debating his wounded appearance of course but now they were also discussing the way he stumbled in angry pursuit of maxine and the subject of their exchange which had unfortunately now been taken out of earshot there were plenty of people in the room who would have liked to have gone out onto the patio and followed todd and maxine down onto the sand but the only one who did so was tammy she pushed through a group standing between her and the patio door maneuvered her way around a waiter and a sofa and headed outside the wind had got up a little since she and todd had arrived it blew off the ocean bringing with it the sound of raised voices tammy heard maxines voice first she was demanding to know how todd dared show his face tammy crossed the patio to see if she could get a look at todd did he need her help or not as she approached the wooden railing an officious little man with the improbable face of an illtempered troll got in her way excuse me but who the hell are you im a friend of todds are you the maitre d there was a barelysuppressed guffaw from one corner of the patio tammy glanced round to see a young man almost as well dressed as the troll composing his face my names gary eppstadt im the head of paramount oh tammy said so so you obviously dont belong on this patio in point of fact i think she did come with todd said another onlooker a woman in black who was lounging against the railing as she sipped her cocktail eppstadt looked tammy up and down as though he was assessing a particularly unappealing heifer the nakedness of his look so infuriated her that she simply shoved him out of her way and went to the railing get security eppstadt said i want this bitch thrown out or i shall lodge charges for assault oh for gods sake gary the woman said youre making a fool of yourself only now did tammy recognize the womans soft drawl it was faye dunaway her weary glance fell momentarily on tammy shes not doing any harm faye went on go inside and get yourself a drink tammy glanced back over her shoulder eppstadt was obviously uncertain how to respond he first threw a fiery glance at dunaway who promptly threw it straight back then he snapped at one of the three younger men doomed to be out here on the patio at the same time christian yes sir what did i just say thatyou wanted security sir and what are you doing going to get them the man said hurrying away christ dunaway murmured didnt you hear what i said she came in with todd well she doesnt belong in here eppstadt said with him or without him shes up to no good mind you sos he he wasnt invited either i should have security cart him away too tammy turned from her spot at the railings what is your problem she said this is nothing to do with you where the fuck did you come from he asked you look like a streetperson is this todds idea of a joke bringing a streetperson in here who are you honey my names tammy lauper and im a friend of todds eppstadt cut in here friend in the sense of friend as in friend tammy said todds been going through some hard times recently no do tell im afraid im not at liberty hes working you honey faye said he knows all about the bad surgery the whole town does as it happens i suggested the surgeon eppstadt said bruce burrows he normally does firstrate work didnt he do some for you faye no said ms dunaway i dont need it yet my mistake but when i do ill be sure to avoid him judging him by what he did to todd that boy used to be damnnear perfect the way warren was perfect fifty years ago i mean they were uncanny both of them tammy didnt bother to listen to the rest of the conversation instead she slipped down the creaking wooden steps that led off the patio and down onto the sand the wash of light from the house lit the beach as far as the surf which was breaking quite boisterously the beach as far as she could see was immaculately dean no doubt the residents hired somebody to vacuum every morning so that nothing unpredictablea whiskey bottle a stray condom a dead fishbe allowed to disfigure the perfection of their stretch of coastline the only items she could see on the beach were two human figures if either todd or maxine had realized that tammy was there they gave no sign of it they simply kept up what theyd been doing for the last ten minutes arguing the wind carried most of their words away but every now and again a phrase would reach tammys eyes maxine called him a waste of time at one point all ego and no brains at another he called her a talentless bitch and a parasite she mentioned by way of response to one of his assaults that the whole town knows you got a facelift and that it went to hell i dont care todd replied then youre even more of a fool than i thought you were maxine yelled back because thats your fucking reputation out the window watch my lips todd said pointing to his mouth i dont care several exchanges followed of which tammy did not catch a single word she continued to approach the pair slowly expecting at any moment to be seen by one or the other but they were too deeply involved in expressing their rage at one another to take notice of her the conversation had definitely changed direction however because now when the wind brought fresh words in tammys direction the subject of the canyon was under debate and todd was shouting you set me up you knew something weird was going on up there and you set me up it was time to make this into a threeway conversation tammy decided stepping into maxines line of sight but maxine wasnt going to be distracted from the subject at hand by tammy all right she said to todd so the house has a history is that such a big deal i dont like messing with that stuff maxine its not safe by that stuff you mean what exactly todd dropped his voice to a nearwhisper but tammy was close enough to hear it the canyons full of dead people maxines response was to laugh her laughter unfeigned are you high no drunk no todd wasnt about to be laughed off ive seen them maxine ive touched them well then you should file a report to the national enquirer not come whining to me about it as far as im concerned this is our last conversation i want an explanation ill give you one maxine said youre crazy jerry katya was at jerrys side her expression troubled is there a way down onto the beach along the side of the house i dont know maybe why todds down on the beach being abused by that bitch of a manager im sure he can stand up for himself i just want to take him away and i dont want to have to come back through the crowd when i bring him back well lets see jerry said he took hold of katyas arm and together they went back to the front door i hate these people katya said when they reached the foyer you dont know any of them jerry said with respect oh believe me i do theyre the same old whores fakes and fools only the names have changed will you be leaving the valet wanted to know as they emerged from the house no jerry said i was just showing my friend around the house do you know if theres a way down onto the beach yes of course just go back through the house wed prefer not to go through the house well i guess theres a pathway which runs down the side of the house which takes you to the beach but its much easier thank you katya said catching hold of the mans gaze and smiling at him id just like to get away from the crowd if the man had any objections they faded away on the spot he blushed at the directness of katyas look and stood aside its all yours he said ten on the beach todd looked up towards the house the patio was now so crowded with spectators that people had gone into the kitchen and up to the bedrooms so they could look out at the beach and watch the exchange between himself and maxine a few of the partiers had wandered down the patio and were watching intently from there the general level of hubbub from inside had also dropped considerably word had got around that a war of words was being fought on the sand and if everyone would just shut up for a minute or two it would be more audible you wish youd never started this now dont you maxine said all i want is some answers no you dont you want to embarrass me in front of my friends because i let you go well todd id had enough of you its as simple as that i was tired i wanted to be free of you and your endless demands maxine closed her eyes as she spoke and for the first time in her life tammy had a morsel of sympathy for the woman despite her makeup and her immaculate coiffure nothing could disguise her genuine exhaustion when she said she wanted to be free of todd tammy believed her when i arranged for you to move into that house it was because it seemed to serve your comforts that was all i cared about now you come here yelling and swearing and i think to hell with your comforts its about time they all heard the truth dont go there maxine why not why the hell not you came here to cause trouble well youre going to get trouble she had raised her voice so that she was now plainly audible to the audience assembled on the patio and gathered at the windows todd had nowhere to run the closer she got to him the more he was forced to retreat towards the house and the more audible her words became just tell the damn woman youre sorry todd tammy said and lets get the hell out of here this isnt the time or the place maxine glanced at tammy conceding her existence here with them for the first time you think hes going to apologize to me he doesnt understand the word sorry you know why hes never been wrong at least the way he tells it well he can make an exception right todd keep out of this todd snapped i hid you away in that house because you asked me to hide you away maxine went on her recollections delivered in the direction of the spectators you needed time to heal im warning you todd said maxine went on unintimidated as i recall she said your face looked like a piece of hammered steak thanks to doctor burrows all right you win todd said just stop right there why they already know the truth todd the whole towns been gossiping about your phantom of the opera act for weeks shut up maxine no todd i will not shut up ive kept your fucking secrets for years and im not going to do it any longer perhaps we should just go todd tammy said dont waste your breath on him maxine said hes not going to sleep with you thats what youre hoping for isnt it god tammy said you people dont deny it maxine snapped well i am denying it you think the world revolves around sex its pathetic anyway i didnt todd said as though he wanted to be sure that maxine was not misled on the subject something about his eagerness to have this particular fact set straight distressed tammy she knew why he was ashamed of her damn him still concerned about his stupid reputation maxine must have seen the anger and disappointment on tammys face because the rage in her own voice mellowed dont let him hurt you she said hes not worth it really hes not its just that he doesnt want them up there she jabbed her finger in the direction of the house thinking hed ever sink so low as to sleep with the likes of you isnt that right todd you dont want people thinking you fucked the fat girl the knife turned a second time in tammy she wished the beach would just open up beneath her and swallow her so shed never have to see any of these people ever again but there was still enough selfesteem left in her to challenge the sonofabitch what had she got to lose is that right todd she said are you ashamed of me oh jesus todd shook his head then made a furtive glance at the house there were probably sixty people on the patio and balconies now enjoying the spectacle below you know what he said fuck both of you with that he turned his back on tammy and maxine and started to walk off down the beach but maxine wasnt going to let him get away so easily we didnt finish talking about your healing todd leave it maxine the operation the one to make you look a few years younger the facelift he swung around at her i said leave it or i will sue your fucking ass on what grounds im just telling the truth youre an arrogant spoiled talentless todd stopped his retreat his face looked blotchy in the light thrown from the house there was a tic beneath the left side of his mouth the expression of empty despair on his mismade face silenced maxine todd looked past both the women at the crowd that was watching all this unfold then he started to yell have you had enough well have you shes right its all true i did get a fucking facelift you know why that cunt eppstadt yes you you fucking quasimodo you eppstadt had found a prime grandstand position to watch the encounter between todd and maxine so there were plenty of eyes turned in his direction now he didnt like the scrutiny any more than todd had he shook his head and waved todds accusations away then turned his back and tried to disappear into the crowd but todd kept on haranguing him youre the freak here you know that todd yelled you fuck with our lives you fuck with our heads well youre not going to fuck with me any more because im not playing your game anymore hear me im not playing todd suddenly ran at the patio and reached up through the railing to catch hold of eppstadts pants leg eppstadt turned on him get your hands off me he shouted kicking at todd as though he were a crazed dog todd simply pulled harder on his leg so that eppstadt had to grab hold of somebody beside him to stop himself falling over his face was white with fury the assault went to the very heart of his dignity this was a living nightmare for him the mad dog actor the audience of people who despised him all drinking his embarrassment down like a fine champagne you aint getting away so easy uglyboy todd said were all in this together pickett let go of me eppstadt demanded his voice had become shrill with rage beads of sweat popping out all over his face you hear me let me go when im done todd said he pulled on eppstadt again dragging him a few inches closer you miserable fucking shit how many people have you told to get their faces fixed huh you were looking old eppstadt said i was looking old ha look at you im not a moviestar no and neither am i im over all that you know why ive seen where they go eppstadt all the beautiful people the stars ive seen where they end up forest lawn oh no theyre not in graves eppstadt thats too easy theyre still out there the ghosts still thinking some fuck like you will give them another chance will somebody get this crazy sonofabitch off me eppstadt shrieked one of the waiters went down on his haunches in front of the railing took hold of todds hands and started pulling off his fingers one by one you better let go man the waiter quietly warned or im going to start hurtin you and i dont want to do that todd ignored him he simply hauled on eppstadt which threw the older man offbalance the woman eppstadt had been holding onto also toppled and would have come down hard had the crowd around her not been so thick eppstadt was not so lucky however the people in his immediate vicinity had moved away as soon as todd had caught hold of his leg down he went catching the waiter a blow with his knee as he fell so that the other man was also sent sprawling todd dragged eppstadt towards the edge of the patio there wasnt a single witness to all of this who knowing eppstadt didnt take pleasure in the indignity they saw being visited on the man people hed scorned and made to look like fools were now all silently hoping this farce would escalate but eppstadt was made of sterner stuff he kicked at his attacker the first blow striking todds shoulder the second hitting his nose and mouth a brutal blow todd let go of eppstadt and fell back on the sand blood pouring from both nostrils like two faucets switched on full power eppstadt scrambled to his feet yelling i want that man arrested right now right now todd looked up from his sprawl his hand going to his face coming away red a hundred faces now stared down at him there wasnt a person at the partywhether bartender guest waiter toilet attendant or valetwho had not forsaken the house to come out and see what all the hubbub was about they were all staring down at the famous bloody face on the sand and the sprawled eppstadt on the patio scandal didnt get much better than this this was a story to dine out on for years a few people had come down onto the sand on the pretext of helping todd perhaps but actually of course to see better what was going on and so have a clearer account for later nobody lent todd a hand not even tammy she had retreated some distance unwilling to provide these witless fools with something else to laugh at todd scrambled to his feet without help and instinctively turned his back on his audience theyd already seen and heard far more than he wanted them to see or hear all he wanted now was to get away from their snickering assessments fuck you all he muttered to himself wondering which way he should go along the beach left or right and then straight ahead of him he had his answer standing there at the waterline watching him was katya at first he didnt believe it was really her what was she doing so far from her sanctuary but if it wasnt her then who he didnt wait for his senses to catch up with what his instinct already knew without looking back at the ridiculous circus behind him he stumbled down the beach towards her despite all that katya had done all that she was associated with in todds mind her smile was welcome to him now her madness infinitely preferable to that of eppstadt and the mob behind him he was done with them forever this last humiliation was simply the final proof that he did not belong at this party any longer for better or worse he belonged in the canyon with the woman standing at the waters edge beckoning to him what are you doing here he asked she smiled oh that smile still an astonishment what do you think i came to find you i thought youd never leave the canyon sometimes i surprise myself he put his arm around her an ambitious wave came up around their legs and filled his shoes with cold saltwater he laughed snorting through the blood it spattered her god im sorry thats gross he went down on his haunches and brought a handful of water up to wash his face inhaling to cleanse his nostrils the saltwater stung katya came down to crouch in the surf beside him her gaze going over his shoulder theyre coming down from the house to get you she warned fuck he didnt need to glance back to confirm what she was saying eppstadt would enjoy what came next of course having todd arrested for assault hauled up before a judge it would be headlines tomorrow and attached to it every detail of what maxine had proclaimed to her guests burrows would be shooed out of hiding wherever he was to tell his half of the story orif he chose to stand by his hippocratic oath and remain silentthen somebody would invent the details or a nurse would spill them however it was verified the secret was out but his story was only part of this katya what about her secret if they got her into the spotlight as well as todd then the mystery of would become part of tomorrows headlines the sanctuary would be violated by police and press and when theyd gone by the public i cant bear this he said he was ready to weep for them both she took hold of his hand then dont she said she stood up facing the sea pulling on his hand so that he stood with her there were a few lights out there in the ocean very remote otherwise it was completely dark walk with me she said she couldnt mean into the water yes she did she was already walking and he was following not because he liked the idea of striding off into the icy roaring pacific but because the alternativethe mockery of the audience on the shore all the interrogations that awaited himwas too much to contemplate he wanted to be away from all that and if the only direction he could take led him into the ocean then so be it he had her hand in his that was all he needed for the first time in his life that was all he needed there are currents he said i know and sharks im sure he almost looked back but stopped himself dont bother she said you know what theyre doing yes staring at us pointing at us coming after us yes but not where were going the water was up to todds waist now and higher still on katya who was a good six inches shorter than he though the waves werent large tonight as theyd been at the height of the storm they still had sufficient power to throw them backwards when they broke against their bodies the force of one wave separated them and katya was carried back to shore a few yards todd turned and went back to get her glancing up at the beach as he did so though they were probably less then twentyfive yards out the land already seemed very distant a line of sand scattered with people whod come down to the waters edge to get a better view of whatever was going on and beyond them the houses all bright with lights maxines in particular down the path between the houses he could see the flashing yellow and blue of a policecar it would only be a matter of time he thought before they sent a helicopter after them with a searchlight he reached katya and caught hold of her hand the glimpse of land had filled him with new determination come on he said ill carry you she didnt protest this rather let him gather her up in his arms so that they could continue their escape he had become he thought a monster in an old horror movie grabbing the girl and carrying her off into the night except that it was she whod led him thus far so that made them both monsters didnt it she slipped her arms around his neck and lay her head against his chest the water was so deep now that when the waves came and rifted them up his toes no longer touched the bottom curiously he wasnt afraid they were going to drown most probably but what the hell the water was so cold his body was already becoming numb and his eyelids felt heavy keepholdof me he said to her she pressed her mouth to his neck she was warmer than he was which for some inexplicable reason he found amusing she who was so old was the one with the fever the thought of that of her bodys heat made him voice his one regret wenever did it properlyin a bed i mean we will she said kissing him on the mouth another wave came larger than most that had preceded it and picked them both up they did not break their kiss though the water closed over their heads on the shore there was plenty of commotion but tammy kept away from the heart of it moving off down the beach she had watched todd and katya getting smaller and smaller her panic growing now they were gone perhaps she just couldnt make them out any longer and theyd reappear in a moment but she didnt have very high hopes of that there had been such determination in the way theyd headed out into the darkness plainly they werent going out to enjoy a little swim then turn round and head back to shore they were escaping together in the only direction left for them she had a sick feeling in the pit of her stomach part horror at what shed just witnessed part envy he had made his choice finally and now he was gone she heard the throb of rotorblades and she looked up to see a police helicopter coming from the south following the line of the surf as it approached the place where the lovers had disappeared its powerful spotlight illuminated the water with uncanny brightness tammy looked back at the people assembled along the shoreline almost all the guests had vacated the house and were milling around on the sand she couldnt see maxine but she could name a few famous folks mainly from the color of their clothes glenn close was in white brad pitt in a powder blue suit madonna was in red they were briefly illuminated by the flood of the searchlight then the helicopter veered off seaward and tammy followed its progress as it swooped down close to the water surely todd and katya couldnt have gone that far out even if the current had caught them they couldnt have been swept more than a few hundred yards in the short time since theyd entered the water but then the current wasnt the only variable here was it there was also their own ambition they had gone out intending to be lost and lost they were suddenly she was crying standing outside the wedge of light thrown by the house and beyond the presence of anyone who could possible comfort her dirty and cold and alone she sobbed like a baby she made no attempt to stop the flood better out than in her mother had always said and it was true she could never think straight when she had a bout of tears waiting in the wings it was wiser to just weep them out and be done with them at last her grief began to subside and she cleared the tears from her cheeks with her hands the helicopter was now some distance from the shore and had dropped even closer to the water hovering over one particular place she tried to make sense of the waterscape had the men in the helicopter located the bodies she stared at the spotlit water until her eyes started to ache but she could make no sense of what she was seeing just the spume being whipped up off the water so that it looked like snow in the column of white light after a few minutes the helicopter moved away from that position turning off its searchlight for a while as it headed down the beach when the light was turned on again and the brightness struck the water the search had moved much further out to sea still tammy kept watching desperately trying to make sense of the sight but at last it simply became too frustrating and turning her back on the water she walked back up the side of the house to the street where many of the same people shed seen down by the water earlier enjoying the spectacle along with their champagne were now waiting to pick up their cars they were quiet eyes downcast as though they felt just a tiny prick of guilt at having treated the death of one of their number as a spectator sport whatever interest tammy might once have had in these people was gone the fact that she was practically rubbing shoulders with brad and julia and halfadozen other luminaries was a matter of complete indifference to her her thoughts were still out there in the dark waters of the pacific finally somebody spoke some imbecilic remark about how valets were getting slower every day it was all this airheaded company needed to throw off their show of introspection chatter sprang up and on its heels laughter by the time tammys car had arrived the group was in a fine mood exchanging jokes and telephone numbers the scene on the beachthe tragedy theyd all just witnessed togetheralready a thing of the past eleven along the beach a hundred and fifty yards from where tammy was standing all eyes were also directed seaward and like tammys eyes saw nothing but the uncanny almost beatific light from the hovering helicopter as it passed back and forth over the surface of the water eppstadt had his lawyer jacob lazlov on the line while he watched the water at his side maxine i want this sonofabitch pickett prosecuted to the full extent of the law jacob what do you mean what did he do he practically tore off my leg thats what he did in public jesus jacob it was an attack a physical attack and now the bastards trying to drown himself isnt this all a little premature maxine remarked dryly hes probably drowned by now then ill sue his fucking estate i can sue the estate cant i jacob speak up i cant hear you the helicopter you are a piece of work you know that maxine said ill call you back jacob eppstadt snapped his phone closed and followed maxine back across the beach to the house on the way they encountered the waiter whod come to eppstadts aid during todds attack whats your name son joseph finlay sir well joe id like you to do me a favor and stay within ten yards of me till i tell you otherwise will you do that ill pay you very well for your services and if you see anything you dont like son im there sir good good but you can start by getting me a brandy be quick joe hurried away didnt you have any security at this damn party maxine of course well where the fuck was it when i was having my leg torn off jacobs going to be asking some questions maxine and youd better have some damn good answers todd wasnt some trespasser maxine said she had reached the patio and now turned to face eppstadt tears filling her eyes ive known him ten years everyone knows him well apparently none of us knew him well enough he was ready to kill me he was nowhere near killing you maxine said weary of eppstadts selfdramatization she sank down into the chair where shed been sitting when todd had first arrived turning it round so she could watch the beach your brandy sir eppstadt took his brandy joe pulled a chair up and eppstadt sat down in it ten yards he said to joe im here joe stepped back a little distance to give eppstadt and maxine a measure of privacy eppstadt took out a pack of cigarettes offered one to maxine who took it with trembling fingers he lit both and leaned back in his chair sonofabitch he said whod ever have thought hed pull a stunt like this i think it all got too much for him maxine said he cracked no doubt what was he talking about some house you put him in oh yes that house maxine said it all began with that fucking house wheres jerry brahms who maxine couldnt see jerry but she spotted sawyer her assistant who was inside the house eating he came at her summons mouth stuffed with canapes she told him to find jerry pronto i think we have to assume the current took them eppstadt said directing maxines attention at the helicopter which had steadily moved further and further out from the beach in its search there were now two coast guard boats bobbing around in the water mounted with searchlights have people no taste maxine said surveying the condo on the beach to make matters worse something of the party atmosphere had returned to the gathering the waiters were weaving amongst the guests refreshing drinks or offering finger food it was not being refused people seemed to be of the opinion that the evenings drama was best viewed as part of the fun a waiter brought a platter to maxines side sushi he said she looked at the array of raw fish with almost superstitious disgust oh god why not eppstadt said a little too heartily in fact you can leave the platter how can you eat im hungry and if i were you id keep me happy treat me very delicately he examined the piece of yellowtail in his fingers i suppose at this point i could get all stirred up wondering what the fish was eating before it was caughtbut why wonder maxine got up from her chair and walked over to the railing i always thought you liked todd i thought he was acceptable company up to a point but then he got full of himself and he became impossible your handiwork of course what telling him he was the next best thing to sliced bread when all along he was just another pretty face and now not even that thanks to doctor burrows he picked up a second piece of sushi i tell you if todd is dead then hes done the best thing he could do for his reputation i know how that sounds but its the truth now hes got a crack at being a legend if hed lived grown old everyone would have realized he couldnt act his way out of a damp paper bag and it would have made us all look like fools you for representing him me for spending all that money on him over the years maxine sawyer was leading a stricken jerry up onto the patio at some point in the recent past his rug had become partially unglued and now sat offcenter on his head todds gone he said we cant be sure yet jerry sawyer get mr brahms a scotch and soda light on the scotch jerry this is mr eppstadt from paramount im familiar jerry said his gaze going from eppstadt as soon as hed laid eyes on him and drifting off again towards the water its useless i dont know why they keep searching theyve been swept away by now the house jerry what in the canyon eppstadt said ive been hearing about it from maxine oh i see welltheres not a lot i can tell you i just used to go there as a child i was an actor you see when i was much younger and were there other children there no not that i remember at least just a woman called katya lupiwho took me under her wing shes the one he pointed out towards the waterline who took todd no jerry maxine said whoever that woman was she was young katya was young this girl looked twentyfive katya looked twentyfive he accepted his scotch and soda from sawyer she wasnt of course she was probably a hundred then how the hell can she have looked twentyfive eppstadt demanded jerry had two words by way of reply coldheart canyon eppstadt had no reply to this he just stared at brahms bewildered she looks young jerry said but she isnt that was her out there no doubt about it personally i think it was some kind of a suicide pact between them thats ridiculous maxine snorted todds got his whole life in front of him i think he may have been more desperate than you realized jerry said perhaps if youd been a little better as friends hed still be with us i dont think its very useful to toss that kind of accusation around eppstadt said especially when we dont know the facts i think the facts are very plain jerry said i still read variety he pointed at maxine you decided to give up on representing him when he was having difficulties with his career and you now the accusatory finger went in eppstadts direction cancelled a movie which he had his heart set on not to mention the fact that you the finger returned to maxine just made a public display of humiliating him is it any wonder he decided to put an end to his life neither accusee attempted a defense what was the use what jerry had said was a matter of public record i want to see this canyon eppstadt said and the house the house has nothing to do with any of this jerry said frankly i suggest you keep your distance from it youve already eppstadt ignored him where is it he demanded of maxine well ive never been able to find it on a map but the canyon runs parallel with laurel canyon i dont think its even got a proper name coldheart canyon brahms said again thats what they used to call it in the silent era because she was supposed to have such a cold heart you see you know your way there eppstadt asked maxine isuppose i could find my waybut id prefer somebody to drive me you eppstadt said it was his turn to point jerry shook his head its either you taking me or the police whyd you want to call the police because i think theres some kind of conspiracy going on you pickett the woman who went into the sea with him youre all in this together to do what for gods sake i dont know promote that assholes career i assure you i dont care to hear your assurances eppstadt said i just need you to take me to this canyon of yours its not mine its hers katyas if we went there wed be trespassing on her property ill take that risk well i wont maxine tell him hes coming i dont see why you want to go jerry pleaded lets just make mr eppstadt happy right now shall we i just dont want to trespass jerry said again well you can blame me eppstadt said tell this lupi womanif she ever surfaces againthat i forced you to take me wheres the waiter joe eppstadts makeshift bodyguard came over were going to make a little fieldtrip id like you to come with us oh okay maxine do you have a gun im not going with you yes you are mdear a gun do you have one several but im not going ive had enough excitement for one night i need some sleep well heres your choices come now and lets find out what the hells going on up there together or sit tight and wait for my lawyer to call you in the morning maxine looked at him blankly do i take that as a yes he said there were five in the expedition party maxines assistant sawyer armed with one of maxines guns drove maxine and in a second car driven by jerry went eppstadt and joe the larger of maxines guns a was in eppstadts possession he claimed he knew how to use it by the time they had left many of the partygoers had already drifted away leaving a hard core of perhaps thirtyfive people many of them still on the beach waiting to see if anything noteworthy was going to happen about fifteen minutes after eppstadts expedition had departed for the hills the coast guard called off the helicopter there had been a boating accident up the coastnine people in the waterand air support was urgently needed one of the two search boats was also called off leaving the other to make wider and wider circles as any hope that the lost souls were still alive and close to the shore steadily grew more remote and finally faded entirely part eight the wind at the door one the night was almost over by the time the two cars bearing eppstadts little expeditionary force made their way up the winding road that led into coldheart canyon the sky was just a little lighter in the east though the clouds were thick so it would be a sluggish dawn without an ounce of the drama which had marked the hours of darkness in the depths of the canyon itself the day never truly dawned properly at all there was a peculiar density to the shadows between the trees today as though the night lingered there in scraps and rags dayblooming flowers would fail to show themselves even at the height of noon while plants that would normally offer sight and scent of themselves only after dark remained awake through the daylight hours none of this was noticed by eppstadt or the others in his party they were not the sort of people who noticed things to which so little value could be readily attached but they knew something was amiss even so from the moment they stepped out of their vehicles they proceeded towards the house exchanging anxious looks their steps reluctant even eppstadt who had been so vocal about seeing the canyon when theyd all been down in malibu plainly wished hed not talked himself into this had he been on his own he would undoubtedly have retreated but he could scarcely do so now with so many people watching he could either hope that something alarming happened soon and he was obliged to call a general retreat in the interest of the company or that theyd get into the house make a cursory examination of the place then agree that this was a matter best left with the police and get the hell out the feeling he had walking into the house was the same feeling he sometimes got going onto a darkened sound stage a sense of anticipation hung in the air the only question was what was the drama that was going to be played out here a continuation of the farce hed been so unwillingly dragged into on the beach he didnt think so the stage was set here for some other order of spectacle and he didnt particularly want to be a part of it in all his years running a studio hed never greenlit a horror movie or anything with that kind of supernatural edge he didnt like them on the one hand he thought they were contemptible rubbish and on the other they made his flesh creep they unnerved him with their reports from some irrational place in the psyche a place he had fled from all his life the canyon knew that place he sensed no he knew there were probably subjects for a hundred horror movies here god help him weird huh joe remarked to him eppstadt was glad hed brought the kid along though eppstadt didnt have a queer bone in his body there was still something comforting about having a bigboned midwestern dumbfuck like joe on the team what are we looking for anyhow joe asked as maxine led the way into the house anything out of the ordinary eppstadt replied we dont have any right to be here maxine reminded him and if todd is dead the police arent going to be very happy that we touched stuff i get it maxine he said well be careful big place joe said wandering into the lounge great for parties lets get some lights on in this place shall we eppstadt said hed no sooner spoken than sawyer found the master panel and flipped on every one of the thirty switches before him room after dazzling room was revealed detail after glorious detail jerry had seen the dream palace countless times over the years but for some reason even in its early days when the paint was fresh and the gilding perfect hed never seen the house put on a show quite like this it was almost as if the old place knew it didnt have long to live andknowing its span was shortwas making the best of the hours remaining to it the woman on the beach eppstadt said she built this place yes her name was katya lupi and i know who she was eppstadt replied ive seen some of her movies trash kitsch trash it was impossible of course that the woman whod built this spanish mausoleum was the same individual whod escorted todd pickett into the surf that woman might have been her grandchild eppstadt supposed at a stretch a greatgrandchild more likely he was about to correct brahms on his generational details when a chorus of yelping coyotes erupted across the canyon eppstadt knew what coyotes sounded like of course he had plenty of friends who lived in the hills and considered the animals harmless scavengers digging through their trash and occasionally dining on a pet cat but there was something about the noise they were making now as the sun came up that made his stomach twitch and his skin crawl it was like a soundtrack of one of the horror movies hed never greenlit and then just as suddenly as the chorus of coyotes had erupted it ceased there were three seconds of total silence then everything began to shake the walls the chandelier the ancient floorboards beneath their feet earthquake sawyer yelled he grabbed hold of maxines arm she screeched and ran for the kitchen door outside she shrieked were all safer outside she could move fast when she needed to she dragged sawyer after her down to the back door jerry tried to follow but the shaking in the ground had become a roll and he missed his handhold joe midwestern boy that he was had never experienced an earthquake before he just stood on the pitching ground repeating the name of his savior over and over and over again in perfect sincerity its going to stop any minute eppstadt thought but this one kept going escalating the floor was undulating in front of him if hed seen it in dailies he would have fired the physical effects guy for creating something that looked so phony solid matter like wood and nails simply didnt move that way it was ludicrous but still it escalated and joes calls to his savior became shouts christ christ christ christ whens it going to stop jerry gasped hed given up trying to rise he just lay on the ground while the rattling and the rolling continued unabated there was a crash from an adjacent room as something was thrown over and then from further off a whole succession of further crashes as shelves came unseated and their contents were scattered a short length of plaster molding came down from the ceiling and smashed on the ground a foot from where eppstadt was standing its shards spreading in all directions he looked up in case there was more to come a fine rain of plasterdust was descending stinging his eyes meanwhile the quake continued to make the house creak and crack on all sides eppstadts semiblinded condition only making the event seem all the more apocalyptic he reached towards joe who was hoarse from reciting his oneword prayer and caught hold of him whats that noise the kid yelled over the din it seemed like a particularly witless question in the midst of such a cacophony but interestingly eppstadt grasped exactly what the kid was talking about there was one sound amongst the terrifying orchestration of groans and crashes from all over the house that was deeper than all the others and seemed to be coming from directly beneath them it sounded like two titanic sets of teeth grinding together grinding so hard they were destroying themselves in the process i dont know what it is admitted eppstadt tears were pouring from his eyes washing them dear of the plasterdust well i want it to fucking stop joe said with nice midwestern directness hed no sooner spoken than the noise in the earth started to die away and moments later the rest of the din and motion followed its overjerry sobbed hed spoken too soon there was one last short jolt in the ground which brought a further series of crashes from around the house and from below what sounded like a door being thrown open so violently it cracked its back against the wall only then did the noises and the deepearth motion finally subside and die away what was left from far off was the sound of car alarms everybody okay eppstadt said ill never get used to those damn things jerry said that was a big one eppstadt said at least and it went on and on i think we should just get the hell out of here joe said before we go anywhere eppstadt said venturing into the kitchen we wait for any aftershocks were safer inside than out there right now how do you figure that joe said following eppstadt into the kitchen it was chaos none of the shelves had come off the walls but theyd been shaken so violently theyd deposited their contents on the tiled floor a cabinet holding booze had been shaken down and several of the bottles broken filling the air with the sharp tang of mingled liquors eppstadt went to the refrigeratorwhich had been thrown open by the quake and had half its contents danced off the shelvesand found a can of coke he cracked it carefully letting its excitability fizz away by degrees then poured it as though this sickly soda was a hundred year old brandy and drank better he said ill take one of those joe remarked what colour do i look scowling joe kicked his way through the fractured crockery to the refrigerator and got himself a coke what the hell happened to maxine eppstadt wondered she went out back with sawyer joe said averting his face from a fan of erupting coke eppstadt went out into a passageway that led down to an open door kicking a few pieces of fallen plaster out of the way as he went maxine he called are you okay there was no reply without waiting for anyone to join him he headed down to the back door there was more plaster dust underfoot and several large cracks in the walls and ceiling unlike other areas of the house this portion looked less solid to his eye and very much less elegant a hurried later addition he guessed and probably more vulnerable to shocks than the older parts of the house he called out for maxine again but again there was no reply forthcoming he wasnt surprised the area just outside the door looked squalid large masses of rotted vegetable matter covered the walkway on the other side of the threshold giving off a sickly stench the foliage overhanging the area was so thick that the area was practically benighted he went to the threshold intending to call for maxine again but before he could do so he heard the sound of low sibilant laughter since childhood hed always been certain that laughter heard in his vicinity was laughter heard at his expense and even though his therapist had worked hard for sixteen years to dissuade him of this neurosis it lingered he narrowed his eyes trying to make sense of the shadows beneath the trees dividing form from apparition obviously the laughter had a source perhaps more than one he just couldnt make it out stop that he ordered but the laughter continued which enraged him they were laughing at him he was certain of it who else would they be laughing at bastards he stepped over the threshold ready to sue the air was cold and clammy this wasnt a very pleasant house hed decided very quickly and this was a particularly unpleasant corner of it but the laughter continued and he couldnt turn his back on it not until hed silenced it who the hell are you he demanded this is private property you hear me you shouldnt even he stopped now because there in the shadow of a humongous bird of paradise tree he made out a human form no two no three he could barely see their features but he could feel the imprint of their stares upon him and then more laughter mocking his protests im warning you he snapped as though he were talking to children get away from here go on get away but instead of stopping the addled laughter grew louder still and its owners decided to step out from under the shade of the bird of paradise eppstadt could see them more dearly now they were indeed trespassers he guessed whod been up here partying the night away one of them a very lovely young woman was barebreasted her brunette hair wet and pressed to her skull he vaguely thought he knew her that perhaps as a child actress shed been in a movie hed produced over at paramount or during his earlier time at fox she was certainly developing into a beautiful woman but there was something about the way she stepped out of the shadowsher head sinking down as though she might at any moment drop to the ground and imitate some animal or otherthat distressed him he didnt want her near him even with her tight skin her lovely nubs of nipples her pouty lips there was too much hunger in her eyes and even if he wasnt the focus of that appetite he didnt want to be caught between such a mindless hunger and its object of desire whatever it might be and then there were the others still lurking close to the tree behind her wait there were more than two there were a host of others whose gaze he now felt on him they were everywhere out here in this uncertain dawn he could see the foliage moving where some of them had slunk their naked bellies flat on the ground and they were up in the branches too rotted blossoms came down to add to the muck that slickened the mexican pavers underfoot eppstadt took a tentative backward step regretting that hed ever stepped out of the house no not just that at that moment he was regretting the whole process of events that had brought him to this damned house in the first place going to maxines asinine party having that witless argument with pickett then the interrogation of jerry brahms and the choice to come up here stupid all of it he took a second backward step as he did so the eyes of the exhibitionist girl whod first appeared became exceptionally bright as though something in her head had caught fire then without warning she broke into a sudden run racing at eppstadt he turned back towards the door and in the instant that he did so he saw a dozenno two dozenfigures whod been standing camouflaged in the murk break their cover and join her in her dash for the door he was a step from reaching the threshold when the young bitch caught hold of his arm please she said her fingers dug deep into the fat where healthier men had biceps let me go dont go in she said she pulled him back towards her her strength uncanny he reached out and grabbed the doorjamb thinking as he did so that hed got through the last twentyfive years of his life without anyone laying an inappropriate hand upon him and here he was in the midst of his second such indignity in the space of twentyfour hours the woman still had fierce hold of him and she wasnt about to let him go stay out here she implored he flailed away from her his armani shirt tore and he seized the moment to wriggle free from the corner of his eye he saw a lot of faces eyes incandescent converging on the spot terror made him swifter than hed been in three decades he leapt over the threshold and once he got inside he turned on a quarter throwing all his weight against the door it slammed closed he fumbled with the lock expecting to feel instant pressure exerted from the other side but there was none despite the fact that the trespassers could have pushed the door open they didnt the girl simply called to him through the door her voice wellmodulated like that of someone whod been to a highgrade finishing school you should be careful she said in an eerie singsong this house is going to come down do you hear me mister its coming down he heard he heard loud and clear but he didnt reply he simply bolted the door still mystified as to why they hadnt attempted to break in and ran up the passageway back to the kitchen before he reached the door joe rounded the corner coming in the opposite direction gun in hand where the hell were you eppstadt demanded i was just about to ask you the same were under siege from what there are crazy people out there a lot of crazy fucking people where right outside that door he pointed back down the passageway there was nothing visible through the glass panel theyd retreated in four or five seconds taking refuge in the murk trust me eppstadt said theres twenty or thirty people waiting on the other side of that door one of them tried to drag me out there with them he proffered his torn shirt and bloodied arm as proof she was probably rabid i should get shots i dont hear anybody joe said theyre out there trust me he went back to the kitchen with joe on his heels jerry was running water into the sink and splashing it on his temple joe went straight to the window to see if he could verify eppstadts story while eppstadt snatched a handful of water to douse his own wound the lines down by the way jerry said ive got my portable eppstadt said theyre not working either joe said the earthquakes taken out the whole system did you see maxine or sawyer out there jerry said i never got out there brahms there are people yes i know wait turn off the water i havent finished washing i said turn it off brahms reluctantly obeyed as the last of the water ran off down the pipes another cluster of noises became audible rising from the bowels of the house it sounds like somebody left a television on down there joe said splendidly simpleminded eppstadt went to the door that lead into the turret thats no television he said well what the hell else would it be joe said i can hear horses and wind theres no wind today it was true there was no wind but somewhere it was howling like the soundtrack on lawrence of arabia youll find this place gets crowded after a while jerry said matteroffactly he patted dry the wound on his face we shouldnt be here he reiterated who are they out there eppstadt said old movie stars mainly a few of katyas lovers eppstadt shook his head these werent old and several of them were women she liked women jerry said on occasion especially if she could play her little games with them what the fuck are you talking about joe said katya lupi who built this house once and for all eppstadt said these were not katya lupis lovers they were young one of them at least looked no more than sixteen or seventeen she liked them very young and they liked her especially when shed taken them down there he pointed to the turret door through which the sound of stormwinds were still coming its another world down there you see and theyd be addicted after that theyd do anything for her just to get another taste of it i dont get it joe said better you dont jerry replied just leave now while you still can the earthquake threw the door open down there thats why you can hear all the noise you said it was coming from some other place joe said yes the devils country what thats what katya used to call it the devils country joe glanced at eppstadt looking for some confirmation that all this was nonsense but eppstadt was staring out of the window still haunted by the hungry faces hed met on the threshold much as he would have liked to laugh off what jerry brahms was saying his instincts were telling him to be more cautious suppose there is some kind of door down there he said there is believe me all right say i believe you and maybe the earthquake did open it up shouldnt somebody go down there and close it that would certainly make sense joe aw shit why me because youre the one who kept telling us how good you are with a gun anyway its obvious jerrys in no state to go what about you joe eppstadt said youre talking to the head of paramount so that doesnt mean a whole heap right now does it no but it will when we get back to the real world he stared at joe with an odd little smile on his face you dont want to be a waiter all your life do you no of course not you came to hollywood to act am i right im really good im sure you are do you have any idea how much help i could be to you if i go down there and close the door then you make me a movie star there are no guarantees in this town joe but put it this way youve got a better chance of being the next brad pitt i see myself more as an ed norton okay ed norton you stand a better chance of being the next ed norton if youve got the head of paramount on your side you understand joe looked past eppstadt at the doorway that led to the turret the noise of the storm had not abated a jot if anything the wind had become louder slamming the door against a wall if it had just been the whine of the wind coming from below no doubt joes ambitions would have had him halfway down the stairs by now but there were other sounds being carried on the back of the wind some easy to interpret others not so easy he could hear the screech of agitated birds which was not too distressing but there were other species giving voice below and he could put a name to none of them well joe eppstadt said you want to close that door or do you want to serve canapes for the rest of your life fuck youve got a gun joe wheres your balls you promise youll get me a part not some stinking little walkon i promiseto do my best for you joe looked over at jerry do you know whats down there just dont look was jerrys advice close the door and come back up dont look into the room even if it seems really amazing why because it is amazing and once youve looked youre going to want to go on looking and if something comes out after me shoot it there said eppstadt satisfied joe turned the proposition over in his head for a few more seconds weighing the gun in his hand as he did so ive been in this fucking town two almost three years havent even got an agent looks like this is your lucky day eppstadt said better be joe replied he drew a deep breath and went out into the hallway eppstadt smiled reassuringly at him as he went by but his features werent made for reassurance in fact at the sight of eppstadts crooked smile joe almost changed his mind then thinking perhaps of what his life had been like so farthe casual contempt heaped on waiters by the famoushe went out to the head of the stairs and looked down reassuringly the door had stopped slamming quite so hard joe took a deep breath then he headed down the flight eppstadt watched him go then he went back to the window the people out there he said to jerry what about them will they have harmed maxine i doubt it they dont want blood they just want to get back into the house why didnt they just push past me theres some kind of trap at the door that keeps them out i got in and out without any problem well youre alive arent you what you heard what i said dont start with the superstitious crap brahms im not in the mood neither am i jerry said i wish i was anywhere but here right now i thought this was your dream palace if katya were here it would be a different matter you dont really think that woman on the beach was katya lupi do you i know it was her for a fact i drove her down to malibu myself what jerry shrugged playing cupid katya lupi and todd pickett crazy its all crazy why because you refuse to believe in ghosts oh i didnt say that eppstadt replied somewhat cautiously i didnt say i didnt believe ive been to gettysburg and felt the presence of the dead but a battlefield is one thing and an old hollywood dreampalace is another why people suffered here believe me a few even took their own lives i dont know why im telling you you know how people suffer here you caused half of it this miserable towns awash with envy and anger you know how cruel la makes people how hungry the word rang a bell eppstadt thought of the face of the woman at the back of the house the appetite in her eyes they might not be the kind of ghosts you think you hear moaning at gettysburg jerry went on but believe me they are very dead and they are very desperate so the sooner we find maxine and sawyer and get out of here the better for all of us oh dear god eppstadt said softly what im starting to believe you then weve made some progress i suppose why didnt you tell me all this before we came up here would it have stopped you coming no you see you needed to see for yourself well ive seen eppstadt said and youre right as soon as joes closed the door well all go out and find maxine and sawyer youre sure those things use the word eppstadt i dont want to for gods sake its just a word all rightghosts are you sure they wont come after us they looked vicious they want to get into the house its as i said thats all they care about they want to get back into the devils country do you know why ive half a notion but i dont fancy sharing it with you shall we not waste time standing around trying to guess what the dead want he returned his gaze to the expanse of green outside the window well all of us know sooner than we care to two at am when the earthquake had shaken los angeles out of its predawn doze tammy had been standing on the nameless street outside katya lupis house in coldheart canyon drawn back to the place with an ease that suggested she had it in her blood now for better or worse she had left the party at the colony a few minutes after the departure of eppstadts expedition having decided that there was little point in her waiting on the beach if todd and katya were still in the water then they were dead by now their corpses carried off by the tide towards hawaii or japan and if by some miracle they had survived then they surely wouldnt go back to maxines house they would head home to the canyon her initial plan was to give up on this whole sorry adventure return to the hotel on wilshire shower change into some fresh clothes and then get the first available flight out of los angeles shed done all she could for todd pickett more than he deserved lord knows and what had she got for her troubles in the end little more than his contempt she wasnt going to put herself in the way of that ever again if she wanted to cause herself pain all she had to do was bang her head against the kitchen door she didnt need to come all the way to los angeles to do that but as she drove back to the hotel fragments of things that shed seen in the canyon and later in the house came back to her images that inspired more awe in her soul than terror she would never get another chance to see such sights this side of the grave certainly should she not take the opportunity to go back one last time if she didnt go now by tomorrow it would be too late the canyon would have found new protections against heror anybody elsesinquiry new charms and mechanisms designed to conceal its raptures from curious eyes and of course there was always the remote possibility that todd had survived the ocean and made his way back up there that more than any other was the strongest reason to return her decision made she drove on up to sunsetforgetting about the shower and change of clothesand made her way back to the canyon no doubt it was foolhardy returning to a place where she had endured so much but besides her desire to see the spectacles of the place one last time an putting aside any hopes she might have for todds survival she could not shake the niggling suspicion that her business at the house was not at an end she had no intellectual justification for such a feeling just a certainty marrowdeep that this was the case shed know when it was over and it was not it had been an eerie drive up the winding canyon road in the predawn gloom she had deliberately switched off her headlights so as to attract as little attention as possible but that made her feel even more vulnerable somehow as though she was not quite real herself here in this canyon of a thousand illusions twice something had moved across the road in front of her its grey form unfixable in the murk she put on the brakes and let the creature cross once she got to the house she realized she was not the first visitor there were two cars already parked outside she was crossing the street to examine the other two when the earthquake hit shed been in earthquakes before but shed never actually been standing so close to the bedrock while one took place it was quite an experience she almost lost control of her bladder as the road idled under her feet and the trees especially the big ones creaked and churned she stood and waited for the first shock wave to pass which seemed an eternity then when her heart had recovered something approximating its natural rhythm she headed towards katya lupis dream palace eppstadt was in the hallway looking down the stairwell it was dark at the bottom but he thought he saw a motion in the darkness like motes of pale dust spiraling around joe he called are you there answer me will you the sound from below had died away the din of beasts was now barely audible all that remained was the sound of the wind which was remarkably consistent lending credence to the notion that what he was hearing was a soundtrack not reality but where the hell had joe got to it was fully five minutes since hed disappeared down the stairs to close the slamming door i wouldnt go down there if i were you eppstadt glanced over his shoulder to see that brahms had forsaken his place at the window and had come into the hallway he doesnt answer me eppstadt said i thought perhaps hed fallen ori dont know the doors still slamming hear it of course i dont suppose you want to go down there and close it for me youre big on delegation arent you do they teach you that in business school its just a door so close it yourself eppstadt threw brahms a sour look or dont leave him down there if thats what your instincts are telling you and if i do put it this way the longer you wait the less chance there is youll ever see him again i should never have sent him down there eppstadt said huh i never thought id hear that from you hear what regret this place is changing you even you im impressed eppstadt didnt reply he simply stared down the long curve of the stairway still hoping hed see joes wellmade face emerging from the shadows but the only motion down there was the dust stirred up by the wind circling on itself joe he yelled there wasnt even an echo from below the bowels of the house seemed to consume the shouted syllable im going upstairs jerry said to see if theres anybody up there is maxine still out back i assume so and if i remember from previous quakes shell stay out there a while she doesnt like being under anything even a table during a quake shell come in when shes ready thanks youre welcome you dont like me do you eppstadt said out of nowhere jerry shrugged hollywoods always had its share of little caligulas so saying he left eppstadt to his dilemma and went on up the stairs he knew the geography of the house pretty well there were three doors that led off the top landing one went to a short passageway which led in turn to a large bedroom with en suite bathroom which had been occupied until his death by marco caputo one was a small writing room and one was the master bedroom with its astonishing view its immense closet and sumptuous if somewhat overwrought bathroom jerry had only been in the master bedroom two or three times but it held fond memories for him memories of being a young man invited in by katya oh shed been beautiful that night it had been like lying in the bed of a goddess hed been too frightened to touch her at first but shed gently persuaded him out of his fears as his life had turned out shed been the only woman hed ever slept with in his early twenties he was certain his queerness was a result of that night no other woman he would tell himself could possibly be the equal of katya lupi but that was just serfjustification hed been born queer and katya was his one grand exception to the rule as he reached the door of the master bedroom there was an aftershock a short jolt no more but enough to set the antiquated chandelier that hung in the turret gently swaying and tinkling again jerry waited for a few moments holding onto the banister waiting to see if there were going to be any more shocks coming immediately upon the heels of this one but there were none he glanced down the stairwell no one was in view then he tried the bedroom door it was locked from the inside there was only one thing to construe from this the room had an occupant or occupants he glanced down at the shiny boards at his feet and saw that there were a few droplets of water on the polished timber it wasnt hard to put the pieces of this puzzle together nor to imagine the scene on the other side of the locked door todd and katya had survived their brush with the pacific they were alive sleeping no doubt in the great bed the voyeur in him would have liked very much to have slid through the closed door and spied on the lovers as they slept both naked todd lying face up on the bed katya pressed to his side she was probably snoring as hed heard her do several times when shed catnapped in his presence he didnt blame katya for her covetousness one iota if being hungry for life meant being hungry for an eternity of nights wrapped in the arms of a man who loved you then that was an entirely understandable appetite and there was just a little part of him which thought that if he stayed loyal to her long enoughif he played his partthen she would let him have a piece of her eternity that she would show him how the years could be made to melt away he retreated from the door and headed downstairs leaving the sleepers to their secret slumber when he got to the midlevel landing eppstadt had gone apparently hed made the decision to do downstairs and look for joe jerry looked over the balcony there was no sound from below the wind had died away to nothing the door was no longer slamming he went from the stairs to the front door which stood ajar perhaps this was his moment to depart he had nothing more to contribute here katya had her man todd had found some measure of peace after his own disappointments what else was there for jerry to do but make his silent farewells and slip away he stood at the front door for two or three minutes unable to make the final break eventually he convinced himself to just linger here a little longer simply to see the look on maxines face when she realized todd was still alive he went back into the kitchen and sat down waitinglike anyone whod spent their time watching other lives rather than having one of their ownto see what happened next eppstadt had been two steps from the bottom of the stairs when the aftershock hit he was by no means an agile man but he leapt the last two steps without a stumble there were ominous growlings in the walls as though several hungry tigers had been sealed up in them this was he knew one of the most foolish places to be caught in an earthquake especially if the aftershock turned out not to be an aftershock at all but a warmup for something bigger it would be more sensiblemuch more sensibleto ascend the stairs again and wait until the tigers had quieted down but he wasnt going to do that hed been sensible for most of his life always taking the safe road the conservative route for once he wanted to play life a little dangerously and take the consequences that said he didnt have to be suicidal there was a doorlintel up ahead hed be safer under there than he was in the open passageway he made a dash for the spot and as he did so the aftershock abruptly ceased he took a deep breath then he glanced over his shoulder into the room behind him presumably this was the place joe had disappeared into there was nowhere else for him to go he went to the door looked inside he could see nothing at first just undivided gloom he reached in as many had done before him to fumble for a light switch and failing to find one allowed a little surge of curiosity to take hold of him hadnt he said to himself he wanted to live a little more riskily well here was his opportunity stepping into this strange room at the bottom of this lunatic house was probably the most foolish thing hed ever done and he knew it a cold wind came to greet him it caught hold of his elbow and drew him over the threshold into the worldyes it was a worldinside he looked up at the heavens at that threequarter blinded sun at the high herringbone clouds that he remembered puzzling over as a child wondering what it was that laid them out so carefully so prettily a star fell earthward and he followed its arc with his eyes until it burned itself out somewhere over the trees far off many miles beyond the dark mass of the forest he could see the sea glittering this was not the pacific he could see the ships that moved upon it were like something from an errol flynn flick the sea hawk or some such hed loved those movies as a kid and the ships in them especially the ships it was twentysix seconds since the man from paramount whod spent his professional life keeping the dreamy superstitious child in him silenced by pretending a fine highminded superiority to all things that smelt of greasepaint and midnight hokum had entered the devils country and had lost himself in it come on dont be afraid the wind from the sea whispered in his ear and in he went all cynicism wiped from his mind by the memory of wheeling ships beneath a painted sky still young enough to believe he might grow up a hero three todd stirred from a state closer to a stupor than a sleep he was lying on the immense bed of the master bedroom in the house in coldheart canyon katya was lying beside him her little body gathered into a tight knot pressed close to him one arm was beneath him the other on top as though shed never let him go of him again she was snoring in her sleep as she had been that day hed found her in her bedroom at the guesthouse the human touch it was more eloquent now than ever given what theyd gone through together there had been some terrifying moments for them both in the last few hours fragments of them played in todds head as he slowly extricated himself from her embrace and slid slowly out of the bed first thered been that breathsnatching moment when hed turned his back on the malibu house and headed out into the dark waters of the pacific with katya hed never been so frightened in his life but then shed squeezed his hand and looked around at him her hair blowing back from her face showing off the glory of her bones and hed thought even if i die now i will have been the luckiest man in creation i will have had this woman by my side at the end who could ask for more than that it hadnt been quite so easy to hold on to those feelings of gratitude in the chaotic minutes that followed once they were out of their depth and in the grip of the great pacific the bittersweet joy of what they were doing became a shared instinctive attempt to survive in the dark bruising waters fifty yards out and the big waves the surfers waves started to pick them up and drop them down again into their lightless troughs it was so dark he could barely see katyas face but he heard her choking on seawater coughing like a frightened little girl and suddenly the idea of just dying out here beaten to death by the waves didnt seem so attractive why not try to live he found himself thinking not the kind of life hed had before but some other kind of life travelling around the world perhaps incognito just the two of them that wouldnt be so bad would it and when they were bored with travel they could find some sunny beach down in costa rica and spend every day there drunk amongst the parrots there they could wait out the years until the big glossy world hed once given a shit for had forgotten he even existed all these thoughts came in flashes none of them really coherent the only thought that took any real shape was the means by which they could escape this dark water alive were going to dive he yelled to katya take a deep breath he heard her do so then before another pulverizing wave could come along and knock them out he drove them both into a teetering wall of water diving deep into the placid heart of the wave they must have done this half a hundred times diving down rising up again gasping then watching for the next monstrous wall to be almost upon them before diving again it was a desperate trick but it worked it was dearly preventing them from getting a terrible beating but it was steadily taking its toll on their energies he knew they couldnt continue to defy the violence of the water for very much longer their muscles were aching their senses were becoming unreliable it would only be a matter of time before the force of the water got the better of them and they sank together defeated by sheer fatigue but they had counted without the benign collusion of the tide which all this time had been slowly bearing them south andas it did sohad been also ushering them back towards the shore the tumult of waters around them began to die down and after a few minutes their toes began to brush some of the taller coral towers a few minutes later they had solid ground beneath their feet and a few minutes after that they were stumbling ashore at venice for five minutes or so they lay on the dark sand together spitting up water and coughing and then eventually finding it in them to laugh and catch each others hands against all the odds theyd survived i guess wewe werent readyto die todd gasped i suppose so katya said she dragged her head over the sand to put her lips in reach of his it wasnt a kiss so much as a sharing of breath they lay there mouth to mouth until katyas teeth began to chatter we have to get you back to the canyon he said hauling himself to his knees the lights of the venice boardwalk seemed impossibly remote i cant she said yes you can were going home were going back to the canyon youll feel stronger and warmer once were walking i promise he helped her get to her knees and then practically lifted her to her feet arms around one another they stumbled towards the boardwalk where the usual touristtrap entertainments were still going on despite the lateness of the hour they wove between the people unrecognized and in a back street todd found a kid with a beaten up pinto to whom he offered three hundred waterlogged bucks if hed take them back home and another three hundred dry if he promised not to mention what hed done and where hed been to anyone i know who you are the kid said no you dont todd said snatching the three hundred back from the kids hand okay okay i dont the kid replied gently reclaiming the money you gotta deal todd knew that there wasnt much chance that the drivers promise would last very long but they had no choice in the matter they made their makeshift chauffeur close all the windows and turn up the heating and they clung together in the back of the car trying to get some warmth back into their blood todd got him to drive as fast as the vehicle was capable of going and twenty minutes later he was directing the kid up the winding road into coldheart canyon ive never been up here before the kid said when they were outside the house katya leaned in and stared at him no she said and you never will again something about the way she said it made the kid feel very nervous okay okay he said just give me the rest of the money todd went inside for another three hundred dollars in dry bills and a few minutes later the guy drove off six hundred bucks the richer and none the wiser while todd and katya dragged themselves up the turret stairs to the master bedroom sloughing off their cold damp clothes as they crept towards the bed theyd thought theyd never see again it took todd a long time to get across the bedroom to the closet his body ached to his marrow and his thoughts were as sluggish as his body only as he was pulling on a clean pair of jeans did he realize there were voices in the house shit he murmured to himself he decided not to wake katya instead he would try to get rid of these people himself without unleashing her righteous fury on them he went back into the bedroom despite the hullabaloo from below katya showed no sign of waking this was all to the good she was obviously hearing the hurts of recent days he lingered at the bedside studying her peaceful features the seawater had washed every trace of rouge or mascara from her face she could have been a fifteenyearold lying there dreaming innocent dreams of course that innocence was an illusion he knew what she was capable of and there was a corner of his brain that never completely ceased warning him of that fact but then hadnt she come to the beach to save him who else would have done that except perhaps for tammy all anybody had ever done for him was use him and as soon as theyd got what theyd needed theyd moved on but katya had proved she was made of more loyal stuff shed been ready to go all the way with him to death if necessary so what if she was cruel what if she had committed crimes that would have had her behind bars if anybody knew about them her sins mattered very little to him right now what mattered was how shed taken his hand as theyd turned their back on the lights of the beach and faced the dark waters of the pacific and how hard shed struggled to keep holding onto it however much the tide had conspired to divorce them the voices below had quieted he pulled on a white tshirt and went to the door as he did so there was a small earthquake the door rattled in its frame it was a short jolt and he guessed it was probably an aftershock if so then perhaps what had woken him in the first place was the big shaker why else would he have woken he was still very much in need of sleep god knows nothing would have given him more pleasure than to strip off his jeans and tshirt and crawl back into bed beside katya for another three or four hours of blissful slumber but he could scarcely do that with a search party in the house he heard eppstadts voice amongst the exchanges fuck him it was typical that the little prick would get his nose in their business sooner or later todd had hoped that he and katya would get some quiet time together to plan their next move to search the house for incriminating evidence of scandal and destroy it then to hide in the depths of the canyon until the investigators were satisfied that there was nothing here worth investigating and left taking eppstadt and whoever the hell else was here back with him but eppstadt had ruined that hope before these interlopers left they were going to search every damn room no doubt of that the master bedroom included he was going to need to find a way to spirit katya and himself out of the house and away before they came looking he listened at the door and then very gingerly unlocked it and opened it an inch he could hear an exchange from below which seemed to be led by eppstadt jesusof all people to be up here amongst katyas mysteries mister bottomline himself gary eppstadt there was no sign of an opinion from maxine which was unusual she was normally vocal in any debate however little she knew about the subject then todd remembered her phobia about quakes she always fled for the open air at the first sign of a trembler and no doubt shed done exactly that he was tempted to go onto the balcony and see if he could spot her in the back yardjust to see the bitch in a state of agitationbut there wasnt time there was too much going on downstairs he ventured out of the bedroom a step and peered over the rail in time to see somebodyit was a young man either a waiter brought from the party or one of maxines new boys heading down the spiral into the darkness down there where a door was banging next he heard footsteps and felt certain that eppstadt was about to appear from the kitchen door before he was spotted todd slid back into the bedroom and gently closed the door it made a barely perceptible click certainly nothing audible with so much else going on in the vicinity he knew what that banging door was all about the earthquake had thrown open the door to the devils country and it looked as though eppstadt had convinced some dope to go down and close it idiots didnt they have any instincts didnt something whisper at the back of their heads that when a door slammed in this house you let it slam you let it slam till it chose to stop what you didnt do was head on down the stairs to close it that was suicide or the next best thing he put his head around the corner and peered into the bedroom katya was still fast asleep he briefly contemplated waking her then thought better of it all her life shed had men following her around asking what they should do next he wasnt going to be numbered amongst them no he would deal with this on his own after all the house was going to be his home as much as it was hers his word should be law here he just had to work out how best to proceed and without a shot of espresso to quicken his sluggish thoughts it might take a while no matter the answer would come to him in time he sat with his back against the wall and tried to put out of his head the image of the innocent stranger heading down the spiral staircase to close the door to the devils country four todd stayed put behind the door for several minutes his thoughts describing vague circles in truth he was still hoping that it would not take any action on his part to fix the problem the preferable solution would be this somebody would encounter something that would raise the paniclevel in the house and there would be a mass exodus perhaps it was too much to hope for but every other option required a higher degree of wit than he possessed in his present exhausted state he finally got up from behind the door and returned through the bedroom past his sleeping beauty to the balcony he stepped out the dull dawn had ushered in a dull day later perhaps the marine layer would burn off and theyd have some sun but for now the sky was a wall of dead cloud he looked down into the greenery hoping to spot maxine but the thickness of the jungle all around the houseespecially the gigantic birdofparadise treesmade it virtually impossible to see very much and then out of the corner of his eye he glimpsed a motion somebody was running through the thicket throwing panicked backward glances as he went it wasnt maxine it was her assistant sawyer whod been with her for the last three years he wasnt any more than thirty but hed let his body get out of shape too many hurried lunches snatched because maxine had more work for him than he could ever possibly finish too much afterwork socializing knocking back his single malts and beluga at fancy premieres not to mention the bavarian cremefilled donuts he would bring into the office in boxes of six to help him through his day with a welltimed sugar rush thanks to the donuts and hamburgers and his neat scotches he couldnt run very fast and he certainly couldnt yell for help while he was running he didnt have enough breath for both all he could do was sob between gasps throwing panicking glances over his shoulder his pursuers were closing on him todd could see the bushes thrashing around immediately behind him and something elsesomething smaller and more nimblewas throwing itself from branch to branch overhead to keep up with its quarry mmaxmaxine he managed to get out in between gasps im over here maxine yelled sawyer im at the cages todd followed the sound of maxines voice and located her she was a considerable distance from the house and had clambered up on top of one of a series of cages there she was kneeling with a gun in her hand shed always kept guns around the house todd knew but this was the first occasion hed seen her using one keep following my voice she yelled to sawyer look for a tree with bright yellow flowers like big bells im looking sawyer sobbed from his vantage point on the balcony todd felt like a caesar at the coliseum watching the lions and the christians he could see the christians perfectly clearly and nowas the gap between the pursuer and the pursued closedhe began to glimpse the lions too in the bushes no more than a yard or two behind sawyer was one of deads children a foul hybrid of ghost woman andof all thingsjaguar the latter must have been a prisoner in katyas menagerie but the marriage of anatomies had turned its sleek perfection into something rougher uglier and entirely more bizarre the human element had been female no doubt of that the facewhen todd glimpsed itwas twothirds humanoid the high cheekbones the icy stare it was surely the face of lana turner then the creature opened its mouth and the bestial third showed itself vast teeth top and bottom a mottled throat a black tongue it let out a very unladylike roar and pounced on sawyer who threw himself out of its path with inches to spare are you okay maxine yelled all that sawyer could manage was no are you close to me maxine said i cant see you he cried the branches over his head were shaking violently look for the yellow flowers yellowflowers it would have been easy for todd to direct sawyer through this maze but that would have taken all the fun out of it better to keep his silence and let the man find his own way it was the kind of game he knew katya would love he was tempted to wake her but it would be over in the next few seconds he guessed sawyer was a few yards from the cages and safety having failed to catch its victim on its first pounce the lana as todd had mentally dubbed the creature had returned to her stalking todd caught glimpses of her mottled back as she slid through the thicket her intentions were clear at least from todds point of view she was moving to cut sawyer off from the gallery of cages sawyer and maxine kept a banal exchange going meanwhile so that sawyer could find his way to her youre getting louder am i sure you see the yellow flowers yet yeah i see them youre really close im under them he stopped talking because he heard the low growl of the lana todd could hear the creature too though he couldnt see it he silently willed sawyer not to make any sudden moves just stand still shut up and maybe the animal would lose interest sawyer could stand still without any problem but could he shut up no he could not sawyer was a gabber oh god maxine oh god its close to me shush maxine advised he stopped talking but it was too late the lana knew exactly where sawyer was positioned she launched herself out of the thicket striking sawyer so that he fell sideways through the very patch of yellow flowers which had been his beacon he was now in view of maxine who yelled to him to get up get up quickly he started to do so but the breath had been knocked out of him by the blow and before he could get to his knees the creature was on him a second time her claws digging deep into the mass of his shouldermuscle from her perch on the cage maxine was attempting to get a clear shot but it would have been difficult for anyone however sophisticated their skill with guns to put a bullet in the animal and not wound sawyer in the process but maxine was ready to give it a try shed been taking lessons from an excop from the lapd for several months she knew to keep a steady hand and her eye fixed on the target sawyer couldnt have moved if his life had depended upon it the creature had him held in a deathgrip maxine fired the sound was sharp in the still air of the canyon like a whipcrack it echoed off the other wall of the canyon the blow of the bullet throwing sawyers attacker off her victim she lay this notsodistant relation to the exquisite miss turner on the ground beside sawyer whom shed loosed as soon as she was hit blood ran copiously from them both mingling on the ground between them get up maxine said to sawyer it was good advice the lana was still alive her breathing quick and shallow sawyer wasnt so badly injured that he failed to realize the danger he was still in he rolled away from his attacker and started to get to his feet as he did so the creature suddenly sat up beside him and opening her sizeable jaws lunged she took a chunk from sawyers leg twisting her head to take away the bulk of his calf he screamed and fell forward onto his hands maxine had a clear shot at the beast and took it but her second shot was not as efficient as her first it struck the creatures shoulder passing through the muscle without appearing to significantly slow the animal which threw itself on top of sawyer as though she were attempting to mount him seconds later the lana opened her mouth and sank her teeth into the bones of sawyers skull the mans sobs ceased instantly and what little strength his limbs had possessed fled he hung beneath the lanas body like a zebras corpse from the jaws of a lion glassyeyed and lifeless todd heard maxine say oh christoh christ but the horror wasnt over with yet the creature apparently wanted to get her teeth into her wounder because having dispatched sawyer she let the body drop from her jaws and began to move towards the cage on which maxine was crouched even in her hurt state there was no doubt that she had the physical power to get up onto the cage and attack maxine in fact the wounds she had sustained didnt seem to be hurting her that much her hybrid face carried a look that was somewhere between an animal snarl and a human smile maxine didnt hesitate taking a bead on the animal she fired the bullet struck the creature in the middle of her face taking out the flat nose and the top half of the mouth for one long moment she seemed not to comprehend the fatal damage she had sustained she lifted her front leg which ended in a hand which erupted into claws towards her face almost as though she intended to explore the damage she had sustained but before her corrupted limb could reach her face the creatures system closed down and she fell forward dead there had been a good deal of motion in the foliage throughout this episode todd had the sense that there were several other creatures watching to see how this proceeded before they showed their own faces now with the death of lana the thicket was still nothing moved nothing breathed the only sound todd could hear was the very soft sound of maxine saying oh god to herself over and over she quickly got control of her horror and her fear and started to clamber down off the cage where shed been perched todd was halftempted to call down to her to offer some word of encouragement but he refrained from doing so for one thing he didnt want to admit that hed stood as a spectator to this whole drama second he was afraid of distracting maxine while she was down there certainly her killing of the creature had silenced its brethren in the thicket but their silence didnt mean theyd given up their stalking they were simply sitting in the shadows waiting for maxine to make a mistake when no doubt they would fall upon her in a vengeful mob thus keeping his silence todd watched maxine make her way between the cages glancing back at the house constantly as though she was trying to find a path that would lead her back to safety but was at present only able to find one that ran parallel to the house she was now thirty or forty yards from the cages which was a good thing because that meant she couldnt see what was happening on the walkway beneath them a minute or two after her exit a few of lanas family members appeared from the thicket whereas todd had knowntheyd been waiting now about six of them came out of hiding they had no interest in the corpse of their sibling it was sawyer they wanted surrounding his body they began to play with the corpse like children with some gruesome toy they tore off his clothes and bit off his penis and balls they followed that by biting off fingers knuckle by knuckle and spitting the pieces out they seemed to take infantile pleasure in the mess they were making todd was horribly disgusted by the spectacle but he kept watching until they were finished with the fingers and began to disembowel the man only then did he retreat from the balcony railing and go back inside it would not necessarily be easy for maxine to find her way back up to the house he realized many of the pathways were overgrown and in her present no doubt panicked state of mind she could easily lose her way and keep on losing it he would have to go outside and find her katya was still sleeping the shots hadnt even stirred her indeed she seemed to have scarcely moved so profound was her slumber her hand was still up at her mouth limply curled round on itself he kissed her saw that this did not wake her either and left her to her slumbers five eppstadt was in the devils country a fine drizzle almost a mist was drooping from the bloated clouds it came in soft waves against his face cooling his flushed skin if he doubted the reality of this place its chill seemed designed to undo his doubt he hated the idea that what he was witnessing was real doing so violated all his logical faculties but what was the alternative that hed slipped and fallen and was now lying at the bottom of the stairs in a semicomatose state imagining all this it was a pretty solution but as he had no way of knowing whether it was true or not his only option was to find joe and get the hell out of here before the place began to get even crazier than it already was the less he knew about this countrythe less its grotesqueries lodged in his psychethe happier the rest of his life would surely be with that thought he began a three hundred and sixty degree scanning of the landscape calling joes name as he did so his din was enough to stir life in the bushes and trees he felt himself watched by several species of unlikely animal their eyes huge and luminous their postures and in some cases the details of the physiognomies vaguely human as though this twilight world had witnessed all kinds of criminal couplings finally he heard a response from joe whos there eppstadt come over here quickly you gotta help me he followed the sound of the mans shouting there was a small copse ahead and joe had clambered a few feet into a tree by means of a crude wooden ladder which had been propped against one of the trunks what the hell are you doing eppstadt wanted to know joe simply repeated his plea you gotta help me theres no time joe eppstadt said youve got to come back with me right now christ i sent you down to close the door whyd you come in for the same reason you did joe said i couldnt believe what i was seeing are you going to help me or not eppstadt had pressed his way into the midst of the thicket as he and joe spoke snagging his suit on the briars that grew in profusion here several times as he did so the tableau that now came into view appalled him there was a man crucified amongst the higher branches of the tree joe had climbed the deed done with both rope and nails joe had already managed to remove a couple of the nails and was now pulling at the knotted rope with his teeth he was desperate to get the man down from the tree and he had reason the branches around the mans head were bustling with birds the devils countrys version of carrioncrows bigger crueler versions theyd clearly made several assaults on the mans face already there were deep gouges around the victims sockets where the birds had gone after his eyes blood from the wounds poured down his face he might have resembled christ but for the brightness of his blond hair which fell in dirty curls to his shoulders i need a stone joe yelled down at eppstadt what for just find me a fucking stone will you eppstadt didnt like to take ordersespecially from a waiterbut he saw the urgency of the situation and did as he was asked looking around until he laid his hands on a long sharp stone which he passed on up to joe from his perch on the ladder joe took aim at the closest of the carrion crows it was a good throw the stone struck the most ambitious of the flockwho had apparently decided to come in for the killand messily smashed open the birds head but its companions did not fly off as joe had hoped they simply retreated up the tree a branch or two squawking in fury and frustration while the dead bird dropped from the perch as if awoken from a grateful sleep by the din of the birds the crucified man raised his head and opened his mouth a black snake no thicker than a babys thumb slid out from between his lips in a thin gruel of blood spittle and bile the snake dangled from the mans lower lip for a few moments hooked by its tail then it fell to the ground a foot from eppstadt he stepped away in disgust throwing a backward glance at the door just to reassure himself that his means of escape from this insanity was still in view it was but the snake had changed his perspective on this mercy mission the guys on the way out eppstadt said to joe you cant do anything for him we can still get him down and im telling you hes beyond help joe look at him there did indeed seem little purpose in laboring to depose the man he was obviously close to death his eyes had rolled back beneath fluttering eyelids showing nothing but white he was attempting to say something but his mind and his tongue were beyond the complex business of speech you know what eppstadt said glancing around the landscape this is a setup there were indeed dozens of hiding places for potential attackershuman or animalwithin fifty yards of them rocks holes thicket we should just get the hell out of here before whoever did this to him tries the same on us leave him you mean yes leave him joe just shook his head he had succeeded in getting this far and wasnt going to give up now he pulled on the rope that held the mans right hand the arm fell free blood pattered on the leaves over eppstadts head like a light rain im almost done joe said joe i get ready joe said again leaning across the victims body to untie the other hand youre going to have to catch him he warned eppstadt i cant do that well who else is going to do it joe snapped eppstadt wasnt paying attention however hed heard a noise behind him and now he turned to find that a freakish child naked and runty had appeared from somewhere and was looking up at him weve got company he said to joe who was still struggling to free the crucified mans other hand when eppstadt looked back at the freak it had approached a few steps and eppstadt had a clearer view of it there was something goatish in the genepool eppstadt decided the childs bandy legs were sheathed with dirtyyellow fur and his eyes were yellowgreen from beneath the pale dome of his belly there jutted a sizeable erection which was out of all proportion to the rest of his body he fingered it idly while he watched why are you taking the man down he said to joe then getting no answer from joe directed the same question at eppstadt hes in pain was all eppstadt could find to say though the phrase scarcely seemed to match the horror of the victims persecution thats the way my mother wants him the goatboy said your mother lilith he said pronouncing the word as two distinct syllables she is the queen of hell and i am her son if youre her son eppstadt said playing along for time until a better way to deal with this absurdity occurred then it follows yesshe would be your mother and she had him put up there so i could see him the goatboy replied the head of his pecker echoing his own head in its infuriated nodding the angrier he became the more the evidence of his extreme inbreeding surfaced he had a hairlip which made his outrage harder to understand and his nosewhich was scarcely more than two gaping wet holes in his face ran with cataharral fluids his teeth when he bared them were overlapped in half a dozen places and his eyes were slightly crossed in short he was an abomination the only perfect piece of anatomy hed inherited that monstrous member between his legs which had lost some of its hardness now and hung like a rubber club between his roughhaired legs im going to tell my mother about you he said stabbing a stunted forefinger in eppstadts direction that man is a crinimal a crinimal eppstadt said with a supercilious smirk the idiotchild couldnt even pronounce the word correctly yes the goatboy said and hes supposed to hang there till the birds fluck out his eyes and the dogs eat out his end tails entrails end tails all right have it your way end tails i want you to leave him up there during this brief exchange eppstadts gaze had been drawn to the goatboys left foot the nail of his middle toe had not been clipped since birth now it looked more like a claw than a nail it was six perhaps seven inches long and stained dark brown who the hell are you talking to joe yelled down from the top of the ladder the density of the foliage made it impossible for him to see the goatboy apparently hes up there as a punishment joe better leave him there who told you that joe came down the ladder far enough to have sight of the goatboy that the boy bared his teeth at joe a dribble of dark saliva came from the corner of his mouth and ran down onto his chest i really think we should just get going eppstadt said not until this poor sonofabitch is down from here joe said returning up the ladder fucking freak this isnt our business joe eppstadt said there was something about the way the air was rolling around them something about the way the clouds churned overhead covering the already depleted light of the sun that made eppstadt fearful that something of real consequence was in the offing he didnt know what this place was or how it was created nor at that moment did he care he just wanted to be out through the door and upstairs again help me joe yelled to him eppstadt went to the bottom of the ladder and peered up the crucified man had dropped forward over joes broad shoulder even in his semicomatose state he could still beg for some show of compassion please he murmured i meant no offense he wouldnt fuck my mother said the goatboy by way of explanation for this atrocity he was just a foot or two behind eppstadt staring up at joe and the man he was attempting to save he turned briefly surveyed the sky the wind was getting gusty again slamming the door and then throwing it open shes coming the goatboy said smell that bitterness in the air eppstadt could indeed smell something strong enough to make his eyes water thats her the goatboy said thats lilith shes bitter like that even her milk he made an ugly face it used to make me puke and me i love to suckle i love it he was getting hard again talking himself into a fine little fever he put his thumb in his mouth and pulled hard on it making a loud noise as he did so he was every inch an irritating little child excepting those inches where he was indisputably a man id put him back if i were you he said pushing past eppstadt to stand at the bottom of the ladder eppstadts gaze returned to the heavens the sky was the colour of cold iron and the bitterness the child had said was his mothers stench was getting stronger with every gust of the cold wind eppstadt looked off into the distance to see if there was any sign of an arrivee on the winding road but they were almost deserted the only person on any of the roads right now was a man some two or three miles away who was lying sprawled his head against a stone eppstadt had no logical reason to believe this but he was somehow certain the man was dead his brains spattered on the stone where he lay his head otherwise the landscape was empty of human occupants there were plenty of birds in the air struggling against the increasingly violent gusts to reach the safety of their roosts and small animals rabbits and the like scampering through the roiling grass to find some place of safety eppstadt was no natureboy but he knew enough to be certain that when rabbits were making for their boltholes it was time for human beings to get out of harms way weve got to go he said to joe youve done all you can not yet joe yelled the wind was strong enough to make even the heavy branches of the tree sway dead leaves were shaken down all around for gods sake joe what the fuck is wrong with you he took a step up the ladder and caught hold of joes belt then he tugged youre coming or im going without you then go joe began to say he didnt finish because at that instant the ladder which was presently bearing the weight of eppstadt joe the samaritan and the crucified man broke eppstadt was closest to the ground so he sustained the least damage he simply fell back in the sharp stones in which the copse and its briar thicket were rooted he scrambled to his feet to find out what had happened to the other two men both had fallen amongst the thorns the crucified man spreadeagled on top of joe only now were the mans wounds fully displayed besides the peckings around his eyes there were far deeper woundscertainly not made by birdsin his chest somebody had had some fun with him before he was nailed up there cutting starpatterns around his nipples joe struggled to get himself out from under the man but his flailing only served to catch him in the thorns help me he said throwing his hand back over his head towards eppstadt quickly im being pricked to death here eppstadt approached the thicket and was about to take hold of joes hand when two of the largest wounds on the crucified mans chest gaped and the flat black heads of two snakes each ten times the size of the serpent that had slipped out of his throat pressed their bloodsoaked snouts out of the layers of flesh and yellow fat and came slithering out of his torso one of them trailed a multitude of what eppstadt took to be eggs suspended in a jellied mass of semitranslucent phlegm eppstadt stepped away from the thicket and from joe the serpents crisscrossed as they emerged their beady white eyes seeking out some new warm place to nest are you going to help me or not joe said eppstadt simply shook his head eppstadt joe wept for gods sake get me out eppstadt had no intention of getting any closer to the snakes than he already was but the goatboy had no such scruples he pushed past eppstadt and grabbed hold of joes outstretched hand his strength like his member was out of all proportion to his size one good haul and he had joe halfway freed from the thorn bushes joe screamed as his back was scored by the thorns which had been pressed deep into his flesh by the weight of the man on top of him ah now shut up the goatboy yelled over joes complaints hanging out of the thicket poor joe looked halfdead the pain had made him vomit and it was running from the side of his mouth his demands had become pitiful sobs in the space of a few seconds horrified though he wasand guilty too eppstadt still couldnt bring himself to intervene not with the snakes raising their heads from the body in which theyd nested still eager for another victim ignoring joes weak protests the goatboy pulled on him a second time and then a third which was the charm joe fell free of the thicket landing heavily on his pierced back sheer agony lent him the strength to throw himself over onto his stomach his back was nearly naked the violence of the goatboys haulings had torn open his shirt he lay face down in the dirt retching again thatll teach you the goatboy said playing with crinimals you should get some of your own while he was addressing joe in this witless fashion eppstadt chanced to look up at the man still sprawled on the bed of thorns the two snakes had slithered over his chest and were now entwined around his neck he was too close to death to even register this last assault he simply lay there eyelids fluttering over sightless eyes while the life was throttled out of him see that the goatboy said so much for you and your tricks now i lost my toy and your little friend is dead why couldnt you stay out of it huh he was mine the boys fury had him jumping up and down now mine mine mine and suddenly he was up on joes back dancing a tarantella on the mess of thorns and wounds and blood mine mine mine it was a show of petulance no more nor less joe rolled over and threw the boy off then he started to get to his feet but before he could do so the goatboy came at him his step still reminiscent of some peculiar little dance get up eppstadt yelled to joe not certain what the goatboy was up to but certain it was mischief quickly despite his agonized state joe started to push himself off his knees as he did so the goatboy made a high slashing kick joes hand went up to his neck and he fell back in the dirt the foot which had struck joe was the one with the long middle nail and what had looked to eppstadt like a glancing blow had in fact slashed open joes windpipe both joes hands were at his neck now as blood and air escaped his throat he turned his gaze towards eppstadt for a moment as though the head of paramount might know why joe was lying in the dirt of a place he couldnt even name while his last breath whined out between his fingers then the look of incomprehension went out of his eyes to be replaced with a blank stare his hands dropped away from his neck the whining sound died away and he rolled forward all the while the goatboy went on dancing out of pure pleasure eppstadt didnt move he was afraid to draw the murderers attention but then the boy seemed to take it into his halfwitted head to go find some other plaything and without looking back at eppstadt again he ran off leaving joe dead in the dirt and the man whod come to save him alone in the darkening air six tammy had come into the house cautiously not at all certain what she was going to find in fact what she found was jerry brahms he was standing in the hallway looking down the stairwell his face ashenexcept where it was bloody from his fallhis hands trembling before he could get a word out of his mouth there came a din of shrieks from below whos down there tammy asked jerry some boy we came up here with from maxines party a waiter and eppstadt and god knows what else wheres maxine shes outside she fled into the backyard when the earthquake hit there were more noises from below and then a rush of wind coming up the stairwell tammy peered down into the darkness there was somebody down at the very bottom lying on the floor she studied the figure it moved wait a minute she said half to herself thats zeffer it was it was zeffer and he was alive there was blood all over him but he was definitely alive she went to the top of the stairs hed heard her calling his name and his shining eyes had found her were fixed on her she started down the stairs i wouldnt go down there brahms warned her i know she replied but thats a friend of mine she glanced up at brahms as she took her second step there was a look of mild astonishment on his face she wasnt sure why was it because people didnt have friends in this godforsaken house or because she was going down the stairs despite the cold dead smell on the wind zeffer was doing his best to push himself up off his stomach but he didnt have the strength to do it wait she called to him im coming she picked up her speed to get to him once she reached the bottom she tried not to look towards the door through which hed crawled but she could feel the wind gusting through it there was a spatter of rain in that wind it pricked her face listen to me zeffer murmured she knelt beside him wait let me turn you over she did her best to roll him over so he wouldnt be face to the ground and managed to lift him so that his head was on her lap though his lower body was still halftwisted around he didnt seem to notice he seemed in fact to be beyond comfort or discomfort in a dreamy state which was surely the prelude to death it was astonishing that hed survived this long given the wounding hed sustained but then perhaps he had the power of the devils country to thank for that now she said what do you want to tell me the horsemen he said theyre coming for the devils child horsemen yes the dukes men gogas men tammy listened zeffer was right she could hear hooves on the wind or in the ground or both they sounded uncomfortably close can they get out she asked zeffer i dont know probably his eyes closed lazily and for a terrible moment she feared shed lost him but they opened again after a time and his gaze fixed on her his hands reached up and took hold of tammys arm though his grip was feeble i think its time the dead came in dont you he said to her his voice was so softened by weakness she was not sure shed heard it right at first the dead she said he nodded yes all the ghosts outside in the canyon they want to come into the house and weve kept them out all these years yes but he shook his head as if to say dont interrupt me i dont have time you have to let them in he told her but theyre afraid of something tammy said i know the threshold remember how i told you i went back to romania of course i found one of the brotherhood there a friend of father sandrus he taught me a method of keeping the dead from coming into your house what you have to do is undo what i did and in theyll come believe me in theyll come how she said if time was so short and he was so certain why waste a breath on argument go into the kitchen and get a knife he told her a strong knife one thats not going to break on you then go to the back door and dig in the threshold the threshold the wood frame you step over to go outside there are five icons in the wood ancient romanian symbols and all i have to do is remove them you just remove them the dead will be ready as soon as the threshold is clear theyve waited a very long time for this been very patient he allowed himself the smallest of smiles as he spoke dearly the prospect of the dead invading the house pleased him will you do this for me tammy of course if thats what you want its whats right then ill do it of course ill do it you only need open one door theyll all find their way in i suggest the back door because its rotting the threshold will be easier to he stopped his lips drawn back from his teeth in a grimace the wound was taking its terrible toll fresh blood came between his fingers you dont need to tell me any more she told him you just lie quietly ill go get some help no he said you need help no he said again shaking his head just get to work are you sure yes this is more important all right ill she was about to repeat her reassurance when she realized hed stopped breathing his eyes were still open and there was still a lively gloss in them but no life there nothing william zeffers long and agonizing life was at an end on the floor above jerry looked up as the door to the master bedroom opened and todd emerged hello jerry he said as he started down the stairs you got hurt i fell during the quake we need to get outside and find maxine really shes lost out there and sawyers dead im afraid if somebody doesnt get to her i heard the shouts jerry said vaguely looking and sounding like a man whod lost all interest in the drama that was being played out around him who else is here todd asked him eppstadts downstairs with some kid he brought from the party yes i saw him is he one of maxines new superstars no hes just a waiter jerry said todd looked down the rest of the flight there was a body at the bottom of the stairs and somebody else a woman bent over touching the face of the dead man with great gentility she closed the dead mans eyes then she looked up the stairwell hello todd she said hello tammy i thought you were drowned sorry to disappointment you he started down the stairs towards her she turned her face from him returning her gaze to the body did you see eppstadt he asked her as he came down the flight you mean that sonofabitch from the studio yes that sonofabitch yes i saw him she glanced up at todd there were tears in her eyes but she didnt want to shed them in front of him not after what had happened on the beach hed been so horribly careless of her feelings she wasnt going to show any vulnerability now if she could help it where did he go todd asked her as if there was much choice in the matter she nodded down the passageway towards the door to the devils country he went in there i think i didnt see it jerry told me how long ago i dont know she said iand frankly i dont really care right now todd put his hand on tammys shoulder im sorry this is a bad time i never was very good expressing my feelings is that supposed to mean youre sorry she said yeah he replied the word hardly shaped more like a grunt than an apology she made the tiniest shrug of her shoulder to get him to take his hand off her which he did there was so much she wanted to say to him but this was neither the time nor the place to say it he got the message she didnt have to look back to see that hed gone she heard his footsteps as he headed off down the passageway only after ten or fifteen seconds did she look up and by that time he was stepping through the door suddenly the tears shed held back broke a chaotic cluster of feelings battling to surface all at once gratitude that todd was alive sorrow that zeffer was dead anger that todd had no better way to show his feelings than to grunt at her that way didnt he know how much hed hurt her here the voice at her shoulder was that of jerry brahms he was offering her a cleanly pressed handkerchief a rather oldfashioned gesture but very much appreciated at that particular moment which one are you crying over she wiped her tears from her eyes because if its todd he went on i wouldnt bother hell survive this and go on and forget all of us thats the kind of man he is you think so im sure of it she wiped her nose sniffed what was he talking to you about jerry asked he wanted to know about eppstadt not todd zeffer oh hehe had something he wanted me to do for him she wasnt sure she wanted to share zeffers proposal with jerry this was a world filled with people who had extremely complicated allegiances suppose jerry out of some misplaced loyalty to katya tried to stop her it was perfectly possible that he might try but then how the hell did she get rid of him so that she could go upstairs and do what she had to do one obvious way presented itself although it was playing with fire if she went to the door of the devils country jerry would probably follow her the place had a way of holding your attention she knew and if it held his for long enough then she could slip away upstairs into the kitchen find a knife go to the threshold and get to work it wasnt her favourite plan but she had no alternative to hand at that moment and she needed to act quickly without saying anything she got up and walked off down the passageway towards the door the wind came out to meet her like an eager host ready to slip its arms through hers and invite her in she didnt need to look over her shoulder to know that jerry was coming after her he was talking to her just a step behind i dont think you should go any further he said why not i just want to see whats in here everybody talks about it i think im the only one who hasnt actually seen it properly for myself as she spoke she realized that there was more truth to this than she was strictly admitting of course she wanted to see her little plot to lure jerrys attention away was also a neat opportunity to excuse her own curiosity talk about muddied allegiances she had some of her own one more glimpse into that other world was on her own subconscious agenda for some reason its not good to look in there for too long jerry said i know that she replied a little testily ive been in there but another peek cant hurt can it i mean can it shed reached the door and without further debate with brahms pushed it open and stared at the landscape before her with eyes that had recently been washed with tears everything was in perfect focus and it was beautiful she didnt hesitate to debate the matter with her conscience brahms or god in heaven she just stepped out of the passageway and followed where todd had gone just a couple of minutes before seven it wasnt difficult for todd to find eppstadt unlike his first visit to this little corner of hell when his eyes had taken some time to become used to the elaborate fiction that the tiles were creating for him this time everything was warmed up and ready to go he looked through the door and there it was in all its glory from the spectacle of the eclipse overhead to a single serrated blade of grass bent beneath the toe of his shoe along which a little black beetle was making its way and standing in the midst of all this looking as appropriate as a hardon in the vatican was eppstadt hed obviously had some problems while he was here the man whod been several times cited as the bestdressed man in los angeles was looking in need of a tailor his shirt was torn and severely stained with what looked like blood his face was covered in sweat and his hair which he obsessively combed over the bald patch had fallen forward exposing an area of shiny pink scalp and giving him a ridiculous fringe you he said pointing directly at todd you fucking lunatic you did this deliberately and now people are dead pickett real people dead because of your stupid games hey hey slow down whos dead oh as if you give a damn you trick us all into following you into thisthisobscenity todd looked around as eppstadt ranted obscenity he saw no obscenity given the shortness of his acquaintance with this place he had certainly felt a lot of different things about it hed been enchanted here hed been so terrified that hed thought his heart would burst hed been absurdly aroused and close to death as he ever wanted to get but obscene no the devils country was simply the ultimate eticket ride if you dont like it he said to eppstadt why the hell did you come in here to help joe and now hes dead what happened to him eppstadt glanced over his shoulder dropping his voice to a whisper theres a child around here only its not a child hes a goat so hes the devils kid dont start with that devil shit i never made one of those movies this isnt a movie eppstadt no youre quite right it isnt a movie its a fucking obscenity yeah so you said how can you be so casual eppstadt said taking a stride towards todd i just saw somebody sliced to death what the goatboy did it just opened up joes throat and its your fault eppstadts stride had picked up speed he was getting ready to do something stupid todd sensed his terror had become a capacity for violence and even though thered been times when todd had wanted to beat the crap out of eppdtadt this was neither the time nor the place you want to see what you caused eppstadt said not particularly well youre going to he caught hold of the front of todds tshirt let go of me eppstadt eppstadt ignored him he just turned and hauled todd after him the volatile mixture of his fear and rage making him impossible to resist todd didnt even try katya had given him a lesson in how to behave here you kept quiet or you drew attention to yourself and somehowit was something about the way the wind seemed to be blowing from all quarters at once something about the way the grass seethed at his feet and the trees churned like thunderheadshe thought it wasnt just eppstadt who was in a state of agitation this whole painted world was stirred up by now the hunters dogs probably had their scent and the duke was on his way just chill todd said to eppstadt im not going to fight you if you want me to see something then ill come look just stop pulling on me will you eppstadt let him go his lower lip was quivering as though he was about to burst into tears which for todds money was worth the price of admission you follow me eppstadt said ill show you something keep your voice down there are people around here you dont want to have coming after you i met one of them already eppstadt said walking on towards a small group of trees and i never want to see anything like it again so lets get out of here no i want you to see i want you to take full responsibility for what happened here i didnt make this place todd said but you knew it was here you and your little lover im putting the picture together now dont worry ive got it all somehow i doubt that eppstadt was searching the ground now his step more cautious as though he was afraid of treading on something what are you looking for he glanced back at todd joe he said and then returning his gaze to the ground he pointed there he said what there go look go on who was he todd said staring down at the maimed body in the dirt its throat gaping his name was joe somethingorother and he was a waiter at maxines party thats all i know and goatkid did this to him yeah why for christs sake amusement would be my closest guess todd passed a clammy hand over his face okay ive see him now can we get the hell out of here and find maxine maxine yeah she went outside with sawyer i know and now sawyers dead christ were being picked off like flies who killed him someanimal only it wasnt any kind of animal i ever saw before all right im coming eppstadt said but you listen to me pickett if we survive this youve got a fuck of a lot to answer for oh like you dont me what the hell do i have to do with this ill tell you im listening i wouldnt be here and nor would you or maxine or any other poor fuck he glanced at joes corpse if you hadnt sounded off at the beach orif you really want to go back to the start of thingshow about a certain conversation we had during which you suggested i get my face fixed oh that yes that i was wrong you should never have done it it was a bad call that was life my flesh and he froze for something had emerged from the undergrowth a beast that was a vague relative of a lizard but shorter squatter its back end having instead of a long and serpentine tail an outgrowth of two or three hundred pale bulbous tumors it went directly to the remains of joe no no no eppstadt said quietly then suddenly running at the creature the way he might at a dog whod come sniffing at his gate get away he yelled for gods sake get away the lizard threw the yellowblue gaze of one of its eyes up in eppstadts direction was unimpressed and returned to sniffing around the slicedopen neck it flicked the wound with its tongue oh jesus oh jesus eppstadt gasped he picked up a rock and threw it at the animal striking its leathery hide again the cold reptilian assessment and this time the creature opened its throat and let out a threatening hiss todd caught hold of eppstadt wrapping his arms around him from behind to keep him from getting any more belligerent with the animal they were lucky the beast was so interested in the remains of joe he knew otherwise it would have turned on them the lizard averted its gaze from eppstadt again and started to tear at the raw meat around joes neck so that joes head was thrown back and forth as it secured itself a mouthful eppstadt was no longer attempting to free himself from todds bearhug so todd let his hold slip a little at which point he turned on todd slamming the heel of his hand against todds shoulder that should have been you eppstadt said following the first blow with a second twice as strong todd let him rant over eppstadts shoulder he saw the lizard retreating into the undergrowth from which it had emerged dragging the remains of waiter joe after him you hear me pickett yeah i hear you todd said wearily thats all youre good for lizard food lizard food the blows were coming faster and harder now it was only a matter of time before todd hit him back and they both knew it knew it and wanted it no more innuendo no more lawyers just fisticuffs in the mud all right todd said bitchslapping eppstadt for the fun of it i get it he struck him again harder you want to fight a third blow harder still which split eppstadts lip blood ran from his mouth and then suddenly the two of them were at it not exchanging clean neat blows the way they did in the movies but knotted up together in a jumble of gouges and kicks years of anger and competition emptying in few chaotic seconds they could not have chosen a less perfect place or time to settle a personal score if theyd looked a lifetime but this wasnt about making sensible decisions this was about bringing the other sonofabitch down as it was they both went down having wrestled their way into muddy terrain their feet slid from under them and down they went locked together like two boys tammy saw them fall oh no she said half to herself not here dont do it here i wouldnt go any closer if i were you brahms advised her well youre not me tammy said and without waiting for any further response she pressed on over the uneven ground towards the two men in the mud there were sounds of birds overhead and she glanced up at the sky as she walked towards the men it was spectacularly beautiful and for a moment her thoughts were entirely claimed by the piled cumulus and the partiallyblinded sun the darkness of the heavens between the clouds was profound enough that the brightest of the stars could be seen set in velvet grey when she looked back at todd and eppstadt they were virtually indistinguishable from one another physicallyboth liberally coated in mud but it was still dear which one was eppstadt he was letting out a virtually seamless monologue about todd the general sense of which was that todd was a vapid overpaid talentless sonofabitch furthermore when all this insanity was over he eppstadt was going to make certain that everybody knew that todd had caused the death of a number of innocent people with his arrogance as tammy got closer to the fight it became evident to tammy that this wasnt going to end quickly or easily neither man was going to be talked down from their fury it had escalated too far she could only hope they exhausted each other quickly before they attracted unwanted attention there seemed little hope of that though theyd fought to their feet again it was becoming harder and harder for either man to land a solid blow in this slippery environment finally eppstadt swung wide and went down in the mud falling heavily he struggled to get up the heels of his hands sliding in the mud but before he could succeed todd clambered on top of him and straddled him his hands at the mans throat there was no fight left in eppstadt all he could do was gasp and shake his head you fuckhead todd said none of this would have happenedif youhad made my fucking movie eppstadt had by now recovered enough energy to speak i wouldnt put you in a movie if my fucking life depended on it at which point tammy made her presence known todd it was eppstadt who looked up first oh jesus he said i wondered when you were going to show your fat ass tammy wasnt in the mood for long speeches leave the shithead in the mud todd she said and lets just get out of here todd grinned through his mask of mud the megawatt smile it would be my pleasure he got to his feet and stepped away eppstadt pulled his rather ungainly bulk to his knees he had lost one of his choice italian shoes in the melee and now began to search for it in fact it had been flung wide of mud close to where tammy was standing looking for this she said yes he glared beckoning with his fingers she tossed it in the thorn bushes cunt faggot no i am many things but a bugger i am not right brahms dont bring me into this jerry said i just want us all out of here were coming jerry todd said not looking at him you go on and take tammy not without you oh how touching eppstadt said the fat girl is loyal to the end even though she doesnt have a hope in hell of getting a fuck out of it tammy had kept her fury limited to that one casual toss of the italian shoe but now it erupted all her fury towards eppstadts and his kind the mrhighandmightys who thought that fat fangirls were less than shit you are such scum she said you nastyminded tinypeckered little piece of excrement she approached him as she yelled but after the fight with todd the last thing eppstadt wanted was this woman laying her hands on him keep her away from me jerry he demanded raising his hands palms out as he did so he retreated towards the copse of trees jerry you hear me leave him tammy well hes scum and tell her to cover herself up eppstadt fired back the sight of her cellulite makes me gag jerry had caught hold of tammys arm luckily for him tammy had suddenly lost interest in all this scoresettling she was studying a group of horsemen who were following a winding road that would eventually bring them she quickly realized to this very spot todd she said yes i saw we have visitors the duke of goga of course along with his entourage they still had plenty of time to get to the door tammy reckoned the hunters were still some distance away and it didnt seem that theyd yet spotted the interlopers jerry was already on his way to the exit todd had found some clean water to wash his wounds but he could be up and gone in a couple of seconds eppstadt was the exception hed gone into the thornthicket to fetch his italian shoe and as he did so something moved in amongst the mass of thorny branches off to the left of him he stopped reaching for his shoe and studied the shadows whatever it was seemed to have become snagged in there because it shook itself then it let out a kind of mewling sound and shook itself again this time more violently the maneuver worked however freed of the thicket it stumbled out into view it was the goatboy he started to pull thorns out of his flesh the pain of it making him weep softly to himself eppstadt knew what this creature was capable of from his previous encounter and he had no desire to draw the attention of the beast he gave up on his shoe and set his eyes on the door jerry brahms was right it was time they got the hell out of here the goatboy had stopped weeping now and for some reason had fixed his gaze upon tammy or more particularly upon her breasts there was no equivocation in his stare no attempt to pretend he was looking elsewhere he simply stared lovingly at the upper part of tammys torso and licked his lips tammy had heard the boys sobbing complaints and was staring at him so was todd come on tammy todd said tammy let her gaze go from the boy to the approaching hunters plainly theyd also heard the sound of the childs wails because theyd picked up their speed and were approaching at a hard gallop tammy looked back at lucifers child in all his goaty glory his tears had dried now and was less interested in picking thorns out of his flesh theyd done some damage she saw little rivulets of dark red blood ran down his limbs from the places where hed been pierced there was one spot that looked particularly tender deep in the groove of his groin he worked the thorn out a little but not once did he take his eyes off the objects of his present devotion he didnt even glance over at the horsemen though he must have heard their approach he obviously knew how to outmaneuver them hed been doing it for centuries he had a warren of hideyholes to tuck himself away tammy glanced up at the sky at the moon locked in its unnatural position in front of the sun then she looked around at the landscape which that halfclouded light illuminated the road and the approaching horsemen the cluster of boulders where todd was standing stripped of his torn tshirt doing his best to lift handfuls of clean water up to his wounded face the goatboy would be gone in a moment tammy knew and when it was gone the hunt would as zeffer had told her continue in the same weary way it had been going for centuries perhaps it was time to bring the whole sorry thing to an end once and for all to see if she little tammy lauper from sacramento couldnt deliver the devils child back into the hands of the duke who could then return him to its mother and bring an end to this long weary chase she knew of only one desperate method by which she might do this she didnt waste time enacting it she unbuttoned her torn blouse starting at the top she had every jot of the goatboys attention from the moment her fingers touched the first button he forgot about removing thorns from his flesh he simply watched like them she said to him so softly she was certain nobody would hear the goatboy heard her as she knew he would he had an animals ears by way of reply he nodded very slowly indeed almost reverentially there were two buttons remaining two buttons and her blouse would fall open and hed have a feast of her hanging in front of his eyes she stopped unbuttoning he made a little growl in his throat the smile suddenly went from his face perhaps she was imagining it but there seemed to be a flicker of fire in his eyes she stopped her teasing and put her hands back up to the first of the remaining buttons he rewarded her with a little smile which showed her a detail shed missed until now his teeth though small were all sharpened to a fine point he had the smile of a piranha she literally felt the flesh around her nipple tighten up at the prospect of those needles coming anywhere near her she chanced a quick look in the direction of the horsemen but they had disappeared from sight for a time the road that was bringing them here had wound into an expanse of pine forest she looked back at the goatboy he was tapping his left foot which appendage boasted a nail that would not have shamed a raptor plainly he was just a little anxious about the proximity of the duke and his men he did not wish to be caught but just as plainly he was not going to leave not yet not until hed seen what tammy had to offer he pointed at her made a little waggling motion with his forefinger show me he said she smiled at him but she didnt move to oblige show he said again she continued to smile at him all the while assessing how many strides of his flat little feet it would take for him to reach her should he take it into his head to run he could be on her in five strides she guessed four if he pushed it she slipped one of the two buttons out of its hole the blouse fell open a little giving him a peek at her left nipple she flashed suddenly on some hot summers day in her fourteenth year when shed crept into her parents room in the middle of the afternoon and played striptease in the mirror she had more to boast about than any of the other girls in her class bigger breasts and hair down between her legs her life would have been a lot happier if her breasts had stopped growing that day but theyd had a long way to go by the time she was fifteen she was like a young shelley winters and it just got worse from there strange how things came round how something that had become a source of shame for her was now out of nowhere redeemed she let her fingers slip down to the last button knowing that the goatboys gaze would go with them and she would have a chance however slim to look up past him and see whether the horsemen had emerged from the forest the news was bad there was no sign of the duke and his men had they perhaps taken a wrong turning in the forest surely not surely they knew this entire territory after so many years of riding it show me your tits the goatboy demanded as he spoke he lifted his left leg and struck a stone with his raptor claw a bright spark leapt from the place and landed on a tuft of grey grass where it erupted into a little fire it had too little fuel to keep it sustained for long but in the five or six seconds that it took for the cycle of spark fire and extinction to play out tammy heard the sound of the dukes horses and from the corner of her eye saw them emerging from between the trees the goatboy narrowed his eyes to golden slits the corners of his mouth turned down showing the lower row of monstrous teeth show me he said again plainly he wasnt going to be toyed with any longer he wanted to see what she had and he wanted to see them now she didnt pretend that the horsemens proximity was not of interest to her what was the use everybody was in on this ridiculous game the goatboy included he dropped his head a little which should have been a sign for tammy as to what he would do next but she was too busy thinking about how long the duke would take to get off his horse to realize that the goatboy was making make a run at her and by the time she did realize he was already halfway there and there was nothing between her bare breasts and his hands his mouth his teeth but a prayer eight fearing the worst todd let out a yell and started racing across the muddy bloody ground to do whatever he could to stop the goatboy attacking tammy but before he could get there she had taken matters into her own hands she let the last of the six buttons slip and her blouse fell open unveiling her breasts the sight of them literally stopped the devils child in his tracks he opened his mouth and drool ran from it tammy was smart enough not to reject this sign of adoration however crude instead she opened her arms inviting him into her embrace todd would have betted against the wisdom of this the goatboy was no sentimentalist he wanted to play rough but had he made that bet he would have lost it the devils child fell to his knees laughing then he crawledyes crawledinto tammys arms his hands went greedily up to one of her breasts and he held the unwieldy bubble of flesh before his eyes for a moment of devotion his mouth was slick and wet the saliva glinted off his terrible teeth please god todd murmured it was very possibly the strangest sensation of tammys thirtyfour years the feeling of the devils childs mouth around her left nipple there had been a momentas he closed his mouth around herwhen it had crossed her mind that she should be afraid that with one chomp he could give her an instant mastectomy if he so chose but somehow she knew he would not he was in love with her breasts instead he worshipped them in his way though his mouth was tight around her flesh she felt not so much as the lightest of scratches from those sharklike teeth in fact she suspected hed somehow sheathed them the way a snake sheathed its fangs because as he sucked and sucked all she felt was a slightly guilty rush of pleasure as his suction drew the blood to the nipple and the flesh surrounding the nipple sensitizing the entire area then as though all this werent peaceful and domestic enough the devils child closed his eyes his fat little hands holding the source of his bliss and tammy gently rocked him in her arms goga had been searching for liliths child for many centuries now under a sky thatthough it was sometimes cloudy sometimes clearalways showed the sun eclipsed he had no real idea of how long his imprisonment in the devils country had lasted his mind had long ago lost any grasp on the passage of time he and his men had passed the centuries in a kind of fugue state sometimes when they rested and ate what theyd huntedrabbit on occasion or venison or wild pigthey would talk about what had happened to them that day on the hunt and where they now were it was the dukes opinion that this was not a real place at all but a kind of dream that the devil was dreaming and they were trapped in it how else to explain the curious limitations of their condition the same ships forever heading towards the horizon the same roads haunted by the same beasts the same sun in the same heaven halfblinded by the same black moon but in the last few daysif days and nights could truthfully be said to pass herethere had been signs that things were changing in what had been hitherto a virtually changeless place there had always been strangers coming and going but whereas in the past visitors had little or no effect upon the world they were wandering through the trespassers of recent times had not been quite so guileless or so lucky several had perished in the region around the forest and nowas if all this were not strange enougha new spectacle stranger by some measure than all that had preceded it sitting beside the roadnursing the object of their long search as though he were a commonplace babywas a barebreasted woman the duke dismounted a few yards from where tammy sat in the dirt rocking the goatboy in her arms his lieutenants had dismounted several horselengths away and were now creeping around the nursing woman swords drawn tammy saw all of this but she registered nothingnot a word not the raising of a fingerfor fear of alerting the contented child to the fact that his time in this idyllic state was about to end very cautiously the duke approached the woman and child beckoning to his men to take their final positions one of the men had brought a wooden box clearly his own crude handiwork which he now opened and positioned behind the pair the goatboy didnt open his eyes but he pulled his mouth away from tammys breast long enough to say you dont all have to creep around like that i know what youre up to hed no sooner spoken than his interest in the dukes men was forgotten again and he was back to stroking the ample flesh in front of him beautiful he said to tammy do you have names for your tits names tammy said actually no oh you should theyre amazing he kissed them first left then right then left again tender affectionate kisses may i name them myself he asked this question with the greatest delicacy stumbling over the words plainly the last thing he would have wished to do is cause offense of course she said i may oh thank you then this must be helena who i sucked on and this one ill call beatrice he looked at tammy framed by her breasts and you who are you tammy just tammy tammy jayne lauper im qwaftzefoni the goatboy said are you on the run from somebody tammy i was i suppose in a way who my husband arnie he doesnt appreciate you no the goatboy began to lick helena and beatrice again big sloppy tounguings that made tammy shudder with pleasure no children he said in the middle of a stroke no arnie cant but you could tammy he lay his head against her pillows believe me i know about these things youre fertile as the nile as soon as you get pregnant these beautiful mammaries will become milkmachines and your children will be strong and healthy with strong healthy hearts like you finally he opened his eyes just a slit his gaze first settling on her face then slipping sideways to get a glimpse of the cage so whats your opinion he said to her about what should i give myself up or let the chase go on what happens if you give yourself up i go home with my mother lilith back to hell isnt that where you should be yes i suppose so but how would you feel if i said you should be back with arnie oh no so you understand he said running an appreciative palm over the smooth globes then putting his head down between them his chin in the groove sometimes you just have to get away at least for a while but you know now that i lie here i think maybe its time to give up ive been running for years never let anybody lay a finger on me until you his voice already low went to a barely audible whisper almost a hiss are they very close now he said yes she told him theyre very close he toyed with her hardened nipple if i give myself up what will happen i think well all leave this country one way or another andin your opinionwould that be such a bad idea no she told him in my opinion it would be a very good idea and they wont hurt me they wont hurt you you promise she looked into his eyes brown into gold i promise they wont hurt you all right he said lifting his arms up and putting them round her neck its time we put an end to this but first you have to kiss me according to who according to me she kissed his grizzled lips and as she did so he leapt out of her arms as though hed been slick with butter a jump that carried him three or four feet above her head prindetil the duke yelled his men werent about to come so close to their quarry and lose him again they each caught hold of an arm and leg of the child and carried him squealing more like a pig than a goat to the wooden crate before they could get him safely locked away however there came a shout from eppstadt where are you going with that thing he demanded theyre taking it away todd explained oh no theyre not absolutely not i saw it commit murder i want to see it tried in a court of law he started towards the two men who had taken hold of the creature the duke sword drawn instantly came to stand between them tammy meanwhile even before shed buttoned herself up was ready to add her own voice to the argument dont you interfere she told eppstadt youll fuck up everything are you crazy well yes why am i asking of course youre crazy letting that thing suck on you that way you obscene woman just do it todd urged the men hoping his miming of the boys imprisonment would help the men understand his meaning it did while the duke held eppstadt at swordpoint his men put the goatboy into the crate the wooden bars of which were decorated with small iron icons hammered into the timber whatever their meaning they did the trick though qwaftzefoni was easily strong enough to shake the crate apart he did not so much as lay his hands on the bars but sat passively in his little prison awaiting the next stage of the proceeding the duke issued a new round of orders and the men lifted the crate onto the back of one of the horses and started to secure it there while they did so the duke made a short but apparently deeply sincere speech to tammy thanking her she assumed for her part in this dangerous enterprise all the while he kept an eye on eppstadt and his sword raised should the man attempt to interfere eppstadt was obviously equally aware that the duke meant business even if he didnt understand the exchange because he kept his hands raised throughout and his mouth shut todd meanwhile stood watching the sky there was it seemed a subtle change in the configuration of the heavens the moon was very slowly moving off the face of the sun suddenly there was a shriek from one of the dukes men the goatboy had found a place where his hand and arm could fit through the bars without touching the icons and using a moment of the mans distraction had reached out and was digging his shortfingered hand into the meat around the mans eye he had firm hold of it firm enough to shake the man back and forth like a puppet blood gushed from the place splashing against the goatboys palm and running down his victims face the horse on which the crate was set reared up in panic and the cratewhich had not yet been firmly fixed to the saddle slid off the creature did not let go of his victim he hung onto the mans face as the crate crashed to the ground it did not break open as no doubt the goatboy had hoped and in a fit of frustration he started to tear the mans flesh open still further the duke was swift he came to the place in two strides and with a single swing of his sword separated the goatboys hand from his wrist the creature let out a sickening shrill wail tammywhod watched all this in a state of horrified disbelief now covered her ears against the noise of both victims man and boy though shed muted the scene she couldnt take her eyes off it the hunter dropping to his knees with the childs hand still fixed in his face like some foul parasite the goatboy in his crate stanching his stump with his other hand the duke wiping the blood off his blade there was a short moment of calm as the goatboys sobs became subdued and the wounded man having pulled the hooked finger out of his flesh covered his wound with a cloth to slow the flow of blood the calm lasted no more than twenty seconds it was broken by a grinding sound in the earth as though a machine made of stone and iron was on the move down there what fresh hell is this jerry murmured tammys eyes were on the crate and its contents the goatboy had given up all his complaints and was peering between the bars with his mouth open and slack he knew exactly what was about to happen earthquake eppstadt said no tammy replied reading the look on the goatboys face liliih part nine the queen of hell one the ground opened up as though it was going to bring forth some fantastic spring red shoots as fine as needles appeared in their tens of thousands pierced the ground a vshaped crack each side perhaps twenty feet in length then erupted into the burgeoning ground the apex no more than a yard from the spot where had goatboys crate sat the steady reverberation of immense machinery increased and it now became apparent what purpose this machine had for an opening appeared in the earth resembling the upper part of some vast reptilian snout the red needles continued to grow both in size and number especially around the lip and at a certain point when they were perhaps a foot tall or taller they produced hosts of tiny purpleblack flowers which gave off a scent no one in the vicinity was familiar with it was pungent like a spice but there was nothing about it which would ever have persuaded a cook to use it the smell and thus presumably the taste was so powerful that it would have overwhelmed even the most robust dish it made everyone feel faintly nauseated by its forcefulness eppstadt who had the weakest stomach actually threw up by the time hed done with his retching the extraordinary growthcycle of the plant had carried it past its peak however the small black blossoms were in sudden decay their petals losing their colour and now in its autumnal mode the odor of the plant changed what had been an almost unbearable stench a minute before became transformed by the process of corruption its foulness entirely evaporated what remained was a scent that somehow conspired with the souls of everyone present to put them in mind of some sweet memory something lost something sacrificed something taken by time or circumstance nor though their bodies were held in the embrace of these feelings could they have named them the scent was too subtle in its workings to be pinned to any one memory all that mattered was the state of utter vulnerability in which it left everyone by the time the hells mouth had opened and lilith herself had stepped out of its long sharp shadows her flora had enraptured the souls of everyone who stood before her whatever they saw from now on whatever they said and did was colored by the way the scent of her strange garden had touched them was she beautiful well perhaps the scent was beautiful so it seemed shewho was shaped by the scent as if her body were carved from perfumed smokewas surely beautiful too though a more logical assessment might have pointed out how curiously made her face was close in colour and texture to the blossoms in their corrupted phase her voice that same less dreamy assessor might have said was unmusical and her dress despite its great size and elaboration more proof of obsession even of madness than of beauty even allowing that there can be not one good and reliable report of lilith the devils wife some things may still be clearly said of her she was happy for one she laughed with almost indecent glee at the sight of her caged child though she plainly saw that he was missing a hand and her manner when dealing with the duke was nothing short of exquisite youve suffered much for your crime against my household she said speaking in cultured english whichby some little miracle of her makinghe understood do you have any idea how many years have passed since you first began to hunt for that idiot child of mine she stabbed a finger at the creature in the crate who started to moan and complain until she shushed him by slapping the bars the duke replied that no he did not know well perhaps its best you dont lilith told him but what you should know because it will shape what happens when i have taken this imp of mine back is that your natural lifespanyour three score years and tenwas over centuries ago the duke looked puzzled at this and then aghast as he realized the consequences of what she was telling him that he and his men had hidden their lives away in this fruitless hunt around and around and around chasing a baby whod put on perhaps two years in the period of the pursuit my father he said my brother all dead lilith said with some little show of sympathy all that you knew and remembered has gone the dukes face remained unchanged but tears filled up his eyes and then spilled down his cheeks men and your hunts lilith went on addressing it seemed some larger error in the dukes sex if you hadnt been out killing healthy stags and boars in the first place you could have married and lived and loved but she shrugged we do as our instincts dictate yes and yours brought you here to the very edge of your own grave she was telling him it seemed that hed run out of life and now after all the sacrifices of his hunt his reward would be death pure simple and comfortless let me have my child then she said then well have this wretched business over and done with it was at this point that eppstadt spoke up once more hed had a twitching little smile on his face for a while the reason for which was simple enough this latest spectacle had finally convinced him that one of his earlier explanations for all of this was most likely the correct one he was lying unconscious somewhere in the house and was fantasizing this whole absurd scene he very seldom felt as selfwilled in dreams as he felt in this one indeed he seldom dreamed at all or at least remembered his dreams but now that he had this nonsense in his grasp he wasnt ready to let it go just yet ever the negotiator he stepped forward and put out his hand to prevent the duke passing over the child i dont suggest you do that just yet he said not sure whether the man understood him or not though the gesture was clear enough the moment you hand over the brat youre dead you understand dont do this eppstadt todd advised why the hell not its just a dream its not a dream jerry said its real everything down here is as oh christ brahms shut up you know what im going to do when im finished sorting this out im going to kick your faggot ass he grinned obviously hugely satisfied to be so politically incorrect youre going to regret this todd said jerrys right how can he be right eppstadt said his voice dripping contempt look at this place how can any of this fucking idiocy be real its all going on in my head and i bet you thought i had the dull little mind of a business school executive eppstadt todd said this is not going on in your mind eppstadt made the donkeybray buzz that accompanied the wrong answer on a quiz show he was riding high on his newfound comprehension of his situation wrong baby fuck so very very wrong can i say something while weve got this moment and its my dream so ill fucking say it anyway you are a terrible actor i mean we would get the dailies in at paramount and we would howl i mean we would fucking howl at some of the takes tears pouring down our faces while you attempted to emote you are such a cunt that i am and youre a millionaire many times over because i persuaded a bunch of losers who wouldnt know a crass commercial decision from a hole in their asses to pay you an obscene amount of money to parade your godgiven attributes he turned to lilith who had been watching this outburst as though amused by the cavorting of an antic dog sorry there i go mentioning the gword probably doesnt sit well with you god lilith said no god sits perfectly well with me eppstadt was clearly about to make some boorish reply to this but lilith ignored him she let out a rhythmical whistle and up from the dark throat of the earth came two women bald and barebreasted at the sight of either faces or breasts perhaps both the goatboy in the crate started to get voluble again wailing and chattering this is the end then lilith said to the duke im taking him do you have any final words the duke shook his head and raised his swordjabbing it in eppstadts direction in order to persuade him to stay out of these proceedings eppstadt stood his ground until the point of the dukes sword pierced his mudcaked shirt then he yelped and duly stepped back to prevent worse coming his way hurt did it jerry said shut the fuck up eppstadt snapped he made no further attempt to agent the exchange between lilith and the duke however the crate was unbolted and lilith reached in grabbing her onehanded offspring by his dick and balls take him ladies she said to the women and in a most unmotherly fashion she threw him into the arms of her maidservants who seized him between them and carried him off down the slope and into the darkness so it finishes lilith said to the duke she turned on her heel catching hold of her insanely embroidered garment and lifting it up to clear her step then she glanced back did you have children she asked the duke he shook his head then youll lie with those who went before you but not with any that came after thats good it would be mournful to meet your children in the grave tonight she inclined her head farewell then my lord it seems to me youve earned your rest she had said all she intended to say and again made to depart but eppstadt wasnt quite done youre good he said i mean real gravitas i dont see that a lot and youre beautiful you know its usually one or the other tits or brains but youve got both i almost wish i wasnt dreaming lilith gave him a stare which would have sent wiser men running but eppstadt still believing himself the master of his own dream was not going to be cowed by any of its cast have i met you somewhere before he said i have havent i im conjuring you up from a memory oh dont do this todd murmured dont what eppstadt snapped play not here not now its my sandbox ill play if i want to but the rest of you can get the fuck out that means you faggot and her he pointed at tammy and you pickett out go on i want you out for some reason todd looked to lilith for permission to depart she nodded first at todd then at tammy finally at jerry are you sure you dont want to make a graceful exit todd said to eppstadt fuck you jerry had already turned his back on the hells mouth and was heading back towards the threshold tammy had also turned but had halted caught by the sight of the duke and his two men who were lying on the ground at the edge of the trees how they had got therewhat instinct had driven them to lie down like thisshe didnt know their bodies were already in advanced states of corruption even though they were still alive and they were gazing up at the slowlychanging sky their faces cleansed of any expression of resentment or need or pain they seemed perfectly resigned to their decease as though after all these years trapped in a circle they could not break they were simply grateful to be leaving it so there they lay maggots at their nostrils beetles at their ears their sight drowning in pools of rot she didnt watch to the end she wasnt that brave instead she turned away and followed jerry to the door as she came to his side he said look i saw no not there jerry said thats too sad for words look up its almost over two so it was the sun was now over halfway uncovered and with every passing moment the landscape it had lit with so miserly a light for the better part of four hundred years was growing brighter the thinnest cloudsthose most susceptible to heathad already evaporated now the cumulus were in retreat showing a bank of blue through which clusters of falling stars came blazing down as though to celebrate the passing of the hunt some of the braver beasts in this extraordinary landscapecreatures that had lived contentedly in the perpetual twilight but were curious to see what change the sun would bringwere venturing out of their dens and caves and squinting up at the spectacle overhead a lion blessed with wings strong enough to carry it aloft rose from its imperial seat amongst the branches of a noahic oak as though to challenge the sun itself it was instantly overcome by the incandescence that filled the heavens and tumbled back to earth shedding feathers the size of swords jerry saw the lesson clearly enough its all going to change very quickly now he said there was indeed a general sense of panic in the landscape every species that had learned to prosper in the silverdim light was in a sudden terror fearful that whatever the sun was sheddinglight heat or bothit would be their undoing in every corner of this painted world creatures were scuttling and scampering fighting over the merest sliver of shadow it was not just the lion that had been brought down several flocks of birds confounded by the sudden blaze panicked in midflight and descended in squawking confusion on the roads wild dogs went noonday crazy and set on one anothers throats in bursts of overheated rage the air was suddenly populated with myriad tiny gnats and dragonflies which rose from the grass in such swarming abundance they could only have been born that moment their eggs cracked by the abrupt rise in temperature and where there were flies of course there were flycatchers rodents leapt up out of the grass to feed on the sudden bounty lizards and snakes swarmed underfoot it was an astonishing transformation in the four or five minutes since the child had been passed back to his mother and the dukes curse had been lifted the landscape through which goga and his men had ridden had undergone a seachange falling stars and falling lions the air filled with the flutter of a million dragonflies and the howling of thousand sunblinded dogs trees coming into sudden blossom their buds so fat and fruitful they exploded like little bombs so that a blizzard of petals drenched the air with perfume and in the same moment as the dragonflies rose up and the trees blossomed death caught a million throats and with howls and shrieks and crazed cavorting the reaper claimed both the common dog and the fanciful beasts lilith had hatched to make the hunt more purgatorial for her victims the chicken that had laid eggs filled with serpents was devoured by its brood in its dotage a lizard with a dragonfly still fluttering in its jaws was taken by a beast only lilith could have conjured its back a shameless homage to the cunt from its glorious labial head to the enormous golden eye buried in its depths like an opulent egg a thousand thousand witnesses could not have catalogued what happened to the devils country in those minutes an army of chroniclers could not have caught a quarter of the stories here they came and went too fast birth death and the madness between filling the senses to overflowing at the door tammy had time to wonder if perhaps eden had been like this not the calm hand of a placid creator moving over the dappled grass of paradise and leaving the lion the lamb and all that lived in between where it passed but rather this the sun turned up as though by an impatient cook frying life into being in one frenzied blazing carnival its most exquisite beasts no more likely to survive the heat than its basest creations beauty of no importance in the heat of the moment nor poetry nor intelligence just things rising and falling without judgement or consideration the loveliest of beings dying before they had time to speak while veils of flies descended to pump their eggs into the bed of their quickened rot no wonder lilith had said so knowingly that god sat perfectly well with her hadnt she been his first female creation the bride for adam which yahweh had rejected hers the first womb hers the first egg hers the first blood shed in pain because a man had made it so tammy looked to see if she could catch a glimpse of the woman one last time with this new notion in her head but the air between where she stood and where the queen of hell had been standing was a maze of petals flies birds seeds scales and flakes of cooked corruption lilith was out of sight and tammy knew that if she was lucky she would never have occasion to look into the womans eyes again three upstairs in the great bed in the master bedroom katya had woken from one of the most restorative slumbers shed enjoyed in years no nightmares not even dreams just a deep sense of wellbeing knowing that she had finally found the man with whom to share the years in the privacy of the canyon a moment later the comforts of her wakingstate were dashed the bed beside her was cold and empty and she heard voices strangers in her house that there might be people in the kitchen or the dining room would have been bad enough but she knew instinctively where the voices were coming from they were way downstairs in that room and given that todd was not beside her he was probably down there with them the thought did not comfort her she understood all too well the claim that place had nor did it play favorites it beguiled with equal eloquence the genius and the dullard the intellectual and the sensualist shed seen it happen over and over again lord knows shed had fixes enough from it herself over the years it had kept her beautiful kept her strong but for her being in the room was merely a function of cosmetics it wiped away the years though perhaps it was truly was the devils country she attached no great metaphysical significance to the place it was her beauty parlor nothing more and if there were people in there now using up her dwindling sum of perfection then she wanted them out out she got up and started to dress going over the events of the previous evening as she did so there was only one person she knew who might have seduced todd away from her side tammy the bitch whod taken him away last time for some reason todd felt some sentimental attachment to tammy there was nothing wrong with that in principle it proved he had a heart but the woman had no place in the scheme of things from this point on shed served her minor purpose it was time she was removed dressed now katya went to the mirror the sleep had done her good there was a luminosity in her eyes that had not been there for many years she could even bring herself to turn on a smile it was unfortunate she thought as she stepped out onto the landing but there were bound to be these little challenges at the outset nothing however was going to get between her and her paradise zeffer had tried and zeffer was dead this woman would probably try too but shed end up the same way he had and if things really went well the killing blow would come from todd that would make things perfect if he found the weapon and struck her down it was essential to make him understand that anyone who endangered their little paradise would have to be killed and there was nothing better for the cementing of a relationship than to spill a little blood together eppstadt had sent pickett the woman and brahms running but hed stayed awhile to torment the strange woman hed conjured up it wasnt often he tangled with a woman whose intellect he respected for a time columbia had been run by just such a woman dawn steel and eppstadt had always enjoyed a good debate with her but shed died of brain cancer at some absurdly young age the loss had saddened him true there were a couple of actresses who had the wit to hold his attention for more than a sentencejamie lee curtis was surprisingly sharp susan sarandon and jodie foster were worth his time but mostly they were little more than bodies to him so where as hed already asked himself had he found the raw material for this baroque fantasy called lilith it wasnt just the beauty and eloquence of the woman it was the whole implausible world that surrounded her like an mgm musical designed by heironymus bosch what are you staring at lilith asked him she had long ago begun her slow descent into the underworld but nowcaught by eppstadts scrutinyshe had halted and turned to face him again you he said bluntly well dont so saying she again turned her back and continued to descend into the earth wait he demanded i want to talk with you he caught hold of the rear of her trailing gown didnt you hear me i said wait if there had been any trace of indulgence left on liliths face it had now disappeared she assessed him with a merciless gaze wait she said her tone withering what makes you think i would obey any instruction of yours as she spoke she glanced down at eppstadts feet and he felt a motion under his heel odd he thought he stepped aside only to find that a new crop of the shoots had sprung up before the opening of the hellmouth this time however they were more densely planted than before and they were only growing in his immediate vicinity what is this he said he felt the first needlepricks in his ankles little more than irritations really but when he lifted his leg he dragged the shoots out from under his skin and they hurt he yelped with pain hopping on one leg he hoisted up his trouser leg there were a dozen of tiny wounds around his ankle where the shoots had entered his skin all were bleeding fuck he said there was nothing remotely entertaining about this dream now he wanted it to stop meanwhile he felt the crop of shoots entering his other leg he had no intention of repeating his error so he stomped down the area of the shoots with his injured foot and planted it there while he gingerly hoisted up his other trouser leg to examine the damage impossible as it seemed the shoots had already advanced through the muscle of his calf he could see their trajectory through his skin they were getting steadily more ambitious as they climbed dividing and dividing again forming a network through his flesh he caught hold of one at his ankle where it pierced his skin it was no thicker than a few braided hairs but it wriggled around between his finger and thumb as though determined to keep on climbing keep on growing he tried to pull on it but a spasm of pain ran up through his leg following the path of the shoots advance it had almost reached his knee there were tears of agony in his eyes now he looked up at lilith blinking them away so as to see her better she was still watching him all right he said you made your point she didnt reply make it stop he told her she seemed to consider this for a moment biting lightly on her lower lip as she turned the option over as she did so he glanced down at his other foot the plants hed ground beneath his heel had been replaced by new growths which were already four or five inches high and piercing him afresh oh god no he said returning his gaze to his tormentors face please i was wrong he barely able to get the words out the pain was so intolerable make it stop though his vision was blurred he could see her response to his plea she was shaking her head damn you he said i made one fucking mistake ive said im sorry that should be good enough something burst just above his knee he tore at his trouser leg ripping the fabric with such paininspired force that it tore all the way up to his groin there were flowers blossoming from the meat of his knee six or seven small florets each giving off a stink so pungent it made him giddy to inhale it he glanced up at the woman whod done this to him just one last time hoping his tongue would be inspired to make her merciful but shed plainly already decided she knew how this would end she had turned her back on him and was continuing her descent into the underworld eppstadt felt a new series of eruptions in his legs leading all the way up from his knee to his groin the large pale muscle of his thigh had become a veritable garden upwards of twenty flowers had blossomed there blood ran from the places where theyd come forth and it coursed around the back of his leg soaking into the tatters of his trousers the collected scent of the blossoms all but made him swoon he toppled backwards and sprawled in the shoots that were waiting for him like a deathbed welcoming him into its final comfort what the hell happened to eppstadt todd said looking back the brightening day had put a layer of haze between the hells mouth and the door that led up into the house the details of eppstadts condition were impossible to fathom all they could see was that for some reason the man was lying back amongst flowers i thought he was in trouble a few moments ago jerry said he seemed to be crying out hes not crying out now tammy said looks like hes taking a nap crazy todd said well leave him to it i say jerry remarked if he wants to stay thats his damn business there was no argument from the other two after you jerry said stepping aside to let tammy cross the threshold he followed quickly after her with todd on his heels todd glanced back one last time at the transforming landscape the ships had disappeared from the horizon as though some longawaited wind had finally come and filled their sails and borne them off to new destinations the little gathering of houses beside the river with its two bridges had been eroded by light and even the snaking shape of the river itself was on its way to extinction though shed doubted the tale zeffer had told him it seemed now that it was true this had been a prison painted to hold the duke now that his hunt was over and the devils child had been returned the place no longer had any reason to exist age was catching up with it the heat of its painted sun was undoing it image by image tile by tile eppstadt he yelled are you coming but the man in the long grass didnt move so todd let him lie there eppstadt had always been a man who did what he wanted to do and to hell with other peoples opinions sprawled on the ground eppstadt heard todds call and halfthought of returning it but he could no longer move several shoots had entered the base of his skull piercing his spinal column and he was paralyzed the greenery pushing up through his brain erasing his memories as they climbed had not yet removed every last shred of intelligence he realized that this was the end of him he could feel the first insinuations of shoots at the back of his throat and an itching presence behind his eyes where they were soon to emerge and flower but it concerned him far less than it might have done had he imagined this sitting in his office it wasnt the kind of death hed had in mind when he thought of such things but then his life hadnt been as hed expected it to be either hed wanted to paint as a young man but hed had not the least talent a professor for the art school had remarked that hed never met a man with a poorer sense of aesthetics what would they have thought now those critics whod so roundly condemned him if theyd been here to see wouldnt they have said he was passing away prettily with his head full of shoots and colour and his eyes was he never finished the thought one of liliths flowers blossomed inside his skull and a sudden massive hemorrhage stopped dead every thought eppstadt was entertaining or would ever entertain again indifferent to his death the plants continued to press up through his flesh blossoming and blossoming until from a little distance he was barely recognizable as a man at all merely a shape in the dirt a log perhaps where the flowers had grown with particular vigor hungry to make the most of the sun now that it was shining so brightly four tammy knew there was trouble brewing the moment she set eyes on katya the woman was smiling down at them beatifically but there was no warmth or welcome in her eyes only anger and suspicion what happened she said straining for lightness its over todd told her coming up the stairs his hand extended towards her in a placatory manner no doubt he also read the signs in the womans eyes and didnt trust what he saw there come on he said laying his palm against her waist in a subtle attempt to change her direction no she said gently pressing past him so as to go down the stairs i want to see theres nothing to see jerry said she didnt bother to sweeten her expression for brahms he was her servant nothing more nor less what do you mean theres nothing to see its all gone he said his tone tinged with melancholy as though he were gently breaking the news of a death to her it cant be gone katya snapped pushing on past jerry and tammy and heading down the stairs the hunt goes on forever how could goga ever catch the devils child she turned at the bottom of the stairs her voice strident how could any man ever catch the devils child it wasnt a man tammy piped up it was me katyas face was a picture of disbelief obviously if the idea of a man bringing the hunt to an end wasnt farcical enough the notion that a womanespecially one she held in such plain contempthad done so was beyond the bounds of reason thats not possible she said departing from the bottom of the stairs and heading along the passageway she was out of tammys view now but everyone could hear katyas bare feet on the floor and the doorhandle being turned no the word was almost a shriek jerry caught hold of tammys elbow i think you should get out of here no no no that room was the reason she stayed young now it made sense tammy thought that was why jerry had sounded as though he were announcing a death it was katyas demise he was announcing denied her chamber of eternal youth what would happen to her if this was a movie shed probably come hobbling back along the passageway with the toll of years already overtaking her her body cracking and bending her beauty withering away but this wasnt a movie the woman who strode back into view at the bottom of the stairs showed no sign of weakening or withering at least not yet that bitch she yelled pointing at tammy i want her killed todd you hear me i want her dead tammy looked up the stairs to where todd was standing it was impossible to read the expression on his face meanwhile katya ranted on shes spoiled everything everything it had to end eventually todd said as todd spoke tammy felt the pressure of jerrys hand on her arm subtly encouraging her to head on up the stairs while there was still time to do so she didnt wait for a second prompt she began to ascend keeping her eyes fixed on todds face what was he thinking look at me she willed him its me its your tammy look at me he didnt which was a bad sign it would be easier to obey katya if he didnt think of tammy as a real human being didnt look into her eyes didnt see her fear dont let her go katya said she was coming up the stairs now taking them slowly her pace casual todd just stood there and for once tammy was glad of his passivity she slipped by him without being apprehended and headed on to the top of the stairs todd the cry was from jerry not from katya tammy looked back for some reason todd had caught hold of him and was preventing him from following tammy from the expression on his face it was clear jerry knew he was in trouble he struggled to pull himself away from todd but he was much the weaker man i looked after you didnt i katya said to jerry when you didnt have a friend in the world i was there for you wasnt i and now you let this happen it wasnt my fault i couldnt stop it katya was right in front of him now her palm flat against his chest she didnt seem to be exerting any pressure but whatever power she was exercising through her hand was enough to make him sink back against the wall it wasnt your doing katya said incredulously you could have killed her that would have stopped her interfering killed her jerry said plainly horrified at the idea as though hed not realized until now that the stakes were so high or that the prospect of murdercasual inevitablewas so close perhaps most of all not realizing that the woman hed obviously fallen in love with should now show herself to be as cold as the queen of hell you little fake katya said putting her hand on jerrys head and ripping at the hair sewn into his scalp she pulled and a flap of skin came away in her hand blood ran down over jerrys face jesus katya todd said theres no need no need to what she broke in her face perfect in its fury those wonderful bones that exquisite symmetry finding in rage its best purpose no need to punish him he knows what he did she tossed away the flap of hair and skin and slapped jerry across his face tammy had witnessed this kind of cruelty from her before the last time zeffer had been its target and just like zeffer jerry seemed almost mesmerized by her show of fury powerless to defend himself against her but tammy wasnt about to watch him kicked half to death the way zeffer had been kicked even if in some twisted way brahms was ready to accept that fate you know how pathetic you are she said to katya slapping around old men pathetic he didnt do anything down there i did it i did it all tell her todd it wasnt jerrys fault it wasnt tammys either yours then katya said shifting her burning gaze to todd as she spoke she put her hand on jerrys face and pushed him he reached out to stop himself tumbling back down the stairs but there was nothing to catch hold of down he went head over heels tammy peered over the stairwell jerry was sprawled at the bottom still breathing but apparently unconscious she was almost grateful better katya dismiss him and come after her instead she could still run she could still defend herself and she certainly wasnt about to be hypnotized by the bitchs gaze she didnt wait for katya to start up the flight in pursuit of her she left the banister and headed into the kitchen shes crazy it was todd hed followed her in shaking his head you gotta go he said to tammy catch her katya yelled she was obviously taking her sweet time coming up the stairs confident even now that she had this under control todd you hear me catch her what are you her dog tammy said is that what shes reduced you to just go todd said shes all ive got left shell kill you too if it suits her tammy said you know it dont say that todd begged ive got to stay with her if i dont what have i got you were at the party you heard what they said its all over for me i dont have anything left except her she loves me tammy no she doesnt she does no shes just using you that isnt love who the hell are you to say as good as anybody else better where youre concerned the years i wasted thinking about you wasted yes wasted i wanted you to love me but you never did now you want her to love you and she wont not ever shes incapable of love it hurt him to hear that it hurt because he believed her much as he didnt want to it was the truth she knew it and soto judge by those despairing eyes of hisdid he his gaze went to the window he studied the glass for a time do you think theyre still out there todd said what the dead yes even as she was speaking she was thinking about zeffers last request the madness of the devils country had put it out of her head suppose i said i knew a way to get them into the house tammy said is that possible its possible tammy said cautiously he went back to the door hed just stepped through how he asked lowering his voice tammy was still uncertain of his allegiances she didnt want to tell him everything in case he was still going to side with katya but on the other hand she needed his help its just something somebody told me she said she wanted to believe she had him on her side but she was far from certain katya was calling from the stairs again todd have you got her close the door tammy said keep her out she started to look around the kitchen which of the drawers was most likely to contain a knife a good strong steak knife no better a fatbladed chopping knife something that wouldnt snap under pressure todd katya sounded as though she was in the hallway close the door tammy said please todd glanced back in katyas direction then god bless him he closed the door what are you doing tammy heard her say its all right todd called back to her tammy started going through the drawers as quickly as possible there seemed to be dozens of them did she want aluminum foil and plastic bags no spoons and ladles no cutlery there were a few knives in here but they were too flimsy for her purposes she needed a blade she could use to dig at the wood if she didnt get the icons out of the threshold the ghosts would stay out there todd let me in you have to go todd said to tammy not until ive got a yes a knife the ninth drawer she opened was a treasure trove of knives large small middlesized knowing she could only have a few seconds left before katya came in tammy simply gathered up a handful of knivesfive or sixand headed back to the passageway as she reached the door she heard katyas voice from across the room you think youre going to save yourself with those tammy looked back over her shoulder katya had pushed the door open and shoved todd aside raising her hands as she approached ready to take tammy by the throat todd raced ahead of her to stand between the two women hey now he said lets just calm down nobodys going to hurt anybody katya seemed to listen to him her agitation quieted all right she said looking at todd with wide dark eyes what do you suggest tammy didnt trust this little performance at all but it gave her time to back off towards the door as she reached it one of her hastilycollected knives slipped from her hand she bent down to pick it up and in attempting to do so lost her grip on all the others she cursed as they went spinning across the polished tiles in all directions pick them up todd katya said later todd replied his tone still mellow in response she slapped him hard across his alreadywounded face striking blood from it i want them picked up he stared at her for a minute then very calmly he caught hold of her hand and said dont do that you want to hit me back katya said go on if thats what you want to do then do it no you wont will you youre too damn weak all you men too damn weak as if to prove the point she pulled her hand out of todds grip and pushed past him heading straight for tammy faced with the choice of waiting a few seconds to see if todd would come to her rescue or making an escape while she could tammy snatched up the first knife to hand which was neither the largest nor toughest of the blades and made a run for the door katya came after her tammy stumbled as she got up and katya would probably have caught up with her if todd hadnt finally found the courage to put his arms around katya from behind and hold her back all right he yelled to tammy go tammy didnt need a second invitation she ran out into the passage and slammed the door after her it had a lock but regrettably no key she looked down the passageway to the back door there was a glass panel in it the glass wasnt flawless but it was clear enough for tammy to see the shapes of the ghosts assembled like a pack of hungry dogs eager to be let into the house she could hear the odd listless murmuring they made the words like objects that had been used so many times they had lost all their shape did they know somehow that she was on her way to let them in was that why their murmuring became a little more urgent as she opened the door and the silvery stare in their eyes a little brighter wait she said to them im going to do this but you have to wait there was noise from the kitchen behind her plainly katya was attempting to persuade todd to go and fetch herprobably kill her tammy couldnt make sense of the words and that was probably for the best she couldnt afford to be panicked any more than she already was or shed screw this up tammy glanced back over her shoulder to check that katya wasnt already in the passageway then she went down on her hands and knees and examined the threshold the wood was worn with time and rot had got into it softening it she ran her fingers over the full length of it clearing away the dirt the area smelt vaguely of vomit but she supposed that was the rot she was smelling at three or four inch intervals along the length of the threshold there were metal markers like nails with large elaborately configured heads hammered into the timber she dug around one of them with the nail of her forefinger it seemed very solidly imbedded in the wood but she had no doubt she was on the right track meddling with these things because as soon as she started to do so the ghosts murmuring became almost reverent in tone worshipful she looked up at them the light they emitted had grown brighter either that or theyd narrowed their eyes yes that was it they narrowed their eyes to study what she was doing this is it isnt it they answered the only way they could they fell completely silent this was not a procedure they wanted to put at risk by making so much as a single sound there were five icons in the threshold the middle one slightly bigger than the other four which was a circle with two irregularlyshaped arms coming from it at noon and seven oclock on its dial she dug her knife into the centre of the symbol okay she said softly to it out you come the wood was so wormy it crumbled beneath her knifepoint she dug deeper exposing parts of the icon that were still dean it gave off a subtle iridescence like motherofpearl her confidence growing she kept digging until she had cleared the wood away around the whole thing then she put her knifetip under the rim and tried to lever it out much to her disappointment it wouldnt budge not even a little bit damn she said softly she worked at it a little more then remembered the old school adage trotted out before every test if you cant answer the first question dont waste time on it move on to the next one thats what she did she moved left and started to stab at the wood around the icon at the far end of the row if anything the threshold was even more rotted here than it was at the centre the wood came away in fat splinters there was more noise from the kitchen shouting now but she ignored it just kept digging bigger splinters flew she felt a rush of certainty she was going to do this she pressed the knife under the edge of the icon there was a moment of resistance then the pressure of the blade on a nerve in her hand sent a spasm of pain up her arm she yelped and in the same moment the icon jumped free of the wood landing on the tile outside the din from the kitchen suddenly became very specific she heard todd say dont do that it was a voice shed never heard from him before not even in a movie there was fear in his voice something katya was doing or was about to do had made him afraid not a very comforting thought without wasting time looking over her shoulder she quickly went to the other end of the threshold and started to work there though there was plenty of light between the trees she was cold there was a length of clammy flesh down her spine and another across her shoulderblades as though somebody had painted a cold cross on her skin her teeth chattered lightly but again she was in luck the wood around the icon came away in three or four large pieces she pressed the knife as deep under the device as it would go and levered the thing shifted instantly and as it did so the same spasm shed felt before ran up her arm it wasnt a nerve she was striking she realized it was a jolt of energy given off by the metalwork as it was levered out it hurt so much she dropped the knife for a moment to massage her hand her fingers were getting numb she looked up at her silent witnesses yes i know she said hurry up i know she picked up the knife again and moved left long strips of splinters had already come out of the wood at that end so some of the work was done and now she had a technique she ferreted around with the knifepoint close to the metal looking for a weakness then she dug out a few large pieces of wood and went in for the kill the third one was the easiest so far except for the pain which was excruciating it ran all the way up to her shoulder joint and into her neck her hand was beginning to feel stupid with numbness still there were only two icons left to move surely they werent beyond her capabilities some instinct made her go back to the middle icon thinking that she might get lucky but it was a waste of time the damn thing was as immovable as it had been previously she went on to the right of it and dug around the second of the remaining pair the wood was just as vulnerable as it had been on the other side but her numbed muscles were nowhere near as strong now as theyd been a minute ago she took both hands to the blade but she wasnt as smart with her left hand as she was with her right and it added little by way of leverage her breath was coming in short gasps her frustration mounting she glanced up at the ghosts as though the fierceness of their need to be inside would lend her some strength to her surprise she found that one of them had come forward and crouched down to examine one of the icons it apparently carried no power now that it was out of its place in line like a letter lifted from a curseword and rendered harmless the man was so close to her she could have touched him if shed raised her hand very quietly the dead man spoke the bitch is coming he said tammy glanced over her shoulder there was nobody in the passageway behind her yet but now nor was there any sound from the kitchen still she didnt doubt that what the man had said was true she willed her hands to grasp the knife a little harder and they seemed to oblige her just a little she pushed the blade deeper into the wood and the icon shifted she twisted and felt what was by now a familiar jolt of power from the metalwork this time it passed through both hands the icon was spat from the wood and fell spinning on the tiles but she had no reason to celebrate her hand was now so weak that the knife fell from her grip and clattered on the floor between her knees there was now no feeling remaining in her right hand and her left was not going to be much use to her on the remaining icon still what choice did she have she picked the knife up in her left hand anyway and using the numbed wrist of her right guided it to the hole shed dug around the central icon perhaps if she just wriggled the point of the blade around for long enough shed locate a weak spot she leaned forward to put the weight of her body into the calculation come on she murmured to it you sonofabitchmove for momma there was a sound behind her a soft sound a groan she looked back fearing the worst and the worst it was todd had swung around the doorjamb coming from the kitchen his hand clutching his lower belly there was blood running between his fingers and blood on his trousers a lot of it she stabbed me he said his tone one of near disbelief he kept his eyes fixed on tammy as though he couldnt bear to inspect the damage oh jesus she stabbed me he leaned forward and for a moment tammy thought he was simply going to fall over but he reached out and caught hold of the lips of one of the four alcoves carved into the walls of the passageway you have to get out of here he said to tammy she got to her feet ready to help him but he waved her away just go before she comes he would have said but it was academic katya was there already coming round the corner the knife in her hand his blood on it todd turned back to look at her she was moving at her old leisurely pace as though they had all the time in the world to play out the last reel of this tragedy todd reached into the alcove and found an antique pitcher there his body blocked what he was doing from katyas view but even if shed seen what he was up to tammy thought she would have still kept coming she had the knife after all and more than that she had the certainty that todd had nowhere else to go nowhere to fall finally except into her arms into her knife that was what the pace of her approach announced that she expected him to die in her embrace todd grasped the pitcher and swung it round it caught katyas shoulder and shattered shards of ceramic flying up into her face the impact was sufficient to throw her back against the wall and the knife dropped from her hand but the effort had used up a significant part of what was left of todds energies he stumbled across the passageway his arms outstretched and fell against the opposite wall his face was ashen his teeth clenchedhis eyelids lazy with pain let them in he murmured to tammy what are you waiting for let them in at the other end of the passageway tammy felt katyas gaze fix on her a ceramic chip had nicked the skin beneath her eye a single drop of blood ran down over her flawless cheek she didnt trouble herself to wipe it away she simply dropped to her haunches and casually picked up the knife even in the chaos of her thoughts the symmetry of all this was not lost on tammy two women each with a knife and dying between them the man theyd both loved or imagined they had as tammys mother had been fond of saying when the subject of love had come up in conversation as it would from time to time itll all end in tears well so it had and more to come no doubt plenty more to come she tore her gaze from katya picked up the knife with her left hand and guided it with her right back to the assaulted wood around the middle icon again she leaned into the task put every pound to work she twisted the knife to the left a few small sprinters came away she twisted again this time to the right wanting nothing in the world as much as she wanted that sickening jolt through her bones she could see more of the icons depth now embedded in the wood it went far deeper than the others she saw that was why it refused to budge it wasnt just wider it was longer she glanced up at the ghosts theyd missed nothing of what was going on in the passageway eyes like slits theyd all come a little closer to the threshold daring its consequences behind her todd said tammy he was sliding down the wall his gaze fixed on her katya had apparently used the knife on him again but hadnt lingered to finish him off she was moving past him her eyes on tammy itll all end in tears tammy murmured herself and then turned one last time to the challenge of the central icon for the last time she threw her weight down upon it using her weakened left hand and her benumbed right to twist the knifeblade in the groove beneath the metal ridge another two or three small splinters came away come on she begged please god move katya was right behind her now she could feel her presence at her back and of course tammy was a perfect target right now but there wasnt a thing in hell she could do about that not if she wanted to keep going keep pushing keep hoping the damn thing would it moved she looked down at the icon and yes god love it the thing had lifted out of the wood a little scarcely at all in truth but movement was movement she twisted again using what little strength her left hand had and suddenly the jolt came up out of the icon with such force that it threw her backwards so that she landed in front of katya deposited before her like a sacrificial lamb the pain in her hands and her arms was so severe this time that she had difficulty staying conscious the image of katya loomed above her knife in hand blotches of darkness invaded it from the corners of her sight but she held on by force of will determined not to lie there passively while katya leaned over and slit her throat you interesting bitch katya said raising the knife she took hold of tammys hair pulling back her head to expose her throat but before she could deliver the cut something else drew her attention it seemed she had not realized until this moment that all her defenses had been breached jesus christ she said weak as she was tammy was still capable of feeling a little satisfaction as she saw the look on katyas face go from murderous intent to puzzlement and thenvery suddenlyto fear what have you done she murmured tammy didnt have the energy or the wit for a pithy reply but she didnt really need one events would speak for themselves now the door was open and the threshold cleared after years of frustration and exile katyas longneglected guests were coming back to reacquaint themselves with the mysteries of the devils country part ten and the dead came in one they came almost silently at first and cautiously as though even now they suspected katya had laid some trap to catch them once they were inside the house but as soon as four or five of them were safely over the threshold and it became obvious that there were no traps their silence erupted into a horrid din of triumph and their caution turned into an ungainly torrent of desperate spirits all struggling to get through the door at the same time though tammys consciousness was still slippery she had enough strength left to protect her face from the feet of those coming through rolling herself into a semifetal position to avoid the worst there were so many revenants and the door through which they were attempting to pass was so narrow that impatience soon ignited amongst the crowd arguments became physical assaults as the stronger pushed the weaker aside so they could be the first down the stairs the first through the door that would take them into the devils country tammy had her hands over her face but between her fingers she saw katya put up a vain protest against this invasion she shouted something but it was lost in the din of triumph and argument a moment later she was too was lost as the wave of exiles threw themselves against her and carried her away this time tammy did hear her though it was not a word she uttered but a scream a furious scream they were in her dream palace these things which had once been her friends her beautiful friends the virile and the beautiful deities of a lost golden age reduced by hunger and despair to the filleted smeared wasted dregs of humanity now bore her away the noises they made as they cameand came and camewere some of the most distressing sounds tammy had ever heard slaughterhouse shrieks and plaguepit moans chattering and curses that were more like the din out of a padded cell than anything that should have come from an assembly of oncesophisticated souls finally however the noise and the kicking of her body by passing feet slowed and ceased the procession of the dead had passed over the threshold along the corridor and into the house it had taken perhaps five minutes to get the entire assembly inside now they were gone the passageway was deserted except for tammy and todd tammy waited another minute or two before gathering the strength to unknot her weary limbs and roll herself over she gave thanks as she did so to her mother of all people who had been an unpleasant piece of work but had possessed the constitution of a horse which tammy had inherited most of the women tammy knew would not have survived the brutal physical assaults and violations that had punctuated the adventures of her last few days thanks to momma tammy had she fixed her gaze on todd who had apparently also survived both katyas attack and the revenants tide he was halfsitting halfslumped against the wall further down the passageway staring at the alcove from which hed grabbed the antique pitcher his breathing was ragged but at least he was still alive it was a short drive to cedarssinai from here if she could get help to carry him to the car she crawled over to him he was doing nothing to staunch the wounds the blood was pulsing out of him he saw her coming from the corner of his eye very slowly he turned his head towards her you let them in he said yes i let them in youhad it planned all along then not really it was zeffers idea he made a long soft moan as he saw the neatness of this zeffer the first exile from the dream palace zeffer whod been the bitchgoddesss dog finally become her undoer and tammy his agent so you were in this together he said ill tell you about it later right now we should get out of here he made a very small very weary shake of his head i dont thinkill be going anywhere anytime soon she meant to kill me and im afraidshe has she knew in the end id sided with you and that meant id betrayed her you didnt yes i did i knew the last thing she wanted was that the ghosts get in he shook his head his eyes sliding closed but i had to it was the right thing he opened his eyes again and looked down at the blood and her killing me that was right too christ no its allended upthe way it should dont say that tammy murmured its not over yet she pushed herself up onto her knees then grabbed hold of the edge of one of the alcoves and hauled herself to her feet the numbness was passing from her hands now they simply tingled as though theyd been trapped under her while she slept from outside she heard the sound of footsteps and she looked round to see maxine stumbling up the steps from the garden in a state of total disarray in any other circumstance tammy might have found the sight funny maxines clothes were torn her face scratched and grimy but right now she was just one more victim of katya of the house of the canyon my god she said seeing todd sitting there the blood pooling on the floor what the hell happened katya tammy said it was all the explanation she had energy for once over the threshold maxine closed the door and locked it her hands trembling theres things out there yes i know they killed sawyer for a moment it looked as though she was going to succumb to tears but she fought them off and came along the passageway her expression turning from one of imminent tears to shock wait she said is that todd was he that unrecognizable tammy thought it seemed he was in the hours since maxine had last set eyes on him todd taken a hell of a beating by the sea by eppstadt by katya now he looked like a boxer whod gone twenty rounds with a man twice his strength both his eyes puffed up his lower lip was swollen and jutting his whole face a mass of colors bruises old and new cuts old and new all spattered with dried mud looking at him afresh with maxines appalled gaze tammy realized that she could have shown this poor broken face to a thousand members of the todd pickett appreciation society and not a single one would have known who they were looking at and that probably included herself how far theyd all fallen the gods and their admirers both we have to get an ambulance up here maxine said she bent down to speak to todd were getting an ambulance no he said weakly lifting his hand stay with me maxine looked at tammy who gave her a small nod maxine took hold of todds hand what happened to eppstadt maxine asked last time i saw him he was in hell tammy replied there was something rather satisfying about being able to say that even if she didnt really know what theyd all experienced behind that door downstairs whatever it was it was real her breast still tingled from the goatboys suckling and the woman katya i dont know where she went but if youll take care of todd id like to find out todd gave his own misshapen reply to this suggestion becareful as he spoke he raised his free hand in tammys direction it was impossible to interpret the expression on his face but the fact that he was afraid for her spoke volumes and she in her turn was afraid afraid that if she didnt find some excuse to leave now shed be left here watching him die she pressed his fingers and he returned the pressure its good he said better see that bitch she nodded and headed off back down the passageway as she went she heard maxine dialing on her portable phone which had apparently survived the traumas of her journey through the wilderness behind the house there was a calamitous din corning from the centre of the house it sounded as though a hurricane had been loosed down there and was moving from room to room getting stronger as its frustration mounted tammy went to the stairwell and stood there for a few moments letting the tears fall why not why the hell not what crazy person wouldnt weep when theyd turned over the rock of the world and theyd seen what was there crawling around the dead the nearly dead and the sorrow of every damn thing it wasnt just todd she was weeping for she was shedding a tear it seemed for everyone shed ever known for arnie for gods sake who one night had told her how his grandfather otis when he was in his cups would burn the eightyearold arnies knuckles with cigarettes for the fun of it and how arnie had said it was good theyd never have children because he was afraid hed end up doing the same for the dead whod waited outside this insane asylum for so long waiting for their chance to get back over the threshold and now they were in they werent happy because what theyd come in search of was gone that was their noise she knew their fury circling below their frustration mounting with every turn for todds and all the imperfect people whod loved him because theyd thought he was made of purer stuff than they all the worshippers whod sent him messages through her begging him just to drop them a note pick up the phone tell them that he knew they existed shed been one of those people herself once upon a time in a way shed been the worst of them in fact because although shed got so close to understanding the ways of this grotesque town and known it was a crock of deceits and stupidities instead of turning her back on it all burning todds pictures and getting herself a life worth living shed let herself become a propagator of the great lie shed done it in part because it made her feel important but more because shed wanted todd to be the real thing the dream come true alive in the same imperfect world shed lived in but better than that dirty disappointing world and having once decided to believe that lie she had to keep on believing it because once he fell from grace there was nothing left to believe in itll all end in tears as her mother had been wont to say and tammy had despised the woman for her lack of faith in things for her cynical certainty that everything was bound to sorrow but in the end shed been right tammy was standing in the creaking raging ruins of that terrible truth tears on her own face shed for just about everything shed ever known she wiped her cheeks and looked down the stairwell the last time shed looked shed seen jerry sprawled at the bottom another one of katyas victims but now he was gone she didnt want to call his name that risked drawing katyas attention and if she was in the vicinity tammy had already had enough of her to last several lifetimes she ventured cautiously down the stairs holding the banisters with both hands the wood reverberated beneath her palms shaken by the noise of the dead about halfway down she felt a rush of icy air erupt from the stairwell and a heartbeat later a flood of forms returned from the passageway that led to the devils country the revenantsor at least some of themwere coming back the way theyd come tammy let go of the banister and threw herself against the wall as half a dozen of the phantoms came roaring up the stairs gone she heard one of them saying its voice a mournful howl gone more revenants were emerging from the devils country now all in a similar state of fury one of them began to dig at the ground at the bottom of the stairs with his bare hands attacking the boards with such violence they cracked then he tore them up obviously looking for what was already lost tammy stayed glued to the wall and in that state slid down to the bottom of the flight to see if she could spot jerry zeffers body had been shoved aside by the passage of the ghosts and lay face down in the corner of the stairwell looking in the other direction she saw that the door to the devils country was throwing itself open and closed slamming with such violence that its framework had cracked so had the plaster overhead the light had dropped out of its fixture and was dangling along with a clod of plaster from a bare wire describing a figure of eight in the air as it swung it wouldnt have been tammys first preference to venture any closer to the slamming door than shed already come but as shed left the responsibility of todd with maxine she knew it fell to her to protect jerry the ghosts wouldnt hurt her she hoped as long as she didnt get in their way shed done nothing to harm them if anything she should be their heroine but in their present state of high frustration she wasnt sure they knew the difference between those who were on their side and those who werent they simply wanted to know where their longawaited paradise had gone apparently some of them were certain it had been removed to some other part of the house to trick them hence this crazy tearing up of the floor and smashing of the walls it was here somewhere and they were going to tear up the fabric of the house until they found it two of these berserkers emerged from the room their faces smears of fury and raced past her up the stairs she waited until theyd disappeared and then she went to the door with the light swinging giddily overhead the passageway pitched like a funhouse ride she closed her eyes to snatch a muchneeded moment of stillness then opened them and without waiting for the door to stop its lunatic slamming she pushed it open and stepped into the space that had once been called the devils country maxine had had occasion to lie to todd many times over the course of their working life together but she had never lied more profoundly than when shed told himthat day shed announced she was no longer working for himthat there were more like him available on every plane the image of hordes of potential todd picketts just waiting to be picked out of the hopefuls who flew into lax every hour had been cruel nonsense sure there were always goodlookers in any bunch sometimes beauties and sometimesthough very rarelya beauty had some innate talent but very few who came to tinseltown hoping to snatch the brass ring had what the young todd had possessed the kind of effortless charm that an entire generation men and women both could fall in love with hed been that rarest of things a universal object of desire of course it didnt take much to taint such purity but todd had been lucky though in private hed often been sour envious and scornful maxine had successfully kept all that from the fans todds image had remained damn near perfect his only enemy was time and even that in the end wouldnt have mattered if hed allowed it to take its toll without shame look at paul newman practically sainted at seventy it would have been the same for todd people would have loved him as he grew old the way they loved certain songs because he was part of who they were maxine could have said all of this to him on the beach if shed been prepared to eat enough humble pie her words might have even persuaded him not to go into the water with katya and what a lot of grief that would have prevented but instead shed been stupid and let the lie stand and now they were here at the end of it all and what had their petty warring earned them well a lot of things shed have preferred never to have experienced being out in the back yard with the ghosts for one that had been almost more than her sanity could endure seeing sawyer torn apart that way was a horror shed never be able to get out of her head and then to make her way back through the undergrowth while some of his mutilators stalked her sniffing after her as though they were dogs in heat and she the local bitch there were no words for the horror of that and finally this coming back inside the house to find todd as near dead as made no difference his face covered in wounds his body all cut up the emergency services were on their way but even if the canyon had been easy to find which of course it wasnt she didnt have much hope that theyd make it in time to help him he made a noise his eyes fluttering can you hear me todd theres an ambulance on its way for a moment his eyes opened a little wider and he seemed to be making an effort to concentrate on the face in front of him its maxine she said remember me there was no recognition in his eyes his breathing which had steadily become shallower was now so shallow she could scarcely see his chest rising and falling she dropped her head towards his and spoke softly into his ear as if to a child please dont go she said to him youre strong you dont have to die here if you dont want to he opened his mouth a little his breath smelt metallic as though hed just swallowed a mouthful of old pennies she thought he intended to tell her something and put her ear to his lips his mouth continued to move but no sound came out except the wet sounds of his throat and tongue working she was bent forward for perhaps half a minute hoping for something from him but the posture was making her back creak so she sat up again in the fifteen seconds it took her to lift herself up from her bowed position and sit up straight the man she was tending died it was only when she started to speak to himjust repeating his name in the hope that she might get some response from himthat she realized every trace of animation had gone out of him very tenderly she put her hand up to todds battered face and touched his cheek many times over the years shed gone on set to find that the makeup people had given him swellings or wounds that had looked grotesquely realistic but theyd always been movie wounds however bloody they gotand however much he was supposed to have suffered in their gettingthey were never disfiguring the todd pickett whom audiences had come to see with his bluegreen eyes his dark lush hair his symmetryhis smilenone of that was ever spoiled but this lying before her this was a different spectacle entirely once she had closed his eyes there was nothing left visible of the todd pickett the world had loved she extricated herself from beneath his corpse with some difficulty it bothered her to be leaving his body just sprawled here in the passageway in such an undignified manner but she didnt know what else to do she needed to find tammy jerry and a vodka not necessarily in that order anyway she thought as she looked down at the corpse what the hell did todd care where he was lying he was gone hopefully about some better business than the rest of the ghosts who lingered around this damnable house the thought of themof the undeniable fact of them which shed witnessed just a few minutes beforemade her heart quicken if the dead lived on after their demise did that mean that was todds spirit in the vicinity right now hovering around before he decided where he was headed she could feel herself blushing with selfconsciousness wondering what shed done in the few minutes since his passing that he might have witnessed had she said anything asinine or let go of some gas in her nervousness feeling a little foolish but knowing she couldnt take a step without speaking she said todd are you here then she waited looking around a fly had buzzed in from the back yard where the door was still open and it now landed in the pooling blood between todds legs where it supped eagerly she bent down and shooed it away it rose giddily into the air as though stupefied by the sheer scale of the feast that lay below she swatted at it with the back of her hand and to her surprise she struck it down it went on its back its buzz suddenly manic as it careened around on the tile beside todds body had maxine been a deeper thinker she would perhaps have hesitated to kill the thing but thered never been any room for metaphysics in her life and though she might once have heard in conversation that in some cultures a fly attending on a corpse must be treated reverentially in case it carried the soul of the deceased such possibilities were very remote from her way of thinking she put her foot down on the upturned fly without a moments hesitation and headed back into the kitchen two the tiled room was hazy when tammy stepped inside though the walls were now quite solidshe could see the grout between the tiles and the cracks on the surfaces of the tilesthere was a dense cold fog in the place which made deep breathing difficult and seeing any great distance more difficult still the air smelt rank like a very intense mildew apparently one of the illusions the room had been capable of creating was the illusion of smell there had been the fragrance of greenery in here when shed last entered the smell of rain on leaves and damp earth and the pungent aroma of horse manure from a dump left by one of the dukes horses but apparently all that had been masking the real smell of the place which was this smothering fungoid stench she advanced cautiously fearful of suddenly encountering somebody in the fog and not leaving herself time to retreat she could hear the ghosts now and again their howls and their complaints strobed through the fogthickened air making it hard for her to judge their distance for safetys sake she kept one of the walls in sight to her left as a point of reference it possessed only a shadow of its former genius for deception the landscape that had once seemed so real was now reduced to outlines even these were not complete in some places they had deteriorated to near abstractions in others theyd gone entirely but then in other places there were still large expanses of paintwork intact where she could make out the whole visual structure of a picture in one place there were tufts of grass and small white flowers that spreading from the bottom of the walls across the ground creating the illusion that the visitor was walking over fertile ground in another rocks and boulders were strewn about some cracked open by ambitious shrubs which had settled in their cracks as seeds and more distantly here and there she could still see copses and forests roads and rivers which cloudshadows had once passed over most convincingly and beasts had haunted and men lived and died in the hues of all these fragments of the country had faded needless to say burned away by the unveiled sun all the richness of the rendering all the detail of the painters craft was lost what remained was almost as simple as the outlines in a childs coloring book once in a while as she walked the fog would become a little thinner overhead and shed catch a glimpse of the ceiling it was in much the same state as the walls and floor the outlines of cloud formations were still visible but without the brushwork and colour to lend them life they looked even more abstracted than the landscape just meaningless shapes only the sun whose appearance had begun the process of destruction retained some lifelike qualities the brightness it shed was sickly however as though it was blazing too brightly to stay aloft and alight for long and would soon be consumed by its own fever and still she walked with the wall on her left certain that shed soon come to the corner of the room but the journey went on and on much to her astonishment the room must truly have been enormous as zeffer had boasted she remembered the pride on his face when hed described how theyd built the room how the tiles had been numbered so that they could be put up in the exact order hed found them in only now with the deceptions of the room removed did she better understand why hed felt such pride the achievement had been substantial lunatic but substantial finally the wall turned a corner leading away from her which was a surprise she began to wonder if this search wasnt becoming foolhardy how much further should she explore hugging the wall for securitys sake but getting further and further away from the door should she take a chance and step out into the dark featureless fog hoping her sense of direction would guide her back to the place shed come from no that wasnt sensible she decided on the more conservative option she simply turned on her heel and putting the wall that had been on her left on her right returned the way shed come her only concession to risk was to venture perhaps six or seven yards from the wall which put it at the limit of her sight given the density of the mist in this manner she proceeded tentatively back the way shed come the trek back to the door was not the uneventful journey the outward bound trip had been shed taken perhaps five strides from the turnabout spot when she heard the whooping clamor of ghosts and a body of themsmeared together in their grief melded it seemed into one furious beingappeared from the fog their faces were bitter turned down mouths and burning cold blue eyes like the luminous eyes of deepsea fish shed not been terrified of them at the threshold but she was terrified now not because they would see her and recognize her and blame her for the absence of their consolation but because they could catch her up in their momentum and carry her away with them she instinctively dropped to the ground as they approached and they moved on past her wailing and cursing she heard cracking sounds as they passed by and when theyd gone she saw that the tiles which theyd passed over had shattered she stayed pressed on the ground while the fog roiled around her afraid that theyd come back they didnt return thank god but it was clear that this wasnt a safe place to be she could hear other packs of ghosts roving around in the fog making their own terrifying din the fog she assumed had delayed their full realization that this place was a shadow of its former self that was why some of them kept on searching hoping that the power theyd fed on in the good old days was still here somewhere of course it was not and by degrees the bitter word was spreading so that each of the groups searching the room slowly grasped the disastrous truth and as soon as they did they went crazy tammy she looked up close to the ground the fog thinned somewhat and she could see twice as far as she could see when standing and there at the limit of her vision lying on the ground like her was jerry brahms oh thank god there was a dark smear on his face which she guessed was blood otherwise he seemed to be all right he crawled towards her on his belly like a soldier under fire as she approached she saw that the smear was indeed blood its source the patch of skin which katya had torn out of his scalp when he reached her he caught hold of her hand my dear thank the lord youre still alive i feared the worst i truly did somebody let the ghosts in that was me in gods name why because todd wanted me to she said it wasnt the whole truth of course but it was enough for now where is todd she looked away from him just for a moment it was all she needed to do oh lord no not my todd she stabbed him katya stabbed him why its too complicated well later then wheres katya now i think shes in here somewhere so why did you come down whyd you think to find you oh you sweet he grasped her hand hard now can we please go she said do you know the way to the door she glanced over her shoulder the wall shed strayed from was still visible yes i think so back to the wall make a right and then we follow it until we reach the door which will be on the left very organized i hope im right tammy said she started to get to her feet jerry tried to persuade her back down on the ground im too big to be crawling around like this she said jerry nodded and you know what im too old he said if she sees us she sees us yes he scrambled to his feet and together they headed back to the relative security of the wall there were noises from every direction some were theby nowfamiliar cries of frustrated ghosts but there were now also sounds of mounting destruction the revenants were venting their fury by taking the room apart tammy could hear them tearing at the walls bringing down waves of tiles and after the shrill crash of breaking tiles came the deeper din of wood beams being smashed timber wrenched from timber with the squeal of unseated nails tammy and jerry stayed close to the wall but the air was quickly filling with particles of dust which suggested the destruction was getting closer to them it was impossible to tell from which direction perhaps from all may i tammy said slipping her hand into jerrys be my guest the door was in sight now and though the din was sickening tammy dared to think they might get out of this alive with a little luck no sooner had it crossed her mind than there was a massive disturbance in the fog close byso large a disturbance that the fog actually parted like a pair of drawn drapes tammy dragged jerry back the way theyd come two or three steps no more as she did so the ghosts came out of the gaping fog and flung themselves at the wall around the door they tore at itand at the wall surrounding itwith such force that part of the ceiling above the door came crashing down pieces of shattered tiles splintered wood and plaster flew in all directions tammy and jerry turned away and shielded their faces a barrage of shards peppered their backs when the noise of the demolition ceased and tammy looked back a haze of plaster dust had replaced the fog she inhaled and it caught in her throat reducing her to a coughing tearful mess jerry was in the same or worse condition tammy spat out a mouthful of the white soot and wiped her eyes with the heel of her hand not the smartest thing to do she felt plaster particles scrape between her irises and her lids a new flood of tears came as she wiped them away she felt jerry catch hold of her arm seizing her so hard that she stopped coughing and blinked the tears out of her eyes to cleanse them then she looked round at him the ghosts whod demolished the wall were now tearing at the exposed substructure of the wall reducing it to sprinters but it wasnt the scene of destruction jerry was looking at he was staring ahead back towards the centre of the room she always knew how to make an entrance he whispered tammy followed his gaze the drapes of mist were beginning to close again slowly but walking up between them like a diva preparing to take her place centrestage and armed for this final scene with the knife shed used to stab todd was katya lupi three hello tammy she said i suppose you thought you were going to get out of here alive well youre not sorry to disappoint you enoughs enough katya jerry said doing his best to sound authoritative oh you know me better than that jerry katya replied enoughs never been enough for me she looked at tammy did he tell you i took his virginity no he didnt well i did he was a sad little thirteen year old with a dick about as big as this she waggled her pinkie do i exaggerate jerry she went on her tone darkening jerry said nothing all that ive done for you and youre ready to creep away ready to leave me alone thats all you men ever do isnt it you creep away not todd tammy said todd wanted to trust you shut up you couldnt possibly understand what was between us she pointed the bloody knife at jerry but you you understood you knew how id been deserted in the past this was the big scene tammy thought no doubt about that and she was playing it for all she was worth as though she could finally be absolved of all shed done in the name of deserted womanhood youre pathetic tammy cried why dont you do something useful with that knife and slit your fucking wrists oh no this isnt the end for me katya replied calmly this is the end for him and for you she poked the knife in tammys general direction your miserable lives are certainly over but not me i was always a chameleon wasnt i jerry from picture to picture didnt i change he didnt reply to her but she pressed the point as though she simply sought verification of the truth well didnt i she said grant me that much yes he said as though to silence her so ill change again ill go out into the world and ill be somebody new theres a whole new life still waiting to be lived not a hope in hell tammy said what let it go tammy jerry said why she may look like a million dollars but shes just a slice of the same stale ham that she ever was you know what i love movies even the silent ones like broken blossoms i love broken blossoms it still makes me cry theres some heart in it something real but yourflicks she laughed shaking her head theyre dead you see thats the paradox mary pickfords gone and fairbanks and barrymore theyre all gone but they live on because they made people laugh and cry whereas you youre alive and the shit you made isnt worth a damn thats not true katya said jerry tell her yes jerry tammy said quietly tell her the truth is that youre not remembered quite as well as i may have lets not tell any more lies tammy said grimly she looked at katya nobody knows who the fuck you are katya looked at tammy for a moment and then back to jerry who shook his head if they knew tammy said dont you think somebody would have recognized you when you came to get todd katya looked down at the cracked floor she was absolutely still except for her right hand which was idly judging the heft of the knife when she looked up again her face carrying a radiant smile all right enough recriminations weve said our hard words now we must begin to forgive tammy looked at her with incredulity how many faces did this woman have theres going to be no forgiving here she said will you shut up katya snapped passing her hand over her brow the smile dropped away for a moment and there was a terrible vacuity in its place as though the masks however many there were concealed nothing at all but she put the smile on again a little more tentatively and looked at jerry im in need of your help she said your help and your forgiveness please she opened her arms jerry for old times sake i gave you a life didnt i being up here with me wasnt it something to live for jerry took a long time to answer then he said you smell of death katya please jerry dont be cruel yes ive hurt a lot of people i realize that nobody regrets that necessity more than i do but right from the beginning i was trapped what could i do zeffer was the one who brought the hunt into this house not me i knew nothing about it how can i be blamed for that i think they blame you jerry said nodding past katya at the nowstilled fog or rather at what it concealed at some point in this exchange the revenants had left off their demolition their fury momentarily calmed as they listened to katyas selfjustification many of them had been physically intertwined earlier but they had separated themselves from one another and shrouded by the fog listened to the woman play her parts they were your guests jerry said to katya some of them were great actors if they were so great why did they become addicted so easily so did you he reminded her but the room was mine they were just people who just passed through yes some of them were casual friends some of them were even casual lovers but once they were dead they were nothing i knew you were going to say that eventually tammy said you selfish bitch jesus katya said i have heard enough of you she lifted her knife and came at tammy in two seconds she would have had the blade buried in tammys heart but before she could reach her target somebody stepped out of the mist and knocked the knife from her hand it spun on the tile but katya was quick she ducked down and snatched it up again her gaze going to the figure who had stepped into her path he had opened his arms as though to formally present himself to her rudy she said the man in front of her bowed his gleaming head katya he replied tammy couldnt see his face but she thought there some sorrow in the syllables whether for her or for himself who could say hed no sooner spoken than from another spot close to the door somebody else spoke her name this second voice was heavier than valentinos there was more anger in it than melancholy remember me he said doug fairbanks katya turned doug i didnt realize you were here too and me came a third voice this time a woman clara katya said of course the speaker walked up to katya as she spoke her stride remarkably confident she was a shadow of her former self but tammy would still have recognized the face of clara bow the beestung lips the high curved brows the wide eyes once filled with innocent highspirits but not now now they burned katya glanced over her shoulder please clara she said dont come so close why should you care how close we get clara bow said yes came a fourth voice youre not to blame remember anyway came a fifth voice were nothing nothing said a sixth voice and a seventh katya turned swinging her weapon in a wide arc even so it missed its several marks the ghosts were too quick for her she was sluggish even in her fury besides tammy thought what possible harm could a kitchen knife do upon these creatures yes they had a corporeal existence no question of that but they wereas far as she understood itspirit presences made of ether and memory these people couldnt die they were already dead long long dead and they were assembling now in even greater numbers having apparently given up on looking for the devils country it was gone the evidence of which was the fading lines on the walls of this melancholy chamber all that remained by way of satisfaction if that was the word was to punish the woman who had kept them outside in her joyless canyon for so many seasons holding on to the hope that they would one day be let back in to the house to satisfy their craving for the solace of their addiction katya was well aware that she was in jeopardy and hopelessly outnumbered while still holding the knife she raised both hands in a vague gesture of surrender the dead seemed not to care their pale faces which had always looked impersonal were nowin the presence of the woman who had once been their confidanteassembling fragments of forgotten particularities it was like a room full of alzheimers patients recovering in the presence of some person theyd known well what theyd previously lost themselves their eyes which had been little more than lights in their heads took on a specific shape and color their mouths which had been slits bloomed into sensuality tammy didnt think any of these reconfigurations were good news for katya unobtrusively she caught hold of the back of jerrys shirt and gently eased him out of katyas immediate vicinity she moved him not a moment too soon an instant later one of the ghosts came barreling out of the mist and caught hold of katya tammy didnt see the attackers face but she heard the guttural cry which escaped him as he swung his captive around to face the fog katya struggled but he had her arms pinned behind her and despite her considerable strength he was the stronger fuck you ramon she screamed she made a second attempt to wrest herself free of navarros grip and by sheer vigour succeeded in liberating one of her arms the one with the knife she then stabbed wildly at the man who had hold of her ramon navarro the knife slid into his side and there it lodged before she could retrieve it he had caught hold of her flailing arm and had pinned it again though he had very firm hold of her she still continued to struggle and curse giving up on english in favour of romanian and then after perhaps thirty seconds of romanian curses she gave up completely and fell silent for a moment tammy thought navarro had killed her her silence was so sudden and complete butas had always been the case in this housethe truth was not so simple the curtain of fog shifted as though several breezes had pierced it at the same moment and then like a troupe of actors appearing to take their final bow the rest of the revenants began to appear from the mist four five six seven eight ten twelve their eyes were on katya all of them on katya now she began to struggle with fresh fervor her movements chaotic and panicky like those of a trapped animal much to tammys surprise navarro let her go she turned on him instantly reaching for the knife that was still protruding from his side but before she could catch hold of it he reached out and grabbed the front of katyas dress then he pulled tearing the light pink fabric away from her body and exposing her breasts the look on her face changed her fury apparently mellowing navarro bent forward and put his face between her breasts she let out a light laugh which was surely artificial but nevertheless passed for the real thing well enough he responded by licking the passage of flawless skin up to her throat wetting it until it shone her nipples aroused by his touch were hard her eyes flickered closed murmuring something in romanian words of appreciation to judge by their tone encouraged he moved his mouth down from her throat to her left breast and as he did so he slipped his arms beneath her legs and lifted her up the ghosts still assembling behind her raised their heads watching her elevation she was laughing for real now her head thrown back in abandon navarro was no longer licking her he was putting all his effort into lifting her up higher and higher still until katya and her laughter and her shining breasts were above his head katya opened her eyes the laughter suddenly passed away from her face as she realized what hed done again she spoke in romanian but this time the words were not so appreciative nor did she have long to speak them before navarro threw her to the assembled crowd she seemed to hang for a long moment in the space between her deliverers arms and the hands of those who were ready and eager to receive her then she fell down down into their open arms down to be caught by her dead patient friends whod waited so very long to enjoy her hospitality again and had been so bitterly disappointed finally after all these yearsall her cruelties all her games all her indifferencethey had her she screamed as they laid their cold hands on her flesh shrieked like a little girl being violated they ignored her protests as she had ignored them over the years they pulled her hair so that it came out at the roots they ripped at her smooth sweet flesh that showed no sign of the toll the years had taken on the rest of the world they bit off her nipples they tore off her labia like shreds offender meat and shoved the pieces down her throat to silence her death had not made them kind time had not made them kind years of sitting in the canyonthe santa anas in one season rain in another crucifying heat in another none of it had made them kind they pulled at her as though she was a perfect little doll that theyd been given and were now fighting over the trouble was she wasnt designed for such careless handling she tore too quickly in a matter of seconds what had once been katya lupi was a ruin they broke her arms so that the bones poked through they tore at her sex so that the gaping lipless slit ran halfway up her stomach she had spat out her labia and now attempted to call them by name to eke out a little mercy but they had none to give they had planned this martyrdom for years each playing his or her horrid part someone got their fingers beneath the skin of her face and worked it off inch by ghastly inch leaving only the pinkness of her eyelids in a mass of red muscles two others unseated her breasts from the bone so that they hung down like sacs of fat while the blood poured from the wounds where her nipples had been and thenperhaps sooner than theyd wanted or plannedher body gave out her shrieks ceased her deathdance ceased she hung in their arms like something that had once made sense but would never make sense again just to be sure there was no more fun to be had with her virginia maple whod been the second victim of the scourge of stars that had began with the death of rudolph valentino drove her hand into the dead womans mouth and with the strength death and hatred had lent her clawed out a fistful of the womans brains which she threw at the tiles there it spattered holding for a moment before sliding to the ground meanwhile someone else had gone in through her womb and pulled out her innards like a magicians colored handkerchiefs coming one after the other the coils of her guts her stomach and all the rest attached with loose strings of tissue and fat tammy saw it all it was a good deal more than she wanted to see but no less than her eyes could take in not once did she look away though every second that it continued she told herself she should do so because this was just a common atrocity now it was nothing to look at and nothing to be proud of to be looking but when it was over and the ghosts dragged katyas disemboweled remains away into the fog to put to whatever grotesque purpose their anger still demanded she at least knew that the bitch was finally dead she voiced that opinion and of course jerrynever one to sweeten things unnecessarilyreplied things are never the way you think theyll be in coldheart canyon well see how dead she really is when they went upstairs maxine was in the kitchen squatting in the corner with a blank expression on her face she looked extremely weary as though the toll of recent events had taken fifteen years off her life she wouldnt get up so jerry went down on his haunches and started to quietly talk to her finally she spoke shed had every intention of coming downstairs to help them she told him tears streaming down her face but then the noises started those terrible noises and she could no longer bring herself to do it she went on in the same fashion for a while circling on herself why dont you try and get her to get up tammy suggested to jerry then she went to pay her respects to todd the golden boy was lying where hed fallen more or less looking peaceful more or less eyes closed mouth open blood shining on the ground around his head during the early years of her infatuation tammy had dreams in which she would touch him thered been nothing sexual in these touches or at least nothing explicitly so just his being there in an ordinary room and saying to her its okay you can come over here you can touch me that had been the sum of it shed always woken from those dreams with such a profound yearning in her heart a yearning to confirm his existence in her waking world simply by one day getting the chance to really touch him just to know that he wasnt simply a game played with light but a real thing of flesh and blood now here she was and here he was and she could touch him all she liked but nothing on earth could have persuaded her to do so what shed been looking for in that touch was no longer there to be found hed gone and what remained as shed just seen in the room below was not worth her attention she turned from his corpse fighting the instinct to say goodbye to it and finallyunable to resist the force of instinctsaying it anyway then she returned to the kitchen where she found that jerry had succeeded in coaxing maxine to her feet and was now rummaging in the fridge for something cold for her to drink im afraid theres only beer he said oh no wait theres some milk here too you want some milk milk she said her eyes suddenly brightening like a childs eyes yes a glass of milk jerry carefully poured a brimming glass for her and she drank it down staring out of the window between gulps as soon as youre ready jerry prompted her we should go yes she nodded as she drank there were new dins from below suggesting that the ghosts were up to fresh mischief nobody wanted to be around when they finally tired of their labors downstairs and decided to ascend eppstadt maxine said her mind apparently sharpened by the milk what happened to eppstadt i told you tammy reminded her oh yes hes dead isnt he yes hes dead and the waiter joe yes joe hes dead too there was a long silence between them then while maxine emptied her glass which gave tammy an unhappy moment to picture the bodies that were littered around the house todd in the hallway sawyer somewhere in the garden joe the waiter and eppstadt in the bowels of the house and katya many places by now we should be thankful jerry said for what maxine wanted to know for getting out of here alive lets be thankful when we see sunset boulevard she said a little of the old maxine showing not before the noise in the house was still escalating as they left and when tammy looked back she saw that there was a crack over the front door two inches wide which zigzagged all the way up to the eaves like a bolt of black lightning they got into tammys car and drove down the hill maxines spurt of fortitude gave out halfway down and she began to cry pitifully but tammy was having none of it shush she said half gently half not were not having any of that you hear its over maxine its over of course that wasnt strictly true her mind turned to the creatures shed encountered in the canyon during the night the children what would happen to them and what other perverse miracles had the devils country worked upon the anatomies of those whod ventured there she vaguely wondered if perhaps she or jerry both of whom had spent some considerable time in that godless place would have something to show for their presence there she would have to watch herself closely at least for a while by now they were almost at the bottom of the hill we have to go and report all this to the police tammy said together now maxine said i couldnt possibly we have to maxine there are bodies up there we dont want to be accused of murder theyre going to think were all crazy maxine commented well thats easily solved jerry said well bring them up here and they can see it all for themselves thatll change their minds suppose they do think were responsible maxine said people like to point fingers in this damn town well they wont be pointing any fingers at us tammy said well explain explain maxine said how the hell will we ever explain well start at the beginning and go on until were done weve got nothing to hide therell be no end to it maxine said now todds dead the press is going to be all over us theyre going to be digging up every sordid little story about him whether its true or not theyll print any piece of garbage that floats down the sewer its going to go on for months and you think in the middle of all this the truth is going to be heard forget it its going to be a circus you dont have to be a part of the circus jerry said none of us do we can just say no and walk away let them write whatever they want to write theyre going to do it anyway true enough maxine sighed i just wanted to try and guard his reputation maybe if youd guarded him a little better when he was still around we wouldnt be in this mess tammy said she caught maxines reflection in the mirror the corners of her mouth turned down in misery im sorry tammy said maybe that was a bit sharp no maxine replied i let him down he needed me and i walked in the opposite direction mea culpa what does that mean im responsible maxine said and i am dont think i dont know it her reply brought an end to the exchange they drove on in silence until they reached langley road which in turn brought them on to doheny drive and finally down onto sunset boulevard it was a busy intersection the lights slow they had to wait through three changes creeping closer to the main tide of traffic but there was a simple contentment for all three in sitting in the car and watching the buses and the messenger bikes and the beverly hills rolls royces drive on past life going on in other words in its usual way people going east people going west all oblivious to the fact that just a short drive from this loud bright place was a cleft in the rock of the city of angels which was deep enough to conceal miracles part eleven the last chance one news like a lifeform is divided into orders and classes and kinds thus what was deemed worthy of note on the front page of variety was not thought appropriate for the front page of the la times none of which was again deemed appropriate for the national enquirer which put together a special edition centered on the deaths of todd gary eppstadt andas they put itthe unfortunate unnamed victims who were pulled down into the same spiral of decadence and death that claimed the hollywood powerplayers but padded the issue out with the old faithfuls haunted hollywood the tragic deaths of the young and the beautifulmarilyn james dean jayne mansfield doomed souls who paid the ultimate price for fame and all this gutter journalism of a high order by comparison with the real bottomfeeders the journalists of the globe who printed amongst countless lurid absurdities which they had clearly invented at their editorial meetings a number of facts that were paradoxically closer to the truth of the events than anything in any other newspaper or magazine given their notoriously low standards of veracity however the publication of these reports made the truest parts of the story unprintable in any other journal the facts became tainted by association poisoned in fact if it appeared in the globe how could it be true the only items of the story that appeared in every location were those that were related to the hard facts of death in tinseltown todd pickett everyone agreed had been on some kind of downward spiral the cause might be disputed but the fact that he was no longer the most beautiful man in the world or the most successful male star of the year was not in the eternal game of snakesandladders that was hollywood todd pickett had done all the climbing he was ever going to do if hed survived it would all have been downhill from here there was in fact a widelyheld opinion which stated that in dying youngeven dying violentlytodd had made the best career move of his life hed gone while the going was relatively good and in a fashion that would assure his name was never forgotten for todd pickett fans the world over variety opined todays tragic news brings the curtain down on a stellar career filled with glorious moments of pure cinematic magic but there must be many of those admirers who are relieved that their hero will never disappoint them again his run of spectacular successes was plainly drawing to an end all that remained was the sad and regrettably alltoocommon spectacle of a great star eclipsed two tammy saw that word everywhere now eclipsed it sat hidden in otherwise innocent sentences waiting to mess with her mind the instant she saw it she was back in the devils country staring up at the shape of that black moon obscuring the face of the sun she could feel the contrary winds against her face she could hear the sound of horses hooves or worse the wailing of qwaftzefoni when that happened she would have to put down whatever it was she was reading that had concealed the treacherous word and direct her attention back to the real world the room in which she was sitting the view through the window the weight of the flesh on her bones of course the word wasnt the only trap though shed come back to the house on elverta road and valiantly tried to pick up the rhythm of her briefly forsaken life she knew it would be a long time until the bad times passed away shed simply seen too much and the threads of what shed seen were intimately woven into the world shed returned to though shed put all the objects around the house that were connected to todd away in the big front bedroom with the rest of her memorabilia out of sight was not out of mind she knew she was going to have to deal with all that stuff in a more thorough way before too long and the prospect weighed heavily upon her meanwhile she was alone in the house just under three weeks after her return to sacramento arnie had announced that he was moving out in order to move in with maureen ginnis a bottleblonde who worked as a dispatcher at the fedex offices at the airport in a way tammy was glad she knew maureen a little and she was a nice woman a better match for arnie than tammy had ever been and having the house to herselfknowing that when she got up in the morning she didnt need to see anybody or speak to anybody if she didnt want to that made the craziness she felt itching inside her a little easier to cope with because she didnt have to conceal it from anyone she could just take the phone off the hook lock the doors draw the drapes and act like a crazy lady she got a bad cold a couple of weeks after arnie left and bought up a cabinetful of overthecounter cold flu congestion and expectorant medications they usually made her feel so dopey that she avoided taking them but in her present situation it scarcely mattered if she felt halfcomatose having bought the medicines she dosed herself to the gills with cureall syrups the color of fancy french liqueurs and went to bed in the middle of the afternoon to sweat it out it was a bad move she woke about one in the morning from a dream in which shed been lying in bed with the goatboy clamped to her breast suckling noisily she could smell the meaty sweetness of her breastmilk as it seeped from the corner of his hairy mouth and heard the long middle nail of his foot catching on the comforter as he jerked around in animal bliss with the weird logic of dreams she had very reasonably told qwaftzefoni that she felt feverish and he would have to stop she had pulled him off her breast with some difficulty only to discover that he had hold of her hand the sharp nail of his thumb pressed hard against the pulsing vein in her wrist as though threatening to pop it at a moments notice then he had guided her palm down to the clammy place beneath the curve of his stomach where his prodigiously veined prick stuck out from folds of infant fat she felt a row of tiny objects down the underside of his shaft theyre black pearls he said before she asked the question theyll increase your pleasure in her feverdream she barely had time to register what the little bastard was proposing before he was climbing up onto her her tit spurting in his fist as he milked her her screams going for nothing in the hellish heat of the room the spilt milk went bad in a heartbeat souring on the sheets it stank as if theyd been soaked in vomit the stench rising around her with physical weight as though it might smother her she had begged for the goatboy to leave her alone but he clutched her hand so tight she was afraid hed break the bones if she didnt obey him so she had taken hold of his pearllined dingaling and proceeded to jerk it you want it over with quickly he had said to her yes she had sobbed hoping hed let her go men knew how to do it better than women anyway arnie had always turned up his nose at the offer of a handjob you never do it right id prefer to do it myself but there were no easy getouts here then stay still the goatboy had said flipping over backwards still keeping his grip on her fountaining breast but relinquishing the enforced masturbation for a grosser game he was straddling her head now his thick little legs just long enough to raise the cushy divide of his ass six or seven inches above her nose the coarse hair on his goaty legs pricked her face it thickened around his buttocks and hed long since given up trying to clean it the stench made her gag open your mouth put out your tongue she could bear it no longer she reached up and grabbed his balls hard throwing the little fuck forward so that he was sprawled on the milksoaked bed then she lifted his tail and started to beat his ass with her palm for all the world like a mother chiding a monstrous child he started to sob and shit the groove of his buttocks filling up with the turd he would have dumped on her face if hed had the chance she was past caring about how dirty her hands were she just kept beating the little fucker until he had no more tears left and he was reduced to hiccups no the hiccups werent his they were hers her eyes fluttered open the fever had broken and she was alone in a bed that was damp with all the sweat shed shed but otherwise sweetsmelling the cretinous horror shed brought from the devils country was gone shit hair and all she got up out of bed and flushed all the medicines down the toilet determined to let the flu pass from her system of its own accord she was crazy enough without the aid of medication three jerry tammy my dear whatever happened to you i wondered when you were going to call you could have called me well to be perfectly honest he said i didnt want to trouble you unlike me youve got a life to live well actually arnie left me oh i am sorry dont be its for the best you mean it i mean it we werent meant for one another it just took us a long time to find out what about you well since we made the news ive been invited out to a few more fancy dinners than i used to be people are curious so they wine me and dine me and then they casually interrogate me i dont mind really ive met a lot of people mostly young men who have a faintly morbid interest in what went on up in the canyon which they pass off as an interest in me i play along i mean why not at my age you dont argue interest is interest and what do you tell them oh bits and pieces ive got quite adept at figuring out who can take what you know the ones who say tell me everything are the ones who go clammy when theyre told everything no never everything i dont think anybody ive met is ready for everything so how do people respond well theyre usually ready for something fairly wild if they sought me out in the first place its because they know something theyve heard some rumor some little piece of gossip so it keeps the conversation interesting now you what about you have you been sharing our adventures with anybody no nobody no not really you should you know you cant keep it all bottled up its not healthy jerry i live in rio linda sacramento not hollywood if i started spouting off about going to the devils country my neighbours would probably never talk to me again would you care be honest probably not what about rooney who tammy frowned rooney the detective who interviewed us remember over and over his name was rooney i thought it was peltzer no thats one of maxines lawyers lester peltzer okay so peltzers a lawyer and rooneys who you havent heard from him hes the detective at the beverly hills police department who first talked to us have you been checking your messages she hadnt but she said she had strange jerry said because hes called me six or seven times pressing me for details then i called the department replying to one of his calls and you know what he was fired two weeks ago so whys he calling you i think the sonofabitch is writing a book about what happened to us i guess well find that out when its published he can do that maybe hell change the names i dont know but its our story he cant go round telling our story maybe we should all talk to peltzer and see if we can stop him oh god tammy said softly life used to be so simple are you having a hard time jerry said yeah i guess no what am i saying im having a horrible time really bad dreams is that it dreams or is there more she thought about her reply for a moment wondering if she should share the problems shed been having with him but what was the point though theyd been through hell together she didnt really know him all that well how did she know he wasnt planning to write a book too so she said you know all things considered im doing just fine well thats good jerry said sounding genuinely pleased have the reporters stopped bothering you oh i still get the occasional journalist on the doorstep but i had one of those little spyhole things put in the door and if i think he looks like a reporter than i just dont open the door just as long as youre not a prisoner in your own house oh lord no she lied good welli should let you go ive got a thousand one other thing yes this is going to sound a little wacko oh okay but i wanted to tell you about it justfor old times sake i suppose im listening you know we never really discussed what happened to us in the house no well i figured we all knew i didnt really mean what happened to everybody i meant you and me down in that room you know that there was a lot of power in those tiles visiting the devils country kept katya looking perfect all those years what are you getting to as i said its going to sound wacko but i guess were both used to that by now yes he took a deep breath you see i had prostate cancer inoperable the doctors gave me nine months to a year to live that was december of last year christmas eve actually god jerry im so sorry no tammy youre not listening i said i had a tumor what its gone completely every detectable trace gone the doctors cant believe it theyve done the scan five times to be absolutely sure and nowfinallythey are absolutely sure jerry brahms brain tumor has disappeared and according to them that simply cant happen ever but it has it has and you think its got something to do with us being in the room put it this way i went into that house with a malignant tumor and when i came out again the tumor had gone what can you say about a thing like that its either a coincidence or its a miracle and you think its a miracle you know what he paused now i am going to sound wacko but i prefer to think of it as katyas last present to me she didnt seem the giftgiving type you only saw the darkness tammy there was another side to her i think there always is dont you theres always some light in the darkness somewhere is there tammy replied i guess im still looking four tammy desperately wanted to believe that she had indeed profited somehow from the madnessinducing journey shed taken through the wilds of coldheart canyon she didnt need anything as monumental as jerrys healed tumor just some modest sign to prove to her that despite all the death and the suffering shed witnessed some palpable good had come of it every waking hour her thoughts circled on what shed experienced looking for some sign of hope not miracles just hope a light in the darkness a reason to live but the more she searched the more absurd the search seemed to be common sense told her she should venture out into the world and start trying to live a normal life again perhaps if she joined a couple of womens clubs or maybe even tried to find herself a loveranything to change her focus get her out of her head and back into a normal way of thinking but she always found some reason to put off anything too adventurous it was almost as though shed used up her capacity for adventure during her time in the canyon her trips into the dangerous territory over her front door step became briefer and briefer by the way she started to get panicky when she got into her car and the panic escalated so quickly that by the time she got to the end of the block she often had to turn round and head straight back home again going to the market had become impossible she took to ordering essential foodstuffs by phone and when the supplies arrived shed make the exchange with the delivery guy as short as possible shed just take the stuff pass over the money and close the door often not even waiting for the change she realized that this odd behaviour was beginning to get her a reputation around the neighborhood more than once she peeped out between the closed drapes and saw that people were lingering outside her house some on the sidewalk some in cars pointing or staring shed become she supposed the local eccentric the woman whod come back from the wilds of hollywood in a state of mental derangement all of this of course only added to her spiraling sense of anxiety mingled with more than a touch of paranoia if she answered the door to the delivery boy and caught sight of somebody in the street outside she naturally assumed the passerby was spying on her at night she heard noises on the roof and woke more than once certain that one of katyas los ninos had found its way to rio linda and was scrambling over the eaves trying to get down to her bedroom window in saner moments she knew all this was nonsense but the very fact that she had saner moments implied that she was slowly giving herself up to lunacy it was all very fine for jerry brahms to talk about having his cancer cured by the power of the room but she felt as though whatever shed been given in the devils country it was affecting her mind not her body and it was not doing anything remotely healing quite the reverse it was deconstructing her grip on reality piece by piece some days when she woke the dreams remained attached to her all day like pieces of lint shed go through her waking hours in a halfstupefied state coming into rooms and not knowing why she was there leaving them again and remembering then forgetting as she turned round she was in a constant state of exhaustion her lids were like lead once in the middle of the day she found herself on her hands and knees in the bathroom working at the tiles with her bare hands and ajax attempting to remove some spidery sketches of a certain country that shed daydreamed into creation another time shed gone into the kitchen to find the faucet running and a shape in the sink that looked like a piece of roadkill a matted pelt two rows of sharpened teeth set between black leathery lips the force of the hot water slowly turned the cadaver over and showed her the broken head of something shed seen in the canyon or in her dreams of the canyon foul beyond words she turned off the faucet steam rose from the mouth of the thing like a last breath then it melted fur and teeth and all and was gone down the plughole hmm she said to herself unimpressed by this ugly little show somehow shed always imagined madness to be a more dramatic thing than this again the movies had it wrong there was no grandeur in it no exquisite folly just a pile of teeth and dirty fur in the kitchen sink that said she knew that her mental decline was gathering speed she needed to do something about it soon or this journey she was taking was going to take her away from herself completely she would be a blankeyed thing sitting at the kitchen table wiped clean by banalities five while jerry was giving thanks for his new life and tammy was dealing with the grim illusions in her kitchen sink maxine was in a very different frame of mind her injuries were remarkably slight given all that shed gone through within a week she was physically ready to return to her offices and attempt to pick up business but most of the calls she got in the first week werent business calls at all but gently inquiring conversations that rapidly gave way to interrogation it seemed as though everyone in hollywood wanted to know about events at the house in coldheart canyon in truth she had no desire to tell her story to anyone not even her closest friends ghosts and rooms laid with tile providing visions of another worldthis was not the stuff she could have shared with any of her contemporaries without being mocked but she had to say something or she was going to start making even more enemies than she already had so she concocted a version of events without supernatural elements in the censored version todd had indeed been hiding away because of work done to his face and there hed been stalked and finallysadlymurdered by his stalker most of the people she talked to accepted this bowdlerized version of events at least for the duration of the conversation but those few loyal sources she still had around town reported something very different back to her everyone had their own version of what had happened in coldheart canyon ranging from the ludicrous to the actionable and they were spreading it around freely whatever the version of the storyand they ranged from murder mystery to ghoststoriesthey had this in common maxine was the villain she was to blame for knowingly putting her innocent client in a house that was haunted she was to blame for not warning him that a close friend was a murderer she in short was the reason he was dead it seemed that nothing she could say or do persuaded people that this wasnt the case years of resentment towards her surfaced now as her enemies elaborated version after version of what had gone on in the canyon each one less flattering to maxine than the one before she eventually gave up attempting to put people straight on such matters people would believe what the hell they wanted to anyway shed learned that after twentytwo years in the business you could sometimes guide peoples opinions but if they didnt want to buy what you had to sell you could shout yourself hoarse trying to make them do it and it would never work after a few days of fruitless endeavor she became curiously immune to all the gossip flying around and just got on with trying to get to see some new talent she was an agent without a major client which meant that as far as the town was concerned there was no reason to take her calls especially as she wasnt playing ball and offering up the inside scoop on what a psychic hired by the fox channel to wander round the canyon called the most haunted piece of real estate in hollywood in other words everybody knew there was more to thisa lot more than they had been told so farand it was only a matter of time before somebody started to talk that somebody was patrick rooney the detective at the beverly hills police department whod done the initial work on the pickett case at fiftyeight he was very close to retirement and was looking at a life on a middleranking detectives pension life would not be lush he knew although he didnt have an expensive lifestyle he had all the normal outgoings alimony a mortgage car payments plus a wellstocked bar and a habit of smoking between forty and fifty cigarettes a day hed already calculated the dip in his standard of living hed have to take when he left the force it was going to be substantial but heredropping into his lap like a gift from godwas the answer to all his problems hed been told the story first by the lauper woman and later by maxine frizelle though their accounts had been outlandish to say the least they had also been remarkably consistent something weird had happened up in the canyon and whether it was true in part or not at all scarcely mattered what mattered to rooney was that people loved this kind of thing there was profit to be made here enough to make his retirement look a lot more cozy he began to make surreptitious copies of the interviews and smuggle them out of the station with an eye to assembling them all into book form it wasnt hard to do if he asked for copies of a record in order to advance some particular aspect of the case then nobody challenged the request in a short time he had amassed at home eleven bulging files of material on the canyon case enough to start editing and collating what he needed was a point of view other than his own after all he wasnt at the heart of all this he was simply an onlooker coming in after the drama was over what his book needed was an insider whose story would become its backbone he decided to approach maxine frizelle you want to do what im going to write a book about events in coldheart canyon as everyone insists on calling it i was hoping i could count on your involvement your point of view miss frizelle would make the book a good deal stronger youve had all the facts youre going to get from me detective wait wait rooney said before you put the phone down on me think about it todd pickett was your client for how long eleven years so think of this as your chance to set the record straight once and for all the good the bad and the ugly if i were ever to choose to set the record straight mr rooney it would not be with a cop as a coauthor oh i wasnt going to write any of this i was going to get a ghostwriter in to do that then im really missing something here rooney maxine said summoning up her most withering tone what exactly is your contribution to this project my experience of almost four decades in the lapd i worked on the manson case this is nothing like manson not remotely will you let me finish im not saying the cases are identical but we still have a lot of parallels the brutal deaths of several highprofile hollywood people all with some connection to the occult todd never had anything to do with that kind of thing and you can quote me well somebody in that house did i have copies of photographs of every inch of the place there are occult symbols hammered into all the thresholds did you know that several symbolsprobably east european in originwere removed from the area around the back door around the time mr pickett died he may even have been responsible for their removal do you have any comment to make about any of that yes its preposterous and if you try to tie todd to any of that kind of stuff youre going to be in deep trouble thats a risk im willing to take but i am going to write the book ms frizelle with or without your assistance i doubt you can do that rooney you got that information because you were a cop you cant go using it to make money i wouldnt be the first and i wont be the last rooney said frankly i dont see what the hell your problem is unless you were planning to do it yourself is that it am i rainin on your parade here no i have no intention of writing my own version of events then help me do mine rooney said his tone perfectly reasonable ill throw a piece of the action your way if thats what this is about how does five percent sound dont make this any worse than it already is i dont want your blood money have a little decency for gods sake todd is dead so are a lot of other people this isnt the time to be thinking about making a profit im not going to do a hatchet job on him i swear your exclients reputation is perfectly safe with me okay so i hear he did a few drugs a lot of coke i hear especially when he worked with smotherman and the plastic surgery again no big deal i mean ill have to write about it but i wont make him look bad i promise you why the hell would i rely on your promises rooney there was a brief silence so thats a no rooney finally said yes thats a big fat no well dont say i didnt ask and for the record mr rooney let me say this if you do want to try and write this book you go ahead and try i promise you will have so many lawyers crawling up your ass youll think theyre breeding up there very nice very ladylike nobody ever mistook me for a lady rooney now get the hell off my phone i need to call my lawyer six the call from rooney stirred maxine up she contacted her lawyer lester peltzer as she said she would and organized a conference call with several other lawyers in town whom she respected so that everyone could give her the benefit of their very expensive opinion unfortunately they all agreed on one thing she didnt have a hope in hell of stopping rooney going ahead when the book was written and being set for publication that was a different matter one of the lawyers pointed out if he wrote something libelous then they could go after him and if it was obvious that hed got access to police files then lapd internal affairs might get riled up and take him to court but there was no guarantee the lapd had a lousy record when it came to policing themselves so right now hes free to say whatever he wants to say maxine raged just for profit its the constitution one of the lawyers pointed out its not against the law maxines lawyer pointed out lightly youve made a good deal of money yourself over the years but i didnt lie to do it lester all right maxine dont get your blood pressure up im merely pointing out that this is america we live and die by the rule of mammon he drew a deep breath put on his most rational tone maxine ask yourself whether taking this guy to court over some book thatll be off the shelves in two three months is worth your time and temper you may end up giving him more publicity by suing him than he would ever have got if you hadnt youll make an issue of it and suddenly everybodys buying his damn book ive seen it happen so many times so youre saying i should let him do it maxine said let him write some shit about todd wait wait lester said in the first place you dont know hes going to write shit maybe hell be respectful todd was a very popular actor an american icon for a while so was elvis maxine pointed out it doesnt mean some sonofabitch didnt write about every dirty little secret elvis ever had i know because i read the book so what are you afraid of that the same will happen to todd people will write bullshit and in the end itll be the bullshit thats remembered not the work lester was usually quick with an answer but this silenced him finally he said okay let me ask you something do you think theres anything rooney knowsas a matter of factwhich could be really destructive to todds longterm reputation yes i do i think dont lester said please dont tell me right now i think it might be simpler for everyone if i didnt know all right lets all go away and think about this maxine and you do the same thing i can see your concern youve got a legacy here you want to protect i think the question isdo you do that best by drawing attention to rooney with a lawsuit or by letting him publish and be damned the phrase caught maxines attention shed heard it before of course but now it had new gravity new meaning she pictured rooney publishing his book and then having his soul dragged away to the devils country for his troubles publish and be damned she said you know that i could maybe live with tammy hadnt seen a human face real or televised in four days not even heard a voice the jacksons her nextdoor neighbours had gone off for a long weekend the previous thursday noisily departing with the kids yelling and car doors being slammed now it was sunday the street was always quiet on sunday but today it was particularly quiet she couldnt even hear the buzzing of a lawnmower it was as though the outside world had disappeared she sat in the darkness and let the images that had been haunting her for so long tumble over and over in her head like filthy clothes in a washing machine over and over in a gruel of greygrimy water the madness shed seen and heard and smelled over and over the trouble was the more she turned it all over the dirtier the washing became as if the water had steadily turned from gray to black and now when she got up to go to the bathroom or to climb the stairs she could hear it sloshing around between her ears the muck of these terrible memories darkening with repetition so this was what it was like to be crazy she thought sitting in the darkness listening to the silence while you turned things over in your mind going to the kitchen sometimes and staring into the fridge until shed seen everything that was in there the rotted things and the unrotted things then closing it again without cleaning it out and going upstairs and washing the bathroom floor then going to lie down and sleeping ten twelve fourteen hours straight through not even waking to empty your bladder this is what it was and if it didnt go away soon she was going to be a permanent part of the madness just another rag turning in the darkness indistinguishable from the things shed worn over and over and the telephone rang its noise was so loud she jumped up from the chair in which she was sitting and tears sprang into her eyes absurd to be made to weep by the sudden sound of a telephone but the tears came pouring down whether she thought she was ridiculous for shedding them or not she had unplugged the answering machine a while ago so now the phone just kept on ringing eventually she picked it up more to stop the din than because she really wanted to speak to anyone she didnt in fact she was perfectly ready to pick up the receiver and just put it straight down again but she caught the sound of the woman at the other end of the line saying her name she hesitated put the receiver up to her ear a little tentatively tammy are you there a voice said still tammy didnt break her silence i know theres somebody on the line the woman went on will you just tell me is this tammy laupers house no tammy said surprised the sound her own voice made when it finally came out then she put the receiver down it would ring again she knew it was maxine frizelle and maxine wasnt the kind of woman who gave up easily tammy stared at the phone trying to will the damn thing from ringing for a few seconds she thought shed succeeded then the ringing started again go away tammy said without picking up the receiver the syllables sounded like gravel being shaken in a coarse sieve the telephone continued to ring please go away she said she closed her eyes and tried to think of the order in which she would need to put the words if she were to pick up the receiver and speak to maxine but her mind was too much of a mess it was better not to even risk the conversation if all maxine was going to hear in tammys replies was the darkness churning around in her washingmachine of a head all she had to do was to wait a while for gods sake the telephone would stop its din eventually maybe five more rings maybe four maybe three at the last moment some deepseated instinct for selfpreservation made her reach down and pick up the receiver hello she said tammy that is you isnt it maxine yes its me good god you sound terrible are you sick ive had the flu really badly i still havent got rid of it was that you when i called two minutes ago i called two minutes ago it was you wasnt it yes it was im sorry id just woken up and as i say ive been so sick well you sound it maxine said in her matteroffact manner look i need to talk to you urgently not today i cant im sorry maxine this really cant wait tammy all you have to do is listen the flu didnt make you deaf did it this drew a silent smile from tammy her first in days same old maxine subtle as a sledgehammer okay tammy said im listening she was surprised at how much easier it was to talk once you got started and she had the comfort that she was talking to maxine all shed have to do as maxine had said was listen do you remember that asshole rooney vaguely you dont sound very sure he was the detective we talked to when we first went to the police you remember him now round face no hair wore too much cologne for some peculiar reason it was the memory of the cologne which had been sicklysweet which brought rooney to mind now i remember she said well hes been on to me did he call you no sonofabitch whys he a sonofabitch because the fuckheads got me all stirred up just when i was beginning to put my thoughts in order much to tammys surprise she heard a measure of desperation in maxines voice she knew what it was because it was an echo of the very thing she heard in herself night and day awake and dreaming could it be that she actually had something in common with this woman whom shed despised for so many years that was a surprise to say the least what did the sonofabitch want she found herself asking there was a second surprise here her mouth put the words in a perfectly sensible order without her having to labor over it he claims hes writing a book can you believe the audacity of the creep you know i did know about this tammy said so he talked to you he didnt but jerry brahms did the conversation with jerry came back to her remotely as though it had happened several months ago oh good maxine said so youre up to speed ive got a bunch of lawyers together to find out if he can do this and it turns outguess whathe can he can write what the hell he likes about any of us we can sue of course but thatll just give him more publicity thats exactly what peltzer said he said the book would last two months on the shelves three at the outside then it would be forgotten hes probably right anyway rooneys not going to get any help from me thats not going to stop him of course i know tammy said but frankly you dont give a damn right there was a pause it seemed the conversation was almost at an end then rather quietly maxine said have you had any thoughts at all about going back up to the canyon there was a second pause twice three times the length of the first at the end of which tammy suddenly found herself saying of course it felt more like an admission of guilt than a straightforward reply and what was more it wasnt something shed consciously been thinking about but apparently somewhere in the recesses of her churnedup head shed actually contemplated returning to the house i have too maxine confessed i know its ridiculous after everything that happened up there yesits ridiculous but it feels like unfinished business tammy prompted yes precisely jesus why didnt i have the wit to call you earlier i knew youd understand unfinished business thats exactly what it is the real meat of this exchange suddenly became clear to tammy she wasnt the only one who was having a bad time so was maxine of all people maxine whod always struck tammy as one of the most capable selfconfident and unspookable woman in america it was profoundly reassuring the thing is maxine went on i dont particularly want to go up there alone im not even sure im ready me neither but frankly the longer we leave it the worse its going to get and its bad isnt it yes tammy said finally letting her own despair flood into her words its worse than bad its terrible maxine its justwords cant describe it you sound the way i look maxine replied im seeing a therapist four times a week and im drinking like a fish but none of its doing any good im just avoiding everybody does that help maxine wanted to know no not really so were both in a bad way what do we do about it i realize were not at all alike tammy god knows i can be a bitch then when i met katyawhen i saw what kind of woman i could turn intothat frightened me i thought yuck that could be me you were protecting him you know in a way we both were i suppose thats right the question is have we finished or is there more to do tammy jet out a low moan do you mean what i think you mean she said that depends what you think i mean that you think hes still up there in the canyon lost christ i dont know all i know is i cant get him out of my head she drew a deep breath then let the whole bitter truth out for some stupid reason i think he still needs us dont say that maybe its not us maxine said maybe its you he had a lot of feelings for you you know if thats you trying to talk me into going back to the canyon its not going to work so i take it you wont come i didnt say that well make up your mind one way or another maxine replied exhibiting a little of the impatience which had been happily absent from their exchange thus far do you want to come with me or not the conversation was making tammy a little weary now she hadnt spoke to anybody at such length for several weeks and the chatwelcome as it waswas taking its toll did she want to go back to the canyon or not the question was plain enough but the answer was a minefield on the one hand she could scarcely think of any place on earth she wanted to go less shed been jubilant when shed driven away from it with maxine and jerry shed felt as though shed escaped a deathsentence by a hairsbreadth why in gods name would it make any sense to go back there now on the other hand there was the issue she herself had raised that of unfinished business if there was something up there that remained to be done then maybe it was best to get up there and do it shed been hiding away from that knowledge for the last several weeks churning her fears over and over trying to pretend it was all over but maxine had called her bluff maybe theyd called each others admitted together what they could not have confessed to apart all right she said finally all right what ill go with you maxine breathed an audible sigh of relief oh thank god for that i was afraid you were going to freak out on me and i was going to have to go up there on my own when were you planning to do this is tomorrow too soon maxine said you come to my office and well go from there are you going to ask jerry to come with us hes gone maxine replied jerrys dead no key west hes sold his apartment and moved all in a week lifes too short he said so its just the two of us its just the two of us and whatever we find up there seven on several occasions in the next twelve hours tammys resolve almost failed her and she thought about calling and telling maxine that she wouldnt be coming to los angeles after all but though her courage was weak it didnt go belly up in fact she arrived at maxines office twenty minutes earlier than theyd arranged catching maxine in an uncharacteristic state of disarray her hair uncombed her face without blush or lipstick shed lost weight shed perhaps fifteen pounds courtesy of the canyon so had tammy every cloud had a silver lining you look better than you sounded maxine said when we first started talking i thought you were dying so did i on and off it was that bad huh i locked myself in my house didnt talk to anyone did you talk to anybody i tried but all people wanted to know about was the morbid stuff i tell you theres a lot of people who i thought were friends of mine who showed their true colors over this people i thought cared about todd who were about as crass as you can get was there a lot of blood that kind of thing maybe i did the right thing locking myself away its certainly given me a new perspective on people they like to talk about death as long as its not theirs tammy took a look around the office while they chatted it was very dark very masculine antique european furniture persian rugs on the walls photographs of maxine in the company of the powerful and the famous maxine with todd at the opening of several of his movies maxine with clinton and gore at a democratic fundraiser when the presidentelect still had color in his hair and a reputation to lose maxine with a number of alist stars some of whom had fallen from the firmament since the pictures had been taken cruise van damme costner demi moore michael douglas mel gibson anjelica huston denzel washington and bette midler and on the sideboard in art nouveau silver frames a collection of pictures which maxine obviously valued more highly than the rest one in particular caught tammys eye in it todd was standing along side a very sour very old woman who was ostentatiously smoking a cigarette is that bette davis five months before she died my first boss lew wasserman used to represent her was she ever up in the canyon do you think no i dont think bettes ghost is up there she had her own circle all the great divas did and they were more or less mutually exclusive at a guess a lot of katyas friends had an interest in the occult i know valentino did thats what took them up there at the beginning she probably introduced them to it all very slowly maybe tarot cards or a ouija board checking out which ones were in it for the cheap thrills and which ones would go the distance with it clever oh she was clever you can never take that away from her right in the middle of this mans city where all the studio had men at the top she had her own little dominion and god knows how many people wrapped around her little finger it sounds like you admire her a bit well i do i mean shed broken every commitment and she didnt give a shit she knew what she had something to make people feel stronger sexier no wonder they wanted to keep it to themselves but in the end it drove some of them crazy even the ones who thought they could take it it seems to me it affected everyone a little differently i mean look at us we got a taste of it and it didnt suit us too well i should tell you i thought i was heading for the funny farm you should have called me we could have compared notes my mind was just going round and round nothing made sense any more i was ready to do myself in i dont want to hear that kind of talk maxine said the fact is youre here you survived we both did now we have to do this one last thing what if we get up there and dont find anything then we just leave and get on with our lives we forget we ever heard of coldheart canyon i dont think theres very much chance of that somehow frankly neither do i it was hot in the valley the temperature at noon stood at an unseasonal one hundred and four with the probability that it would climb a couple of degrees higher before the day was out the freeway was blocked for seven miles with people trying to get to raging waters a waterslide park which seemed like a cooling prospect on a day like this if you could only reach the damn thing later that afternoon in a freak mirrorimage of the fire at warners there was a small conflagration at a warehouse in burbank which had been turned into a ministudio for the making of xrated epics by the time the firetrucks had wound their way through the clogged traffic to reach the blaze thered already been five fatalities a cameraman and a mйnageаtrois whose versatility was being immortalized that afternoon along with the male stars fluffer had all been cremated there was very little wind so the sickly smell of burning flesh and silicon lingered in the air for several hours even if that particular stench didnt reach the canyon there were plenty that day that did indeed it seemed the canyon had become a repository for all manner of sickening stenches in the weeks since its sudden notoriety as though the rot at its heart was drawing to it the smell of every horror in the heatsickened city every unemptied dumpster that concealed something for forensics to come look at every condemned apartment or lockup garage where somebody had died and had not yet been discovered every pile of oncebright flowers collected from the fresh graves of forest lawn and the hollywood memorial cemetery and were now piled high in the corner along with their tags carrying messages of sympathy and expressions of loss rotting together all of it found their way into the cleft of the canyon and clung to the once healthy plants weighing them down like a curse laid on the air itself its so damn quiet tammy said as she got out of maxines car in front of what had once been katya lupis dream palace there were a few birds singing in the trees but there wasnt much enthusiasm in their trilling it was too hot for musicmaking the birds themselves sat in what little shade they could find beneath the leaves and stayed still the only exception to this were the falcons which rode the rising tides of heat off the canyon their wings motionless and the ravens who dipped and banked as they chased one another overhead landing in argumentative rows on the high walls around the house the dream palace itself was in a shocking state the damage the ghosts had done to the vast chamber on which the house sat throwing the whole structure into an accelerated state of decay the oncemagnificent facade with its highlights of moroccan tile had not only cracked from end to end but had now fallen forward exposing the lathandtimber below the massive doorwhich tammy had imagined belonging to an errol flynn epichad split in three places the metal lock which had been as vast and medieval as the rest of the thing had been removed sawn away by a thief with an electric saw hed made an attempt to take the antique hinges too but the size of the job had apparently defeated him tammy and maxine squeezed through the mass of debris which had gathered behind it the turret into which they stepped was still intact all the way up to its vault with its painted images of oncefamous faces peering down but the plaster on which the fresco had been made was now laced with cracks and cobs of the design had fallen away so that the vault looked like a partiallyfinished jigsaw underfoot the missing pieces fragments of mary pickfords shoulder and lon chancy srs crooked smile is this earthquake damage maxine said looking up at the turret there were places where the entire structure of the turret not just the inner painted layer but the tiles too had dropped out of place so that the californian sky was visible i dont see why the house would survive all these years of earthquakes without being substantially damaged and then practically come apart in a its weird maxine agreed maybe the ghosts did it really they got up there she said pointing at the vault i bet you they got everywhere they were pretty pissed off tammy stepped into the kitchen and had her thesis proved correct the kitchen had been comprehensively ripped apart shelves torn down cutlery pulled out of drawers and scattered around plates smashed frying pans used to beat at the tiled worksurfaces so that they were shattered food had been pulled out of the fridge and deepfreeze both of which stood openrotted fruit and uncooked steaks scattered around broken bottles of beer and cartons of spoiled milk everything that could be destroyed had been destroyed the tops of the faucets had been twisted off and water still gurgled from the open pipes filling up the clogged sink until it overflowed soaking the floor but all this was cosmetic the ghosts had been working on the structure too and theyd had the supernatural strength to cause considerable damage ragged holes had been made in the ceiling exposing the support beams some of whichthrough a massive effort by the phantom demolition teamhad been unseated and pulled through the plaster facade jutting like vast broken bones tammy waded through the filthy water to the second door and opened it a scummy tide had proceeded her out into the passageway where todd had died it was considerably darker than the kitchen she instinctively reached round and flicked on the light there was a sharp snap of electricity in the wall the lights came on flickered for a moment then went out again after a beat there was another noise in the wall and an eruption of sparks from one of the light fixtures further down the wall she thought about trying to switch the electricity off but that didnt seem very smart under the circumstances she was standing in half an inch of water with the power crackling in the walls better just leave it alone the only reason shed come out here was to be certain that the place where todd had lain had been cleaned up in fact it hadnt been touched the water from the kitchen had not reached as far as the spot where he had died so the pools of blood that had come from his body were now dry dark stains on the floor there were other stains too where his body had lain that she didnt want to think too much about further down the passageway beyond the bloodstains was the back door and the threshold where shed dug out the icons the nerves in the tips of her fingers twitched as she thought about those terrible minutes hearing todd and katya fighting in the kitchen while the ghosts waited on the threshold bristling but silent waiting for their moment her heart quickened at the thought of how close shed come to losing the game shed played here something crunched beneath her sole and she stepped aside to find one of the icons was lying on the tile she bent down and picked it up there was nothing left of the force it had once owned so she pocketed it as a keepsake as she was doing so she caught sight of a body lying outside in the shadows of the noahic birdofparadise trees maxine she called suddenly alarmed im coming be careful dont touch the light switches as soon as she heard maxines footsteps splashing through the kitchen tammy ventured to the threshold and stepped over it the greenery smelt pungent back here she was reminded of those dark swampy parts of the canyon where shed almost lost her life during her night journey the swamp had crept closer to the house it seemed there were mushrooms and fungi growing out of the wall and the mexican pavers were slick with green algae underfoot whats wrong maxine wanted to know that tammy pointed to the body which lay face down in the middle of a particularly fertile patch of fungi tammy wondered if perhaps hed been trying to make a meal of them and died in midswallow poisoned help me turn him over tammy said no thanks maxine said im as close as i need to get undaunted tammy went down on her haunches beside the body pressing her fingers into the damp sticky groove between the body and the tiles upon which it lay the corpse was cold she lifted it up an inch or two peering down to see if she could get a better glimpse of the dead man but she couldnt make out his features she would have to turn the cadaver over she pushed harder and hoisted the body onto its side rivulets of pale maggots poured from its rotbloated underbelly she let it fall all the way over lolling on the ground not only was it not a man it was not strictly speaking a human being but one of what zeffer had called the children the hybrid minglings of ghost and animal this one had been a female part coyote part sexgoddess it had six breasts courtesy of its bestial side but two of them had gone to jelly the four that remained however were as lush as any starlets adding a touch of surrealism to this otherwise repulsive sight the creatures head was a mass of wormy life exceptfor some reasonits lips which remained large ripe and untouched who is it maxine hollered from the interior of the house its just an animal tammy said sort of the ghosts fucked the animals and sometimes the animals fucked the ghosts and these things the children were the result obviously maxine hadnt known about this little detail because a look of raw disgust came over her face jesus this place never fails to she finished the sentence by shaking her head tammy wiped her hands on her jeans and surveyed the steps that led down to the garden theres more of them down here she called back to maxine more by the time maxines curiosity had overcome her revulsion and shed reached the first body tammy had already moved on to the second third and fourth then to a group of four more all lying on the steps leading down to the lawn or at the bottom and all in roughly the same position face down as though theyd simply fallen forward it was a curiously sad scene because there were so many different kinds of animals here large and small dark and striped and spotted lush and bony it looks like jonestown maxine said surveying the whole sorry sight she wasnt that far off the mark the way bodies had all dropped in the grass some lying alone others in groups looking as though they might have been hand in hand when the fatal moment came it had the feel of a mass suicide no question had the sun been on them directly no doubt the stench would have been nauseating but the air was cool beneath the heavy canopy the smell was more like that of festering cabbages than the deeper stomachturning stench of rotting flesh why so few flies tammy thought on this for a moment i dont know they werent properly alive in the first place were they they had ghosts for fathers and animals for mothers or the other way round i dont think they were flesh and blood in the same way you and i are that still doesnt explain why they came here to die like this maybe the same power that ran through katya and the ghosts ran through them too tammy said and once it was turned off they came back to the house and died exactly and the dead maxine said all those people where did they go they didnt have anything to keep them here tammy said so maybe theyre out wandering the city maxine said not a very reassuring thought as maxine talked tammy plucked some large leaves from the jungle all around and then went back amongst the corpses bending to gently lay the leaveswhich shed chosen for their sizeover the faces of the dead maxine watched tammy with a mingling of incomprehension and awe it would never in a thousand years have occurred to her to do something like this but as she watched tammy going about this duty she felt a surge of simple affection for the woman shed endured a lot and here she was still finding it in her heart to think of something other than her own comfort her own ease she was remarkable in her way no question are you done she asked when tammy was all but finished almost she said she bowed her head do you know any prayers i used to but maxine shrugged emptyhanded then im just going to make something up tammy said ill leave you to it then maxine said turning to go no tammy said please i want you to stay here with me until im finished are you sure please okay maxine said tammy bowed her head then after taking a few moments to decide what she was going to say she began lord she said i dont know why these creatures were born or why they died she shook her head in a kind of despair though whether it was about the words or the situation she was attempting to describe maxine didnt know perhaps a little of both were in the presence of death and when that happens we wonder it makes us wonder why were alive in the first place well i guess i want to say that these things didnt ask to be alive they were born miserably and they lived miserably and now theyre dead and id like to ask you lord to take special care of them they lived without any hope of happiness but maybe you can give them some happiness in the hereafter thats all amen maxine tried to echo the amen but when she did so she realized that these hesitant simple words coming from so unlikely a source had brought on tears tammy put her arm around maxines shoulder its okay she said i dont even know why im crying maxine said letting her head drop against tammys shoulder while the sobbing continued to wrack her this is the first time ive cried like this really cried in lord knows how long its good to cry let it come is it really good to cry maxine said recovering herself slightly and wiping her nose ive always been suspicious when people say cryings good for you well it is trust me you know tammy i dont know if anyone has ever told you this but youre quite an amazing lady oh really she said well thats kind of you its not the sort of thing arnie used to say well then arnie was a fool maxine said recovering a little of her old edge are you ready to go back inside now tammy said a little embarrassed by maxines compliment yeah i guess so they made their way through the dead to the steps and started to climb as they did so it occurred to maxine that in laying the leaves on the dead and offering up a prayer on their behalf tammy had brought the idea of forgiveness into katya lupis loveless domain it was probably the first time the subject had been broached in this vicinity in threequarters of a century katya hadnt seemed too big on forgiveness you erred against her you suffered for it and you kept suffering what are you thinking about tammy asked her just this place maxine looked up at the house and turned to take in the rest of the canyon maybe the tabloids had it right about what oh you know the most cursed piece of real estate in hollywood bullshit tammy said you dont think that room downstairs was made by the devil or his wife i dont want to know who made it tammy said but i know who fed it who made it important people just like you and me addicted to the place that makes sense places cant be good or bad tammy said only people thats what i believe did that make you feel better by the way what you did out there tammy smiled bit crazy huh not at all you know it did make me feel better much better those poor things didnt have a hope so now we can go look for todd maxine said and if we dont find him in tammy looked at her watch shall we say fifteen minutes we give it up as a bad idea agreed agreed where do you want to look first tammy said the master bedroom maxine replied whenever things didnt go well he used to go to his bedroom and lock the door funny arnie would do the same you never told me anything about arnie maxine said as she led the way through the chaos of the kitchen to the hallway there wasnt that much to tell and theres even less now hes gone do you think hell come back i dont know tammy said sounding as though she didnt care that much depends on whether his new woman puts up with him or not well put it this way do you want him back no and if he tries to make nice im going to tell him to go fuck himself excuse my french they stepped out into the hallway you want to go up there first tammy said he was your friend or client or whatever maxine looked doubtful go on tammy urged her you go on up and ill try downstairs okay maxine said but stay in shouting distance i will and if i dont find anything down there ill come straight up and find you maxine started up the stairs two at a time im not spending another hour after dark in this canyon she called as she went she watched tammy descend as she ascended and then when the turn in the stairs put them out of sight of one another she concentrated her attentions on the doorway in front of her the landing she was crossing was creaking with every footfall no doubt the damage the ghosts had done up here was as thorough as it had been below god knows how profoundly theyd affected the substructure of the place another reasonif any were neededto be out of here quickly shed read her poe she knew what happened to houses as psychotic as this had been they came tumbling down their sins finally caught up with them and they collapsed on themselves like tumorous men burying anyone and everyone who was stupid enough to be inside when the roof began to creak tammy i can hear you the place is creakin up here is it creakin down there yep so lets make this short an sweet huh we already agreed even shorter and sweeter maxine had reached the door of the master bedroom she knocked lightly at first then she called todds name there was no reply forthcoming so she tried the handle the door was unlocked she pushed it open it grated over a scattering of dirt and there was the sound of several irregular shaped objects rolling behind it she investigated besides the dirt there were some rocks behind the door and several clods of earth some with grass attached somebody appeared to have hauled a sack of earth up from the garden and it had split open behind the door todd she called again this time there was a mumbled reply she stepped into the room the drapes were almost completely drawn keeping out ninetenths of the sunlight the air smelt stale as though nobody had opened the door in days but it also smelt strongly of fresh dirt she studied the gloom for a little time until she saw the figure sitting up on the bed his knees raised under what she took to be a dark coverlet it was todd he was naked from the waist up hello maxine he said there was neither music nor threat in his voice hello todd couldnt stay away huh tammys with me she said shifting the blame yes i heard her and i expected her no halfexpected her but i didnt expect you i thought it was all over with us once i was dead out of sight its not as simple as that no it isnt is it if its any comfort its true in both directions you think about me you tammy the life i had sure i think about it all the time there isnt much else to do up here so why are you up here he moved in the bed and there was a patter of dirt onto the bare boards what shed taken to be a blanket was in fact a pyramid of damp earth which hed piled up over the lower half of his body when he moved the pyramid partially collapsed he reached out and pulled the dirt back towards him so as not to lose too much over the edge of the bed his body she saw looked better than it had in years his abdominals were perfectly cut his pectorals not too hefty but nicely defined and his face was similarly recovered the damage done by time excess and doctor burrows scalpels eradicated you look good she said i dont feel good he replied no no you know me i dont like being on my own maxine it makes me crazy he wasnt looking at her any longer but was rearranging the mound of dirt on his lap his erection she now saw was sticking out of the middle of the dirt i wake up with this he said flicking his hardon from side to side with his hand it wont go down he sounded neither proud of the fact nor much distressed by it his erection was just another plaything like the dirt heaped over his body why did you bring half the back yard up here just to play he replied i dont know yes you do she said to him okay i do im dead right right yeah i knew it he said with the grim tone of a man who was having bad news confirmed i mean i knew as soon as i looked in the mirror and i saw i wasnt fucked up anymore i thought im like the others in the canyon so i went out to look for them why i wanted to talk to somebody about how it all works being dead but still being here having a body substance i wanted to know what the rules were but theyd all gone he stopped playing with himself and stared at the sliver of light coming between the drapes there were just those things left the children yeah and they were droppin like flies we saw theyre all around the house ugly fucks todd said i know why too why what why they were droppin what he licked his lips and frowned his eyes becoming hooded theres something out there maxine something that comes at night his voice had lost all its strength it sits on the roof what are you talking about i dont know what it is but it scares the shit out of me sitting on the roof shining shining shining like it was a piece of the sun he suddenly started to make a concentrated effort to bury his erection like a little boy abruptly obsessed with some trivial ritual two handfuls of dirt then another two then another two just to get it out of sight it didnt work his cockhead continued to stick out red and smooth i dont want it to see me maxine he said very quietly the thing on the roof i dont want it to see me will you tell it to go away she laughed dont laugh at me i cant help it she said look at you sitting in a sackful of dirt with a hardon talking about some light i dont even know what it is he said maxine was still laughing at the absurdity of all this ill tell tammy to do it he said shell do it for me i know she will he kept staring at the crack of light between the drapes go and get her i want to see her so im dismissed am i no he said you can stay if you want or you can go if you want to youve seen me im okay except for the light except for the light im not crazy maxine its here i know youre not crazy maxine said he looked straight back at her for the first time the light hed been staring at had got into his eyes somehow and was now reflected out towards heror was that simply the way all ghosts looked she thought perhaps it was the silvery gaze that was both beautiful and inhuman i suppose we both could be dreaming all this he went on they dont call these places dream palaces for nothing i meani was dead wasnt i i know i was dead that bitch killed me his voice grew heavy as he remembered the pain of his final minutes not so much the physical pain perhaps as the pain of katya turning on him betraying him well for whats its worth maxine said im sorry about what oh a thousand things but mainly leaving you when i did it was tammy who pointed it out if i hadnt gone and left you perhaps none of this would have happened she said that to you todd replied with a smile yep shes got a mouth on her when something strikes her the point is she was right todds smile faded it was the worst time of my life he said and i made it worse its all right he said its over now is it really yes really its history i was so tired maxine said i know tired of me and tired of who youd become yes yes i dont blame you this town fucks people up he was looking at her with that luminous gaze but it was clear his thoughts were wandering wheres tammy did you say she went downstairs will you please go get her for me oh please now is it she said smiling you have changed you know what starts to happen if you stay here long enough he said apropos of nothing in particular no what you start to have these glimpses of the past at least i do im sitting here and suddenly im dreaming im on a mountain on a mountain climbing this sheer cliff that cant have been a memory todd or at least it cant have been a real mountain you hated heights dont you remember he took his gaze off her and returned it to the crack between the drapes plainly this news made him uncomfortable questioning as it did the nature of his recollections if it wasnt a real mountain what was it it was a fake built on one of the soundtracks at universal it was for the big fall a movie i was in a movie a big movie surely you remember did i die in it no you didnt die in it why do you want to know i was just trying to remember last night what movies id made i kept thinking if the light has to collect me and i have to leave and i have to tell it what movies i made he glanced at the wall beside the bed where hed scrawled a listin a large untutored scrawlof some of the titles of his films it was by no means comprehensive proof perhaps of a mind in slow decay nor were the titles he had remembered entirely accurate gunner became gunman for some reason and the big fall simply fallen he also added warrior to the list which was wishful thinking how many of my pictures did i die in then two why only two quickly because you were the hero right answer and heroes dont die ever right i wouldnt say ever sometimes its the perfect ending for example a tale of two cities thats old anyway dont quibble the point is i dont care about what the light wants im the hero oh i get where this is headed im not going maxine suppose it wants to take you somewhere better like where i dont know say it go on you seeyou cant even say it i can say it heaven the afterlife is that where you believe it wants me to go i dont know where it wants you to go todd and im never going to find out because im not going to go im the hero i dont have to go right what could she say to this he had the idea so very firmly fixed in his head that it wasnt going to be easily dislodged i suppose if you put it that way she said you dont have to go anywhere you dont want to he put his heel behind a small portion of dirt and pushed it off the edge of the bed it rattled as it rained down on the bare boards its all bullshit anyway he said whats bullshit movies i should have done something more useful with my life donnie was right donnie yes he suddenly looked hard at her donnie was real wasnt he he was my brother tell me i didnt dream him no you didnt dream him oh good he was the best soul i ever met in my life sorry but he was no he was your brother its good you love him hmm a silence a long silence then life would be shit if id just dreamed him nine at the bottom of the stairs tammy discovered that the entire substructure of the housethe floor once occupied by the devils countrywas now reduced to heaps of rubble with a few support pillars here and there which were presumably the only things keeping the house from collapsing upon itself completely seeing the tenuous state of things tammy was tempted to go straight back upstairs to warn maxine but then she figured that there was probably no tearing urgency the house had managed to stay upright in the weeks since the ghosts had wreaked this havoc and wasnt likely to collapse in the next five minutes she would risk looking around for a little while just to be sure shed understood as much of this mystery as was comprehensible before she turned her back on it forever the last few steps of the stairway had been torn away by the revenants assault but there was a heap of its own rubble directly beneath it so it wasnt much of a leap for her even so she landed awkwardly and slid gracelessly down the side of the heap puncturing her ankles and calves on the corners of the shattered tiles she stumbled away from the bottom of the stairs and through the doorway the naked framework of which was still standing surprisingly enough though the walls to the right and left of it were virtually demolished and the ceiling brought down exposing a network of pipes and cables there was very little light beyond the patch in which she stood which had leaked in from the turret otherwise it was murky in every direction she strayed a little distance from the doorway taking care not to hobble herself on a larger piece of masonry and careful too not to lose her bearings every now and again something on a higher floor would creak or grind or somewhere in the darkness around her shed hear a patter of dry plasterdust then the creaking would stop the pattering would stop and her heart would pick up its normal rhythm again of one thing she was pretty certain there were no ghosts here theyd wreaked their comprehensive havoc and gone on their melancholy way leaving the house to creak and settle and eventually when it could no longer support its own weight collapse shed seen enough she moved back to the doorway and returned through it to the stairs climbing over the rubble onto the lowest step the staircase swayed ominously as she heaved herself onto it and she saw that it had become disconnected from the wall a few feet up and was therefore floating a fact she had failed to grasp during her descent she ascended with a good deal more caution and reached the relatively solid ground at the top of the stairs with an inwardly spoken word of thanks the door to the master bedroom was open she saw a moment later maxine emerged and beckoned for her to come up todds here and he wants to see you she explained is he all right tammy asked fully realizing even as she said this that it was a damnfool question to ask about a man whod been recently murdered by way of reply maxine made a strange face as though she didnt have the least clue what the man in the master bedroom was up to you should just come up and see for yourself she said as they crossed on the stairs maxine took the opportunity to whisper i hope to hell you can make more sense of him than i could hello tammy todd was lying in the bed with a pile of dirt covering his lower half there was dirt on the floor too and on his hands youre a mess she remarked brightly ive been playing in the mud can i open the drapes a little or put on a lamp its really gloomy in here put on a lamp if you really must she went to the table in the corner and switched on the antiquated lamp doing so tentatively given her problem with the electricity on the lower floor then she went to look out of the narrow gap between the drapes maxine had been right the evening was coming on quickly already the opposite side of the canyon was purple grey and the sky above it had lost all its warmth there were no stars yet but the moon was rising in the northeastern corner of the canyon dont look out there todd said why not just close the drapes please she obviously wasnt quite quick enough for him because he sprang out of bed scattering dirt far and wide his sudden movement startled her a little it wasnt that she was afraid of him exactly but if death emphasized peoples natural propensities as it seemed it did then there was a good chance hed be wilder in death than he had been alive he took the drape from her handsnatched it almostand pulled it closed i dont want to see whats out there he said and neither do you she looked down at his groin how could she help herself he was as hard as any man shed laid eyes on his dick moving even though he was standing still bobbing to the rhythm of his pulse it would be ridiculous she thought not to mention it like his standing there with a pig under his arm and making no reference to that whats that in honour of she said pointing down at the pulsing length me why would you like it its covered in dirt yeah he took hold of the lower four inches of his dick and began to brush the soil off the top four twisting his dick round so that he could fetch out the particles of dirt in the ridges of his circumcision scar i didnt think id see you again he said as he worked he let his dick go it thumped against his belly before settling back into its headhigh position i was beginning to think this was my only friend he said he knocked his dick sideways with a little laugh im sorry tammy said i wasnt feeling well enough to come before now todd wandered back over to the bed and sat down on the edge of the mattress more dirt fell onto the floor he folded his arms bunching the muscles of his shoulders and chest are you mad at me she said a little i guess because i didnt visit yeah i wouldnt have made very good company i thought i was going crazy you did he was interested now what happened i locked myself up in my house i wouldnt see anybody i was just about ready to kill myself oh shit he said theres no reason to do that all the bad times are over tammy you can go off and live your life what life i dont have a life she sighed just that stupid little home filled with todd pickett memorabilia you could sell it all im going to trust me maybe take a cruise around the world or better still stay up here with me i dont think i mean it stay here have you been downstairs not recently why because this house is going to fall down todd very soon no it isnt he said did you know there are dozens of small earthquakes in california every day well there are and this place is still standing it doesnt have any bottom floor left todd katyas guests dug it all up he turned to the bed and started to pull armfuls of the dirt off the sheet what are you doing persuading you to stay he said still pulling at the earth when he had almost all the dirt removed from the bed he pulled the sheet out and went around the other side of the bed throwing the corners of the sheet into the middle and then bundling up both sheet and dirt he pushed the bundle off the bed and got up onto the clean mattress sitting with his head against the board and his legs crossed his balls were tight and shiny his dick was hard as ever he gave her a lascivious grin climb aboard he said here she thought was an invitation in a million and there would have been a time no doubt when she would have swooned at the very idea of it i think you should cover yourself up tammy said keeping the tone friendly but firm havent you got a pair of pants you can wear you dont want this he said running his fingers over the smooth head of his cock no she said thank you its because im dead isnt it she didnt reply to him instead she wandered through to the closet which was enormous barely a tenth of it was filled and started to go through the trousers and jeans on the hangers and found an old muchpatched pair of jeans their condition suggesting that he was fond of them because hed had them fixed so often as she pulled them off the hanger she heard a sound on the roof like something scraping over the spanish tiles did you hear that she called through to todd there was no answer from the room next door bringing the jeans with her she made her way back into the bedroom todd was no longer on the bed he had snatched the dirtstained sheet up off the floor and had wrapped it haphazardly around his body the result being something between a toga and a shroud and was now crawling around in the corner of the room in this bizarre costume his eyes turned up towards the roof he beckoned tammy over putting his forefinger to his lips to ensure her silence there were more noises on the roof scraping sounds that suggested the animal whatever it was had some considerable bulk what is it she said thats not a bird he shook his head still staring up at the ceiling what then i cant see what it is its too bright oh so you have looked yes of course ive looked he said very softly shit this always happens its like theyre its chorus he was referring to the coyotes which had begun a steady round of almost panicked yelpings from the other side of the canyon whenever the light appears the damn coyotes start up he had begun to shudder not from the cold tammy thought but from fear it crossed her mind that this was very far from the conventional image of ghosthunting the phantom naked and afraid her proffering a pair of jeans to cover him up its come here for me todd said very quietly you know that how can you be sure because i can feel it in my chest and in my balls the first time it came here it actually got into the house i was asleep and i woke up with this terrible ache in my balls and that he pointed down between his legs was so hard it hurt i was terrified but i yelled at it to go away and off it went i think i must have startled it how many times has it been back since that first time six or seven no more nine ten times sometimes it just waits in the garden sometimes it sits on the roof like it is now and then once it was in the pool theres no water in the pool no i know it was lying at the bottom not moving and you couldnt see any shape in it no no shape i mean do angels even have shapes an angel thats what you think it is im pretty sure i mean it came to get me and i am dead so thats why its hanging around and it almost had me once what happened i looked at it and my head started to fill up with all these memories things i hadnt thought about for years and years literally me and donnie as kids cincinnati nothing important just things you might think of in a daydream and it said to me wait it speaks this thing speaks yes it speaks what sex is it i dont know sometimes it sounds more like a guy he shrugged i dont know im sorry i interrupted you what did it say oh it said all this is waiting for you all this meaning what all the memories i suppose my past people places smells you know how sometimes you wake up from a dream and its been so real so strong everything in the real world seems a bit unconvincing for the first halfhour well it was like that after i saw the memories nothing was quite real so why the hell are you fighting it it doesnt want to hurt you ill tell you why im fighting because its a oneway street tammy i go with the light theres no way back and is being here so wonderful now dont i mean it dont argue with me he said ive thought about this a lot believe me its all ive thought about so what do you want to do i want you to stay right here with me until the damn thing goes away it wont try any tricks if youre here you mean giving you the memories its got others once it appeared on the lawn looking like patricia my mother i knew it wasnt really her but its crafty that way you know she was telling me to come with her and for just a few seconds it had you fooled yeah not for long butyeah at this juncture there was a rapping sound on the door todd jumped its only maxine tammy said getting up and turning from todd he caught hold of the jeans she was carrying not because he wanted to wear them but to stop her escaping him dont answer it he said please stay here with me im begging you stay please she held her breath for a moment listening for the presence on the roof it was no longer audible had the creaturewhatever it wassimply departed or was it still squatting up there biding its time ora third possibility just as plausible as the other twowas she falling for some fictional fear that todd in his confused postmortem state had simply created out of thin air was she just hearing birds on the roof skittering around and letting his imagination work her up into a frenzy about it put your jeans on she said to him letting go of them tammy listen to me i am listening she said crossing to the door of the bedroom put your jeans on she heard the rapping sound again this time she thought perhaps shed been wrong it wasnt maxine at all it was somebody outside the house beating on the front door she went to the bedroom door and cautiously opened it she was in time to see maxine retreating across the hallway from the front door what is it she whispered maxine looked up at her by the expression on her face something had unsettled her i heard this knocking went to the door and tammy there was a light out there shining in through the cracks in the door so hes not having delusions tammy said she headed downstairs to comfort maxine as she did so she reported what shed just heard todd tell her todd said there was something out there waiting for him thats his turn of phrase waiting for him apparently it sits on the roof a lot she put her hand on maxines trembling shoulder are you okay i am now it just freaked me out so you didnt open the door well you cant open it can you its cracked but its not much protection stay here so saying tammy crossed the hallway gingerly slid through the broken door and stepped out onto the doorstep oh jesus be careful maxine murmured theres nothing she said are you sure maxine stepped out through the cracked door and they stood together on the step the last light of the afternoon had by now died away but the moon had risen and was shedding its brightness through the trees to the right of the front door well at least its a beautiful evening maxine remarked staring up at the light coming between the branches tammys thoughts were elsewhere she stepped out of the house and onto the pathway then she turned around running her gaze back and forth along the roof looking for some sign any sign whatsoever of the creature that had made the noise up there as far as she could see the roof was completely deserted nothing she said to herself she glanced back at maxine who was still staring up at the moon she was alarmed to see that the sight of the moonlight seemed to have brought maxine to tears whats wrong she said maxine didnt reply she simply stared slackly up at the tree a few leaves fluttered down from the branches where the moonlight was sourced and to tammys amazement the light began to slowly descend oh fuck tammy said very softly realizing that this was not the moon todd had been right there was some entity here its outer form consisting of raw light its core unreadable whatever it looked like it apparently had eyes because it could see them clearly tammy had no doubt of that she felt its scrutiny upon her not just upon her in fact in her she was entirely transparent to it or so she felt and as its study pierced her she felt it ignite other images in her minds eye the house on monarch street where she was born appeared in front of her its presence not insistent enough to blot out the world in which she was standing but coexisting with it neither sight seeming to sit uncomfortably beside the other the door of the monarch street house opened and her aunt jessica her fathers sister came out onto the stoop aunt jessica of all people whom she hadnt thought about in a very long time jessica the spinster aunt smiling in the sunshine and beckoning to her out of the past not just beckoning speaking your papas at the fire station she said come on in now tammy come on in shed not liked aunt jessica overmuch nor had she had any great fear of her father the fact that aunt jessica was there on the stoop was unremarkable she used to come over for supper on every tuesday thursday and saturday often taking care of tammy and her brothers when tammys parents went out to see a movie or go dancing which theyd liked to do even the line about papa being at the fire station carried no especial weight papa was always at the fire station for one thing or another because he wasnt just a fireman he was the union organizer and a fierce advocate for better pay and conditions so there had always been meetings and discussions besides his diurnal duties in short the memory carried no particular measure of significance except for the fact that it was a memory of hers and that somehow this creatureangel or whatever it washad got into her head to set it in motion was its purpose that of distraction perhaps so being so perfectly commonplace tammy could slip into its embrace without protest because it evoked neither great joy or great regret it was just the past there in front of her momentarily real she thought of what todd had said about how the angel had appeared as his mother somehow the way todd had described the process it had sounded altogether more sinister than this more like a trap for his soul tammy yes i see it she said to maxine what do you see maxine said its just my aunt jessica well if i were you id look away maxine advised tammy didnt see why it was so important that she looked away im okay just watching she said but maxine had taken hold of her arm and was gripping it so hard that it hurt she wanted to turn and tell the woman to let go of her but it was easier said than done the image of the clapboard house on monarch street had in fact caught her up in its little loop it was like a short length of film running round and round the door would open aunt jessica would beckon and speak her three lines your papas at the fire station come on in tammy come on in then shed beckon again and turn round to step back into the house the door would close the dappled sunlight falling through the branches of the old sycamore just to the right of number monarch street would move a little as a gust of summer wind passed through its huge heavy branches then after a beat the door would open once again and auntie jessica would reappear on the stoop with exactly the same smile on her face exactly the same lines to speak look away maxine said again this time more urgently the urgency got through to tammy maybe i should do as she says she thought maybe this little pictureshow isnt as innocent as it seems maybe im going to be stuck in this loop with the door and jessica and the shadows coming through the sycamore forever a little spasm of panic rose in her she made a conscious effort to avert her eyes thinking of what todd had said but her minds eye had become glued to the scene the angel had conjured and she couldnt shake herself free of it she forced herself to close her eyes but the loop was still there behind her eyelids indeed it carried more force there because it had nothing to compete with she began to shake help me she murmured to maxine but there was no answer forthcoming maxine there were beads of brightness in the image she could see in her minds eye and they were getting stronger in spite of her panicked state tammy didnt have any difficulty figuring out what they signified the angel was getting closer to her it was using the cover of the looped memory to approach her until she was within reach of it maxine she yelled where the hell are you in her minds eye the green door on monarch street was opening for perhaps the eleventh or twelfth time smiling aunt jessica appearing to beckon and speak maxine your papas at the fire station maxine shed gone that was the bitter truth of it seeing the angel approaching and unable to pull tammy out of its path shed done the sensible selfprotecting thing shed retreated the light in the scene on monarch street was getting brighter with every passing moment she could feel its corrosive energies on her skin what would the angels luminescence do to her if it touched her cook her marrow in her bones boil away all her blood oh god in heaven this wasnt a game it was life or death she had to find something to break the loop before the light of the angelic projector got so hot it cremated her there was to be no help from maxine that was clear so she was left with todd where had he been the last time shed seen him her thoughts were now so chaotic she couldnt even remember that no wait hed been upstairs hadnt he she couldnt picture him but she remembered that hed been up in the master bedroom oh and hed been naked she remembered that too todd the naked ghost slapping his hard dick around as though it was a toy that hed suddenly discovered was unbreakable for a moment the image of jessica on the doorstep juddered as though the sprockets had become caught in the gate for a moment her mind had found a tool to thrust into the mechanism actually todds tool bobbing at his groin giving her its sliteyed gaze yes she could almost see it aunt jessicas smiling image juddered a second time then the brightness behind the picture started to press through her eyes burning away the pupils making her look momentarily demonic yoyo yoyo youyourpapasasasasatatatatatatthethethethe the woman was jerking round like a puppet being manipulated by someone in the early stages of a grand mal the loop flipped back and she was beckoning again with the first syllable of her speech caught on her tongue tammy ignored it she had todds beautiful rod in her minds eye and it was strong enough to break the angels back go away she told aunt jessica yoyoyoyo i said go away there it was now todds erection clear as day she made an intellectual assessment of it to give solidity to the memory it was a good eight inches long circumcised with a slight lefthand drift the light behind aunt jessica grew blindingly bright burning away not only the old ladys figure but the stoop and the summer tree the image of todds manhood was getting stronger all the time as though tammys pulse beats were feeding it blood fattening it glorifying it the angels brilliance still made her skin itch but she had the better of it now two three more seconds and monarch street had disappeared completely overtaken by the image of todds manhood maxine she yelled again there was still no reply she put her head down so when she opened her eyes she would be staring at the ground not at the angels light she halfexpected to see maxine sprawled on the ground at her feet overcome by the angels power but no there was nothing below her but the cracked pathway that led from the front door she turned on her heels and lifted her gaze a little the front door was open the light the angel shed washed the entire scene before her taking its colour out and throwing tammys shadow up against the wall she felt a perverse imperative to glance back over her shoulder to put the weapon shed summoned to the test one more time but she persuaded herself from such nonsense and stumbled back the way she and maxine had come just a little while before even before she reached the steps she heard maxine sobbing inside enraged that shed been left to face the enemy alone but at least grateful that maxine was alive she climbed the steps pushed the cracked front door closed as far as it would go and went back into the house maxine was sitting on the stairs shaking on the floor above todd had just emerged from the master bedroom hed put on the jeans tammy had fetched for him and he was carrying a large gun it wont do you any good tammy said slamming the door behind her im sorry maxine said i left you out there so i noticed i was yelling for you to come but you wouldnt move and that thing was just getting closer and closer it wants me it doesnt want you two well then tammy said staring at the front of todds straining jeans and giving up a silent prayer to the efficacy of their contents we have two options we either give you to the angel and let it take you wherever the hell it intends to take you oh god no please i dont want to go with that thing id rather die stop waving the gun around and listen to me todd i said we had two options whats the other one we make a run for it ten it wasnt really a choice given their circumstances they had to make a run for it and the way tammy looked at it the sooner they did so the better for everybody the angel could afford to play a waiting game she assumed did it need nourishment probably not did it sleep or take private little moments in which to defecate again probably not it could most likely afford to lay siege to the house for days weeks even months until its victims had no strength left to outwit it or outmaneuver it maxine had gone to the guest bathroom to wash her ashen face she didnt look much better when she got back she was still pale and shaking but in her usual straightforward manner she demanded that everyone agree to what was being contemplated here in words of one or at most two syllables lets all get this straight she said the thing outside is definitely an angel that is to say an agent of some divine power yes yes todd said he was sitting at the top of the stairs only partially visible in the light from the dining room which was the only light that now worked and whys it here exactly just for the record we know why its here maxine tammy said no lets just be very clear about this because it seems to me we are playing with fire this thing this light it wants my soul todd said is that plain enough for you and you maxine said glancing at tammy to see how she was responding to all this are blithely suggesting we try and outrun it yes youre crazy before tammy could reply todd put in a final plea if we fail we fail but at least lets give it a try frankly i realize im outvoted on this but i think this is insane maxine said if you really believe in your immortal soul todd why the hell arent you letting this divine agent come and get you im not saying i dont believe in my soul i do i swear i do but you know me ive never trusted agents he chuckled joke maxine lighten up it was a joke maxine was not amused suppose its the real thing she said suppose its god looking at us at you maybe it is but then again maybe it isnt this canyons always been full of deceits and illusions and you think thats what it is i dont know i just dont trust it id prefer to stick around here a little longer than go off with it here you want to stay in this dump todd its not going to be standing for more than another week so maybe ill set off across america i dont know i just got nothing to do even though im dead and suppose were pissing off higher powers maxine said have you thought about that you mean god if god really wants me hell find a way to get me right hes god but if he doesntif i can slip off and enjoy myself for a few years maxine threw a troubled glance at tammy and you go along with all this if todd doesnt feel you were the one saying prayers out there let me finish if todd doesnt feel hes lived his full life its his choice the point is youve had all the life youre going to get maxine said to him then to tammy were talking to a dead man something we would not be doing outside coldheart canyon things are different here todd murmured remembering what katya had told him damn right they are maxine said but the rules of this place end somewhere north of sunset and its only because of the power that was once in this house that youre getting a chance to play this damnfool game with god a game with god tammy said so quietly maxine barely heard what shed said what i was just saying a game with god i didnt think youd care about something like that arent you an atheist once i might have todd stood up hush hush the women stopped talking todd looked up towards the vault of the turret with its holes that showed the night sky stay very still he said as he spoke the light came over the top of the turret its motion eerily smooth and silent three beams of its silvery luminescence came in through holes in the roof they slid over the walls like spotlights looking for a star to illuminate for a moment the entity seemed to settle directly on lop of the turret and one of the beams of light went all the way down the stairwell to scrutinize the debris at the bottom then after a moments perusal it began to move off again at the same glacial speed only when it had gone completely did anybody speak again it was maxine who piped up first why doesnt it just come in and get you she said thats what i cant figure out i mean its just a body of light it can go anywhere it chooses i would have thought under the door down through that hole she pointed up to the turret its not like the house is burglarproof tammy had been thinking about that very question i think maybe this place makes it nervous she said thats my theory for what its worth all the evil this house has seen i dont think angels are afraid of anything maxine said then maybe its just repulsed i mean its like a dog right sniffing out souls its senses are really acute think how this place must stink especially down there she glanced down the stairwell where the angels light had lingered for a moment before moving on the devils country was down there people suffered died horrible deaths if i was an angel id stay out if you were an angel my love maxine said god would be in a lot of trouble this won a laugh out of tammy all right youve heard my theories i think youre both right todd said if the light wanted to come inside the house it could it did once remember but i think between my not wanting to go and the smell of what this house has seen its probably figured itll wait sooner or later the house is going to start falling down and then ill come out and itll have me thats why we should surprise it tammy said go now while its least expecting anyone to leave you dont know what its expecting maxine put in it could be listening to every damn word we say as far as you can tell well im going to try for it todd said pushing his gun into his trousers muzzle to muzzle if you dont want to come thats fine maybe you could just divert it somehow give me a chance to get to the car no were going tammy said speaking on behalf of maxine whose response to this was a surrendering shrug it is preposterous she pointed out however who the hell ever outran an angel how do we know todd said maybe people do it all the time they stood together at the door and listened for twenty twentyfive minutes seeing if there was some pattern to the motion of the light in that time it went up onto the roof twice and made half a circuit of the house but then seemed to give up for no particular reason it made no sound nor did its light at any point seem to alter in intensity it wasperhaps predictablyconstant and patient like a hunter sitting by a burrow knowing that sooner or later its occupant must show its nose about nine fifteen or so tammy went up to the master bedroom to scan the view across the canyon and down towards century city shed scoured the kitchen for dried goods and tinned goods that had survived either the ghosts rampages or the passage of time and had found many tins had been punctured and the food inside was rotten but she collected up a few cans of edible stuff baked beans peaches hot dogs in brine and then after some digging around found an opener and made up a plate of unlikely gastronomic bedfellows and took them upstairs to the balcony the canyon had gone pindrop quiet if she hadnt already known they had an agent of creations maker in their vicinity the spooked silence of every cicada coyote and night bird would have confirmed the fact it was eerie standing there watching the dark hollow of the canyon and the few stars that were visible above it and listening to the empty dark she could hear the click of the fork against her teeth the noise of her throat as it swallowed the beans and bites of hotdogs i used to love hotdogs came a voice from the dark room behind her it was todd you know ordinary food i never really got a taste for the more sophisticated stuff you want some of this she asked him glancing round as she proffered the plate no thanks he said i havent really got an appetite anymore maybe ghosts arent supposed to eat yeah thats what i figured he replied coming out onto the balcony then do you think they fuck because if they dont im going to have to find some other way to get this down he glanced down at the lump beneath his bathtowel cold showers yeah he chuckled everything comes full circle doesnt it cold hotdogs for you cold showers for me nothing really changes i dont know she said this isnt normal for me conversations withif youll excuse the phrasedead movie stars in million dollar houses with an angel waiting on the front door step right shed finished her ad hoc meal and went back into the bedroom to set he plate down while she was doing so she heard todd call her name very softly she went back out onto the balcony what is it look she looked following the direction of his gaze there was a glow of light in the denselyforested cleft of the canyon it looked as though it had settled in the fork of a tree i guess raphael must have got bored is that his name raphael i dont know its just the only angels name i know angels arent my strong point his real names probably marigold the point is its wandered off we should go while weve got the opportunity it may not stay down there very long right ill go and find maxine wait todd said catching hold of her arm just one thing before you whats that i want your honest opinion on what do you think shes right am i screwing with my immortal soul trying to escape this thing you know i was wondering about that when i was eating my hotdogs my aunt jessica was a churchlady all her life she used to go and arrange the flowers on the altar three times a week and she used to say god sees everything this was when i was a little girl and she thought id been naughty god sees everything shed say wagging her finger so you cant ever hide from him i think he can hear us right now and at least she would have believed he was and you who knows i used to believe her and i suppose theres a little part of me that still thinks wherever i am whatever im doinggood bad or indifferentgods got his eye on me or her eye so so if he doesnt want something to happen he can stop it oh were back to that if god doesnt want me to get out of here hell make sure i dont right todd allowed a little smile to creep onto his face he looked like a mischievous sixyearold so what do we think when we see that he nodded to the light in the distance isnt it like its looking the other way now tammy smiled maybe she said maybe gods saying ill give you a chance just this once todd leaned forward and kissed tammy on the cheek oh i like that he said just this once its just a theory its all i need right now so you want to go he paused a moment and studied the light in the canyon below the angel had apparently paused down there either to contemplate the loveliness of creation or to fall asleep for a while whatever the reason it was no longer moving if were going to go todd said this is the time agreed agreed ill go get dressed they found maxine tammy explained to her what she and todd had seen from the balcony and that it was time to try and make a getaway pleasantly lubricated by the vodka maxine was ready for an escape in fact she was first to the door bottle in hand remarking that the sooner they were all out of this fucking house the better for everyone tammy led the way clutching maxines carkeys tightly in her palm to keep their merest tinkle from reaching the ears of the angel the canyon was now completely dark even the few stars that had been lit overhead earlier were now covered by cloud as thoughtammy thoughtthe angel had extinguished them it was the kind of notion she wouldnt have given room to on any other night but this in any other place but this but who knew where the bounds of possibility lay tonight it was ridiculous in a way to imagine that an angel could blow out stars but wasnt it equally bizarre that there should be a dead man walking in her footsteps planning to outrun heaven incident by incident wonder by wonder her adventures in the canyon had escalated in outlandishness as though in preparation for this nights excesses first the ghosts and their children then the devils country now this they moved without mishap to the gate paused there to be sure the coast was clear and then moved onagain without incidentout into the street nobody said a word if the silence of the natural world had been uncanny from the balcony it was ten times stranger now they were out on the road where there would usually be a chirping carpet laid out all around them and trilling songs in the darkened canopy but here now nothing it made what was already strange enough stranger still it was as though every living thing from the most ferocious coyote to the tiniest flea was intimidated silence and stillness by the scale of power in their midst the only things foolish enough to move were these three human beings stumblings through the darkness all was going well until tammy caught her foot in a pothole and fell sideways todd was there to catch her but he wasnt quick enough to stop the short cry of alarm that escaped her as she slipped it was the loudest thing that had been heard in the canyon in a long while its echo coming back off the opposite wall she silently mouthed the word damn then taking a deep breath she went to the car adrenaline making her a little more efficient than she might have been otherwise and opened the door the car announced that there was a door open with an irritating little ping ping ping well hell it scarcely mattered now they were committed to this the angel was already pricking up its ears no doubt get in she hissed todd ducked into the back maxine opened the passenger door and slid in with something less than grace then she slammed the door so hard it was probably audible in santa barbara sorry she slurred force of habit todd leaned over from the back seat and put his hand on tammys shoulder give it all youve got he said ill do what i can she said and slipped the key into the ignition even as she was instructing her fingers to turn the key the moon came out above coldheart canyon except of course that it wasnt the moon it was the messenger of god roused from its meditations and climbing a silent ladder into the dark air over their heads fuck and double fuck todd said it moved straight towards the house andperhaps because the evening was a little damp and the marine layer had come in off the oceanit had collected around it a cloak of mist now instead of simply being a light it looked like a cloud with a white fire burning at its core trailing a tail like a comet tammy wasnt intimidated she turned on the car engine it roared reassuringly loud handbrake maxine said handbrake ive got it tammy said she took off the handbrake and put the vehicle into gear then she slammed her foot down and they took off todd she yelled over her shoulder i want you to keep an eye on that sonofabitch for me todd was already doing just that peering out of the back window its still above the house he reported maybe it thinks were still in there i dont think its that dumb somehow maxine said tammy drove the car up the street and around two wide curves before she found a place where it was possible to turn round it was a squealing messy five or six point turn in the narrow street and the last maneuver delivered the back end of the car into the shrubbery no matter tammy hauled the wheel round and accelerated todd went to the other side of the back seat and looked out huh he said what the damn thing still hasnt moved maybe its lost interest tammy said it was a forlorn hope of course scarcely worth voicing but every moment the thing failed to come after them was blessed by the way she said as she turned the first wide corner south of the house i got a little taste of what that thing does to you todd you mean the memories yeah did it freak you out no it was just sort of banal really it has a memory of my aunt jessica its coming oh shit tammy glanced in her rear view window nothing looked over her shoulder nothing i dont see it its after us i dont see it she caught a glimpse of todds face in the mirror his eyes turned directly upwards and she knew where it was the next moment there was a light on the road all around the car as though a police helicopter had appeared over the ridge with a spotlight and caught them in it there was a turn up ahead she took it at sixtyfive miles an hour wheels shrieking and for a moment the cloud overshot the road and she was driving in near darkness losing the light so suddenly left her utterly disorientated and she took the next curve which came fifteen yards after the previous one so tightly that the lefthand side of the car was clawed by twigs and branches todd whooped hell woman youre quite a driver why didnt you tell me you never asked tammy said steering the car back into the middle of the road we could have gone dragracing together i always wanted to find a woman i could go dragracing with now you tell me another curve came up as tight as the one before but this time she took it without any problem they were halfway down the hill by now and tammy was beginning to think that maybe just maybe they were going to reach sunset boulevard without their pursuer catching up with them if we do get to sunset she said what happens then do you think the damn thing will give up shed no sooner spoken than the light reappeared on the street ahead of them it was no longer hovering in the air above the street but had descended to block the road from one side to the other tammy slammed on the brakes but as she did so a sliver of the angels light came through the windshield to meet her mind its freight familiar from their previous encounter the road ahead of her was instantly erased replaced with the facade of the house on monarch street she heard maxine somewhere to her right let out a yell of panic and then felt her reaching over to wrest control of the car from her there was a brief chaotic moment when tammys panic overwhelmed the angels gift of memory and she saw to her horror that the car had swerved off the road and was speeding into the dense thicket that grew between the trees the image lasted for a moment only then it was gone the approaching trees maxines fumbling hands her curses all of it erased in its place tammy was standing at the door of her aunt jessicas house in the dappled sunlight and aunt jessica was telling her that her papa had gone down to the fire station the car struck a tree and the windshield smashed but aunt jessica smiled on they hit another tree and another though tammy saw none of it she didnt hear the splinter of wood or the shrieks from maxine nor did she hear the din of tearing metal as a door was torn off her foot was still jammed on the brakes but they didnt seem to be slowing the vehicles momentum what eventually brought the car to a halt was a boulder which lifted it up and threw it over on its left side at the instant of impact the angels vision faltered again and tammy saw the world as it really wasa blur of tumbling trees and raining glass she saw her arms in front of her her whiteknuckled hands still seizing the wheel she saw blood on her fingers and then a little storm of shredded leaves coming in through the broken window their sweetness reminding her even in the midst of this chaos of quieter times mown lawns on a sunday afternoon grass in her hair when shed been playwrestling with sandra moses from next door pieces of green memory which flickered into her minds eye between the tumbling view through the windshield and the last brief appearance of aunt jessicas doorstep she knew it was the last because this time as the car came to a halt and tammy slumped in her seat her consciousness decided to forsake the pain of her broken bones or the sound of maxines screaming and just go away into the reassuring gloom of aunt jessicas house why did you not come when i called aunt jessica demanded kindly though she was she didnt like to be disobeyed tammy looked at the woman through her elevenyearolds eyes and fumbled for an answer to the old ladys question but nothing she could say to jessica would make any sense now would it canyon car angel crash how could she possibly understand anyway aunt jessica didnt really want an answer she had her niece inside the house where she wanted her and that was all that was really important tammy walked down the hallway into this brown comfortable memory and let aunt jessica close the door behind her so that the screaming and the raining glass and the world turned upside down could be forgotten and she could go wash her hands before sitting down to a plate of aunt jessicas special meatloaf eleven it was night in coldheart canyon and though it was the wrong season for the santa anas proper to be blowing the wind that came up about a quarter to midnight was warm for a night in early spring it carried away the smell of burned rubber and spilled gasoline it even took away the stench of the vodkalaced vomit maxine had ejected with the vodka out of her system she found she could think a little better with trembling fingers she unfastened her seatbelt and fell through the open door out of the seat in which shed been hanging and on to the grass she lay there for a long time alternately sobbing and being stern with herself luckilyif this can be said to be luckshed had two previous experiences with car wrecks the second of which had been substantially worse than this one in that it had happened on the in the middle of the morning rush and involved nineteen vehicles and eight fatalities she had suffered a hairline skull fracture a dislocated shoulder and back problems that her chiropractor had blithely announced would be with her for the rest of her life unless she was very much mistaken she was not in anything like as bad a condition after this little funride as shed been on that occasion shaken up yes dizzy sick and a little hysterical certainly but when she finally crawled away from the car and got to her feet she was pleased to discover that she could stand up quite well and that nothing hurt with that piercing hurt that suggested something had been broken or punctured you must have had an angel watching over you she looked round at the wit whod spoken it was todd he was close to the car trying to wrench open the door on the drivers side is tammy still in there maxine said yeah im afraid she is how does she look how the hell do i know todd remarked its too dark to see yes it was dark and though that wasnt good for finding out how tammy was doing it did suggest the absence of their pursuer its still here todd said just in case you were wondering where he pointed up maxine followed his finger the angels light brightened the high branches of a nearby pine it wasnt as steady as it had been up at the house in fact it was fluttering nervously which made maxine picture a flock of luminous birds up there all shaking out their feathers after a rainstorm and hopping from bough to bough in their agitated state hey you maxine yelled up at the light too frustrated and angry to care about the protocol of what she was doing tammy could be bleeding to death in there how about a hand down here i dont think its interested in helping anyone but me i had to beg it to let me get you two sorted out before ityou knowcame and took me you mean you talked to it yeah while you were unconscious and you promised i promised id go with it as soon as you two were safe that was the deal huh you made a deal with an angel what else was i going to do i had to do something and it was my stupidity that got us into this mess he put his head through the broken window at least shes still breathing but shes also bleeding he lifted his hands and displayed his palms for maxine they were bloodsoaked oh god you know what what youre going to have to go for help because that sonofabitch isnt going to let me out of its sight can you do that can i walk yes i can walk can i walk as far as sunset she drew a deep breath i dont know i can try okay then you go get someone to help tammy and for gods sake be quick about it i dont think shes got much time ill stay here with her not that ive got much choice a deals a deal a deals a deal have you got a cigarette todd stood up and dug in his jeans pocket yep he pulled out a crushed packet and examined its contents two marlboro lights one each matches never without he came over to maxine and gave her the better preserved of the cigarettes you light it she said he put both the cigarettes in his mouth and lit them from a single flame then he handed maxines back to her didnt somebody do that in a movie he said god you are an ignoramus yes of course paul henreid in now voyager i showed it to you yeah he smiled i remember maxine frizelles ten favorite moments she drew on the cigarette and started to walk back along the path carved through the thicket by the car to the street hurry todd said tammy ate her meatloaf in silence thinking of nothing in particular aunt jessica busied herself in the kitchen coming in now and again to be sure that tammy was eating all her vegetables if the plate wasnt cleaned thered be no dessert no pie or cake aunt jessica wasnt a very good cook but she knew what her niece liked pie and cake preferably with ice cream youre going to be a big girl she said to tammy when she brought through the slice of peach cobbler and ice cream big all over and that can get a girl into a lot of trouble yes auntie especially with the boys i know auntie so you have to be extra careful boys take advantage of big girls and i dont want to see you hurt i wont let them auntie good aunt jessica said though she didnt sound much convinced back into the kitchen she went leaving tammy to enjoy her cobbler a la mode the first couple of mouthfuls tasted good she ate them thinking of nothing in particular the clock ticked on the mantelpiece aunt jessicas canary chirped in its cage she took a third mouthful for some reason it didnt taste as good as the first two almost as though there was a piece of bad fruit in it she put her napkin up to her mouth and spat out whatever it was but the taste of dirt and the gritty texture of it remained on her tongue and in her throat she put down her spoon and put her fingers into her mouth wait somebody said it wasnt aunt jessica who spoke to her however it was a mans voice a gentle man theressomethingin my mouth she said though she wasnt quite sure who she was talking to dirt the man told her its just dirt can you spit it out spit hard she glanced back towards the kitchen aunt jessica was at the sink washing pans she wouldnt approve of tammy spitting in the house i should go outside she said you are outside the man replied as he spoke to her she felt the room lurch sidewaysthe table the mantelpiece the canary in his cage oh no she said whats happening its all right the man said softly auntie she called no honey im not your auntie its todd now spit youve got dirt in your mouth the world lurched again only this time there was somebodys arms to catch her and she opened her eyes to see the face of the handsomest man in the world looking down at her he was smiling there you are he said oh thank god i thought id lost you as the last morsels of aunt jessicas peach cobbler melted away she remembered where she was and how shed got here the angel on the road the trees the car overturning and glass shattering wheres maxine shes fine she went to get help but shes been away a long time so i had to drag you out of there myself it took a little doing but i did some bandaging there was a first aid kit in the trunk i got the bleeding to stop i was eating peach cobbler you were hallucinating is what you were doing only there was dirt in it she spat with as much gusto as she could manage it made her body hurt to do it though her stomach her head she winced you did good todd said maxine got out with scrapes it was pure luck she said i was driving too fast and that damn angel got in my way she dropped her voice did it leave todd shook his head and directed her attention up at the tree where the angelic presence still sat it was quite composed now it had made its arrangements and it was waiting im afraid its going to want me to go with it very soon he said i promised id go you did you didnt try and make a run for it how could i you were in there hurt i couldnt just run out on you but you might have escaped ha you know i think i did he said i dont understand ohnot quite the way i thought i was going to but i escaped being a selfish fuckup he looked into her eyes you think i would have had an angel come to fetch me before i met you no way it would have been straight down to hell for todd pickett he was making a joke of it of course but there was something here that came from his heart she could see it in his eyes which still continued to stare deep into hers i want to thank you he said leaning down and kissing her cheek maybe next time round itll be our turn eh our turn yeah you and me born nextdoor to one another and well know i want you to stop this now she told him gently there were tears blurring her vision and she didnt like that hed be gone soon enough and she wanted to have him in focus for as long as possible he looked up uhoh i hear the cavalry he said tammy could hear them too sirens coming up from the bottom of the hill sounds like i should make my exit todd said the sirens were getting louder damn do they have to come so quick there were tears in his eyes now dropping onto tammys cheek shit tammy i dont want to go yes you do she said she fumbled for his hand and finding it squeezed it youve had a good time you know you have yeah oh yeah ive had a great time better than most true enough the light was descending from the tree and for the first timeeither because the angel was close to finishing its business or because tammy herself was hovering on the edge of lifeshe saw the contents of the light more clearly there was no attempt to confuse her with memories now no monarch street no aunt jessica at the door there was a human shape neither male nor female standing in the light and for a moment as it came to stand behind todd she thought it was toddor some other face of his some gentle eternal face that no camera would ever capture nor words would ever show he stroked her face with the back of his fingers and then he stood up next time he murmured yeah then his smile that trademark smile of his which had made tammy weak with infatuation when shed first seen it dimmed a little its departure not signifying sadness only the appearance of a certain ease in him which his smile had concealed all these years he didnt need to try so hard any longer he didnt need to charm or please she tried to catch his eye one last timeto have one last piece of him even now but he was already looking away looking at where he was really headed she heard him speak one last time and there was such happiness in his voice she began to cry like a baby dempsey he said here boy here she turned her head towards the light thinking she might glimpse him even now but as she did so she heardor thought she heardthe angel utter a word of its own a seamless word like a ribbon wrapped around everything shed ever dreamed of knowing or being it wasnt loud but it erased the sound of the sirens for which she was grateful then it moved off up into the darkness of the canyon knowing she was safe in the hands of those who would take care of her and one maxine who loved her she followed the ribbon of the word up the flanks of coldheart canyon skimming the darkened earth and as the woman and the word passed over the ground together the creatures of the canyon forgot their fear they began to make music again cicadas in the grass nightbirds in the trees and on the ridge the coyotes yapping fit to burst not because they had a kill but because they had life epilogue and so love one although every medical expert who paraded by tammys bed in the next many weeksbonespecialists and skullspecialists gastroenterologists and just good oldfashioned nursesinvariably pronounced the opinion that she was a very lucky woman to he alive there were many painful days and nights in that time of slow slow recovery when she did not feel remotely lucky quite the reverse there were times especially at night when she thought she was as far from unmended as shed been when todd had first pulled her out of the car why else did she hurt so much they gave her painkillers of course in mindbefuddling amounts but even when shed just taken the pills or been given the injection and the first rush of immunity from pain was upon her she could still feel the agony pacing up and down just beyond the perimeter of her nerves inured state waiting for a crack to appear in the wall so that it could get back in and hurt her again she was in the intensive care unit at cedarssinai for the first seventytwo hours but as soon as she was deemed fit to be removed from the icu her insurance company demanded she be taken to the la county hospital where she could be looked after at fifty percent of the price she was in no state to defend herself of course and would have undoubtedly been transferred had maxine not stepped in and made her presence felt maxine was close friends with several of the hospital board and made it clear that she would unleash all manner of legal demons if anyone even thought of moving mrs lauper when she was in such a delicate state the hospital authorities responded quickly tammy kept her bed complete with a private room at cedarssinai maxine made it her business to be sure that the room was filled with fresh orchids every day and that fresh threelayer chocolate cake from lady janes on melrose was brought in at three every afternoon i want you well she instructed tammy during one of her first visits after tammy had been released from icu i have a list of dinner parties lined up for the two of us that will take every weekend for the next year at least shirley maclaine called me claimed shed had a vision of todd passing over wearing a powder blue suit i didnt like to spoil the poor old biddys illusions so i told her that was exactly what he was wearing just as a matter of interest what was he wearing jeans and a hardon tammy replied hed torn up his tshirt for bandages her voice was still weak but some of its old music was starting to come back day by day well ill leave you to tell her that and then theres all these friends of todds who want to meet you why because i told them about what an extraordinary woman you are maxine said so youd better start to get seriously well as soon as youre ready to be moved i want you to come down and stay with me in malibu thatd be too much trouble for you thats exactly what i need right now maxine replied without irony too much trouble the moment i stop to thinkthats when things get out of hand luckily tammy didnt have that problem in addition to the heavy doses of painkillers she was still being given she was getting some mild tranquilizers her thoughts were dreamy most of the time nothing seemed quite real youre a very resilient woman her doctor an intense prematurelybald young fellow called martin zondel observed one morning while scanning tammys chart it usually takes people twice as long as its taking you to bounce back from these kinds of injuries am i bouncing i dont feel like im bouncing well perhaps bouncing is too strong a word but youre doing just fine it was a period of firsts the first trip out of bed as far as the window the first trip out of bed as far as the door the first trip out of bed as far as the ensuite bathroom the first trip outside even if it was just to look at the construction workers on the adjacent lot putting up the new research block for the hospital maxine and tammy ogled the men for a while i should have married a bluecollar worker maxine said when they got back inside hamburgers beer and a good fuck on a saturday night i always overcomplicated things arnies bluecollar and he was a terrible lover oh yes arnie its time we talked about arnie what about him well for one thing hes a louse tell me something i dont know whats he been up to are you ready for this hes been selling your lifestory who to everyone youre hot news right now in fact i had a call from someone over at fox wondering if i could sell you on the idea of having your life turned into a movie of the week i hope you said no no i just said id talk to you about it honestly tammy theres a little window of opportunity in here when you could make some serious money selling my lifestory i dont think so i dont have one to sell thats not what these dodos think look at these maxine went into her bag and brought out a sheaf of magazines laying them on the bed the usual suspects the national enquirer and the star plus a couple of more upmarket magazines people and us tammy was still too stiff to lean forward and pick them up so maxine went through them for her flicking to the relevant articles some carried photographs of todd at the height of his fame the photographs often emblazoned with melodramatic questions was fame too much for the worlds greatest heartthrob on one and on another his secret hideaway became a canyon of death but these lines were positively restrained in contrast with some of the stuff in the pages of the globe which had dedicated an entire pullout special your family will treasure for generations to the subject of haunted hollywood or in their hyperbolic language the spooks the ghosts the satanworshippers and the fiends who have made tinseltown the devils fanciest piece of real estate there were pictures accompanying all the articles of course mostly of todd occasionally of maxine and gary eppstadt and evenin the case of the enquirer and the globe pictures of tammy herself in fact she was the subject of one of the articles which was led off by a very unflattering picture of her the article claiming that according to her husband arnold obsessive fan tammy jayne lauper probably knows more about the last hours of superstar todd picketts life than anybody else alivebut she isnt telling why because lauper is the leader of a black magic cult which involves thousands of the dead stars fans worldwide who were attempting to psychically control their star when their experiment went disastrously and tragically wrong i was of two minds whether to show you all this maxine said at least yet i realize it probably makes your blood boil how can they write such things theyre just making it up there were worse believe me not about you but theres a piece about me ive got my lawyers onto and two pieces about burrows oh really one of them was a very long list of hishow shall i put this his less than successful clients so todd wasnt the first apparently not burrows was just very good at buying peoples silence i guess nobody really wants to talk about their unsuccessful asslifts now do they maxine gathered all the magazines up and put them into the drawer of the bedside table thats actually put some colour back into your cheeks its indignation tammy said its fine to read all that nonsense in the supermarket line but when its about you its different so shall i not bring any more of them in no you can bring em in i want to see what people are saying about me where are the magazines getting my photographs from that one of me looking like a threehundredpound beet maxine laughed out loud youre being a little harsh on yourself but youre right its not flattering i guess the photographer himself gave them the picture and you know who that was yes it was arnie it was taken last summer hes probably gone through all your family photographs but look dont get stirred up hes no better or worse than a thousand others believe me ive seen this happen over and over when theres a little money to be madea few hundred bucks evenpeople come up with all these excuses to justify what theyre doing with other peoples privacy america deserves to be told the truth and all that bullshit thats not what arnie thought tammy said he just said to himself i deserve to make some money for putting up with that fat bitch of a wife all these years there was no laughter now just bitterness deep and bleak im sorry maxine said i really shouldnt have brought them in yes you should and please dont apologize im not really all that surprised what are they saying about youif you dont mind me asking maxine exhaled a ragged sigh she was exploitative manipulative never did anything for todd except for her own profit that kind of stuff do you care its funny it used not to hurt in fact i used to positively wallow in being peoples worst nightmare but that was when todd was still alive she let the thought go unfinished whats the use she said at last getting up from beside the bed we cant control any of this stuff theyll write whatever they want to write and people will believe what they want to believe she leaned in and kissed tammy on the cheek you take care of yourself doctor zondelis that it zondel i think so sounds like a cheap white wine well anyway he thinks youre remarkable and said to him this we knew tammy caught hold of her hand thank you for everything nothing to thank me for maxine said we survivors have got to stick together ill see you tomorrow and by the way now that youre compos mentisi warn youtheres a chance youre going to have nursing staff coming in to ask you questions then selling your answers so say nothing however nice people are to you assume theyre fakes maxine came every day often with more magazines to show but on wednesdaythree weeks and a day after tammy had returned to consciousnessshe had something weightier to place on her bed remember our own norman mailer detective rooney exdetective martin ray rooney the same behold he did labour mightily and his gutter publishers saw that it was publishable and they did a mighty thing and put it in print in less than three weeks no here it is in all its shoddy glory it wasnt a big booka mere two hundred and ninetysix pagesbut what it lacked in length it made up for in sheer bravura the copy described it as a story too horrific for hollywood to tell on the cover was a photograph of the house in coldheart canyon with the image of a glowering demon superimposed on the clouds overhead he says you me and a woman called katya lupescu were in it together like the three witches in macbeth you mean you actually read it well i skimmed its not the worst thing ive read he spells all our names right most of the time but the rest oh god in heaven i dont know where to begin its a big sticky mess of hollywood myths and manson references and completely asinine pieces of detective work basically hes convinced everyone is in on this massive conspiracy to do what wellthats the thing hes not really sure he claims todd found out about it so he was murdered same with joe same with gary eppstadt though of course everybody in hollywood had a reason to murder gary eppstadt i didnt know books could be published so fast well its just hackwork itll be off the shelves in a month but rooney got a quarter of a million dollars advance for it can you believe that tammy picked the book upwhich was called hells canyonand flicked through it did he interview arnie well i didnt read it that closely but i didnt see his name oh theres pictures tammy said coming to the eightpage section in the middle of the book to give him his due rooneyor somebody working on his behalfhad done a little research hed turned up two photographs from the archives of some silent movie enthusiast one was a picture of katya lupi dressed in a gown so sheer it looked as though it had been painted on the other a much more informal photograph which showed katya mary pickford douglas fairbanks theda bara ramon navarro and a host of other luminaries at a picnic in the shadow of the dream palace in coldheart canyon at the back of the crowdseparated from katya by several rows of smiling famous faces was willem zeffer tammy closed the book dont want to see any more i dont think so not today ive been thinkingdoctor zinfandel tammy laughed at maxines perfectly deliberate error has told me youll be out of here in a week ten days at the most i dont want you going back to rio linda at least not yet i want you to come and stay with me at the house in malibu if it doesnt have too many distressing memories tammy had been worrying about how shed cope when she was released from the hospital the offer made her burst with tears of relief oh christ i hadnt realized you hated the place that much laughter appeared through the tears no no id love to come good then im going to send danielleshes my new assistantto sacramento and have her pickup some of your things if thats okay with you that would be perfect nine days later tammy moved out of cedarssinai and maxine ferried her down to the beachhouse it looked much smaller by day and somehow more ordinary without the twinkle lights in the trees and the cars driving up full of the great and the good perhaps it was simply that shed come to know maxine so well in the past few weeks that the house didnt seem at all alien to her it was very far from her taste of course but it was modestly stylish and the objects on the shelves were elegant and pretty sitting on the patio on the second or third evening sipping a virgin mary the wind warm off the pacific she asked maxine if shed decorated the place herself or had it done professionally oh id love to say i chose every object in the house but it was all done for me actually jerry selected the paintings hes got a good eye for art its a gay thing tammy spluttered into her drink hes flying back to california next weekend to see a friend in the hospital so i said he should call in thats all right yes if you dont feel up to it you dont have to see him im fine maxine tammy said believe me im fine two as it turned out the following saturday when jerry came to visit tammy was feeling anything but fine doctor zondel had warned her that there would be some days when she felt weaker than others and this was certainly one of those she only had herself to blame the previous day she had decided to take a walk along the beach and as the day was so sunny and the air so fresh shed completely lost track of time what shed planned as a twentyminute stroll turned into an hourandaquarter trek which had not only exhausted her but made her bones and muscles ache she was consequently feeling frail and tender when jerry came by the following day and in no mood for intensive conversation it didnt matter jerry had plenty to talk about without need of prompting mainly his new and improved state of health im trying not to be too much of a pollyanna about it all in case something goes horribly wrong and the tumor comes back but i dont think its going to im fine and you honey i have good days and bad days tammy said todays a bad day maxine said chucking tammy under the chin to get a smile look at you maxine if i didnt know better id say you had a gay gene in you someplace maxine gave him a supercilious smile well if i did i certainly wouldnt tell you about it are you implying i gossip it was not an implication maxine deadpanned it is a fact of life well ill keep my mouth closed about this i promise jerry said with a mischievous glint but were you not once a married lady tammy im not getting into this tammy said all right i will say no more on the subject but i see what i see and i think its very charming men are such pigs anyway maxine gave him a fierce look and beneath her makeup tammy thought she was blushing you said you had pictures to show us maxine said i did oh yes i did pictures of what tammy said her mind only a quarter committed to the subject at hand distracted as she was by the exchange that had just taken place between maxine and jerry she knew exactly what jerry was implying and although she couldnt remember thinking that she and maxine had been nesting just like a couple of lesbians she could see that his innuendo was not without plausibility from the outside at least and besides men were pigs or at least most of the men it had been her misfortune to become attracted to jerry had brought out his pictures now and passed them over to maxine who started to look through them oh my lord she said softly maxine handed the photographs over to tammy one by one as shed looked at them they were just taken by my old camera so theyre not very good but i stayed all day to watch the whole thing from beginning to end the thing jerry had watched and had photographed was the los angeles public works demolition of katya lupis dream palace i didnt even know they were going to knock it down maxine said well apparently there was a fierce lobby from your gang tammy my gang the appreciation society oh to keep the place as some kind of todd pickett shrine you didnt hear about that tammy shook her head my my you two have had your heads in the sand well there was a petition saying that the house should be left standing but the authorities said no it had to come down apparently it was structurally unsafe all the foundations had gone of course we know why but nobody else can figure it out anyway they sent in the bulldozers it was all over in six hours the demolition part at least then it took another five or six hours to put the rubble in trucks and drive it away did anybody come to watch tammy asked quite a few coming and going but not a crowd never more than twenty at any one time and we were kept a long way back from the demolition which is why the pictures are so poor the women had been through all the pictures now tammy handed them back to jerry who said so thats another piece of hollywood history thats bitten the dust it makes me sick this is all weve got faintly resembling a past in this city of ours and we just take a hammer and knock it all down how sensible is that personally im glad its gone tammy piped up another wave of weakness had come over her as she looked at the pictures and now she felt almost ready to pass out you dont look too good maxine said i dont feel too good would either of you mind if i went to lie down not at all jerry said tammy gave him a kiss and started towards her bedroom arent you going to tuck her in maxine tammy heard jerry say as it happens yes and so saying she followed tammy into the bedroom you know you mustnt let anything jerry says bother you maxine said once tammy was lying down she stroked the creases from the pillow beside tammys head i know he doesnt mean any harm i know that too she looked at maxine seeking out her grey eyes you know just for the record no tammy we dont have to have this conversation you dont have a lesbian bone in your body no i dont and if i dowell i havent discovered it yet but as you raised the subject i could quite happily take care of you for as long as youd like i like your company and i like yours good so lets have the world believe whatever it wants to believe fine by me tammy made a weak little smile mirrored on maxines face whod have thought maxine murmured she leaned forward and kissed tammy very gently on the cheek go to sleep honey i want you well when shed gone tammy lay beneath the coverlet listening to the reassuring rhythm of conversation between maxine and jerry from next door and the draw and boom of the pacific of all the people to have found such comfort with maxine frizelle her life had taken some very odd turns no question about that but somehow it still seemed right after the long journeys of late the pursuits and the revelations the terrors that could not speak and those that spoke all too clearly she felt as though maxine was somehow her reward her prize for staying the terrible course whod have thought she said to herself and with maxines words on her lips she fell asleep i want to go back to rio linda tammy announced two days later they were sitting on their favorite spot out on the patio and today there was a splash of the vodka mixed with tomato juice in tammys glass you want to go home maxine said tammy took her hand no no she said then more fiercely god no thats not my home any longer so well i had this huge collection of todd pickett memorabilia and i want to get rid of it then i want to think about selling the house meaning youll move in with me if it isnt too sudden at our age nothings too sudden maxine said but are you sure you want to go through all that stuff yourself cant you get one of the fans to do it i could i suppose tammy said but id feel better doing it myself then well do it together itll be boring theres so much stuff and arnies been using the house on and off so itll be a pigsty i dont care when do you want to go as soon as possible i just want to get it over and done with tammy tried to find arnie first at the airport and then at his new girlfriends house just to warn him that they were coming into town but she didnt get hold of him part of her was glad that maxine was accompanying her when there were so many variables she couldnt predict but there was another part of her that felt a little uncomfortable at the prospect maxine lived in luxury what would she think when she laid eyes on the scruffed stuffed little ranchhouse where tammy and arnie had lived out the charmless farce of their marriage for fourteenandahalf years they got an early plane out of los angeles and were in sacramento by ninethirty in the morning maxine had arranged for a chauffeured sedan to meet them at the airport the chauffeur introduced himself as gerald and said that he was at their disposal did they want to go straight to the address hed been given tammy gave maxine a nearly panicked look the moment was upon her and suddenly she was anxious come on maxine said well face the horror together then well be out of here by the middle of the afternoon arnie hadnt bothered to mow the front lawn of course or weed the ground around the two rose bushes that tammy had attempted to nurture the bushes were still alive but only just the weeds were almost as tall as the bushes of course he may have changed the lock tammy said as they approached the front door then well just get gerald to shoulder it in maxine said ever practical its still your house honey were not doing anything illegal in fact the key fitted and turned without any problem and it was immediately apparent from the general state of the place that arnie hadnt after all been a very regular visitor here in a while but the heating had been left turned up so it was stiflingly hot in all the rooms a stale sickly heat in the kitchen there was some food left out and rotting a halfeaten hamburger a pile of fruit which had been corrupted into plush versions of the originals two plates of pizza crusts the stink was pretty offensive but tammy got to work quickly clearing up the kitchen while maxine went around the house opening the windows and turning down the heating with the rotted food bagged and set outside and bleach put down the sink to take away the stench the place was a little more hospitable but tammy made it very clear that she wanted to stay here for as short a time as possible so they set to work given the size of the collection it was obviously not going to be sorted through and disposed of in a day all tammy wanted to do was collect up all the stuff that was personal and either burn it or take it away the rest she would let members of the appreciation society come in and collect theyd end up fighting over the choicest items no doubt all the more reason not to be there when they came i didnt realize you had so much stuff maxine said when theyd looked through all the rooms oh i was a topoftheline obsessive no question and i was organized she went over to one of the filing cabinets opened it and fingered through it till she found the file she wanted whats this maxine said letters from you to me usually dictated but not read i was a bitch i know i was just trying to protect him the only way i knew how and it worked i never really got near him nobody did maybe if i had been less paranoid hed have been less paranoid then we wouldnt have tried to hide him away and none of this tammy interrupted her enough of that she said lets start a bonfire out in the back yard and get this done a bonfire for what for things like these she proffered the maxine frizelle file things its nobodys business to ever see or read is there much like that theres enough you want to start a fire with these and ill bring some more stuff out sure anywhere in particular arnie built a barbecue pit to the right of the back door only he never finished it we could use that done maxine took the papers outside leaving tammy to go through the cabinets collecting up other files that for one reason or another she didnt want people to see she wasnt proud of what her overbearing tendencies had led her to do or say on occasion this was the perfect time to clean up her past a little it wasnt so much the thought of posterity that drove her to do this rather it was the desire to keep these unflattering missives and notes out of the hands of the members of the appreciation society who would come in here after theyd gone to cast dice and divide the lots when she took the first armful out to the back yard she found that maxine had made quite a healthy fire with the copies of her own letters is that all no no tammy said studying the fire theres a lot more she kept staring you know thats what i used to think ghosts were like she said flames in the sun invisible but there maxine took the files from tammy and proceeded to feed them to the flames are we ever going to set the record straight tammy wondered aloud like how write our own book lauper and frizelles guide to the afterlife something like that itd just be another opinion maxine said poking at the fire with the stick shed picked up people would go on believing their favourite versions you think for sure you cant change peoples opinion about stuff like that its imbedded they believe what they believe ill go get some more stuff historians of the future are going to curse us for this you know that probably tammy said catching a thin black smut that was spiraling up from the fire like some bizarre insect it crumbled in her hand she brushed her palms together briskly to clean it off then she went back inside for some more fuel for the fire three or four trips out into the backyard and shed done all she needed to do she stood in the front bedroom where shed always kept her special treasures and assessed the contents she could only imagine how many fights there would be over the contents of this room how much bitching and bargaining her gaze went to the back of the room wherehidden out of sight behind several boxes of film stillswas the holy of holies the box of photographs of todd that she and she alone owned the idea that these would become bargaining material like all the other bits and pieces they were leaving was repugnant it was fine for the fans to have their petty arguments over crewjackets and scraps of costuming but not her precious photographs she carefully negotiated her way through the piles of bricabrac to where her treasure lay hidden then she slipped her hand down into the hidingplace and pulled the box out into view the rest could go to the fire or the fans but this and this alone she would keep she decided she put it under her arm and went outside to see how her firestoker was doing is that the last of it maxine said looking at the box under tammys arm no im keeping this oh okay its just pictures of todd the fire was still burning strongly waves of heat rose up out of the halffinished pit making the air undulate while she stared at the fire tammy opened the box of photographs and as she did so some instincta kind of repugnance for the woman who had obsessed so often on these picturesmade her toss the box lid aside and with one unpremeditated movement pluck the pictures and the little roll of negatives out of the box and toss them into the middle of the fire changed your mind huh maxine said yep the flames were already curling around the first of the series but maxine could see him clearly enough he was younger then yeah they were taken on life lessons are those the negatives youre burning dont ask that must have cost you a small fortune but he surely was a goodlooking man the first of the photographs had been consumed now the second and the third are these the last of it then i think so tammy said they can argue over the rest only im parched watching fires is thirsty work you want me to get you a coke or a beer no i want us to get back in the car and go home home tammy said still looking at the fire the sixth seventh and eighth pictures were being consumed the roll of negatives had already curled up into a little black ball yes home maxine said she took tammys hand and kissed the back of it where you belong the last of the photographs had come into view preserved from the heat of the flames on which it sat by the bottom of the box this was always the picture shed stared at most often and most intensely the one in which shed often willed todds gaze to shift just a few degrees so he would look out at her the fire had caught it now in a few seconds it would be ashes suddenly just as impetuously as shed delivered the pictures into the fire she now reached down and plucked this one out she blew on the flames which only encouraged them here maxine said and snatching the photograph from tammys hand dropped it to the ground and quickly stamped out the flames you left it a bit late for a change of mind tammy picked the picture up nipping out the last orange worms of fire that crawled around its charred edges threequarters of the image had been consumed and the remaining portion was browned by the heat and dirt of maxines stamping but todds face shoulder and chest had survived and his eyes of course just one second from meeting the gaze of the camera imminent but permanently averted you really want to keep that yes if you dont mind well frame it and well find a place in the house where we can say hello to him once in a while done she headed back to the house im going to call the airport find out when the next plane back to los angeles is are you ready to go just say the word tammy looked down at the picture in her hand maxine was right she had left it a little late to salvage it but there might come a time when she and maxine needed the comfort of this face when they were no longer young and the imminence of his gaze would carry with it the promise of a reunion in another kinder place she glanced up to be sure maxine had gone inside then she gave the bittersmelling scrap of photograph a quick kiss having done so she smiled at the man in the picture and at herself for all her years of vain adoration well shed made her peace with it at least she slipped the photograph into her pocket and went inside leaving the fire to burn itself out in arnies halffinished handiwork three it is night in coldheart canyon and the wind is off the desert the santa anas they call these winds they blow off the mojave bringing sickness on occasion and the threat of fire but tonight the santa anas are not blisteringly hot tonight they are balmy as they pass through the canyon their only freight is the sweet fragrance of flowers they make the young palms that are growing wild on the flanks of the canyon sway and the banks of bougainvillea churn they raise dust along the road that winds up the canyon once in a while somebody will still make their way up that winding road usually to look for some evidence of scandal or horror but nature abhorring a vacuum has blanketed with green vine the deep pit that marked the location of katya lupis house so the visitors coming here in the hope of finding bloodstains or satanic markings scrawled into the sandstone dig around for a while in the hot sun and then give up theres nothing here that gives them gooseflesh just flowers and dragonflies grumbling to one another that this was all a waste of time they get back in their rental cars arguing as to who suggested this fools errand in the first place and drive away to find something that will give them something morbid to talk about once they get back in to tulsa or new jersey when people finally ask them whether they went up to that godforsaken canyon where all those hollywood folks died they say that yeah they went and had a look but it was a waste of gas and temper because there was nothing to see not a thing and so over the next few summers as people come and look and go away disappointed word slowly spreads that coldheart canyon is a sham a fake not worth the effort so people come less and less and eventually the tourists dont come at all theres only one kind of visitor who will still make the effort to find the place where katya lupi built her dream palace and for this sort of sightseer the canyon will still put on a show they come always in expensive vehicles designed to be driven over rough undomesticated land they come with rolls of geological maps and surveyors equipment and talk proprietarily about how the canyon would look if it had a fivestar hotel seven or eight stories high built at the top end with three swimming pools and a dozen fivegrandanight bungalows all arranged so that everybody has a little corner of the canyon walled off for their private spa the contours of the land altered so that it feels like a world within a world an escape into paradise just two minutes drive from sunset boulevard the canyon has heard all this idle nonsense before of course and it has promised itself never again hearing these men talk about the money theyre going to make once theyve done their digging and their planting the canyon loses its temper and starts to show its displeasure as only dirt and rock given something close to consciousness by the magic worked in its midst can do at first it simply shakes the ground a little just enough to send some stones skipping down the canyons flanks to shatter the windshields on every vehicle on the road very often a tantrum like this is enough to make the developers turn tail but not always once in a while theres somebody who refuses to be so easily intimidated and the canyon must escalate its assault it shakes its flanks until it uncovers certain horrid forms the mummified remains of the children of the ghosts and the animals who mated here in the dark days of the canyons shameful past the revelation is brief just enough to say this is the least of it my friend dig and you will regret what i will show you for the rest of your life the show works every time pragmatic though these men are they feel the cold presence of the uncanny all around them and suddenly they want no more of this place in their panic they dont even bother to clear the granulated glass off their leather seats they just get into their cars and drive away in clammy haste leaving their maps and artists renderings to decay in the dirt and their ambitions to rot beside them so the canyon sits in the middle of the sprawling city inviolate nobody will touch it now all it has to do is wait wait for a certain summons theres no telling when it will come perhaps its a hundred years away this call on the other hand perhaps it will come tomorrow all the canyon knows is this that at some point in the future a whisper will pass through its cracks and its vaults and with one almighty heave the canyons and the hills and the flatlands as far as the shore will stand up on end and all the towers and the dams and the dream palaces that were built here along with their builders and their inheritors will drop away into the deep dark pacific the land will shake for a year or so as it lays itself down again tremors will continue to convulse it but by degrees things will return to the way they were in an earlier time the santa anas will blow in their season and theyll carry into the canyon the seeds of the flowers whose scents they bear dropping them carelessly in the newlychurned dirt after a few weeks of warm winter rain the naked ground will be covered with grass and the shoots of young flowers even the first spears of palm trees and bamboo in the months to come they will flourish transforming the land out of all recognition and in time it will be as though men had never come to this perfect corner of the worldnever called it paradise on earth never despoiled it with their dream factories and in the golden hush of the afternoon all that will be heard will be the flittering of dragonflies and the murmur of hummingbirds as they pass from bower to bower looking for a place to sup sweetness
