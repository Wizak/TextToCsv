 chapter all right night owls its coming up on midnight and youre listening to khip get ready for five hits in a row this is cilia oroarke and darling im sending this one straight out to you her voice was like hot whiskey smooth and potent rich throaty touched with the barest whisper of the south it might have been fashioned for the airwaves any man in denver who was tuned in to her frequency would believe she was speaking only to him cilia eased up on the pot on the mixer sending the first of the five promised hits out to her listeners music slid into the booth she could have pulled off her headphones and given herself three minutes and twentytwo seconds of silence she preferred the sound her affection for music was only one of the reasons for her success in radio her voice was a natural attribute shed talked herself into her first job at a lowfrequency lowbudget station in rural georgia with no experience no resume and a brandnew high school diploma and she was perfectly aware that it was her voice that had landed her that position that and her willingness to work for next to nothing make coffee and double as the stations receptionist ten years later her voice was hardly her only qualification but it still often turned the tide shed never found the time to pursue the degree in communications she still coveted but she could double and had as engineer newscaster interviewer and program director she had an encyclopedic memory for songs and recording artists and a respect for both radio had been her home for a decade and she loved it her easygoing flirtatious onair personality was often at odds with the intense organized and ambitious woman who rarely slept more than six hours and usually ate on the run the public cilia oroarke was a sexy radio princess who mingled with celebrities and had a job loaded with glamour and excitement the private woman spent an average of ten hours a day at the station or on station business was fiercely determined to put her younger sister through college and hadnt had a date in two years of saturday nights and didnt want one setting the headphones aside she rechecked her daily log for her next fifteenminute block for the space of time it took to play a top hit the booth was silent there was only cilia and the lights and gauges on the control board that was how she liked it best when shed accepted the position with khip in denver six months before shed wrangled for the pmtoam slot one usually reserved for the novice deejay a rising success with ten years experience behind her she could have had one of the plum day spots when the listening audience was at its peak she preferred the night and for the past five years shed carved out a name for herself in those lonely hours she liked being alone and she liked sending her voice and music out to others who lived at night with an eye on the clock cilia adjusted her headphones between the fadeout of hit number four and the intro to hit number five she crooned out the stations number four and the intro to hit number five she crooned out the stations call letters and frequency after a quick break when she popped in a cassette of recorded news she would begin her favorite part of her show the request line she enjoyed watching the phones light up enjoyed hearing the voices it took her out of her booth for fifty minutes every night and proved to her that there were people real people with real lives who were listening to her she lit a cigarette and leaned back in her swivel chair this would be her last quiet moment for the next hour she didnt appear to be a restful woman nor despite the voice did she look like a smoldering femme fatale there was too much energy in her face and in her long nervous body for either her nails were unpainted as was her mouth she rarely found time in her schedule to bother with polish and paint her dark brandybrown eyes were nearly closed as she allowed her body to charge up her lashes were long an inheritance from her dreamy father in contrast to the silky lashes and the pale creamy complexion her features were strong and angular she had been blessed with a cloud of rich wavy black hair that she ruthlessly pulled back clipped back or twisted up in deference to the headphones with an eye on the elapsedtime clock cilia crushed out the cigarette and took a sip of water then opened her mike the on air sign glowed green that was for all the lovers out there whether youve got someone to cuddle up with tonight or you wish you did stay tuned this is cilia oroarke denver youre listening to khip were coming back with our request line as she switched on the tape for a commercial run she glanced up hey nick hows it going nick peters the college student who served as an intern at the station pushed up his darkframed glasses and grinned i aced the lit test way to go she gratefully accepted the mug of steaming coffee he offered is it still snowing stopped about an hour ago she nodded and relaxed a little shed been worrying about deborah her younger sister i guess the roads are a mess not too bad you want something to go with that coffee she flicked him a smile her mind too busy with other things to note the adoration in his eyes no thanks help yourself to some stale doughnuts before you sign out she hit a switch and spoke into the mike again as she read the station promos he watched her he knew it was hopeless even stupid but he was wildly in love with her she was the most beautiful woman in the world to him making the women at college look like awkward gangling shadows of what a real woman should be she was strong successful sexy and she barely knew he was alive when she noticed him at all it was with a distractedly friendly smile or gesture for over three months hed been screwing up his courage to ask her for a date and fantasizing about what it would be like to have her attention focused on him only him for an entire evening she was completely unaware had she known where his mind had led him cilia would have been more amused than flattered nick was barely twentyone seven years her junior chronologically and decades younger in every other way she liked him he was unobtrusive and efficient and he wasnt afraid of long hours or hard work over the past few months shed come to depend on the coffee he brought her before he left the station and to enjoy knowing she would be completely alone as she drank it nick glanced at the clock ill ah see you tomorrow hmm oh sure good night nick the moment he was through the door she forgot about him she punched one of the illuminated buttons on the phone khip youre on the air cilia thats right whos this im kate where are you calling from kate from home over in lakewood my husbands a cab driver hes working the late shift we both listen to your show every night could you play peaceful easy feeling for kate and ray you got it kate keep those home fires burning she punched the next button khip youre on the air the routine ran smoothly cilia would take calls scribbling down the titles and the dedications the small studio was lined with shelves crammed with albums s cds all labeled for easy access after a handful of calls she would break to commercials and station promos to give herself time to set up for the first block of songs some of the callers were repeaters so she would chat a moment or two some were the lonely calling just to hear the sound of another voice mixed in with them was the occasional loony that she would joke off the line or simply disconnect in all her years of handling live phones she couldnt remember a moments boredom she enjoyed it tremendously chatting with callers joking in the safety of the control booth she was able as she had never been able facetoface to relax and develop an easy relationship with strangers no one hearing her voice would suspect that she was shy or insecure khip youre on the air cilia yes youll have to speak up partner whats your name that doesnt matter okay mr x she rubbed suddenly damp palms on the thighs of her jeans instinct told her she would have trouble with this one so she kept her finger hovering over the sevenseconddelay button you got a request i want you to pay slut im going to make you pay when im finished youre going to thank me for killing you youre never going to forget cilia froze cursed herself for it then cut him off in the midst of a rage of obscenities through strict control she kept her voice from shaking wow sounds like somebodys a little cranky tonight listen if that was officer marks im going to pay those parking tickets i swear this one goes out to joyce and larry she shot in springsteens latest hit single then sat back to remove the headphones with trembling hands stupid she rose to pluck out the next selection after all these years she should have known better than to freak over a crank call it was rare to get through a shift without at least one she had learned to handle the odd the angry the propositions and the threats as skillfully as she had learned to handle the control board it was all part of the job she reminded herself part of being a public personality especially on the night shift where the weird always got weirder but she caught herself glancing over her shoulder through the dark glass of the studio to the dim corridor beyond there were only shadows and silence beneath her heavy sweater her skin was shivering in a cold sweat she was alone completely and the stations locked she reminded herself as she cued up the next selection the alarm was set if it went off denvers finest would scream up to the station within minutes she was as safe here as she would be in a bank vault but she stared down at the blinking lights on the phone and she was afraid the snow had stopped but its scent lingered in the chill march air as she drove cilia kept the window down an inch and the radio up to the maximum the combination of wind and music steadied her cilia wasnt surprised to find that deborah was waiting up for her she pulled into the driveway of the house shed bought only six months before and noted with both annoyance and relief that all the lights were blazing it was annoying because it meant deborah was awake and worrying and it was a relief because the quiet suburban street seemed so deserted and she felt so vulnerable she switched off the ignition cutting the engine and the sounds of jim jacksons mellow allnight show the instant of total silence had her heart leaping into her throat swearing at herself she slammed the car door and hunched in her coat against the wind dashed up the stairs deborah met her at the door hey dont you have a nineoclock class tomorrow stalling cilia peeled off her coat and hung it in the closet she caught the scent of hot chocolate and furniture polish it made her sigh deborah always resorted to housecleaning when she was tense what are you doing up at this hour i heard cilia that man oh come on baby turning cilia wrapped her arms around her sister in her plain white terrycloth robe deborah still seemed twelve years old to her there was no one cilia loved more just one more harmless nut in a fruitcake world he didnt sound harmless cilia though several inches shorter deborah held cilia still there was a resemblance between them around the mouth both their mouths were full passionate and stubborn but deborahs features were softer curved rather than angular her eyes thickly lashed were a brilliant blue they were drenched now with concern i think you should call the police the police because this option had simply not occurred to her cilia was able to laugh one obscene call and you have me dashing to the cops what kind of nineties woman do you take me for deborah jammed her hands in her pockets this isnt a joke okay its not a joke but deb we both know how little the police could do about one nasty call to a public radio station in the middle of the night with an impatient sigh deborah turned away he really sounded vicious it scared me me too deborahs laugh was quick and only a little strained youre never scared im always scared cilia thought but she smiled i was this time it shook me enough that i fumbled the delay button and let it broadcast fleetingly she wondered how much flak shed get for that little lapse the next day but he didnt call back which proves it was a oneshot deal go to bed she said passing a hand over her sisters dark fluffy hair youre never going to be the best lawyer in colorado if you stay up pacing all night ill go if you go knowing it would be hours before her mind and body settled down cilia draped an arm over her sisters shoulders its a deal he kept the room dark but for the light of a few sputtering candles he liked the mystic spiritual glow of them and their dreamy religious scent the room was small but it was crammed with mementos trophies from his past letters snapshots a scattering of small china animals ribbons faded by time a longbladed hunting knife rested across his knees gleaming dully in the shifting light a welloiled automatic rested by his elbow on a starched crocheted doily in his hand he held a picture framed in rosewood he stared at it spoke to it wept bitter tears over it this was the only person he had ever loved and all he had left was the picture to press to his breast john innocent trusting john deceived by a woman used by a woman betrayed by a woman love and hate entwined as he rocked she would pay she would pay the ultimate price but first she would suffer the call one single ugly call came every night by the end of a week cilias nerves were frazzled she wasnt able to make a joke of it on or off the air she was just grateful that now she had learned to recognize the voice that harsh wiretaut voice with that undercurrent of fury and she would cut him off after the first few words then she would sit there in terror at the knowledge that he would call back that he was there just on the other side of one of those blinking lights waiting to torment her what had she done after she dropped in the canned news and commercial spots at am cilia rested her elbows on the table and dropped her head into her hands she rarely slept well or deeply and in the past week she had managed only a few snatches of real sleep it was beginning to tell she knew on her nerves her concentration what had she done that question haunted her what could she possibly have done to make someone hate her she had recognized the hate in the voice the deepseated hate she knew she could sometimes be abrupt and impatient with people there were times when she was insensitive but she had never deliberately hurt anyone what was it she would have to pay for what crime real or imagined had she committed that caused this person to focus in on her for revenge out of the corner of her eye she saw a movement a shadow amid the shadows in the corridor panic arrowed into her and she sprang up jarring her hip against the console the voice she had disconnected barely ten minutes before echoed in her head she watched rigid with fright as the knob on the studio door turned there was no escape drymouthed she braced for a fight cilia heart thudding she lowered slowly into her chair cursing her own nerves mark sorry i must have scared you only to death making an effort she smiled at the station manager he was in his middle thirties and he was dropdead gorgeous his dark hair was carefully styled and on the long side adding more youth to his smooth and tanned face as always his attire was carefully hip what are you doing here at this hour its time we did more than talk about these calls we had a meeting just a couple of days ago i told you you told me he agreed you have a habit of telling me and everybody else im not taking a vacation she spun around in her chair to face him ive got nowhere to go everybodys got somewhere to go he held up a hand before she could speak im not going to argue about this anymore i know its a difficult concept for you but i am the boss she tugged at the hem of her sweatshirt what are you going to do fire me he didnt know that she held her breath on the challenge though hed worked with her for months he hadnt scratched deep enough beneath the surface to understand how precarious was her selfesteem if he had threatened her then she would have folded but all he knew was that her show had pumped new life into the station the ratings were soaring that wouldnt do either of us any good even as she let out the pentup breath he laid a hand on her shoulder look im worried about you cilia all of us are it touched her and as always it surprised her all he does is talk for now scooting her chair toward the turntables she prepared for the next music sweep im not going to stand by while one of my people is harassed ive called the police she sprang up out of her chair damn it mark i told you you told me he smiled lets not go down that road again youre an asset to the station and id like to think we were friends she sat down again kicking out her booted feet sure hold on struggling to concentrate she went onair with a station plug and the intro for the upcoming song she gestured toward the clock youve got three minutes and fifteen seconds to convince me very simply cilia what this guys doing is against the law i should never have let you talk me into letting it go this long if we ignore him hell go away your way isnt working he dropped his hand onto her shoulder again patiently kneading the tensed muscles there so were going to try mine you talk to the cops or you take an unscheduled vacation defeated she looked up and managed a smile do you push your wife around this way all the time he grinned then leaned down to press a kiss on her brow she loves it excuse me cilia jerked back in what she knew could easily be mistaken for guilt the two people in the doorway of the booth studied her with what she recognized as professional detachment the woman looked like a fashion plate with a flow of dark red hair cascading to her shoulders and small elegant sapphires at her ears her complexion was the delicate porcelain of a true redhead she had a small compact body and wore a neatly tailored suit in wild shades of blue and green the man beside her looked as if hed just spent a month on the range driving cattle his shaggy blond hair was sunstreaked and fell over the collar of a denim work shirt his jeans were worn and low at the hips snug over what looked to cilia to be about three feet of leg the hems were frayed lanky he slouched in the doorway while the woman stood at attention his boots were scuffed but he wore a classically cut tweed jacket over his scruffy shirt he didnt smile cilia found herself staring studying his face longer than she should have there were hollows beneath his cheekbones and there was the faintest of clefts in his chin his tanned skin was taut over his facial bones and his mouth still unsmiling was wide and firm his eyes intent enough on her face to make her want to squirm were a clear bottle green mr harrison the woman spoke first cilia thought there was a flicker of amusement in her eyes as she stepped forward i hope we gave you enough time cilia sent mark a killing look you told me youd called them you didnt tell me they were waiting outside now you know he kept a hand on her shoulder but this time it was more restraining than comforting this is ms oroarke im detective grayson this is my partner detective fletcher thank you again for waiting mark gestured her then her partner in the man lazily unfolded himself from the doorjamb detective fletcher and i are both used to it we could use a bit more information as you know ms oroarke has been getting some disturbing calls here at the station cranks cilia spoke up annoyed at being talked around mark shouldnt have bothered you with it were paid to be bothered boyd fletcher eased a lean hip down on the table so this where you work there was just enough insolence in his eyes to raise her hackles i bet youre a hell of a detective cilia tired and wishing he was home with his wife mark scowled at her lets cooperate ignoring her he turned to the detectives again the calls started during last tuesdays show none of us paid much attention but they continued the last one came in tonight at do you have tapes althea grayson had already pulled out her notebook i started making copies of them after the third call at cilias startled look mark merely shrugged a precaution i have them in my office boyd nodded to althea go ahead ill take ms oroarkes statement cooperate mark said to cilia and led althea out in the ensuing silence cilia tapped a cigarette out of her dwindling pack and lit it with quick jerky movements boyd drew in the scent longingly hed quit only six weeks three days and twelve hours ago slow death he commented cilia studied him through the haze of smoke you wanted a statement yeah curious he reached over to toy with a switch automatically she batted his fingers aside hands off boyd grinned he had the distinct feeling that she was speaking of herself as well as her equipment she cued up an established hit after opening her mike she did a backsell on the song just fading the title the artist the stations call letters and her name in an easy rhythm she segued into the next selection lets make it quick she told him i dont like company during my shift youre not exactly what i expected i beg your pardon no indeed he thought she was a hell of a lot more than hed expected ive caught your show he said easily a few times more than a few hed lost more than a few hours sleep listening to that voice liquid sex i got this image you know fiveseven he took a casual glance from the top of her head down her body to the toe of her boots i guess i was close there but i took you for a blonde hair down to your waist blue eyes lots of personality he grinned again enjoying the annoyance in her eyes big brown eyes he noted definitely different and more appealing than his fantasy sorry to disappoint you didnt say i was disappointed she took a long careful drag then deliberately blew the smoke in his direction if there was one thing she knew how to do it was how to discourage an obnoxious male do you want a statement or not slick thats what im here for he took a pad and the stub of a pencil out of his jacket pocket shoot in clipped dispassionate terms she ran through every call the times the phrasing she continued to work as she spoke pushing in recorded tapes of commercials cuing up a cd replacing and selecting albums boyds brow rose as he wrote he would check the tapes of course but he had the feeling that she was giving him wordforword in his job he respected a good memory youve been in town what six months more or less make any enemies a salesman trying to hawk encyclopedias i slammed the door on his foot boyd spared her a glance she was trying to make light of it but she had crushed out her cigarette and was now gnawing on her thumbnail dump any lovers no have any temper flashed in her eyes again youre the detective you find out i would if it was personal his eyes lifted again in a look that was so direct so completely personal that her palms began to sweat right now im just doing my job jealousy and rejection are powerful motivators according to your statements most of the comments he made to you had to do with your sexual habits bluntness might be her strong suit but she wasnt about to tell him that her only sexual habit was abstinence im not involved with anyone at the moment she said evenly good without glancing up he made another note that was a personal observation look detective cool your jets oroarke he said mildly it was an observation not a proposition his dark patient eyes took her measure im on duty i need a list of the men youve had contact with on a personal level well keep it to the past six months for now you can leave out the doortodoor salesman im not involved her hands clenched as she rose i havent been involved ive had no desire to be involved no one ever said desire couldnt be onesided at the moment he was damn sure his was she was suddenly excruciatingly tired dragging a hand through her hair she struggled for patience anyone should be able to see that this guy is hung up on a voice over the radio he doesnt even know me hes probably never seen me an image she said tossing his own words back at him thats all i am to him in this business it happens all the time i havent done anything i didnt say you had there was no teasing note in his voice now the sudden gentleness in it had her spinning around blinking furiously at threatening tears overworked she told herself overstressed overeverything with her back to him she fought for control tough he thought she was a tough lady the way her hands balled at her sides as she fought with her emotions was much more appealing much sexier than broken sighs or helpless gestures could ever be he would have liked to go to her to speak some word of comfort or reassurance to stroke a hand down her hair shed probably bite it off at the wrist i want you to think about the past few months see if you can come up with anything however small and unimportant that might have led to this his tone had changed again it was brisk now brisk and dispassionate we cant bring every man in the greater denver area in for questioning it doesnt work that way i know how cops work the bitterness in her voice had his brows drawing together there was something else here but this wasnt the time to dig into it youd recognize the voice if you heard it again yes anything familiar about it nothing do you think it was disguised she moved her shoulders restlessly but when she turned back to him she had herself under control he keeps it muffled and low its ah like a hiss any objections to me sitting in on tomorrow nights show cilia took another long look at him barrels of them he inclined his head ill just go to your boss disgusted she reached for her cigarettes he closed his firm hardpalmed hand over hers she stared down at the tangled fingers shocked to realize that her pulse had doubled at the contact let me do my job cilia itll be easier all around if you let detective grayson and me take over nobody takes over my life she jerked her hand away then jammed it into her pocket just this small part of it then before she could stop him he reached out and tucked her hair behind her ear go home and get some sleep you look beat she stepped back made herself smile thanks slick i feel a lot better now though she grumbled she couldnt prevent him waiting until she signed off and turned the studio over to the allnight man nor did her lack of enthusiasm discourage him from walking her out to her car reminding her to lock her door and waiting until shed driven away disturbed by the way hed looked at her and the way shed reacted she watched him in the rearview mirror until he was out of sight just what i needed she muttered to herself a cowboy cop moments later althea joined boyd in the parking lot she had the tapes in her bag along with marks statement well fletcher she dropped a friendly hand on his shoulder whats the verdict shes tough as nails hardheaded prickly as a briar patch with his hands in his pockets he rocked back on his heels i guess it must be love chapter contents prev next she was good boyd thought as he downed his bitter coffee and watched cilia work she handled the control board with an automatic ease that spoke of long experience switching to music to recorded announcements to her own mike her timing was perfect her delivery smooth and her fingernails were bitten to the quick she was a package full of nerves and hostility the nerves she tried to hide she didnt bother with the hostility in the two hours theyd been in the booth together she had barely spoken a word to him a neat trick since the room was barely ten by ten that was fine as a cop he was used to being where he wasnt wanted and he was just contrary enough to enjoy it he liked his job things like annoyance animosity and belligerence didnt concern him the simple fact was that negative emotions were a whole lot easier to deal with than a slug hed had the opportunity to be hit with both though he would have been uncomfortable with the term philosopher he had a habit of analyzing everything down to its most basic terms at the root of this was an elemental belief in right and wrong or though he would have hesitated to use the phrase good and evil he was savvy enough to know that crime often did pay and pay well satisfaction came from playing a part in seeing that it didnt pay for long he was a patient man if a perpetrator took six hours or six months to bring down the results were exactly the same the good guys won stretching out his long legs he continued to page through his book while cilias voice washed over him her voice made him think of porch swings hot summer nights and the sound of a slowmoving river in direct contrast was the tension and restless energy that vibrated from her he was content to enjoy the first and wonder about the second he was driving her crazy just being there cilia switched to a commercial checked her playlist and deliberately ignored him or tried to she didnt like company in the booth it didnt matter that when she had coolly discouraged conversation he had settled back with his book not the western or mens adventure she had expected but a dogeared copy of steinbecks east of eden it didnt matter that he had been patiently quiet for nearly two hours he was there and that was enough she couldnt pretend that the calls had stopped that they meant nothing that her life was back on its normal track not with this lanky cowboy reading the great american novel in the corner of the booth so that she had to all but climb over him to get to the albums stored on the back wall he brought all her nerves swimming to the surface she resented him for that for his intrusion and for the simple fact that he was a cop but that was personal she reminded herself she had a job to do that was inxs taking you to midnight its a new day denver march but were not going out like a lamb its eighteen degrees out there at so tune in and heat up youre listening to khip where you get more hits per hour weve got the news coming up then the request line light up those phones and well rock and roll boyd waited until shed run through the news and moved to a commercial before he marked his place in his book and rose he could feel the tension thicken as he sat in the chair next to cilia i dont want you to cut him off she stiffened and struggled to keep her voice carelessly sarcastic my listeners dont tune in for that kind of show slick you can keep him on the line on the studio speakers without sending it on air right yes but i dont want to cut to a commercial or some music boyd said mildly but keep him on the line we might get lucky and trace the call and if you can keep the request line open until the end of shift to give him enough time to make his move her hands were balled into fists in her lap as she stared at the lights that were already blinking on the phone he was right she knew he was right and she hated it this is an awful lot of trouble for one loose screw dont worry he smiled a little i get paid the same whether the screws are loose or tight she glanced down at the clock cleared her throat then switched on her mike hello denver this is cilia oroarke for khip youre listening to the hottest station in the rockies this is your chance to make it even hotter our request lines are open ill be playing what you want to hear so give me a call at khip thats her finger trembled slightly as she punched the first lit button this is cilia oroarke youre on the air hi cilia this is bob down in englewood she closed her eyes on a shudder of relief he was a regular hey bob hows it going going great my wife and i are celebrating our fifteenth anniversary tonight and they said it wouldnt last what can i play for you bob how about cherish for nancy from bob nice choice heres to fifteen more bob with her pen in one hand she took the second call then the third boyd watched her tighten up after each one she chatted and joked and grew paler at the first break she pulled a cigarette out of the pack then fumbled with a match silently boyd took the matches from her and lit one for her youre doing fine she took a quick jerky puff patient he waited in silence for her to respond do you have to watch me no then he smiled it was a long lazy smile that had her responding in spite of herself a mans entitled to some fringe benefits if this is the best you can do slick you ought to look for another line of work i like this one he rested the ankle of his boot on his knee i like it fine it was easier cilia decided to talk to him than to stare at the blinking lights on the phone and worry have you been a cop long going on ten years she looked at him then struggling to relax by concentrating on his face he had calm eyes she thought dark and calm eyes that had seen a lot and learned to live with it there was a quiet kind of strength there the kind women some women were drawn to he would protect and defend he wouldnt start a fight but he would finish one annoyed with herself she looked away again busying herself with her notes she didnt need to be protected or defended she certainly didnt need anyone to fight for her she had always taken care of herself and she always would its a lousy job she said being a cop he shifted his knee brushed her thigh mostly instinctively she jiggled her chair for another inch of distance its hard to figure why anyone would stick with a lousy job for ten years he just grinned i guess im in a rut she shrugged then turned to her mike that was for bill and maxine our request lines are still open thats after one quick breath she punched a button khip youre on the air it went smoothly so smoothly that she began to relax she took call after call falling into her old established rhythm gradually she began to enjoy the music again the flow of it the pulsing lights on the phone no longer seemed threatening by she was sure she was going to make it through just one night she told herself if he didnt call tonight it would be over she looked at the clock watched the seconds tick by eight more minutes to go and she would turn the airwaves over to jackson she would go home take a long hot bath and sleep like a baby khip youre on the air cilia the hissing whisper shot ice through her veins she reached over reflexively to disconnect but boyd clamped a hand over her wrist and shook his head for a moment she struggled biting back panic his hand remained firm on hers his eyes calm and steady boyd watched as she fought for control until she jammed in a cassette of commercials the bright bouncy jingles transmitted as she put the call on the studio speaker yes pride made her keep her eyes on boyds this is cilia what do you want justice i only want justice for what i want you to think about that i want you to think and wonder and sweat until i come for you why her hand flexed under boyds in an instinctive gesture of reassurance he linked his fingers with hers who are you who am i there was a laugh that skidded along her skin im your shadow your conscience your executioner you have to die when you understand only when you understand ill end it but it wont be quick it wont be easy youre going to pay for what youve done what have i done she shouted for gods sake what have i done he spit out a stream of obscenities that left her dazed and nauseated before he broke the connection with one hand still covering hers boyd punched out a number on the phone you get the trace he demanded then bit off an oath yeah right disgusted he replaced the receiver not long enough he reached up to touch cilias pale cheek you okay she could hardly hear him for the buzzing in her ears but she nodded mechanically she turned to her mike waiting until the commercial jingle faded that about wraps it up for this morning its tina turners going to rock you through until two my man jacksons coming in to keep all you insomniacs company until am this is cilia oroarke for khip remember darling when you dream of me dream good lightheaded she pushed away from the console she only had to stand up she told herself walk to her car drive home it was simple enough she did it every morning of her life but she sat where she was afraid her legs would buckle jackson pushed through the door and stood there hesitating he was wearing a baseball cap to cover his healing hair transplant hey cilia he glanced from her to boyd and back again rough night huh cilia braced herself pasted on a careless smile ive had better with every muscle tensed she shoved herself to her feet ive got them warmed up for you jackson take it easy kid sure the buzzing in her ears was louder as she walked from the booth to snatch her coat from the rack the corridors were dark catching only a faint glow from the lobby where the security lights burned disoriented she blinked she didnt even notice when boyd took her arm and led her outside the cold air helped she took big thirsty gulps of it releasing it again in thin plumes of white smoke my cars over there she said when boyd began to pull her toward the opposite end of the lot youre in no shape to drive im fine great then well go dancing look no you look he was angry furious he hadnt realized it himself until that moment she was shaking and despite the chill wind her cheeks were deathly pale listening to the tapes hadnt been the same as being there when the call came through seeing the blood drain out of her face and her eyes glaze with terror and not being able to do a damn thing to stop it youre a mess oroarke and im not letting you get behind the wheel of a car he stopped next to his car and yanked open the door get in ill take you home she tossed the hair out of her eyes serve and protect right you got it now get in before i arrest you for loitering because her knees felt like jelly she gave in she wanted to be asleep alone in some small quiet room she wanted to scream worse she wanted to cry instead she rounded on boyd the second he settled in the drivers seat you know what i hate even more than cops he turned the key in the ignition i figure youre going to tell me men who order women around just because theyre men i dont figure that as a cultural hangup just stupidity the way i look at it thats two counts against you detective he leaned over deliberately crowding her back in her seat he got a moments intense satisfaction out of seeing her eyes widen in surprise her lips part on a strangled protest the satisfaction would have been greater he knew if he had gone on impulse and covered that stubborn sassy mouth with his own he was certain she would taste exactly as she sounded hot sexy and dangerous instead he yanked her seat belt around her and fastened it her breath came out in a whoosh when he took the wheel again it had been a rough night cilia reminded herself a tense disturbing and unsettling night otherwise she would never have sat like a fool and allowed herself to be intimidated by some modernday cowboy her hands were shaking again the reason didnt seem to matter only the weakness i dont think i like your style slick you dont have to she was getting under his skin boyd realized as he turned out of the lot that was always a mistake do what youre told and well get along fine i dont do what im told she snapped and i dont need a secondrate cop with a john wayne complex to give me orders marks the one who called you in not me i dont need you and i dont want you he braked at a light tough if you think im going to fall apart because some creep calls me names and makes threats youre wrong i dont think youre going to fall apart oroarke any more than you think im going to pick up the pieces if you do good great i can handle him all by myself and if you get your kicks out of listening to that kind of garbage she broke off appalled with herself lifting her hands she pressed them to her face and took three deep breaths im sorry for for taking it out on you she dropped her hands into her lap and stared at them could you pull over for a minute without a word he guided the car to the curb and stopped i want to calm down before i get home in a deliberate effort to relax she let her head fall back and her eyes close i dont want to upset my sister it was hard to hold on to rage and resentment when the woman sitting next to him had turned from barbed wire to fragile glass but if his instincts about cilia were on target too much sympathy would set her off again want some coffee no thanks the corners of her mouth turned up for the briefest instant ive poured in enough to fuel an sst she let out a long cleansing breath the giddiness was gone and with it that floating sense of unreality i am sorry slick youre only doing your job you got that right why do you call me slick she opened her eyes made a brief but comprehensive study of his face because you are turning away she dug in her bag for a cigarette im scared she hated the fact that the admission was shaky that her hand was unsteady as she struck a match youre entitled no im really scared she let out smoke slowly watching a latemodel sedan breeze down the road and into the night he wants to kill me i didnt really believe that until tonight she shuddered is there any heat in this thing he turned the fan on full its better if youre scared why youll cooperate she smiled it was a full flash of a smile that almost stopped his heart no i wont this is only a momentary respite ill be giving you a hard time as soon as i recover ill try not to get used to this but it would be easy he realized to get used to the way her eyes warmed when she smiled the way her voice eased over a man and made him wonder feeling better lots thanks she tapped out her cigarette as he guided the car back on the road i take it you know where i live thats why im a detective its a thankless job she pushed her hair back from her forehead they would talk she decided just talk then she wouldnt have to think why arent you out roping cattle or branding bulls youve got the looks for it he considered a moment im not sure thats a compliment either youre fast on the draw slick boyd he said it wouldnt hurt you to use my name when she only shrugged he slanted her a curious look cilia thatd be from priscilla right no one calls me priscilla more than once why she sent him her sweetest smile because i cut out their tongues right you want to tell me why you dont like cops no she turned away to stare out the side window i like the nighttime she said almost to herself you can do things say things at three oclock in the morning that its just not possible to do or say at three oclock in the afternoon i cant even imagine what its like to work in the daylight anymore when people are crowding the air you dont like people much do you some people she didnt want to talk about herself her likes and dislikes her successes her failures she wanted to talk about him to satisfy her curiosity and to ease her jangled nerves so how long have you had the night shift fletcher about nine months he glanced at her you meet an interesting class of people she laughed surprised that she was able to dont you just are you from denver born and bred i like it she said surprising herself again she hadnt given it a great deal of thought it had simply been a place that offered a good college for deborah and a good opportunity for her yet in six months she realized she had come close to sinking roots shallow ones but roots nonetheless does that mean youre going to stick around he turned down a quiet side street i did some research it seems two years in one spots about your limit i like change she said flatly closing down the lines of communication she didnt care for the idea of anyone poking into her past and her private life when he pulled up in her driveway she was already unsnapping her seat belt thanks for the ride slick before she could dash to her door he was beside her im going to need your keys they were already in her hand she clutched them possessively why so i can have your car dropped off in the morning she jingled them frowning as she stood under the front porch light boyd wondered what it would be like to walk her to her door after an ordinary date he wouldnt keep his hands in his pockets he thought ruefully and he certainly would scratch this itch by kissing her outside the door outside hell he admitted he would have been through the door with her and there would have been more to the end of the evening than a goodnight kiss but it wasnt a date and any fool could see that there wasnt going to be anything remotely ordinary between them something that he promised himself but nothing remotely resembling the ordinary keys he repeated after going over her options cilia had decided his was best carefully she removed a single key from the chain which was shaped like a huge musical note thanks hold it he placed the palm of his hand on the door as she unlocked it youre not going to ask me in for a cup of coffee she didnt turn only twisted her head no she smelled like the night he thought dark deep dangerous thats downright unfriendly the flash of humor came again i know see you around slick his hand dropped onto hers on the knob took a firm hold do you eat the humor vanished that didnt surprise him what did was what replaced it confusion and he could have sworn shyness she recovered so quickly that he was certain hed imagined it once or twice a week tomorrow his hand remained over hers he couldnt be sure about what hed thought he saw in her eyes but he knew her pulse had quickened under his fingers i may eat tomorrow with me it amazed her that she fumbled it had been years since shed experienced this baffling reaction to a man and those years had been quiet and smooth refusing a date was as simple as saying no at least it always had been for her now she found herself wanting to smile and ask him what time she should be ready the words were nearly out of her mouth before she caught herself thats an incredibly smooth offer detective but ill have to pass why i dont date cops before she could weaken she slipped inside and closed the door in his face boyd shuffled the papers on his desk and scowled the oroarke case was hardly his only assignment but he couldnt get his mind off it couldnt get his mind off oroarke he thought wishing briefly but intensely for a cigarette the veteran cop sitting two feet away from him was puffing away like a chimney as he talked to a snitch boyd breathed in deep wishing he could learn to hate the smell like other nonsmokers instead he continued to torture himself by drawing in the seductive scent that and the other less appealing aromas of a precinct station overheated coffee overheated flesh the cheap perfume hovering around a pair of working girls who lounged resignedly on a nearby bench intrusions he thought that he rarely noticed in the daytoday scheme of things tonight they warred with his concentration the smells the sound of keyboards clicking phones ringing shoes scuffing along the linoleum the way one of the overhead lights winked sporadically it didnt help his disposition that for the past three days priscilla alice oroarke had stuck fast to his mind like a thick thorny spike no amount of effort could shake her loose it might be because both he and his partner had spent hours at a time with her in the booth during her show it might be because hed seen her with her defenses down it might be because hed felt fleetingly her surge of response to him it might be boyd thought in disgust then again it might not he wasnt a man whose ego was easily bruised by the refusal of a date he liked to think that he had enough confidence in himself to understand he didnt appeal to every woman the fact that hed appealed to what he considered a healthy number of them in his thirtythree years was enough to satisfy him the trouble was he was hung up on one woman and she wasnt having any of it he could live with it the simple fact was that he had a job to do now he wasnt convinced that cilia was in any immediate danger but she was being harassed systematically and thoroughly both he and althea had started the ball rolling questioning men with priors that fit the mo poking their fingers into cilias personal and professional life since she had come to denver quietly investigating her coworkers so far the score was zip time to dig deeper boyd decided he had cilias resume in his hand it was an interesting piece of work in itself just like the woman it belonged to it showed her bouncing from a onehorse station in georgia which accounted for that faint and fascinating southern drawl to a major player in atlanta then on to richmond st louis chicago dallas before landing feet first obviously in denver at khip the lady likes to move he mused or was it that she needed to run that was a question of semantics and he intended to get the answer straight from the horses mouth the one thing he could be sure of from the bald facts typed out in front of him was that cilia had pulled herself along the road to success with a high school diploma and a lot of guts it couldnt have been easy for a woman a girl really at eighteen to break into what was still a largely maledominated business interesting reading althea settled a hip on the corner of his desk no one in the station house would have dared whistle at her legs but plenty of them looked cilia oroarke he tossed the resume down impressions tough lady she grinned as she said it shed spent a lot of time razzing boyd about his fascination with the sultry voice on the radio likes to do things her own way smart and professional he picked up a box of candycoated almonds and shook some into his hand i think i figured all that out myself well figure this althea took the box and carefully selected one glossy nut shes scared down to the bone and shes got an inferiority complex a mile wide inferiority complex boyd gave a quick snort and kicked back in his chair not a chance with the same careful deliberation althea chose another candied almond she hides it behind three feet of steel but its there althea laid a hand on the toe of his boot womans intuition fletcher thats why youre so damn lucky to have me boyd snatched the box back knowing althea could and would methodically work her way through to the last piece if that womans insecure ill eat my hat you dont have a hat ill get one and eat it dismissing his partners instincts he gestured toward the files since our man isnt letting up were going to have to go looking elsewhere for him the lady isnt very forthcoming about her past so we push althea considered a moment then she shifted her weight gracefully recrossed her legs want to flip a coin because the odds are shell push back boyd grinned im counting on it its your turn in the booth tonight then you start with chicago he handed her the file we got the station manager the landlord he scanned the sheet himself he intended to go far beyond what was printed there but he would start with the facts use that sweet persuasive voice of yours theyll spill their guts thousands have she glanced over idly as an associate shoved a swearing suspect with a bloody nose into a nearby chair there was a brief tussle and a spate of curses followed by mumbled threats god i love this place yeah theres no place like home he snatched up what was left of his coffee before his partner could reach for it ill work from the other end the first station she worked for thea if we dont come up with something soon the captains going to yank us she rose then well have to come up with something he nodded before he could pick up the phone it rang fletcher slick he would have grimaced at the nickname if he hadnt heard the fear first cilia what is it i got a call a quick bubble of laughter worked its way through old news i guess im at home this time though and i damn im jumping at shadows lock your doors and sit tight im on my way cilia he said when there was no response im on my way thanks if you could break a few traffic laws getting here id be obliged ten minutes he hung up thea he caught her before she could complete the first call lets move chapter contents prev next she had herself under control by the time they got to her above all she felt foolish to have run to the police to him because of a phone call only phone calls cilia assured herself as she paced to the window and back after a week of them she should have a better handle on it if she could tone down her reaction convince the caller that what he said and how he said it left her unaffected they would stop her father had taught her that that was the way to handle bullies then again her mothers solution had been a right jab straight to the jaw while cilia saw value in both viewpoints she thought the passive approach was more workable under the circumstances shed done a lousy job of it with the last call she admitted sometime during his tirade shed come uncomfortably close to hysteria shouting back pleading meeting threats with threats she could only be grateful that deborah hadnt been home to hear it struggling for calm she perched on the arm of a chair her body rulerstraight her mind scrambling after the call she had turned off the radio locked the doors pulled the drapes now in the glow of the lamplight she sat listening for a sound any sound while she scanned the room the walls she and deborah had painted the furniture they had picked out argued about familiar things cilia thought calming things after only six months there was already a scattering of knickknacks something they hadnt allowed themselves before but this time the house wasnt rented the furniture wasnt leased it was theirs perhaps that was why though theyd never discussed it they had begun to fill it with little things useless things the china cat who curled in a permanent nap on the cluttered bookshelf the foolishly expensive glossy white bowl with hibiscus blossoms painted on the rim the dapper frog in black tie and tails they were making a home cilia realized for the first time since they had found themselves alone they were making a home she wouldnt let some vicious faceless voice over the phone spoil that what was she going to do because she was alone she allowed herself a moment of despair and dropped her head into her hands should she fight back but how could she fight someone she couldnt see and didnt understand should she pretend indifference but how long could she keep up that kind of pretense especially if he continued to invade her private hours as well as her public ones and what would happen when he finally wearied of talk and came to her in person the brisk knock on the door had her jolting had her pressing a hand between her breasts to hold in her suddenly frantic heart im your executioner im going to make you suffer im going to make you pay cilia its boyd open the door she needed a moment more needed to cover her face with her hands and breathe deep steadier now she crossed to the door and opened it hi you made good time she nodded to althea detective grayson cilia gestured them inside then leaned her back against the closed door i feel stupid for calling you all the way out here just part of the job althea told her the woman was held together by very thin wires she decided a few of them had already snapped would you mind if we all sat down no im sorry cilia dragged a hand through her hair she wasnt putting on a very good show she thought and she prided herself on putting on a good show i could ah make some coffee dont worry about it he sat on an oatmealcolored couch and leaned back against sapphireblue pillows tell us what happened i wrote it down the underlying nerves showed in her movements as she walked to the phone to pick up a pad of paper a radio habit she said the phone rings and i start writing she wasnt ready to admit that she didnt want to repeat the conversation out loud some of its in oroarke shorthand but you should get the drift he took the pad from her and scanned the words his gut muscles tightened in a combination of fury and revulsion outwardly calm he handed the note to his partner cilia couldnt sit instead she stood in the center of the room twisting her fingers together dragging them apart again to tug at her baggy sweatshirt hes pretty explicit about what he thinks of me and what he intends to do about it is this your first call at home boyd asked her yes i dont know how he got the number i were not listed althea put the pad aside and took out her own who has your home number the station cilia relaxed fractionally this was something she could deal with simple questions simple answers it would be on file at the college my lawyer thats carl donnely downtown there are a couple of guys that deb sees josh holden and darren mckinley a few girlfriends she ran through the brief list thats about it what im really concerned about is she spun around as the door opened behind her deb relief and annoyance speared through her i thought you had evening classes i did she turned a pair of big smoldering blue eyes on boyd and althea are you the police deborah cilia said you know better than to cut classes you had a test stop treating me like a child she slapped the newspaper she was carrying into cilias hand do you really expect me to go along like nothings wrong damn it cilia you told me it was all under control so shed made the first page of section b cilia thought wearily latenight radio princess under siege trying to soothe a growing tension headache she rubbed her fingers at her temple it is under control stuff like this makes good copy thats all no thats not all ive called the police she snapped back as she tossed the paper aside what else do you want there was a resemblance between the two boyd noted objectively the shape of the mouth and eyes while cilia was alluring and sexy enough to make a mans head turn a her sister was handsdown gorgeous young he thought maybe eighteen in a few years shed barely have to glance at a man to have him swallow his tongue he also noted the contrasts deborahs hair was short and fluffed cilias was long and untamed the younger sister wore a deep crimson sweater over tailored slacks that were tucked into glossy half boots cilias mismatched sweats bagged and hit on a variety of colors the top was purple the bottoms green shed chosen thick yellow socks and orange hightops their tastes might clash he mused but their temperaments seemed very much in tune and when the oroarke sisters were in a temper it was quite a show shifting only slightly althea whispered near his ear obviously theyve done this before boyd grinned if hed had popcorn and a beer he would have been content to sit through another ten rounds whos your money on cilia she murmured crossing one smooth leg but the sisters a real upandcomer apparently weary of beating her head against a brick wall deborah turned okay she poked a finger at boyd you tell me whats going on ah never mind she zeroed in on althea you biting back a smile althea nodded were the investigating officers on your sisters case miss oroarke so there is a case ignoring cilias furious look althea nodded again yes with the stations cooperation we have a trace on the studio line detective fletcher and i have already interrogated a number of suspects who have priors for obscene or harassing phone calls with this latest development well put a tap on your private line latest development it only took deborah a moment oh cilia not here he didnt call you here temper forgotten she threw her arms around her sister im sorry its nothing for you to worry about when deborah stiffened cilia drew back i mean it deb its nothing for either of us to worry about weve got the pros to do the worrying thats right althea rose detective fletcher and i have over fifteen years on the force between us we intend to take good care of your sister is there a phone i can use to make some arrangements in the kitchen deborah said before cilia could comment she wanted a private interview ill show you she paused and smiled at boyd would you like some coffee detective thanks he watched her what man wouldnt as she walked from the room dont even think about it cilia mumbled excuse me but he grinned it didnt take a detective to recognize a mother hen your sister deborah right shes something youre too old for her ouch cilia picked up a cigarette and forced herself to settle on the arm of a chair again in any case you and detective grayson seem well suited to each other thea he had to grin again most of the time he forgot his partner was a woman yeah im one lucky guy cilia ground her teeth she hated to think she could be intimidated by another woman althea grayson was personable enough professional enough cilia could even handle the fact that she was stunning it was just that she was so together boyd rose to take the unlit cigarette from her fingers jealous in your dreams slick well get into my dreams later he lifted her chin up with a fingertip holding on im fine she wanted to move but she had the feeling he wouldnt give her room if she stood and if she stood it would be much too easy to drop her head on his shoulder and just cave in she had responsibilities obligations and her pride i dont want deb mixed up in this shes alone here at night while im at work i can arrange to have a cruiser stationed outside she nodded grateful i hate it that somewhere along the line ive made a mistake that might put her in danger she doesnt deserve it unable to resist he spread his fingers to cup her cheek neither do you it had been a long time since shed been touched allowed herself to be touched even that casually she managed to shrug i havent figured that out yet she gave a little sigh wishing she could close her eyes and turn her face into that strong capable hand ive got to get ready to go to the station why dont you give that a pass tonight and let him think hes got me running scared she stood then not on a bet even wonder woman takes a night off she shook her head shed been right about him not giving her room her escape routes were blocked by the chair on one side and his body on the other tension quivered through her pride kept her eyes level he was waiting damn him and unless he was blind or stupid he would see that this contact this connection with him left her frazzled youre crowding me fletcher in another minute just one more minute he would have given in to impulse and pulled her against him he would have seen just how close to reality his fantasy was i havent begun to crowd you oroarke her eyes sharpened ive had enough threats for one day thanks he wanted to strangle her for that slowly his eyes on hers he hooked his thumbs in his pockets no threat babe just a fact deborah decided shed eavesdropped long enough and cleared her throat coffee detective fletcher she passed him a steaming mug thea said black two sugars thanks im going to hang around she said silently daring cilia to argue with her they should be here in an hour or so to hook up the phone then she put her hands on cilias shoulders and kissed both of her cheeks i havent missed a class this semester simon simon boyd commented legree with a laugh deborah kissed cilia again the womans a slave driver i dont know what youre talking about cilia moved aside to gather up her purse you ought to catch up on your reading for us studies your political science could use a boost it wouldnt hurt to bone up on psychology she pulled her coat from the closet while youre at it the kitchen floor needs scrubbing im sure we have an extra toothbrush you could use on it and id like another cord of wood chopped deborah laughed go away cilia grinned as she reached for the doorknob her hand closed over boyds she jolted back before she could stop herself what are you doing hitching a ride with you he sent deborah a quick wink as he pulled cilia out the door this is ridiculous cilia said as she strode into the station which i dont see why i have to have a cop in the studio with me night after night she whipped off her coat as she walked a bit like a bullfighter swirling a cape boyd thought still scowling she reached for the door of a small storage room then shrieked and stumbled back against boyd as it swung open jeez billy you scared the life out of me sorry the maintenance man had graying hair toothpick arms and an apologetic grin i was out of window cleaner he held up his spray bottle its okay im a little jumpy i heard about it he hooked the trigger of the bottle in his belt then gathered up a mop and bucket dont worry cilia im here till midnight thanks are you going to listen to the show tonight you bet he walked away favoring his right leg in a slight limp cilia stepped inside the room and located a fresh bottle of stylus cleaner taking a fivedollar bill out of her bag she slipped it into a pile of cleaning rags what was that for he was in vietnam she said simply and closed the door again boyd said nothing knowing she was annoyed hed caught her he chalked it up to one more contradiction to prep for her shift she went into a small lounge to run over the daily log for her show adding and deleting as it suited her the program director had stopped screaming about this particular habit months before another reason she preferred the night shift was the leeway it gave her this new group she muttered what boyd helped himself to a sugared doughnut this new group the studs she tapped her pencil against the table oneshot deal hardly worth the airtime then why play them got to give them a fair shake intent on her work she took an absent bite of the doughnut boyd held to her lips in six months nobody will remember their names thats rock and roll no the beatles buddy holly chuck berry springsteen elvis thats rock and roll he leaned back considering her ever listen to anything else she grinned then licked a speck of sugar from her top lip you mean there is something else have you always been onetrack yeah she pulled a band of fabric out of her pocket with a couple of flicks of the wrist she had her hair tied back so what kind of music do you like the beatles buddy holly chuck well theres hope for you yet she interrupted mozart lena home beaujolais joan jett ella fitzgerald bb king her brow lifted so were eclectic were openminded she leaned back a moment youre a surprise fletcher i guess i figured you for the lovingandhurting drinkingandcheating type in music appreciation or personality both she glanced at the clock its show time wild bob williams who had the sixtoten slot was just finishing up his show he was short paunchy and middleaged with the voice of a twentyyearold stud he gave cilia a brief salute as she began sorting through s and albums mmm the longlegged filly just walked in he hit a switch that had an echoing heartbeat pounding get ready out there in khip land your midnight stars rising im leaving you with this blast from the past he potted up honky tonk woman he swung out of his chair and stretched his rubbery leg muscles hey honey you okay sure she set her first cut on the turntable and adjusted the needle i caught the paper no big deal bob hey were family around here he gave her shoulder a quick squeeze were behind you thanks youre the cop he asked boyd thats right get this guy soon hes got us all shaking he gave cilia another squeeze let me know if you need anything i will thanks she didnt want to think about it couldnt afford to think about it with thirty seconds to air taking her seat she adjusted the mike took a series of long deep breaths ran a onetwothree voice check then opened her mike all right denver this is cilia oroarke coming to you on number one khip youve got me from ten till two in the am were going to start off giving away one hundred and nine dollars weve got the mystery record coming up if you can give me the title the artist and the year youve got yourself a fistful of cash that number is stand by cause were going to rock the music blasted out pleasing her she was in control again elton john boyd said from behind her honky cat nineteen seventy two she turned in her chair to face him he was looking damned pleased with himself she thought that half grin on his face his hands in his pockets it was a shame he was so attractive a bloody crying shame well well you surprise me slick remind me to put you down for a free tshirt id rather have a dinner and id rather have a porsche but there you go hey she said when he took her hand youve been biting your nails he skimmed a thumb over her knuckles and watched her eyes change another bad habit ive got lots more good instead of sitting back in the corner he chose a chair beside her i didnt have time to get a book he explained why dont i watch you work why dont you she swore then punched a button on the phone hed nearly made her miss her cue khip can you name the mystery record it took five calls before she had a winner trying to ignore boyd she put on another cut while she took the winners name and address as if she didnt have enough on her mind she thought how was she supposed to concentrate on her show when he was all but sitting on top of her close enough she realized that she could smell him no cologne just soap something that brought the mountains to mind one moment and quiet intimate nights the next she wasnt interested in either she reminded herself all she wanted was to get through this crisis and get her life back on an even keel attractive men came and went she knew but success stayed as long as you were willing to sweat for it she shifted stretching out to select a new record their thighs brushed his were long and as hard as rock determined not to jolt she turned her head to look into his eyes inches apart challenge meeting challenge she watched as his gaze dipped down to linger on her mouth and it lifted again desire flickering music pulsed in her ears from the headphones she stubbornly wore so that she wouldnt have to speak to him they were singing of hot nights and grinding needs very carefully she moved away when she spoke into the mike again her voice was even huskier he rose hed decided it was his only defense hed meant to annoy her to distract her from the inevitable phone call that would come before the night was over hed wanted her mind off it and on him he wouldnt deny that hed wanted her to think of him but he hadnt known that when hed succeeded she would tie him up in knots she smelled like midnight secret and sinful she sounded like sex hot and inviting then you looked into her eyes really looked and saw simple innocence the man that combination wouldnt drive mad either had never been born or was already dead a little distance boyd told himself as he moved quietly out of the studio a lot of objectivity it wouldnt do either one of them any good to allow his emotions to get so tangled up with a woman he was supposed to protect when she was alone cilia made a conscious effort to relax muscle by muscle it was just because she was already on edge it was a comfort to believe that her reaction to boyd was merely an echo of the tension shed lived with for more than a week and he was trying to goad her she blew the hair out of her eyes and gave her listeners a treat two hits in a row and herself another moment to calm she hadnt figured him out yet he read steinbeck and recognized elton john he talked slow and lazy and thought fast he wore scarred boots and threehundreddollar jackets what did it matter she asked herself as she set up for the next twenty minutes of her show she wasnt interested in men and he was definitely a man strike one she would never consider getting involved with a cop strike two and anyone with eyes could see that he had a close even intimate relationship with his knockout partner shed never been one to poach on someone elses property three strikes and hes out she closed her eyes and let the music pour through her it helped as it always did to calm her or lift her up or simply remind her how lucky she was she wasnt sharp and studious like deborah she wasnt dedicated as their parents had been she had little more than the education required by law and yet she was here just where she wanted to be doing just what she wanted to do life had taught her one vital lesson nothing lasted forever good times or bad they passed this nightmare however horrid it was at this point in time would be over eventually she only had to get through it one day at a time that was joan jett waking you up as we head toward eleventhirty weve got a news brief coming up for you then a double shot of steve winwood and phil collins to take us into the next half hour this is khip and the news is brought to you by wildwood records she punched in the prerecorded cassette then scanned the printout of the ads and promos she would read by the time boyd came back she was into the next block of music and standing up to stretch her muscles he stopped where he was trying not to groan as she lifted her arms to the ceiling and rotated her hips in time to the music he was sure as she bent from the waist grabbed her ankles and slowly bent and straightened her knees hed seen the routine before it was something she did once or twice during her fourhour stint but she thought she was alone now and she put a little more rhythm into it watching her he realized that the tenminute break hed taken hadnt been nearly long enough she sat again pattered a bit to the audience her headphones were around her neck now as shed turned the music up for her own pleasure as it pulsed she swayed when he put a hand on her shoulder she bolted out of the chair easy oroarke i brought you some tea her heart was like a triphammer in her chest as it slowed she lowered to the table what tea he repeated offering her a cup i brought you some tea you drink too much coffee this is herbal jasmine or something shed recovered enough to look at the cup in distaste i dont drink flowers try it you might not hit the ceiling the next time someone touches you he sipped a soft drink out of the bottle id rather have that he took another sip a long one then passed the bottle to her youre almost halfway there like boyd she looked at the clock it was nearing midnight this had once been her favorite leg of the show now as she watched the second hand tick away her palms began to sweat maybe he wont call tonight since he got me at home he settled beside her again maybe but you dont think so i think we take it a step at a time he put a soothing hand at the back of her neck i want you to try to keep calm keep him on the line longer ask questions no matter what he says just keep asking them over and over he may just answer one and give us something she nodded then worked her way through the next ten minutes theres a question i want to ask you she said at length all right she didnt look at him but drained the last swallow of the cold drink to ease her dry throat how long will they let me have a babysitter you dont have to worry about it lets just say i know something about how police departments work it was there in her voice again that touch of bitterness and regret a few nasty calls dont warrant a hell of a lot of attention youre lifes been threatened he said it helps that youre a celebrity and that theres already been some press on it ill be around for a while mixed blessings she muttered then opened the request line the call came as she had known it would but quickly this time on call number five she recognized the voice battled back the urge to scream and switched to music without realizing it she groped for boyds hand youre persistent arent you i want you dead im almost ready now do i know you i like to think i know everyone who wants to kill me she winced a little at the names he spewed at her and tried to concentrate on the steady pressure of boyds fingers at the base of her neck wow ive really got you ticked off you know buddy if you dont like the show youve just got to turn it off you seduced him there was a sound of weeping now fueled with fury you seduced him tempted him promised him then you murdered him i she was more shocked by this than by any of the gutter names he had called her who i dont know what youre talking about please who the line went dead as she sat there dazed and silent boyd snatched up the phone any luck damn it he rose stuffed his hands in his pockets and began pacing another ten seconds wed have had him in another ten seconds he has to know weve got it tapped his head snapped around when nick peters entered his hands full of sloshing coffee what i i i his adams apple bobbed as he swallowed mark said it was okay if i stayed through the show he swallowed again i thought cilia might want some coffee boyd jerked a thumb toward the table well let you know can you help her get through the rest of the show i dont need help cilias voice was icycalm im fine nick dont worry about it she put a steady hand on the mike that was for chuck from laurie with all her love she aimed a steady look at boyd before she punched the phone again khip youre on the air she got through it that was all that mattered and she wasnt going to fall apart the way she had the other night cilia was grateful for that all she needed to do was think it all through she hadnt objected when boyd took the wheel of her car relinquishing the right to drive was the least of her worries im coming in boyd said after he parked the car she just shrugged and started for the door very deliberately she hung up her coat and pried off her shoes she sat still without speaking and lit a cigarette the marked cruiser outside had relieved her mind deborah was safe and asleep look she began once shed marshaled her thoughts there really isnt any use going into this i think i have it figured out do you he didnt sit down her icy calm disturbed him much more than hysterics or anger would have fill me in its obvious hes made a mistake he has me mixed up with someone else i just have to convince him just have to convince him boyd repeated and how do you intend to do that the next time he calls ill make him listen she crossed an arm across her body and began to rub at the chill in her shoulder for gods sake fletcher i havent murdered anyone so youll tell him that and hell be perfectly reasonable and apologize for bothering you her carefully built calm was wearing thin ill make him understand youre trying to make yourself believe hes rational cilia hes not what am i supposed to do she demanded snapping the cigarette in two as she crushed it out whether hes rational or not i have to make him see hes made a mistake ive never killed anyone her laugh was strained as she pulled the band from her hair ive never seduced anyone give me a break anger brought her out of the chair what do you see me as some kind of black widow who goes around luring men then knocking them off when im finished get the picture fletcher im a voice a damn good one thats where it ends youre a great deal more than voice cilia we both know that he paused waiting for her to look at him again and so does he something trembled inside her part fear part longing she wanted neither whatever i am im no temptress its an act a show and it has nothing to do with reality my exhusband would be the first to tell you i dont even have a sex drive his eyes sharpened you never mentioned youd been married and she hadnt intended to cilia thought as she wearily combed a hand through her hair it was a million years ago what does it matter everything applies i want his name and address i dont know his address we didnt even last a year i was twenty years old for gods sake she began to rub at her forehead his name cilia paul paul lomax i havent seen him for about eight years since he divorced me she spun to the window then back again the point is this guys on the wrong frequency hes got it into his head i what used my wiles on some guy and that doesnt wash apparently he thinks it does well he thinks wrong i couldnt even keep one man happy so its a joke to think i could seduce legions thats a stupid remark even for you do you think i like admitting that im all show that im lousy in bed she bit off the words as she paced the last man i went out with told me i had ice water for blood but i didnt kill him she calmed a little amused in spite of herself i thought about it though i think its time you start to take this whole business seriously and i think its time you start taking yourself seriously i take myself very seriously professionally he agreed you know exactly what to do and how to do it personally youre the first woman ive met who was so willing to concede she couldnt make a man dance to her tune im a realist i think youre a coward her chin shot up go to hell he wasnt about to back off he had a point to prove to both of them i think youre afraid to get close to a man afraid to find out just whats inside maybe youd find out its something you cant control i dont need this from you you just get this man off my back she started to storm past him but was brought up short when he grabbed her arm what do you say to an experiment an experiment why dont you give it a try oroarke with me it should be safe since you can barely stand the sight of me a test he took her other arm lowrisk he could feel the anger vibrate through her as he held her good for reasons he couldnt have begun to name he was just as angry five to one i dont feel a thing he drew her inches closer want to prove me wrong chapter contents prev next they were close she had lifted one hand in an unconscious defensive gesture and now her fingers were splayed across his chest she could feel his heartbeat slow and steady beneath her palm she focused her resentment on that even rhythm as her own pulse jerked and scrambled i dont have to prove anything to you he nodded the barely banked fury in her eyes was easier for him to handle than the glaze of fear it replaced to yourself then deliberately he smiled baiting her whats the matter oroarke do i scare you hed pushed exactly the right button they both knew it he didnt give a damn if it was temper that pushed her forward as long as she moved she tossed her hair back and slowly purposefully slid her hand from his chest to his shoulder she wanted a reaction hang him he only lifted a brow and with that faint smile playing around his mouth watched her so he wanted to play games she thought well she was up for it tossing common sense aside she pressed her lips to his his were firm cool and unresponsive with her eyes open she watched his remain patient steady and hatefully amused as her hand balled into a fist on his shoulder she snapped her head back satisfied not hardly his eyes might have been calm that was training but if she had bothered to monitor his heartbeat she would have found it erratic youre not trying oroarke he slid a hand down to her hip shifting her balance just enough to have her sway against him you want me to believe thats the best you can do angry humiliation rippled through her cursing him she dragged his mouth to hers and poured herself into the kiss his lips were still firm but they were no longer cool nor were they unresponsive for an instant the urge to retreat hammered at her and then needs almost forgotten needs surged a flood of longings a storm of desires overwhelmed by them she strained against him letting the power and the heat whip through her reminding her what it was like to sample passion again every other thought every other wish winked out she could feel the long hard length of him pressed against her the slow deliberate stroke of his hands as they moved up her back and into her hair his mouth no longer patient took and took from hers until the blood pounded like thunder in her head hed known she would pack a punch hed thought he was prepared for it in the days hed known her hed imagined tasting her like this dozens of times hed imagined what it would be like to hold her against him to hear her sigh to catch the fevered scent of her skin as he took his mouth over her but reality was much more potent than any dream had been chain lightning she was every bit as explosive as turbulent as potentially lethal the current sparked and sizzled from her into him leaving him breathless dazed and churning even as he groaned against the onslaught he felt her arch away from the power that snapped back into her she shuddered against him and made a sound part protest part confusion as she tried to struggle away hed wrapped her hair around his hand he had only to tug gently to have her head fall back to have her eyes dark and cloudy on his he took his time letting his gaze skim over her face he wanted to see in her eyes what he had felt the reflection was there that most elemental yearning he smiled again as her lips trembled open and her breath came fast and uneven im not finished yet he told her then dragged her against him again and plundered she needed to think but her thoughts couldnt fight their way through the sensations layers of them thin and silky seemed to cover her fogging the reason drugging the will before panic could slice through she was rocketing up again clinging to him opening for him demanding from him he knew he could feast and never be full not when her mouth was hot and moist and ripe with flavor he knew he could hold yet never control not when her body was vibrating from the explosion they had ignited together the promise he had heard in her voice seen in her eyes was here for the taking unable to resist he slid his hands under her sweatshirt to find the warmed satin skin beneath he took possessed exploited until the ache spreading through his body turned to pain too fast he warned himself too soon for both of them holding her steady he lifted his head and waited for her to surface she dragged her eyes open and saw only his face she gulped in air and tasted only his flavor reeling she pressed a hand to her temple then let it fall to her side i i want to sit down that makes two of us taking her arm he led her to the couch and sat beside her she worked on steadying her breathing focused on the dark window across the room maybe with enough time enough distance she would be able to convince herself that what had just happened had not been lifealtering that was stupid it was a lot of things he pointed out stupid doesnt come to mind she took one more deep breath you made me angry it isnt hard listen boyd so you can say it before she could stop him he stroked a hand down her hair in a casually intimate gesture that made her pulse rate soar again does that mean you dont use a mans name until youve kissed him it doesnt mean anything she stood up hoping shed get the strength back in her legs quicker by pacing obviously weve gotten off the track theres more than one he settled back thinking it was a pleasure to watch her move there was something just fine and dandy about watching the swing of long feminine legs as she paced nervous energy crackling he tossed an arm over the back of the couch and stretched out his legs theres only one for me she threw him a look over her shoulder youd better understand that okay well ride on that one for a while he could afford to wait since he had every intention of switching lines again and soon you seem to have some kind of screwy notion that the only thing that attracts men to you is your voice your act i think we just proved you wrong what just happened proved nothing if there was anything more infuriating than that slow patient smile of his she had yet to see it in any case that has nothing to do with the man whos calling me youre a smart woman cilia use your head hes fixed on you but not for himself he wants to pay you back for something you did to another man someone you knew he continued when she stopped long enough to pick up a cigarette someone who was involved with you ive already told you theres no one no one now no one now no one before no one for years having experienced that first wave of her passion he found that more than difficult to believe still he nodded so it didnt mean as much to you maybe thats the problem for gods sake fletcher i dont even date i dont have the time or the inclination well talk about your inclinations later weary she turned away to stare blindly through the glass damn it boyd get out of my life its your life were talking about there was an edge to his voice that had her holding back the snide comment she wanted to make if theres been no one in denver well start working our way back but i want you to think and think hard whos shown an interest in you someone who calls the station more than normal who asks to meet you asks personal questions someone whos approached you asked you out made a play she gave a short humorless laugh you have remind me to run a make on myself his voice was deceptively mild but she caught the underlying annoyance and frustration in it who else cilia theres no one no one whos pushed wishing for a moments just a moments peace of mind she pressed the heels of her hands against her eyes i get calls thats the idea i get some that ask me for a date some that even send presents you know candyandflower types nothing very sinister about a bunch of roses theres a lot sinister about death threats she wanted to speak calmly practically but she couldnt keep the nastiness out of her voice i cant remember everyone whos called and flirted with me on the air guys i turn down stay turned down he could only shake his head it was a wonder to him that such a sharp woman could be so naive in certain situations all right well shoot for a different angle you work with men almost all men at the station were professionals she snapped and began biting her nails marks happily married bobs happily married jims a friend a good one you forgot nick nick peters what about him hes crazy about you what she was surprised enough to turn around thats ridiculous hes a kid after a long study he let out a sigh you really havent noticed have you theres nothing to notice more disturbed than she wanted to admit she turned away again look slick this is getting us nowhere and im her words trailed off and her hand crept slowly toward her throat and youre what theres a man across the street hes watching the house get away from the window what boyd was already up and jerking her aside stay away from the windows and keep the door locked dont open it again until i get back she nodded and followed him to the door her lips pressed together as she watched him take out his weapon that single gesture snapped her back to reality it had been a smooth movement not so much practiced as instinctive ten years on the force she remembered hed drawn and fired before she wouldnt tell him to be careful those were useless words im going to take a look lock the door behind me gone was the laidback man who had taunted her into an embrace one look at his face and she could see that he was all cop their eyes changed she thought the emotion drained out of them there was no room for emotion when you held a gun if im not back in ten minutes call for backup understood yes she gave in to the need to touch his arm yes she repeated after he slipped out she shoved the bolt into place and waited he hadnt buttoned his coat and the deep wind of the early hours whipped through his shirt his weapon warmed from sitting in its nest against his side fitted snug in his hand sweeping his gaze right then left he found the street deserted dark but for the pools of light from the streetlamps spaced at regular intervals it was only a quiet suburban neighborhood cozily asleep in the predawn hours the night wind sounded through the naked trees in low moans he didnt doubt cilias words wouldnt have doubted it even if he hadnt caught a glimpse through her window of a lone figure on the opposite sidewalk whoever had been there was gone now probably alerted the moment cilia had spotted him as if to punctuate boyds thoughts there was the sound of an engine turning over a block or two away he swore but didnt bother to give chase with that much of a lead it would be a waste of time instead he walked a half block in each direction then carefully circled the house cilia had her hand on the phone when he knocked its okay its boyd in three hurried strides she was at the door did you see him she demanded the moment boyd stepped inside no he was there i swear it i know he relocked the door himself try to relax hes gone now relax in the past ten minutes shed had more than enough time to work herself from upset to frantic he knows where i work where i live how in gods name am i ever supposed to relax again if you hadnt scared him off he might have she dragged her hands through her hair she didnt want to think about what might have happened didnt dare boyd didnt speak for a moment instead he watched as she slowly painfully brought herself under control why dont you take some time off stay home for a few days well arrange for a blackandwhite to cruise the neighborhood she allowed herself the luxury of sinking into a chair what difference does it make if im here or at the station she shook her head before he could speak and if i stayed home id go crazy thinking about it worrying about it at least at work i have other things on my mind he hadnt expected her to agree well talk about it later right now youre tired why dont you go to bed ill sleep on the couch she wanted to be strong enough to tell him it wasnt necessary she didnt need to be protected but the wave of gratitude made her weak ill get you a blanket it was almost dawn when he dragged himself home hed driven a long time from one sleepy suburb to another into an eerily quiet downtown covering his trail the panic had stayed with him for the first hour but hed beaten it made himself drive slowly carefully being stopped by a roving patrol car could have ruined all of his plans under the heavy muffler and cap he was wearing he was sweating in the thin canvas tennis shoes his feet were like ice but he was too accustomed to discomfort to notice he staggered into the bathroom never turning on a light with ease he avoided his earlywarning devices the thin wire stretched from the arm of the spindly chair to the arm of the faded couch the tower of cans at the entrance to his bedroom he had excellent night vision it was something hed always been proud of he showered in the dark letting the water run cold over his tensed body as he began to relax he allowed himself to draw in the fragrance of soap his favorite scent he used a rough longhandled brush to violently scrub every inch of his skin as he washed the dark began to lessen with the first watery light of dawn over his heart was an intricate tattoo of two knives blades crossed in an x with his fingers he caressed them he remembered when it had still been new when he had shown it to john john had been so impressed so fascinated the image came so clearly johns dark excited eyes his voice the way he spoke so quickly that the words tumbled into each other sometimes they had sat in the dark and talked for hours making plans and promises they were going to travel together do great things together then the world had interfered life had interfered the woman had interfered dripping he stepped from the shower the towel was exactly where he had placed it no one came into this room into any of his rooms to disturb his carefully ordered space once he was dry he pulled on faded pajamas they reminded him of the childhood hed been cheated out of as the sun came up he made two enormous sandwiches and ate them standing in the kitchen leaning over the sink so that the crumbs wouldnt fall to the floor he felt strong again clean and fed he was outwitting the police making fools of them and that delighted him he was frightening the woman bringing terror into every day of her life that excited him when the time was right he would do everything hed told her he would do and still it wouldnt be enough he went into the bedroom shut the door pulled the shades and picked up the phone deborah strolled out of her room in a white teddy a thin blue robe that reached to midthigh flapping open her toenails were shocking pink shed painted them the night before to amuse herself as shed crammed for an exam she was muttering the questions she thought would be on the exam she had scheduled at nine the questions came easily enough but the answers continued to bog down at some crossroads between the conscious and the unconscious she hoped to unblock the answers with a quick shot of coffee yawning she stumbled over a boot pitched toward the couch then let out a muffled scream as her hand encountered warm flesh boyd sat up like a shot his hand already reaching for his weapon with their faces close he stared at deborah the creamy skin the big blue eyes the tumble of dark hair and relaxed good morning i detective fletcher he rubbed a hand over his eyes i think so im sorry i didnt realize you were here she cleared her throat and belatedly remembered to close her robe still fumbling she glanced up the stairs and automatically lowered her voice her sister wasnt a sound sleeper under the best of circumstances why are you here he flexed a shoulder that had stiffened during his cramped night on the couch i told you i was going to look after cilia yes you did her eyes narrowed as she studied him you take your job seriously thats right good satisfied she smiled in the upheaval and confusion of her nineteen years she had learned to make character judgments quickly i was about to make some coffee i have an early class can i get you some if she was anything like her sister he wouldnt get any more sleep until hed answered whatever questions were rolling around in her head sure thanks i imagine youd like a hot shower as well youre about six inches too long to have spent a comfortable night on that couch eight he said rubbing the back of his stiff neck i think its more like eight youre welcome to all the hot water you want ill start on the coffee as she turned toward the kitchen the phone rang though she knew cilia would pick it up before the second ring she stepped toward it automatically boyd shook his head reaching over he lifted the receiver and listened with her hands clutching the lapels of her robe deborah watched him his face remained impassive but she saw a flicker of anger in his eyes though brief it was intense enough to make her certain who was on the other end of the line boyd disconnected mechanically then punched in a series of numbers anything he didnt even bother to swear at the negative reply right after hanging up he looked at deborah she was standing beside the couch her hands clenched her face pale im going upstairs he said ill take a rain check on that coffee shell be upset i want to talk to her he pushed aside the blanket and rose wearing only his jeans id appreciate it if youd let me handle it this time she wanted to argue but something in his eyes stopped her she nodded all right but do a good job of it she isnt as tough as she likes people to think i know he climbed the stairs to the second floor walked past an open door to a room where the bed was tidily made deborahs he decided noting the roseandwhite decor and the feminine bits of lace pausing at the next door he knocked then entered without waiting for an answer she was sitting in the middle of the bed her knees drawn up close to her chest and her head resting on them the sheets and blankets were tangled a testimony to the few hours of restless sleep shed had there were no bits of feminine lace here no soft creamy colors she preferred clean lines rather than curves simplicity rather than flounces in contrast the color scheme was electric and anything but restful in the midst of the vibrant blues and greens she seemed all the more vulnerable she didnt look up until he sat on the edge of the bed and touched her hair slowly she lifted her head he saw that there were no tears rather than the fear hed expected there was an unbearable weariness that was even more disturbing he called she said i know i was on the extension then you heard she looked away toward the window where she could see the sun struggling to burn away a low bank of clouds it was him outside last night he said hed seen me seen us he made it sound revolting cilia he was watching she spit out the words nothing i say nothing i do is going to make him stop and if he gets to me hes going to do everything he said hed do hes not going to get to you how long she demanded her fingers clenched and unclenched on the sheets as her eyes burned into his how long can you watch me hell just wait hell wait and keep calling keep watching something snapped inside her and she picked up the bedside phone and heaved it across the room it bounced against the wall jangling as it thudded to the floor youre not going to stop him you heard him he said nothing would stop him this is just what he wants boyd took her by the arms and gave her one quick shake he wants you to fall apart he wants to know hes made you fall apart if you do youre only helping him i dont know what to do she managed i just dont know what to do youve got to trust me look at me cilia her breath was hitching but she met his eyes i want you to trust me he said quietly and believe me when i say i wont let anything happen to you you cant always be there his lips curved a little he gentled his hold to rub his hands up and down her arms sure i can i want she squeezed her eyes shut how she hated to ask hated to need what her lips trembled as she fought for one last handhold on control i need to hold on to something she let out an unsteady breath please he said nothing but he gathered her close to cradle her head on his shoulder her hands balled into fists pressed against his back she was trembling fighting off a wild bout of tears take five oroarke he murmured let loose i cant she kept her eyes closed and held on he was solid warm strong dependable im afraid once i do i wont be able to stop okay lets try this he tilted her head up and touched his lips gently to hers think about me right here his mouth brushed hers again right now easy patient he stroked her rigid back just me here was compassion she hadnt known a kiss from a man could hold it more than gentle more than tender it soothed frayed nerves calmed icy fears cooled hot despair her clenched hands relaxed muscle by muscle there was no demand here as his lips roamed over her face just understanding it became so simple to do as hed asked she thought only of him hesitant she brought a hand to his face letting her fingers skim along his beardroughened cheek her stomach unknotted the throbbing in her head quieted she said his name on a sigh and melted against him he had to be careful very careful her complete and total surrender had his own needs drumming he ignored them for now she needed comfort not passion it couldnt matter that his senses were reeling from her the soft give of her body the rich taste of her mouth it couldnt matter that the air had thickened so that each breath he took was crowded with the scent of her he knew he had only to lay her back on the bed among the tangled sheets and cover her she wouldnt resist perhaps she would even welcome the heat and the distraction the temporary respite he intended to be much more to her battling his own demons he pressed his lips to her forehead then rested his cheek on her hair better on one ragged breath she nodded she wasnt sure she could speak how could she tell him that she wanted only to stay like this her arms around him his heart beating against hers hed think she was a fool i uh didnt know you could be such a nice guy fletcher he wanted to sigh but he found himself grinning i have my moments yeah well that was certainly above and beyond maybe just maybe she wasnt really trying to needle him he pulled back put a hand under her chin and held it steady im not on duty when i kiss you its got nothing to do with my job got it shed meant to thank him not annoy him there was a warning in his eyes that had her frowning sure sure he repeated then rose to jam his hands in his pockets in disgust for the first time she noted that he wore only his jeans unsnapped and riding low the sudden clutching in her stomach had nothing to do with fear and left her momentarily speechless she wanted him not just to hold not just for a few heated kisses and certainly not just for comfort she wanted him in bed the way she couldnt remember ever wanting a man before she could look at him the long lean golden line of torso the narrow hips the dance of muscle in his arms as he balled his hands and she could imagine what it would be like to touch and be touched to roll over the bed in one tangled heap of passion to ride and be ridden what the hells wrong with you now what eyes narrowed he rocked back on his heels as she blinked at him taking a side trip oroarke i ah her mouth was dry and there was a hard knot of pressure in her gut what would he say if she told him where her mind had just taken her taken them she let her eyes close oh boy she whispered i think i need some coffee and a quick dip in a cold lake your sister was fixing some he frowned as he studied her he thought of deborah for a moment of how she had nearly fallen on top of him wearing hardly more than a swatch of white lace hed appreciated the long lissome limbs what man wouldnt but looking at her hadnt rocked his system and here was cilia sitting there with her eyes shadowed wearing a broncos football jersey that was two sizes too big the bright orange cotton was hardly seductive lingerie if he stood there one more moment he would be on his knees begging for mercy how about breakfast his voice was abrupt not even marginally friendly it helped to bring her thoughts to order i never eat it today you do ten minutes look slick do something with your hair he said as he walked out of the room you look like hell he found deborah downstairs in the kitchen fully dressed sipping a cup of coffee that she was waiting for him was obvious the moment he stepped into the room she was out of her chair shes fine he said briefly im going to fix her some breakfast though her brow lifted at this information she nodded look why dont you sit down ill fix some for both of you i thought you had an early class ill skip it he headed for the coffee then shell be mad at both of us she had to smile as he poured a cup then rooted through a drawer for a spoon for the sugar you already know her very well not well enough he drank half the cup and felt nearly human again he had to think of cilia it would be safe enough he hoped if he kept those thoughts professional how much time do you have about five minutes she said as she glanced at her watch tell me about the exhusband paul there was surprise in her eyes in her voice why she was shaking her head before he could answer you dont think he has anything to do with whats going on here im checking all the angles the divorce was it amicable are they ever she was young boyd thought nodding but she was sharp you tell me well in this case id say it was as amicable or as bland as they get she hesitated torn if it was a question of being loyal to cilia or protecting her she had to choose protection i was only about twelve and cilia was never very open about it but my impression was always has been that he wanted it boyd leaned back against the counter why uncomfortable deborah moved her shoulders hed fallen in love with someone else she let out a hiss of breath and prayed cilia wouldnt see what she was doing as a betrayal it was pretty clear that they were having problems before i came to live with them it was right after our parents had died cilia had only been married a few months but well lets say the honeymoon was over she was making a name for herself in atlanta and paul he was very conservative a real straight arrow hed decided to run for assemblyman i think it was and cilias image didnt suit sounds like it was the other way around to me she smiled then beautifully and moved over to top off his coffee i remember how hard she was working to hold her job together to hold everything together it was a pretty awful time for us it didnt help matters when the responsibility for a twelveyearold was suddenly dumped on them the added strain well i guess you could say it hastened the inevitable a couple of months after i moved in he moved out and filed for divorce she didnt fight it he tried to imagine how it would have been at twenty shed lost her parents accepted the care and responsibility of a young girl and watched her marriage crumble sounds to me like she was well rid of him i guess it doesnt hurt to say i never liked him very much he was inoffensive and dull why did she marry him i think it would be more appropriate to ask me cilia said from the doorway chapter contents prev next the something she had done with her hair was to pull it back in a ponytail it left her face unframed so the anger in her eyes was that much easier to read along with the jersey shed slept in shed pulled on a pair of yellow sweatpants it was a deceptively sunny combination her hands were thrust into their deep pockets as she stood directing all her resentment at boyd cilia knowing there was a time to argue and a time to soothe deborah stepped forward we were just yes i heard what you were just she shifted her gaze to deborah the edge of her temper softened dont worry about it its not your fault its not a matter of fault deborah murmured we care what happens to you nothings going to happen youd better get going deb or youll be late and it appears that detective fletcher and i have things to discuss deborah lifted her hands and let them fall she shot one sympathetic glance toward boyd then kissed her sisters cheek all right youd never listen to reason at this hour anyway get an a was all cilia said i intend to im going to catch a burger and a movie with josh but ill be back before you get home have a good time cilia waited not moving an inch until she heard the front door close youve got a hell of a nerve fletcher he merely turned and slipped another mug off the hook behind the stove want some coffee i dont appreciate you grilling my sister he filled the mug then set it aside i left my rubber hose in my other suit lets get something straight she walked toward him deliberately keeping her hands in her pockets she was dead sure shed hit him if she took them out if you have any questions about me you come to me deborah is not involved in any of this shes a lot more forthcoming than her sister got any eggs he asked as he opened the refrigerator she managed to restrain the urge to kick the door into his head you know for a minute upstairs you had me fooled i actually thought you had some heart some compassion he found a halfdozen eggs some cheese and a few miserly strips of bacon why dont you sit down oroarke and drink your coffee she swore at him viciously something shot into his eyes something dangerous but he picked up a skillet and calmly began to fry the bacon youll have to do better than that he said after a moment after ten years on the force theres not much you could call me and get a rise you had no right her voice had quieted but the emotion in it had doubled no right to dredge all that up with her she was a child devastated scared to death that entire year was nothing but hell for her and she doesnt need you to make her remember it she handled herself just fine he broke an egg into a bowl then crushed the shell in his hand it seems to me youre the one with the problem just back off he had her arm in a tight grip so quickly that she had no chance to evade his voice was soft deadly with temper licking around the edges not a chance what happened back then has nothing to do with whats happening now and whats happening now is the only thing that concerns you its my job to determine what applies with an effort he reeled himself in he couldnt remember when anyone had pushed him so close to the edge so often if you want me to put it to rest then spell it out for me exspouses are favored suspects it was eight years ago she jerked away and needing something to do with her hands snatched up her coffee it splattered over the rim and onto the counter i find out from you or i find out from someone else the end results the same you want me to spell it out you want me to strip bare fine it hardly matters at this point i was twenty i was stupid he was beautiful and charming and smart all the things stupid twentyyearold girls think they want she took a long sip of hot coffee then automatically reached for a washcloth to mop up the spill we only knew each other a couple of months he was very persuasive very romantic i married him because i wanted something stable and real in my life and i thought he loved me she was calmer now she hadnt realized that the anger had drained away sighing she turned mechanically reaching for plates and flatware it didnt work almost from day one he was disappointed in me physically and disillusioned when he saw that i believed my work was as important as his hed hoped to convince me to change jobs not that he wanted me to quit altogether he wasnt against my having a career even in radio as long as it didnt interfere with his plans which were boyd asked as he set the bacon aside to drain politics actually we met at a charity event the station put on he was trying to charm up votes i was promoting that was the basic problem she murmured we met each others public personalities what happened we got married too fast and things went wrong too fast i was even considering his idea that i go into marketing or sales i figured i should at least give it a shot then my parents i lost my parents and brought deborah home she stopped speaking for a moment she couldnt talk of that time couldnt even think of the fears and the griefs the pain and the resentments it must have been rough she shrugged the words away the bottom line was i couldnt handle another upheaval i needed to work the strain ate away at what shaky foundation we had he found someone who made him happier and he left me she filled her mug with coffee she no longer wanted end of story what was he supposed to say boyd wondered tough break kid we all make mistakes you were better off without the jerk no personal comments he warned himself they were both edgy enough did he ever threaten you no abuse you she gave a tired laugh no no youre trying to make him into the bad guy boyd and it wont play we were simply two people who made a mistake because we got married before we knew what we wanted thoughtful boyd scooped eggs onto her plate sometimes people hold resentments without even being aware of it then one day they bust loose he didnt resent me sitting she picked up a piece of bacon she studied it as she broke it in two he never cared enough for that thats the sad sad truth she smiled but there wasnt a trace of humor in her eyes you see he thought i was like the woman he heard on the radio seductive sophisticated sexy he wanted that kind of woman in bed and outside the bedroom he wanted a wellgroomed wellmannered attentive woman to make his home i was neither she shrugged and dropped the bacon on her plate again since he wasnt the attentive reliable and understanding man i thought he was we both lost out we had a very quiet very civilized divorce shook hands and went our separate ways if there was nothing more to it why are you still raw she looked up then eyes somber youve never been married have you no then i couldnt begin to explain if you want to run a check on paul you go ahead but its a waste of time i can guarantee he hasnt given me a thought since i left atlanta he doubted that any man who had ever been close to her would be able to push her completely out of his mind but he would let that ride for the moment youre letting your eggs get cold i told you i dont eat breakfast humor me he reached over scooped up a forkful of eggs from her plate and held them to her lips youre a pest she said after she swallowed them dont you have to check in or something i already did last night after you went up to bed she toyed with the food on her plate eating a bite or two to keep him from nagging her he had stayed she reminded herself long after his duty shift was over she owed him for that and she always paid her debts look i appreciate you hanging around and i know its your job to ask all kinds of personal and embarrassing questions but i really want you to leave deb out of it as much as i can spring breaks coming up im going to try to convince her to head for the beach good luck he sipped watching her over the rim of his mug you might pull it off if you went with her im not running from this after pushing her halfeaten breakfast aside she rested her elbows on the table after the call this morning i was pretty close to doing just that i thought about it and after i did i realized its not going to stop until i figure it out i want my life back and thats not going to happen until we know who he is and why hes after me its my job to find him i know thats why ive decided to cooperate he set his mug aside have you thats right from now on my lifes an open book you ask ill answer and youll do exactly what youre told no she smiled but ill do exactly what im told if it seems reasonable she surprised them both by reaching over to touch his hand you look tired slick rough night ive had better he linked his fingers with hers before she could withdraw them you look damn good in the morning cilia there it was again that fluttering that started in her chest and drifted down to her stomach a little while ago you said i looked like hell i changed my mind before i clock in id like to talk to you about last night about you and me thats not a good idea no its not but he didnt release her hand im a cop and youre my assignment theres no getting around that she nearly managed a relieved breath before he continued any more than theres any getting around the fact that i want you so much it hurts she went very still so still she could hear the sound of her own heartbeat drumming in her head very slowly she moved her eyes only her eyes until they met his they were not so calm now she thought there was a fire there barely banked it was exciting terrifyingly exciting lousy timing he continued when she didnt speak but i figure you cant always pick the right time and the right place im going to do my job but i think you should know im having trouble being objective if you want someone else assigned to you youd better say so now no she answered too quickly and she forced herself to backtrack i dont think im up to breaking in a new cop keep it light she warned herself im not crazy about having one at all but im almost used to you she caught herself gnawing on her thumbnail and hastily dropped her hand into her lap as for the rest were not children we can handle it he knew he shouldnt expect her to admit the wanting wasnt all onesided so he would wait a little while longer when he rose she sprang up so quickly that he laughed im going to do the dishes oroarke not jump on you ill do them she could have kicked herself one cooks one cleans oroarke rules fine youve got a remote at noon right how did you know i checked your schedule leave enough time for us to drop by my place so i can shower and change im going to be in a mall with dozens of people she began i dont think i do with that he left her alone boyd was lounging on the couch with the paper and a last cup of coffee when cilia came downstairs he glanced over and the casual comment hed been about to make about her being quick to change died before it reached his tongue he was glad he was sitting down she wore red vivid trafficstopping red the short leather skirt was snug at the hips and stopped at midthigh the jeans she usually wore hadnt given him a true measure of how long her legs were or how shapely the matching jacket crossed over her body to side snaps at the waist it made him wonder what she was wearing beneath it shed done something to her hair it was still tumbled but more artfully and certainly more alluringly and her face he noted as he finally stood shed fiddled with that as well enough to highlight her cheekbones accent her eyes slicken her lips stupid she muttered as she struggled with an earring i can never figure but why hanging things from your ears is supposed to be attractive on a sigh she stared down at the dangling columns and the little gold back in her palm either these are defective or i am are you any good at this shed walked to him her hand held out her scent was wheeling in his head at what putting these in i dont wear them for weeks at a time so ive never really gotten the hang of it give me a hand will you he was concentrating on breathing nice slow even breaths you want me to put that on for you she rolled her eyes impatiently you catch on fast slick she thrust the earring into his hand then tucked the hair behind her right ear you just slide the post through then fasten the little doodad on the back thats the part i have trouble with he muttered something then bent to the task there was a pressure in his chest and it was building he knew he would never get that scent out of his system swearing softly he struggled to pinch the tiny fastening with his fingertips this is a stupid system yeah she could barely speak shed known the minute he touched her that shed made an enormous mistake bursts of sensations flashes of images were rushing into her all she could do was stand still and pray hed hurry up and finish the back of his thumb brushed up and down over her jaw his fingertips grazed the sensitive area behind her ear his breath fluttered warm against her skin until she had to bite back a moan she lifted an unsteady hand listen why dont we just forget it ive got it letting out a long breath he stepped back an inch he was a wreck but some of the tension eased when he looked at her and saw that she was far from unaffected he managed to smile then and flicked a finger over the swaying gold columns well have to try that again when weve got more time since no response she could think of seemed safe she gave none instead she retrieved his coat and her own from the closet she set his aside and waited while he slipped into his shoulder holster watching him give his weapon a quick routine check brought back memories she wanted to avoid so she looked away pulling open the door she stepped into the sunlight and left him to follow when he was ready he made no comment when he joined her do you mind if i tune the station in she asked as they settled into his car its on memory number three pleased she turned it on the morning team was chattering away punctuating their jokes with sound effects they plugged an upcoming concert promised to give another pair of tickets away during the next hour then invited the listening audience to the mall to see cilia oroarke live and in person shell be giving away albums tshirts and concert tickets frantic fred announced come on fred his partner broke in you know those guys out there dont care about a couple of tshirts they want to he made loud panting noises see cilia there was a chorus of wolf whistles growls and groans cute boyd muttered but cilia only chuckled theyre supposed to be obnoxious she pointed out people like absurdity in the morning when theyre dragging themselves out of bed or fighting traffic last quarters arbitron ratings showed them taking over twentyfour percent of the target audience i guess you get a kick out of hearing some guy pant over you hey i live for it too amused to be offended she settled back he certainly had a nice car for a cop some sporty foreign job that still smelled new she was never any good with makes and models come on slick its part of the act he caught himself before he could speak again he was making a fool of himself his own investigation had verified that both morning men were married with tidy homes in the suburbs frantic fred and his wife were expecting their first child both men had been with khip for nearly three years and hed found no crossreference between their pasts and cilias relaxing as the music began cilia gazed out the window the day promised to be warm and sunny perhaps this would be the first hint of spring and her first spring in colorado she had a weakness for the season for watching the leaves bud and grow the flowers bloom yet in spring she would always think of georgia the magnolias the camellias the wisterias all those heady scents she remembered a spring when shed been five or six planting peonies with her father on a warm saturday morning while the radio counted down the top hits of the week hearing the birds without really listening feeling the damp earth under her hands hed told her they would bloom spring after spring and that she would be able to see them from her window she wondered if they were still there if whoever lived in that house cared for them cilia she snapped back what are you all right sure im fine she focused on her surroundings there were big trees that would shade in the summer trimmed hedges for privacy a long gently sloping hill led to a graceful threestory house fashioned from stone and wood dozens of tall slender windows winked in the sunlight where are we my house ive got to change remember your house she repeated right everyone has to live somewhere true enough she thought as she pushed the door open but none of the cops she had ever known had lived so well a long look around showed her that the neighborhood was old established and wealthy a countryclub neighborhood disconcerted she followed boyd up a stone path to an arched door outlined in etched glass inside the foyer was wide the floors a gleaming cherry the ceilings vaulted on the walls were paintings by prominent twentiethcentury artists a sweep of stairway curved up to the second floor well she said and i thought you were an honest cop i am he slipped the coat from her shoulders to toss it over the railing she had no doubts as to his honesty but the house and all it represented made her nervous and i suppose you inherited all this from a rich uncle grandmother taking her arm he led her through a towering arch the living room was dominated by a stone fireplace topped with a heavy carved mantel but the theme of the room was light with a trio of windows set in each outside wall there was a scattering of antiques offset by modern sculpture she could see what she thought was a dining room through another arch that must have been some grandmother she was something she ran fletcher industries until she hit seventy and what is fletcher industries he shrugged family business real estate cattle mining mining she blew out a breath like gold among other things she linked her fingers together to keep from biting her nails so why arent you counting your gold instead of being a cop i like being a cop he took her restless hand in his something wrong no youd better change i have to be there early to prep i wont be long she waited until he had gone before she sank onto one of the twin sofas fletcher industries she thought it sounded important even prominent after digging in her bag for a cigarette she studied the room again elegant tasteful easily rich and way out of her league it had been difficult enough when shed believed they were on fairly equal terms she didnt like to admit it but the thought had been there in the back of her mind that maybe just maybe there could be a relationship between them no a friendship she could never be seriously involved with someone in law enforcement but he wasnt just a cop now he was a rich cop his name was probably listed on some social register people who lived in houses like this usually had roman numerals after their names boyd fletcher iii she was just priscilla alice oroarke formerly from a backwater town in georgia that wasnt even a smudge on the map true she had made something of herself by herself but you never really pulled out your roots rising she walked over to toss her cigarette in the fireplace she wished he would hurry she wanted to get out of this house get back to work she wanted to forget about the mess her life was suddenly in she had to think about herself where she was going how she was going to get through the long days and longer nights until her life was settled again she didnt have the time she couldnt afford the luxury of exploring her feelings for boyd whatever she had felt or thought she was feeling was best ignored if ever there were two people more mismatched she couldnt imagine them perhaps he had stirred something in her touched something shed thought could never be touched again it meant nothing it only proved that she was alive still functioning as a human being as a woman it would begin and end there the minute whoever was threatening her was caught they would go their separate ways back to their separate lives whatever closeness they had now was born of necessity when the necessity passed they would move apart and forget nothing she reminded herself lasted forever she was standing by the windows when he came back the light was in her hair on her face he had never imagined her there but somehow when he looked when he saw her he knew hed wanted her there it left him shaken it left him aching to see how perfectly she fit into his home into his life into his dreams she would argue about that he thought she would struggle and fight and run like hell if he gave her the chance he smiled as he crossed to her he just wouldnt give her the chance cilia startled she whirled around oh i didnt hear you i was the words were swallowed by a gasp as he yanked her against him and imprisoned her mouth earthquakes floods wild winds how could she have known that a kiss could be grouped with such devastating natural disasters she didnt want this she wanted it more than she wanted to breathe she had to push him away she pulled him closer it was wrong it was madness it was right it was beautifully mad as she pressed against him as her mouth answered each frenzied demand she knew that everything she had tried to convince herself of only moments before was a lie what need was there to explore her feelings when they were all swimming to the surface she needed him however much that might terrify her for now the knowledge and the acceptance flowed through her like wine it seemed she had waited a lifetime to need like this to feel like this trembling and strong dazed and cleareyed pliant and taut as a wire his hands whispered over the leather as he molded her against him couldnt she see how perfectly they fitted he wanted to hear her say it to hear her moan it that she wanted him as desperately as he wanted her she did moan as he drew her head back to let his lips race down her throat the thudding of her pulse heated the fragrance shed dabbed there groaning as it tangled in his senses he dragged at the snaps of her jacket beneath he found nothing but cilia she arched back her breath catching in her throat as he captured her breasts at his touch it seemed they filled with some hot heavy liquid when her knees buckled she gripped his shoulders for balance shuddering as his thumbs teased her nipples into hard aching peaks mindlessly she reached for him diving into a deep intimate kiss that had each of them swaying she tugged at his jacket desperate to touch him as he touched her her hand slid over the leather of his holster and found his weapon it was like a slap like a splash of ice water as if burned she snatched her hand away and jerked back unsteady she pressed the palm of her hand against a table and shook her head this is a mistake she paced her words slowly as if she were drunk i dont want to get involved too late he felt as if hed slammed full tilt into a wall no with deliberate care she snapped her jacket again its not too late i have a lot on my mind so do you he struggled for the patience that had always been part of his nature for the first time in days he actively craved a cigarette and and nothing i think we should go he didnt move toward her or away but simply held up a hand before we do are you going to tell me you dont feel anything she made herself look at him it would be stupid to pretend im not attracted to you you already know you affect me i want to bring you back here tonight she shook her head she couldnt afford even for an instant to imagine what it would be like to be with him i cant there are reasons youve already told me there isnt anyone else he stepped toward her now but he didnt touch her if there was i wouldnt give a damn this has nothing to do with other men it has to do with me exactly why dont you tell me what youre afraid of im afraid of picking up the phone it was true but it wasnt the reason im afraid of going to sleep and im afraid of waking up he touched her then just a fingertip to her cheek i know what youre going through and believe me id do anything to make it go away but we both know thats not the reason youre backing away from me i have others give me one annoyed she walked over to grab her purse youre a cop and she tossed her head up so was my mother before he could speak she was striding back into the foyer to get her coat cilia just back off boyd i mean it she shoved her arms into her coat i cant afford to get churned up like this before a show for gods sake my lifes screwed up enough right now without this if you cant let it alone ill call your captain and tell him i want someone else assigned now you can take me to the mall or i can call a cab one more push and shed be over the edge he thought this wasnt the time for her to take that tumble ill take you he said and ill back off for now chapter contents prev next he was a man of his word cilia decided for the rest of that day and all of the next they discussed nothing that didnt relate directly to the case he wasnt distant far from it he stuck with her throughout her remote at the mall subtly screening all the fans who approached her for a word or an autograph all the winners who accepted their tshirts or their albums it even seemed to cilia that he enjoyed himself he browsed through the record racks buying from the classical pop and jazz sections chatted with the engineer about baseball and kept her supplied with a steady supply of cold soft drinks in paper cups he talked but she noted that he didnt talk to her not the way shed become accustomed to they certainly had conversations polite and impersonal conversations and not once not even in the most casual of ways did he touch her in short he treated her exactly the way shed thought she wanted to be treated as an assignment and nothing more while he seemed to take the afternoon in stride even offering to buy her a burger between the end of the remote and the time she was expected back in the studio she was certain shed never spent a more miserable afternoon in her life it was althea who sat with her in the booth over her next two shifts and it was althea who monitored the calls why boyds silence and his absence made it that much more difficult for her to concentrate cilia couldnt have said it was probably some new strategy she decided as she worked he was ignoring her so that she would break down and make the first move well she wouldnt she hit her audience with bob segers latest gritty rock single and stewed shed wanted their relationship to be strictly professional and he was accommodating her but he didnt have to make it seem so damned easy undoubtedly what had happened between them or what had almost happened between them hadnt really meant that much to him that was all for the best she would get over it whatever it was the last thing she needed in her life was a cop with a lazy smile who came from a moneyed background she wished to god she could go five minutes without thinking about him while cilia juggled turntables althea worked a crossword puzzle she had always been able to sit for hours at a time in contented silence as long as she could exercise her mind cilia oroarke she mused was a different matter the woman hadnt mastered the fine art of relaxation althea filled the squares with her neat precise printing and thought that boyd was just the man to teach her how it was done right now cilia was bursting to talk not to ask questions althea thought she hadnt missed the quick disappointment on cilias face when boyd hadnt been the one to drive her to the station for her night shift shes dying to ask me where he is and what hes doing althea thought as she filled in the next word but she doesnt want me to think it matters it wasnt possible for her not to smile to herself boyd had been pretty closemouthed himself lately althea knew he had run a more detailed check on cilias background and that he had found answers that disturbed him personally she thought whatever he had discovered had nothing to do with the case or he would have shared it with his partner but no matter how close they were their privacy was deeply respected she didnt question him if and when he wanted to talk it through she would be there for him as he would be there for her it was too bad she decided that when sexual tension reared its head men and women lost that easy camaraderie abruptly cilia pushed away from the console im going to get some coffee do you want some doesnt nick usually bring some in hes got the night off why dont i get it no restlessness seemed to vibrate from her ive got nearly seven minutes before the tape ends i want to stretch my legs all right cilia walked to the lounge billy had already been there she noted the floor gleamed and the coffee mugs were washed and stacked there was the lingering scent of the pine cleaner he always used so lavishly she poured two cups and as an afterthought stuck one leftover and rapidly hardening pastry in her pocket with a cup in each hand she turned in the doorway she saw the shadow of a man and the silver gleam of a knife with a scream she sent the mugs flying crockery smashed and shattered miss oroarke billy took a hesitant step into the light oh god she pressed the heel of one hand to her chest as if to force out the air trapped there billy i thought you were gone i he stumbled back against the door when althea came flying down the hallway her weapon drawn in an automatic response he threw his hands up dont shoot dont i didnt do nothing its my fault cilia said quickly she stepped over to put a reassuring hand on billys arm i didnt know anyone was here and i turned around she covered her face with her hands im sorry she managed dropping them again i overreacted i didnt know billy was still in the station mr harrison had a lunch meeting in his office he spoke quickly his eyes darting from althea to cilia i was just getting to it he swallowed audibly lots of lots of knives and forks left over cilia stared at the handful of flatware he held and felt like a fool im sorry billy i must have scared you to death and ive made a mess of your floor thats okay he grinned at her relaxing slowly as althea holstered her weapon ill clean it right up good show tonight miss oroarke he tapped the headphones that hed slid around his neck you going to play any fifties stuff you know i like that the best sure fighting nausea she made herself smile ill pick something out just for you he beamed at her youll say my name on the air you bet ive got to get back she hurried back to the booth grateful that althea was giving her a few moments alone things were getting pretty bad when she started jumping at middleaged maintenance men holding dinner knives the best way to get through the nerves was to work she told herself keeping her moves precise she began to set up for what she called the power hour between eleven and midnight when althea came back bearing coffee cilia was inviting her audience to stay tuned for more music weve got ten hits in a row coming up this first ones for my pal billy were going back way back all the way back to it aint dennis quaid its the real the original the awesome jerry lee lewis with great balls of fire after pulling off her headphones she gave althea a wan smile i really am sorry in your place i probably would have gone through the roof althea offered her a fresh mug been a lousy couple of weeks huh the lousiest were going to get him cilia im hanging on to that she chose another record took her time cuing it up what made you become a cop i guess i wanted to be good at something this was it do you have a husband no althea wasnt sure where the questions were leading a lot of men are put off when a woman carries a gun she hesitated then decided to take the plunge you might have gotten the impression that theres something between boyd and me its hard not to cilia lifted a hand for silence then opened the mike to link the next song you two seem well suited as if considering it althea sat and sipped at her coffee you know i wouldnt have figured you for the type to fall into the clichéd sexist mindset that says that if a man and woman work together they must be playing together i didnt outraged cilia all but came out of her chair at altheas bland smile she subsided i did she admitted then her lips curved kind of i guess youve had to handle that tired line quite a bit no more than you i imagine she gestured both hands palms out at the confines of the studio an attractive woman in what some conceive of as a mans job even that small patch of common ground helped her to relax there was a jock in richmond who figured i was dying to ah spin on his turntable understanding and amusement brightened altheas eyes howd you handle it during my show i announced that he was hard up for dates and anyone interested should call the station during his shift she grinned remembering it cooled him off she turned to her mike to plug the upcoming request line after an update on the weather a time check and an intro for the next record she slipped her headphones off again i guess boyd wouldnt be as easily discouraged not on your life hes stubborn he likes to call it patience but its plain muleheaded stubbornness he can be like a damn bulldog ive noticed hes a nice man cilia one of the best if youre really not interested you should make it clear up front boyds stubborn but hes not obnoxious i dont want to be interested cilia murmured theres a difference like night and day listen if the questions too personal tell me to shut up a smile tugged at cilias mouth you dont have to tell me that twice okay why dont you want to be interested cilia chose a compact disc then backed it up with two s hes a cop so if he was an insurance salesman youd want to be interested yes no she let out a huff of breath sometimes it was best to be honest it would be easier then theres the fact that i made a mess of the one serious relationship ive had all by yourself mostly she sent out the cut from the cd im more comfortable concentrating on my life and deborahs my work and her future youre not the type that would be happy for long with comfortable maybe not she stared down at the phone but id settle for it right now so she was running scared althea thought as she watched cilia work who wouldnt be it had to be terrifying to be hounded and threatened by some faceless nameless man yet she was handling it althea thought better than she was handling boyd and her feelings about him she had them buckets of them apparently she just didnt know what to do with them althea kept her silence as the calls began to come in cilia was afraid of the phone afraid of what might be on the other end but she answered call after call moving through them with what sounded like effortless style if althea hadnt been in the studio watching the strain tighten cilias face she would have been totally fooled she gave them their music and a few moments of her time if her hand was unsteady her finger still pushed the illuminated button boyd had entered her life to protect it not threaten it yet she was afraid of him with a sigh althea wondered why it was that womens lives could be so completely turned upside down by the presence of a man if she ever fell in love herself which so far shed had the good sense to avoid she would simply find a way to call the shots the tone of cilias voice had her snapping back recognizing the fear sympathizing with it althea rose to massage her rigid shoulders keep him talking she whispered keep him on as long as you can cilia blocked out what he said shed found it helped her keep sane if she ignored the vicious threats the bloodchilling promises instead she kept her eye on the elapsedtime clock grimly pleased when she saw that the oneminute mark had passed and he was still on the line she questioned him forcing herself to keep her voice calm and even he liked it best when she lost control she knew he would keep threatening until she began to beg then he would cut her off satisfied that he had broken her again tonight she struggled not to hear just to watch the seconds tick away i havent hurt you she said you know i havent done anything to you to him he hissed the words hes dead and its because of you who did i hurt if youd tell me his name i i want you to remember i want you to say his name before i kill you she shut her eyes and tried to fill her head with sound as he described exactly how he intended to kill her he must have been very important to you you must have loved him he was everything to me all i had he was so young he had his whole life but you hurt him you betrayed him an eye for an eye your life for his soon very soon when he cut her off she turned quickly to send out the next record she would backsell it cilia told herself her voice would be strong again afterward ignoring the other blinking lights she pulled out a cigarette they got a trace althea replaced the receiver then moved over to put a hand on cilias shoulder they got a trace you did a hell of a job tonight cilia yeah she closed her eyes now all she had to do was get through the next hour and ten minutes will they catch him well know soon this is the first real break weve had just hang on to that she wanted to be relieved cilia leaned back as althea drove her home and wondered why she couldnt accept this step as a step forward they had traced the call didnt that mean they would know where he lived they would have a name and they would put a face a person together with that name she would go and see him she would make herself do that she would look at that face into those eyes and try to find a link between him and whatever she had done in the past to incite that kind of hate then she would try to live with it she spotted boyds car at the curb in front of her house he stood on the walk his coat unbuttoned though the calendar claimed it was spring the night was cold enough for her to see his breath but not his eyes cilia took a firm grip on the doorhandle pushed it open he waited as she moved up the walk toward him lets go inside i want to know she saw his eyes now and understood you didnt get him no he glanced toward his partner althea saw the frustration held under grim control what happened it was a phone booth a couple miles from the station no prints hed wiped it clean struggling to hold on for a few more minutes cilia nodded so were no closer yes we are he took her hand to warm it in his he made his first mistake hell make another weary she looked over her shoulder was it just her overworked nerves or was he out there somewhere in the shadows close enough to see near enough to hear come on let me take you inside youre cold im all right she couldnt let him come with her she needed to let go and for that she needed privacy i dont want to talk about any of this tonight i just want to go to bed althea thanks for the ride and everything else she walked quickly to the front door and let herself inside she just needs to work this out althea said placing a hand on his arm he wanted to swear to smash something with his hands instead he stared at the closed door she doesnt want to let me help her no she doesnt she watched the light switch on upstairs want me to call for a uniform to stake out the house no ill hang around youre off duty fletcher right we can consider this personal want some company he shook his head no you need some sleep althea hesitated then let out a quiet sigh you take the first shift i sleep better in a car than a bed anyway there was a light frost that glittered like glass on the lawn cilia sighed as she studied it through her bedroom window in georgia the azaleas would be blooming it had been years more years than she could remember since she had yearned for home in that chill colorado morning she wondered if she had made a mistake traveling more than halfway across the country and leaving all those places all those memories of her childhood behind letting the curtain fall again she stepped back she had more to think about than an april frost she had also seen boyds car still parked at the curb thinking of him she took more time and more care dressing than was her habit not for a moment had she changed her mind about it being unwise to become involved with him but it seemed it was a mistake shed already made the wisdom to face up to her mistakes was something shed learned very early she smoothed her plumcolored cashmere sweater over her hips it had been a christmas present from deborah and it was certainly more stylish with its high neck and its generous sleeves than most of the clothes cilia chose for herself she wore it over snug black leggings and on impulse struggled with a pair of starshaped earrings in glossy silver he was spread comfortably over her couch the newspaper open a mug of coffee steaming in his hand his shirt was carelessly unbuttoned to the middle of his chest and wrinkled from being worn all night his jacket was tossed over the back of the couch but he still wore his shoulder holster she had never known anyone who could melt into his surroundings so easily at the moment he looked as though he spent every morning of his life in that spot in her spot lazily perusing the sports page and drinking a second cup of coffee he looked up at her though he didnt smile his utter relaxation was soothing good morning good morning feeling awkward she crossed to him she wasnt certain whether she should begin with an apology or an explanation deborah let me in she nodded then immediately wished shed worn trousers with pockets there was nothing to do with her hands but link them together youve been here all night just part of the service you slept in your car he tilted his head her tone was very close to an accusation it wasnt the first time im sorry on a long shaky breath she sat on the coffee table across from him their knees bumped he found it a friendly gesture one of the friendliest shed made with him i should have let you inside i should have known you would stay i guess i was upset he passed her his coffee you were entitled cilia yeah she sipped wincing a bit at the added sugar i guess id talked myself into believing that you were going to catch him last night it even its weird but it even unnerved me a bit thinking about finally seeing him finally knowing the whole story then when we got here and you told me i couldnt talk about it i just couldnt its okay her laugh was only a little strained do you have to be so nice to me probably not reaching out he touched her cheek would you feel better if i yelled at you maybe unable to resist she lifted a hand to his i have an easier time fighting than i do being reasonable ive noticed have you ever considered taking a day just to relax not really how about today i was going to catch up with my paperwork and i have to call a plumber weve got a leak under the sink she let her hand fall to her knees where it moved restlessly its my turn to do the laundry tonight im spinning records at this class reunion downtown bill and jim are splitting my shift i heard these reunion things they can get pretty wild she was groping feeling more foolish by the minute hed taken the empty cup and set it aside and was now holding both of her hands lightly in his they can be a lot of fun though maybe youd like to come and hang around are you asking me to come and hang around like on a date ill be working she began then subsided she was getting in deep yes sort of okay can i sort of pick you up by seven she said i have to be there early enough to set up lets make it six then we can have some dinner first i deeper and deeper all right boyd i have to tell you something im listening i still dont want to get involved not seriously mmhmm youre completely wrong for me thats just one more thing we disagree on he held her still when she started to rise dont pace cilia just take a couple deep breaths i think its important we understand up front how far this can go and what limitations there are are we going to have a romance cilia or a business arrangement he smiled she frowned i dont think we should call it a romance why not because its because a romance has implications he struggled against another smile she wouldnt appreciate the fact that she amused him what kind of implications slowly watching her he brought her hand to his lips just his mouth brushed over her knuckles and then when her fingers went limp he turned her palm up to press a kiss to its center just he prompted implications boyd she shivered when his teeth grazed over her wrist is that all you wanted to tell me no can you stop that if i really put my mind to it she found that her own lips had curved well put your mind to it i cant think dangerous words but he stopped nibbling im trying to be serious so am i once again he stopped her from rising try that deep breath right she did then plunged on last night when i lay down in the dark i was afraid i kept hearing him hearing that voice everything hed said to me over and over i knew i couldnt think of it if i did id go crazy so i thought of you she paused waiting for the courage to go on and when i thought of you it blocked out everything else and i wasnt afraid his fingers tightened on hers her eyes were steady but he saw that her lips trembled once before she pressed them together she was waiting he knew to see what he would do what he would say she couldnt have known couldnt have had any idea that at that moment at that one instant of time he teetered off the edge hed been walking and tumbled into love with her and if he told her that he thought as he felt the shock of the emotions vibrate through him she would never believe it some women had to be shown convinced not merely told cilia was one of them slowly he rose drawing her up with him he gathered her close cradling her head on his shoulder wrapping his arms around her he could feel her shiver of relief as he kept the embrace quiet and undemanding it was just what she needed how was it he seemed always to know to be held only held without words without promises to feel the solid warmth of his body against her the firm grip of his hands the steady beat of his heart boyd yeah he turned his head just enough to kiss her hair maybe i dont mind you being nice to me after all well give it a trial run she thought she might as well go all the way with it and maybe ive missed having you around it was his turn to take a deep breath and steady himself listen he slid his hands up to her shoulders ive got some calls to make after why dont i take a look at that leak she smiled i can look at it slick what i want is to have it fixed he leaned forward and bit her lower lip just get me a wrench two hours later cilia had her monthly finances spread out over the secondhand oak desk in the den that doubled as her office there were two dollars and fiftythree cents lost somewhere in her checkbook an amount she was determined to find before she paid the neat stack of bills to her right her sense of order was something shed taught herself something shed clung to during the lean years the unhappy years the stormy years if amid any crisis she could maintain this small island of normalcy however bland she believed she would survive ah she found the error pounced on it making the correction she scrupulously ran her figures again satisfied she filed away her bank statement then began writing checks starting with the mortgage even that gave her an enormous sense of accomplishment it wasnt rent it was equity it was hers the house was the first thing she had ever owned other than the clothes on her back and the occasional secondhand car shed never been poor but she had learned growing up in a family where the income was a combination of a cops salary and the lean monthly earnings of a public defender to count pennies carefully shed grown up in a rented house and shed never known the luxury of riding in a new car college wouldnt have been impossible but because of the strain it would have added to her parents income at a time when their marriage was rocky cilia had decided to bypass her education in favor of a job she didnt regret it often she resented it only a little at odd times but her ability to subsidize deborahs partial scholarship made her look back to the time when she had made the decision it had been the right one now they were slowly creeping their way up the house wasnt simply an acquisition it was a statement family home roots every month when she paid the mortgage she was grateful shed been given the chance cilia what oh she spotted boyd in the doorway she started to speak again then focused he still had the wrench shed given him his hair was mussed and damp both his shirt and his slacks were streaked with wet hed rolled his sleeves up to the elbows water glistened on his forearms oh she said again and choked on a laugh i fixed it his eyes narrowed as he watched her struggle to maintain her dignity problem no no not a thing she cleared her throat so you fixed it thats what i said she had to bite down on her lip she recognized a frazzled male ego when she heard it thats what you said all right and since youve just saved me a bundle the least i can do is fix you lunch what do you think about peanut butter and jelly that it belongs in a plastic lunch box with spiderman on the outside well ive got to tell you slick its the best thing i cook forgetting the bills she rose its either that or a can of tuna fish she ran a fingertip down his shirt experimentally did you know youre all wet he held up one grimy hand thought about it then went with the impulse and rubbed it all over her face yeah she laughed surprising him seducing him hed heard that laugh before over the radio but not once since hed met her it was low and rich and arousing as black silk come on fletcher well throw that shirt in the wash while you eat your sandwich in a minute he kept his hand cupped on her chin pulling her to him with that subtle pressure alone when his mouth met hers her lips were still curved this time she didnt stiffen she didnt protest with a sigh of acceptance she opened for him allowing herself to absorb the taste of his mouth the alluring dance of his tongue over hers there was a warmth here that she had forgotten to hope for the warmth of being with someone who understood her and cared she realized as his fingers skimmed over her cheek cared despite her flaws i guess you were right she murmured damn right about what she took a chance an enormous one for her and brushed at the hair on his forehead it is too late cilia he brought his hands to her shoulders again battling back a clawing need a ragged desire come upstairs with me i want to be with you his words sent the passion leaping he could see the fire of it glow in her eyes before she closed them and shook her head give me some time im not playing games here boyd but the grounds pretty shaky and i need to think it through on a steadying breath she opened her eyes and nearly smiled youre absolutely everything i swore id never fall for he brought his hands down to hers and gripped talk to me not now but she laced her fingers with his it was a sign of union that was rare for her im not ready to dig it all up right now id just like to spend a few hours here like real people if the phone rings im not going to answer it if someone comes to the door im going to wait until they go away again all i want to do is fix you a sandwich and wash your shirt okay sure he pressed a kiss to her brow its the best offer ive had in years chapter contents prev next there was a wall of noise the backbeat the bass the wail of a guitar riff there were spinning lights undulating bodies the clamor of feet cilia set the tone with her midnight voice and stood back to enjoy the results the ballroom was alive with sound laughter music voices raised in spurts of conversation cilia had her finger on the controls she didnt know any of the faces but it was her party boyd sipped a club soda and politely avoided a nonetoosubtle invitation from a sixfoot blonde in a skimpy blue dress he didnt consider this a trial hed spent a large portion of his career watching people and hed never gotten bored with it it was a hell of a party and he wouldnt have minded a turn on the dance floor but he preferred keeping his eye on cilia there were worse ways to spend the evening she presided over a long table at the front of the ballroom her records stacked her amps turned up high she glittered her silversequined jacket and black stovepipe pants were a whole new look in tuxedos her hair was full and loose and when she turned her head the silver stars at her ears glistened shed already lured dozens of couples onto the dance floor and they were bopping and swaying elbow to elbow others crowded around the edges in groups or loitered at the banquet tables lingering over drinks and conversation the music was loud hot and fast hed already learned that was how she liked it best as far as he could tell the class of was having the time of their lives from all appearances cilia was too she was joking with a few members of the graduating class most of them male more than a few of them had imbibed freely at the cash bar but she was handling herself boyd noted smooth as silk he didnt particularly like it when a man with a linemans chest put a beefy arm around her and squeezed but cilia shook her head whatever brushoff she used she sent the guy off with a smile on his face theres more where that came from boys and girls lets take you back all the way back to prom night she cued up the eagles one of these nights then skimmed the crowd for boyd when she spotted him she smiled fully so that even with the room between them he could see her eyes glow he wondered if he could manage to get her to look at him like that when they didnt have five hundred people between them he had to grin when she put a hand to her throat and mimed desperate thirst lord he looked wonderful cilia thought as she watched him turn toward the bar strange she would have thought a smokegray jacket would look too conservative on a man for her tastes on him it worked so well she mused with a wry smile that half the female portion of the class of had their eye on him tough luck ladies she thought hes mine at least for tonight a little surprised by where her thoughts had landed she shook herself back and chose a slip from the pile of requests next to the turntable a nostalgic crowd she decided and plucked another fifteenyearold hit from her stack she liked working parties watching people dance and flirt and gossip the reunion committee had done a topnotch job on this one red and white streamers dripped from the ceiling competing with a hundred matching balloons the dance floor glittered from the light of a revolving mirror ball when the music or the mood called for it she could flick a switch on a strobe light and give them a touch of seventies psychedelia mixed with the scents of perfume and cologne was the fragrance of the fresh flowers that adorned each table this is for rick and sue those high school sweeties whove been married for twelve years and they said it was only puppy love were rockin all over the world nice touch boyd commented she twisted her head and smiled thanks he handed her a soft drink heaped with ice ive got a reunion coming up next year you booked ill check my schedule wow she watched as a couple cut loose a few feet away other couples spread out as they put the dirty in dirty dancing pretty impressive mmm do you dance not like that she let out a little breath i wish i did he took her hand before she could reach for another request slip why dont you play one for me sure name it when he poked through her discs she was too amused to be annoyed she could reorganize later after choosing one he handed it to her excellent taste she shifted her mike weve got ourself a wild group tonight yall having fun the roar of agreement rolled across the dance floor were going to be here until midnight pumping out the music for you weve got a request here for springsteen hungry heart fresh dancers streamed onto the floor couples twined around each other to sway cilia turned to speak to boyd and found herself molded against him want to dance he murmured they already were body fitted to body he took her on a long erotically slow circle im working take five he lowered his head to catch her chin between his teeth until i make love with you this is the next best thing she was going to object she was sure of it but she was moving with him her body finetuned to his in silent capitulation she slid her arms around his neck with their faces close he smiled slowly firmly he ran his hands over her hips up lazily up to the sides of her breasts then down again she felt as though shed been struck by lightning youve ah got some nice moves slick thanks when their lips were a whisper apart he shifted leaving hers hungry as he nuzzled into her neck you smell like sin cilia its just one of the things about you thats been driving me crazy for days she wanted him to kiss her craved it she moaned when his hands roamed into her hair drawing her head back her eyes closed in anticipation but he only brushed those tempting lips over her cheekbone breathless she clung to him trying to fight through the fog of pleasure there were hundreds of people around them all moving to the erotic beat of the music she was working she reminded herself she was had always been a sensible woman and tonight she had a job to do if you keep this up i wont be able to work the turntable he felt her heart hammering against his it wasnt enough to satisfy him but it was enough to give him hope then i guess well have to finish the dance later when he released her cilia turned quickly and chose a record at random a cheer went up as the beat pounded out she lifted the hair from the back of her neck to cool it the press of bodies or the press of one body had driven the temperature up shed never realized what a dangerous pastime dancing could be want another drink boyd asked when she drained her glass no im okay steadying herself she reached for the request sheet on top of her pile this is a nice group she said as she glanced across the room i like reunions i think i figured that out well i do i like the continuity of them i like seeing all these people who shared the same experience the same little block of time she mused the paper dangling from her fingers not the greatest era for music with the dreaded disco onslaught but there were a few bright lights the doobie brothers were still together so were the eagles do you always measure time in rock and roll she had to laugh occupational hazard anyway its a good barometer tossing her hair back she grinned at him the first record i spun as a professional was the stones emotional rescue that was the year reagan was elected the first time the year john lennon was shot and the year the empire struck back not bad oroarke its better than not bad she considered him i bet you remember what was playing on the radio the first time you talked a girl into the back seat of your car dueling banjos youre kidding you asked she was chuckling as she opened the request sheet her laughter died she thought for a moment her heart had stopped carefully she squeezed her eyes shut but when she opened them again the boldly printed words remained i want you to scream when i kill you cilia with a brisk shake of her head she passed the note to boyd he was here she thought panic clawing as she searched the room somewhere in this crowd of laughing chattering couples he was watching and waiting hed come close close enough to lay that innocentlooking slip of paper on her table close enough to look into her eyes maybe to smile he might have spoken to her and she hadnt known she hadnt recognized him she hadnt understood cilia she jolted when boyd put a hand to her shoulder and she would have stumbled backward if he hadnt balanced her oh god i thought that tonight just this one night hed leave me alone take a break i cant dazed she clamped her hands together and stared around the room i have to i need to make a call he told her i want you where i can see you he could still be here she thought close enough to touch her did he have the knife the longbladed knife hed so lovingly described to her was he waiting for the moment when the music was loud when the laughter was at a peak so that he could plunge it into her come on wait wait a minute with her nails biting into her palms she leaned into the mike were going to take a short break but dont cool down ill be back in ten to start things rocking again mechanically she shut off her equipment stay close will you she whispered with an arm snug around her waist he began to lead her through the crowd every time they were bumped she shuddered when a man pushed through the throng and grabbed both of her hands she nearly screamed cilia oroarke he had a pleasant affable face dampened with sweat from a turn on the dance floor he was beaming as cilia stood as still as a statue and boyd tensed beside her tom collins not the drink he said still beaming thats my name im chairman of the reunion committee remember oh she forced her lips to curve yes sure just wanted to tell you how thrilled we are to have you got a lot of fans here he released one of her hands to sweep his arm out im about the biggest theres hardly a night goes by i dont catch at least a part of your show lost my wife last year i she cleared her throat im sorry no i mean i lost her came home one night and she and the furniture were gone never did find her or the sectional sofa he laughed heartily while cilia searched for something to say fact is your show got me through some pretty lonely nights just wanted to thank you and tell you youre doing a hell of a job here tonight he pressed a business card into her hand im in appliances you just call me whenever you need a new refrigerator he winked give you a good deal thanks it should be funny she thought later it would be funny nice seeing you tom pleasures mine he watched her walk away and beamed again boyd steered her out of the ballroom and toward the nearest pay phone hang on okay she nodded even managed to smile at a group of women herding toward the ladies lounge im better now im going to sit down right over there she pointed to an arrangement of chairs and a potted plant leaving boyd digging for change she walked over then let her legs collapse under her it was a nightmare she wished it was as simple as a nightmare so that she could wake up with the sun shining in her face she had nearly gotten through an entire day without thinking of him shaky she pulled out a cigarette perhaps it had been foolish to let herself believe he would give her a day of peace but to have come here the odds of him actually being one of the alumni were slim yet hed gotten inside with her back pressed into the chair she watched people file in and out of the ballroom it could be any one of them she thought straining for some spark of recognition would she know him if she saw him or would he be a complete stranger he could be someone standing behind her at the market someone sitting across from her at a gas pump he might be the man in front of her at the bank or the clerk at the dry cleaners anyone she thought as she closed her eyes he could be any one of the nameless faceless people she passed in the course of a day yet he knew her name he knew her face he had taken away her peace of mind her freedom he wouldnt be satisfied until hed taken her life she watched boyd hang up the phone and waited until he crossed to her well theas coming by to pick up the paper well send it to the lab his hand found the tensed muscle at the curve of her neck and soothed i dont think well get prints no she appreciated the fact that he didnt give her any false hope do you think hes still here i dont know that was its own frustration its a big hotel cilia theres no security to speak of for this event it wouldnt be very effective to try to close it off and interrogate everyone in it if you want to take off early i can tell them youre sick no i dont want to do that she took a long last drag on her cigarette the only satisfaction i can get is from finishing out proving im not ready to fold especially if he is still around somewhere okay remember for the next hour im never going to be more than a foot away she put a hand in his as she rose boyd he changed his approach writing a note what do you think it means it could mean a lot of things such as such as it was the most convenient way to contact you tonight or hes starting to get sloppy or impatient she added turning to him at the doorway be honest with me or impatient he cupped her face in his hands he has to get through me first cilia i can promise that wont be an easy job she made herself smile cops like to think theyre tough no he kissed her lightly cops have to be tough come on maybe youve got dueling banjos in there you can play it for me for old times sake not on a bet she got through it hed never doubted that she would and yet the way she held on despite her fears amazed and impressed him not once did she bog down break down or falter but he saw the way she studied the crowd searched the faces as the music raged around her her hands moved constantly tapping out the beat on the table shifting through records fiddling with the sequined studs on her pleated shirt she would never be serene he thought she would never be soothing she would pace her way through life driven by nerves and ambition she would make a demanding and unsettling companion not what hed had in mind on the rare occasions hed considered marriage and family not even close he realized with a faint smile but she was exactly what he wanted and intended to have he would protect her with his life that was duty he would cherish her for a lifetime that was love if the plans hed made ran smoothly she would understand the difference very soon he too was searching the crowd studying the faces watching for any sign any movement that would bring that quick tensing of the gut called instinct but the music raged on the partygoers laughed he saw althea enter and so he thought with a shake of his head did most of the men in the room he had to chuckle when he saw one woman jab her husband in the ribs as he gawked at the redhead skirting the dance floor you always make an entrance thea she only shrugged she was wearing a simple offtheshoulder cocktail dress in basic black i should thank you for getting me out of what turned into an annoying evening my date had a toothbrush in his pocket and a night of wild sex on his mind animal arent they all she glanced past him to cilia amusement faded to be replaced by concern hows she holding up shes incredible she lifted one arched brow partner my sharp investigative skills lead me to believe that you are seriously infatuated with our assignment i passed infatuation im in love with her theas lips formed a thoughtful pout is that with a lowercase or uppercase l thats in all caps he looked away from cilia to his partner there were few others with whom he would share his private thoughts im thinking marriage thea want to be my best man you can count on me still she laid a hand on his arm i dont want to be a drag boyd but youve got to keep some perspective on this the ladys in trouble he struggled against annoyance i can function as a cop and as a man because it wasnt something he wanted to discuss at length he reached in his pocket heres the note for what its worth she skimmed the message then slipped it into her bag well see what the lab boys can do he only nodded the exhusband looks clean an enormous disappointment i finished running him through tonight state senator lomax has been married for seven years and has one point six children he hasnt been out of atlanta for three months i finally got ahold of the station manager in chicago he had nothing but good things to say about cilia i checked out his story about being in rochester the past week visiting his daughter it pans she had a girl seven pounds six ounces he faxed me the personnel files on the jocks and staff who were at the station when cilia worked there so far nothing when i come in monday well take a closer look i figured id go over the file this weekend stick close to our girl i owe you one thea you owe me more than one but whos counting she started out pausing once then twice to refuse the offer of a dance then again to decline a more intimate offer because a party was appreciated more when it ended on a fever pitch cilia chose the last three songs for their beat rather than their sentiment jackets were off ties were undone and careful hairstyles were limp when the last song ended the dance floor was jammed thank you class of youve been great i want to see all of you back here for your twentieth good job boyd told her she was already stacking records as the crowd split off into groups phone numbers and addresses would be exchanged a few of the goodbyes would be tearful its not over yet it helped to work she had to break down the equipment and with the help of the hotel staff she would load it into boyds car then there would be a trip back to the station and the unloading after that maybe she would allow herself to think again it was a good job she looked up surprised mark what are you doing here i could say i was checking up on one of my jocks he picked up one of the s and laughed god dont tell me you actually played this it was pretty hot in suspicious she took it back from him now why dont you tell me what youre really doing here feeling nostalgic himself he glanced around he and his wife had met in high school im here to get my equipment since when does the station manager load equipment im the boss he reminded her i can do whatever i want and as of now he glanced casually at his watch youre on sick leave it was suddenly very clear she shot an accusing look at boyd im not sick you are if i say you are mark countered if i see you at the station before your shift monday night youre fired damn it mark take it or leave it softening the blow he put his hands on her shoulders its business cilia ive had jocks burn out from a lot less pressure than youre under i want you for the long haul and its personal youve got a lot of people worried about you im handling it then you should be able to handle a couple of free days now get out of here but whos going to boyd took her arm you heard the man i hate being bullied she muttered as he dragged her along too bad i guess you figure khip is going to fall apart without you there for a weekend without turning her head she shifted her eyes and aimed a killing look at him thats not the point no the point is you need a rest and youre going to get it she grabbed her coat before he could help her on with it just what the hell am i supposed to do with myself well think of something seething with resentment she stalked out to the parking lot a few stragglers from the reunion loitered around their cars she plopped into the passengers seat and scowled since when did we come into it since by an odd coincidence ive also got the weekend off eyes narrowed she studied him as he conscientiously buckled her seat belt it smells like a conspiracy you havent seen anything yet he deliberately chose a cassette of classical music and popped it into the tape player before driving out of the lot mozart she said with a sneer bach its called cleansing the palate on a heavy sigh she reached for a cigarette she didnt want people worried about her didnt want to admit she was tired wasnt ready to admit she was relieved this stuff always puts me to sleep you could use the rest she had her teeth clenched as she punched in the lighter i dont appreciate you running to mark this way i didnt run to mark i simply called him and suggested you could use some time i can take care of myself slick your taxes are being used to see that i take care of you have i mentioned lately how much i dislike cops not in the past twentyfour hours apparently he wasnt going to rise to any of the bait she dangled and allow her to purge her annoyance with a fight maybe it was for the best after all she decided she could use the time to catch up on her reading the last two issues of radio and records were waiting for her attention she also wanted to look through one of the garden magazines that had come in the mail it would be nice to plant some summer flowers around the house maybe some bushes she hadnt a clue what sort of thing suited denvers climate the idea made her smile she would buy a window box and maybe one of those hanging baskets perhaps that was why she didnt notice they were heading in the wrong direction until boyd had been driving for twenty minutes where are we she sat up quickly blinking on heading west highway what the devil are we doing on driving to the mountains the mountains groggy she pushed back her tumbled hair what mountains i think theyre called the rockies he said dryly you might have heard of them dont get smart with me youre supposed to be driving me home i am in a manner of speaking im driving you to my home ive seen your home she jerked her thumb its back that way thats where i live in denver this is the place i have in the mountains its a very comfortable little cabin nice view were going for the weekend we are not going anywhere for the weekend she shifted in her seat to glare at him im spending the weekend at home well do that next weekend he said perfectly reasonable look fletcher as a cop you should know when you take somebody somewhere against their will its considered a crime you can file charges when we get back okay this has gone far enough it wouldnt do any good to lose her temper she reminded herself he was immune you might think youre doing this for my own good but there are other people involved theres no way im going to leave deborah in that house alone while this maniac is running loose looking for me good point he glided off at an exit and nearly had her relaxing thats why shes spending a couple of days with althea i she told me to tell you to have a good time oh he continued while cilia made incoherent noises she packed a bag for you its in the trunk just when did you plan all this that fabulous voice of hers was quiet too quiet boyd decided bracing for the storm i had some free time today youll like the cabin its peaceful not too remote and like i said it has a nice view as long as theres a nice high cliff i can throw you off of he slowed to navigate the winding road theres that too i knew you had nerve fletcher but this goes beyond what the hell made you think you could just put me in a car arrange my sisters life and drive me off to some cabin mustve had a brainstorm brain damage is more like it get this straight i dont like the country i dont like rustic i am not a happy camper and i wont go youre already going how could he stay so irritatingly calm if you dont take me back right now im going to what she ground her teeth you have to sleep sometime her own words made her take a quantum leap you creep she began on a fresh wave of fury if this is your way of getting me into bed you miscalculated ill sit in the car and freeze first theres more than one bedroom in the cabin he said mildly youre welcome to share mine or take any of the others its your choice she slumped back in her seat finally speechless chapter contents prev next one didnt intend to romanticize it being swept away was fine in books about titled ladies and swaggering buccaneers but it didnt play well in twentiethcentury denver she didnt intend to change her attitude if the only revenge available to her was keeping a frosty distance she would keep it very well he wouldnt get one smile or one kind word until the entire ridiculous weekend was over that was why it was a shame that her first glimpse of the house was in the moonlight he called this a cabin cilia was grateful the music masked her surprised gasp her idea of a cabin was a squat little log structure in the middle of nowhere lacking all possible conveniences the kind of place men went when they wanted to grow beards drink beer and complain about women it was built of wood a soft aged wood that glowed warm in the dappled moonlight but it was far from little multileveled with interesting juts of timber and windows it rested majestically amid the snowdusted pine decks some covered some open promised a breathtaking view from any direction the metal roof glinted making her wonder how it would be to sit inside and listen to rain falling but she stubbornly bit back all the words of praise and pushed out of the car the snow came up to midcalf and clogged in her shoes great she muttered leaving him to deal with whatever luggage they had she trudged up to the porch so it was beautiful she thought it didnt make any difference she still didnt want to be there but since she was and hailing a cab wasnt a possibility she would keep her mouth shut choose the bedroom farthest away from his and crawl into bed maybe shed stay there for fortyeight hours cilia kept the first part of the vow when he joined her on the porch the only sounds were the planks creaking under his weight and the calling of something wild in the woods after setting their bags aside he unlocked the door and gestured her inside it was dark and freezing somehow that made her feel better the more uncomfortable it was the more justified her foul temper then he switched on the lights she could only gape the main room at the cabins center was huge an open gabled structure with roughhewn beams and a charming granite fireplace thick cushy furniture was arranged around it its freestanding chimney rose up through the high lofted ceiling above a balcony swept the width of the room keeping with the theme of open space and wood in contrast the walls were a simple white accented with glossy builtin shelves and manypaned doors and windows this was nothing like the arches and curves of his house in denver the cabin was all straight lines and simplicity the wide planked floors were bare a set of gleaming steps marched straight to the next level beside the fireplace was an open woodbox stacked with split logs a touch of whimsy was added by grinning brass dragons that served as andirons it warms up pretty quick boyd said figuring she would start talking to him again when she was ready he flipped on the heat before he shucked off his coat and hung it on a mirrored rack just inside the door leaving her where she was he crossed to the fireplace and proceeded to arrange kindling and logs the kitchens through there he gestured as he touched a match to some crumpled newspaper the pantrys stocked if youre hungry she was but shed be damned if shed admit it shed been getting a perverse pleasure in watching her breath puff out in front of her sulking she watched the flames rise up to lick at the logs he even did that well she thought in disgust hed probably been an eagle scout when she didnt respond he stood up brushing off his hands as stubborn as she was he figured he could outlast her if youd rather just go to bed there are four bedrooms upstairs not counting the sleeping porch but its a little cold yet to try that she knew when she was being laughed at setting her chin she snatched up her bag and stalked up the stairs it was hard to tell which room was his they were all beautifully decorated and inviting cilia chose the smallest though she hated to admit it it was charming with its angled ceiling its tiny paneled bath and its atrium doors dropping her bag on the narrow bed she dug in to see just what her sister a partner in this crime had packed the big bulky sweater and thick cords met with approval as did the sturdy boots and rag socks the bag of toiletries and cosmetics was a plus though she doubted shed waste her time with mascara or perfume instead of her broncos jersey and frayed chenille robe there was a swatch of black silk with a matching and very sheer peignoir pinned to the bodice was a note happy birthday a few weeks early see you monday love deborah cilia blew out a long breath her own sister she thought her own baby sister gingerly she held up the transparent silk just what had deborah had in mind when shed packed an outfit like this she wondered maybe that question was best left unanswered so shed sleep in the sweater cilia decided but she couldnt resist running her fingertips over the silk it felt well glorious she admitted rarely did she indulge herself with anything so impractical a small section of her closet was devoted to outfits like the one shed worn to the reunion she thought of them more as costumes than as clothes the rest were practical comfortable deborah shouldnt have been so extravagant she thought but it was so like her with a sigh cilia let the silk slide through her hands it probably wouldnt hurt just to try it on after all it was a gift and no one was going to see it heat was beginning to pour through the vents grateful she slipped out of her coat and kicked off her shoes shed indulge herself with a hot bath in that cute clawfooted tub and then shed crawl under that very comfortablelooking quilt and go to sleep she meant to really but the hot water lulled her the package of bubble bath deborah had tucked in the case had been irresistible now the nightspice fragrance enveloped her she nearly dozed off dreaming with the frothy perfumed water lapping over her skin then there was the skylight over the tub that small square of glass that let the stardust sprinkle through indulgent cilia thought with a sigh as she sank deeper in the tub romantic almost sinfully soothing it had probably been silly to light the pair of candles that sat in the deep windowsill instead of using the overhead lamp but it had been too tempting and as she soaked and dreamed their scent wafted around her she was just making the best of a bad situation she assured herself as she rose lazily from the tub unpinning her hair she let it swing around her shoulders as she slipped into the teddy deborah had given her it had hardly any back at all she noted just a silly little flounce that barely covered the essentials it laced up the front thin glossy ribbons that crisscrossed and ended in a small bow in the center just below her breasts though it barely covered them as well some clever structural secret lifted them up made them look fuller despite her best intentions she traced a fingertip down the ribbons wondering what it would be like to have boyd unlace them imagining what it might be like to have his fingers brush over her justpampered skin would he go slowly one careful hook at a time or would he simply tear at them until oh lord cursing herself she yanked open the door and dashed out of the steamy bath it was ridiculous to daydream that way she reminded herself she had never been a daydreamer always always she had known where she was going and how to get there not since childhood had she wasted time with fantasies that had no connection with ambition or success she certainly had no business fantasizing about a man no matter how attracted she was to him when she knew there was no possible way they could become a comfortable reality she would go to bed she would shut off her mind and she would pray that she could shut off these needs that were eating away at her before she could shove her bag on the floor she saw the glass beside the bed it was a longstemmed crystal glass filled with some pale golden liquid as she sampled it she shut her eyes wine she realized wonderfully smooth probably french turning she saw herself reflected in the cheval glass in the corner her eyes were dark and her skin was flushed she looked too soft too yielding too pliant what was he doing to her she asked herself and why was it working before she could change her mind she slipped the thin silk over her shoulders and went to find him hed been reading the same page for nearly an hour thinking about her cursing her wanting her it had taken every ounce of selfpossession he had to set that wine beside her bed and leave the room when he could hear her splashing lazily in the tub just one narrow door away it wasnt as if it were all onesided he thought in disgust he knew when a woman was interested it wasnt as if it were all physical he was in love with her damn it and if she was too stupid to see that then hed just have to beat her over the head with it laying the book on his lap he listened to the bluesy eloquence of billie holiday and stared into the fire the cheerful flames had cut the chill in the bedroom that was the practical reason he had built a fire in here as well as one on the main floor but there was another a romantic one he was annoyed that he had daydreamed of cilia as he set the logs and lit the kindling she had come to him wearing something thin flowing seductive she had smiled held out her hands melted against him when he had lifted her into his arms carried her to the bed they had keep dreaming he told himself the day cilia oroarke came to him of her own free will with a smile and an open hand would be the day they built snowmen in hell she had feelings for him damn it plenty of them and if she werent so bullheaded so determined to lock up all that incredible passion she wouldnt spend so much time biting her nails and lighting cigarettes resentful restrictive and repressed that was priscilla alice oroarke he thought grimly he picked up his wine for a mock toast it nearly slid out of his hand when he saw her standing in the doorway i want to talk to you shed lost most of her nerve on the short trip down the hall but she managed to step into the room she wasnt going to let the fact that he was sitting in front of a sizzling fire wearing nothing but baggy sweats intimidate her he needed a drink after a gulp of wine he managed a nod he was almost ready to believe he was dreaming again but she wasnt smiling yeah she was going to speak she reminded herself say what was on her mind and clear the air but she needed a sip of her own wine first i realize your motives in bringing me here tonight were basically wellintentioned given the circumstances of the last couple of weeks but your methods were unbelievably arrogant she wondered if she sounded like as much of a fool to him as she did to herself she waited for a response but he just continued to stare blankly at her boyd he shook his head what dont you have anything to say about what a low sound of frustration rumbled in her throat as she stepped closer she slammed the glass down on a table and the remaining wine lapped close to the rim the least you can do after dragging me all the way up here is to listen when i complain about it he was barely capable of breathing much less listening in selfdefense he took another long sip of wine if you had any legs brains he corrected gnashing his teeth youd know that a couple days away from everything would be good for you anger flared in her eyes making her all the more arousing behind her the flames shot high and the light rippled through the thin silk she wore so you just took it on yourself to make the decision for me thats right in one jerky movement he set the glass aside to keep it from shattering in his fingers if i had asked you to come here for a couple of days you would have made a dozen excuses why you couldnt well never know what i would have done she countered because you didnt give me the option of making my own choice im doing my damnedest to give you the option now he muttered about what on an oath he stood up and turned away hands braced on the wall he began none too gently to pound his forehead against it as she watched him confusion warred with anger what are you doing im beating my head against the wall what does it look like im doing he stopped letting his forehead rest against the wood apparently she wasnt the only one under too much strain cilia mused she cleared her throat boyd why are you beating your head against the wall he laughed and rubbing his hands over his face turned i have no idea its just something ive felt obliged to do since i met you she was standing a little uncertain now running nervous fingertips up and down her silk lapel it wasnt easy but after a deep breath he found a slippery hold on control why dont you go on to bed cilia in the morning you can tear apart whats left of me i dont understand you she snapped out the words then began to pace boyd opened his mouth but couldnt even manage a groan as he stared at the long length of her back bare but for the sheerest of black silk at the agitated swing of her hips accented by the sassy little flounce she was talking again rapidfire and irritated but it was all just a buzzing in his head for gods sake dont pace he rubbed the heel of his hand against his heart in another minute he was sure it would explode out of his chest are you trying to kill me i always pace when im mad she tossed back how do you expect me to go quietly to bed after youve got me worked up this way got you worked up he repeated something snapped he would have sworn he heard it boomerang in his head as he reached out and snatched her arms ive got you worked up thats rich oroarke tell me did you wear this thing in here tonight to make me suffer i she looked down at herself then shifted uncomfortably deborah packed it its all ive got whoever packed it its you whos packed into it and youre driving me crazy i just thought we should clear all this up she was going to start stuttering in a minute talk it through like grownups im thinking very much like a grownup at the moment if you want to talk theres a chestful of big thick wool blankets you can wrap yourself up in one she didnt need a blanket she was already much too warm if he continued to rub his hands up and down the silk on her arms the friction was going to cause her skin to burst into flame maybe i wanted to make you suffer a little it worked his fingers toyed with the excuse of a robe as it slid from her right shoulder cilia im not going to make this easy on you and drag you to that bed im not saying the idea doesnt appeal to me a great deal but if we make love youre going to have to wake up in the morning knowing the choice was yours wasnt that why she had come to him hoping hed take matters out of her hands that made her a coward and in a miserable way a cheat its not easy for me it should be he slid his hands down to hers if youre ready she lifted her head he was waiting every bit as edgy as she but waiting i guess ive been ready since i met you a tremor worked through him and he struggled against his selfimposed leash just say yes saying it wasnt enough she thought when something was important it took more than one simple word let go of my hands please he held them another long moment searching her face slowly his fingers relaxed and dropped away from hers before he could back up she moved into him wrapping her arms around his neck i want you boyd i want to be with you tonight she brought her lips to his there had already been enough words warm and willing she sank into him for a moment he couldnt breathe the onslaught on his senses was too overwhelming her taste her scent the texture of silk against silk there was her sigh as she rubbed her lips over his he remembered taking a kick in the solar plexus from one of his fathers prized stallions this left him just as debilitated he wanted to savor to drown to lose himself inch by glorious inch but even as he slipped the robe from her shoulders she was pulling him to the bed she was like a whirlwind hands racing pressing tugging followed by the mad erotic journey of her mouth the pressure was building too fast but when he reached for her she shimmied out of the silk and rushed on she didnt want him to regret wanting her she couldnt have borne it if she was to throw every shred of caution to the winds for this one night she needed to know that it would matter that he would remember his skin was hot and damp she wished she could have lingered over the taste of it the feel of it under her fingers but she thought men preferred speed and power she heard him groan it delighted her when she tugged off his sweats his hands were in her hair he was murmuring something her name and more but she couldnt tell she thought she understood his urgency the way he pulled her up against him when he rolled over her she whispered her agreement and took him inside her he stiffened on an oath he tried to level himself and draw back but her hips arched and thrust against him leaving his body no choice her lips were curved when he lay over her his face buried in her hair his breath still shuddering he wouldnt regret this she thought rubbing a soothing hand over his shoulder and neither would she it was more than she had ever had before more than she had ever expected there had been a warmth when he filled her and a quiet contentment when she felt him spill into her she thought how nice it would be to close her eyes and drift off to sleep with his body still warm on hers he was cursing himself steadily he was enraged by his lack of control and baffled by the way she had rushed them both from kiss to completion hed barely touched her in more ways than one though it was she who had set the pace at a sprint he knew she hadnt come close to fulfillment struggling for calm he rolled away from her to stare at the ceiling shed set off bombs inside him and though they had exploded neither of them had shared the joy why did you do that he asked her her hand paused on its way to stroke his hair i dont understand i thought you wanted to make love i did he sat up dragging the hair back from his face i thought you did too but i thought men liked she let her eyes close as the warmth drained out of her i told you i wasnt very good at it he swore ripely enough to have her jolting moving quickly she scrambled out of bed to struggle back into the peignoir where the hell are you going to bed because her voice was thick with tears she lowered it we can just chalk this up to one more miscalculation she reached down for her robe and heard the door slam bolting up she saw boyd turning a key in the lock then tossing it across the room i dont want to stay here with you too bad you already made your choice she balled up the robe hugging it to her chest so he was angry she thought and it was the real thing this time it wouldnt be the first fight she had had about her inadequacies in bed old wounds old doubts trickled through her until she stood rigid with embarrassment look i did the best i could if it wasnt good enough fine just let me go wasnt good enough he repeated as he stepped forward she backed up ramming into the carved footboard somebody ought to bounce you on your head and knock some sense into it there are two people in a bed cilia and what happens in it is supposed to be mutual i wasnt looking for a damn technician the angry flush died away from her face until it was marble white her eyes filled pressing his fingers against his own eyes he swore he hadnt meant to hurt her only to show her that hed wanted a partner you didnt feel anything i did she rubbed tears from her cheek infuriated no one made her cry no one then thats a miracle cilia you barely let me touch you im not blaming you he took another step but she evaded him searching for patience he stood where he was i didnt exactly fight you off i thought lets just say by the time i understood it was too late to do anything about it id like to make it up to you theres nothing to make up she had herself under control again eyes dry voice steady she wanted to die well just forget it i want you to unlock the door he let out a huff of breath then shrugged when he turned to the door she started to follow but he only turned off the lights what are you doing we tried it your way in the moonlight he moved across the room to light a candle then another and another he turned over the record that sat silent on the turntable engaged the needle the trembling cry of a tenor sax filled the room now we try it mine she was starting to tremble now from embarrassment and from fear i said i wanted to go to bed good he swept her up into his arms so do i ive had enough humiliation for one night she said between her teeth she saw something in his eyes something dark but his voice was quiet when he spoke im sorry i never meant to hurt you though she held herself rigid he lowered her gently to the bed with his eyes on hers he spread out her hair letting his fingers linger ive imagined you here in the candlelight with your hair on my pillow he lowered his lips to brush them across hers moonlight and firelight on your skin with nothing and no one else but you for miles moved she turned her head away she wouldnt be seduced by words and make a fool of herself again he only smiled and pressed his lips to her throat i love a challenge im going to make love with you cilia he slipped the strap of the peignoir from her shoulder to cruise the slope with his mouth im going to take you places youve never even dreamed of he took her hand pleased that her pulse had quickened you shouldnt be afraid to enjoy yourself im not youre afraid to relax to let go to let someone get close enough to find out whats inside you she tried to shift away but his arms wrapped around her we already had sex yes we did he kissed one corner of her mouth then the other now were going to make love she started to turn her head again but he cupped her face with his hands when his mouth came to hers again her heart leaped into her throat it was so soft so tempting as his fingertips glided across her face she gave a strangled sigh he dipped into her parted lips to tease her tongue with his i dont want she moaned as his teeth nipped into her bottom lip tell me what you do want i dont know her mind was already hazy she lifted a hand to push him away but it only lay limp on his shoulder then well make it multiplechoice to please himself and her he ran a trail of kisses down her throat when im finished you can tell me what you like best he murmured to her soft dreamy words that floated in her head then he drugged her with a kiss long lazy luxurious though her body had begun to tremble he barely touched her just those fingertips stroking along her shoulders over her face into her hair his tongue slid over the tops of her breasts just above the fringe of black lace her skin was like honey there he thought laving the valley between her heart jackhammered against him but when she reached out he took her hands in his taking his time his devastating time he inched the lace down with his teeth she arched up offering herself her fingers tensing like wires against his he only murmured and leaving a moist trail eased the other curve of lace down his own breathing was short and shallow but he fought back the urge to take greedily with teasing openmouthed kisses he circled her flicking his hot tongue over her rigid nipple until she shuddered and sobbed out his name on a groan of pleasure he suckled she felt the pressure deep inside clenching unclenching to the rhythm of his clever mouth building layering growing until she thought she would die from it her breath was heaving as she writhed beneath him her nails dug hard into the backs of his hands as her body bowed driven up by a knot of sensation she heard her own cry her gasp of relief and torment as something shattered inside her hot knives that turned to silky butterfly wings a pain that brought unreasonable pleasure as every muscle in her body went lax he covered her mouth with his good lord youre incredible i cant she brought a hand up to press a palm to her temple i cant think dont just feel he straddled her she was prepared for him to take her he had already given her more than she had ever had shown her more than she had ever imagined he began to unlace the peignoir with infinite care infinite patience his eyes were on her face he loved being able to see everything she felt as it flickered there every new sensation every new emotion he heard the whisper of silk against her skin as he drew it down he felt passion vibrate from her as he pressed his mouth to the quivering flesh of her stomach floating she stroked his hair let her mind follow where her body so desperately wanted to go this was heaven more demanding more exciting more erotic than any paradise she could have dreamed she could feel the sheets hot from her own body tangled beneath her and the shimmer of silk as it slipped slowly slowly away his skin dampened from pleasure slid over hers when her lips parted on a sigh she could still taste him there rich and male candlelight played against her closed lids there was so much to absorb so much to experience if it went on forever it would still end too soon she was his now he knew much more his than she had been when he had been plunged inside her her body was like a wish long and slim and pale in the moonlight her breath was quick and quiet and it was his name only his name she spoke when he touched her her hands flexed on his shoulder urging him on he slid down her legs taking the silk with him nibbling everywhere as he went the scent of her skin was a tormenting delight he could have lingered over endlessly but her body was restless poised he knew she must be aching even as he was he stroked a fingertip up her thigh along that sensitive flesh close so close to where the heat centered when he slipped inside her she was wet and waiting the breathless moan came first and then the magic of his hands had her catapulting up over a new and higher crest stunned by the power of it she arched against him shuddering again and again as she climbed though her hands clutched at him he continued to drive her with his mouth with his clever and relentless fingers until she shot beyond pleasure to delirium then her arms were around him and they were spinning off together rolling over on the bed like lightning and thunder the time for patience was over the time for greed had begun he fought for breath as her hands raced over him as she had the first time she ripped away his control but now she was with him beat for beat and need for need he saw her eyes glow dark with passion depthless with desire her slick skin shimmered with it in the shadowy light one last time he brought his mouth down on hers swallowing her stunned cry as he thrust himself into her on a half sob she wrapped her arms and legs around him locking tight so that they could race toward madness together he was exhausted weak as a baby and he was heavy using what strength he could find boyd rolled taking cilia with him so that their positions were reversed satisfied he cradled her head and decided he very much liked the sensation of her body sprawled over his she shuddered he soothed cold she just shook her head lazy as a cat he stroked a hand down her naked back i might in an hour or so find the strength to look for the blankets im fine but her voice wasnt steady frowning boyd cupped a hand under her chin and lifted it he could see a tear glittering on her lashes whats this im not crying she said almost fiercely okay what are you she tried to duck her head again but he held it firm youll think im stupid probably the only time i couldnt think you were stupid is right after youve turned me inside out he gave her a quick kiss spill it oroarke its just that i she let out an impatient breath i didnt think it was supposed to be that way not really what way his lips curved funny but it seemed he was getting his strength back maybe it was the way she was looking at him dazed embarrassed beautiful you mean like good he slid his hands down to caress her bottom casually or very good maybe you mean terrific or astounding youre making fun of me uhuh i was hoping for a compliment but you dont want to give me one i figure youre just too stubborn to admit that my way was better than your way but thats okay i also figure i can keep you locked in here until you do damn it boyd its not easy for me to explain myself you dont have to there was no teasing note in his voice now the look in his eyes made her weak all over again i wanted to tell you that i never no ones ever made me she gave up it was terrific yeah he cupped a hand on the back of her head and brought her mouth to his now were going to shoot for astounding chapter contents prev next cilia wrapped her arms across her body to ward off the chill and stared out over the pine and rock boyd had been right again the view was incredible from this angle she could see the jagged snowcapped peaks of the circling mountains closer yet still distant she caught the faint mist of smoke from a chimney evergreens stood sturdy winter veterans their needles whistling in the rising wind there was the harsh whisper of an icy stream she could catch glimpses of the water just the glint of it in the fading sun the shadows were long with late afternoon casting a cool blue light over the snow earlier she had seen a deer nuzzling her nose into it in search of the grass beneath now she was alone shed forgotten what it was to feel so at peace in truth she wondered if she had ever known certainly not since earliest childhood when she had still believed in fairy tales and happy endings it had to be too late when a woman was nearly thirty to start believing again and yet she doubted things would ever be quite the same again he had kept his promise he had taken her places she had never dreamed of in one exquisitely long night he had shown her that love meant you could accept as well as offer take as well as give she had learned more than the power of lovemaking in boyds bed she had learned the power of intimacy the comfort and the glory of it for the first time in years she had slept deeply and dreamlessly she hadnt felt awkward or uncomfortable on waking with him that morning she had felt calm wonderfully calm it was almost impossible to believe that there was another world apart from this spot a world of pain and danger and fear yet there was and it was a world she would have to face again all too soon she couldnt hide here not from a man who wanted her dead nor from her own miserable memories but wasnt she entitled to a little more time to pretend that nothing else mattered it wasnt right on a sigh she lifted her face to the dying sun no matter how she felt or perhaps because she had come to feel so deeply she had to be honest with herself and with boyd she wouldnt let what had started between them go any further couldnt she thought squeezing her eyes tight it had to be better to let her heart break a little now than to have it smashed later he was a good man she thought an honest one a caring one he was patient intelligent and dedicated and he was a cop she shivered and held herself more tightly there was a scar just under his right shoulder front and back she remembered from a bullet that occupational hazard of law enforcement she hadnt asked and wouldnt how he had come by it when it had happened or how near death it had taken him but neither could she hide from the fact that the scars she bore were as real as his she simply could not delude either of them into believing there was a future for them she should never have allowed it to progress as far as it had but that was done they were lovers and though she knew that was a mistake she would always be grateful for the time she had had with him the logical thing to do would be to discuss the limitations of their relationship no strings no obligations in all likelihood he would appreciate that kind of practicality if her feelings had grown too far too fast she would just have to get a grip on them she would simply have to talk herself out of being in love he found her there leaning out on the railing as if she were straining to fly out above the pines above the snowcapped peaks the nerves were coming back he noted with some frustration he wondered if she knew how relaxed she had been that morning when she had stretched against him waking gradually turning to him so that they could make slow lazy love now when he touched her hair she jolted before she leaned back against his hand i like your place slick im glad he intended to come back here with her year after year her fingers danced over the railing then groped in her pockets i never asked you if you bought it or had it built had it built even hammered a few nails myself a man of many talents its almost a shame to have a place like this only for weekends ive been known to break away for more than that from time to time and my parents use it now and again oh do they live in denver colorado springs he began to massage the tensing muscles in her shoulders but they travel a lot itchy feet i guess your father was disappointed when you didnt go into the family business no my sisters carrying on the family tradition sister she glanced over her shoulder i didnt know you had a sister theres a lot you dont know he kissed her lips when they formed into a pout shes a real gogetter tough highpowered businesswoman and a hell of a lot better at it than i would have been but arent they uneasy about you being a cop i dont think its a daytoday worry youre getting chilled he said come on inside by the fire she went with him moving inside and down the rear steps into the kitchen mmm whats that smell i threw some chili together he walked over to the center island where copper pots hung from the ceiling lifting the lid on a pan simmering on the range he sniffed be ready in about an hour i would have helped you thats okay he selected a bordeaux from the wine rack you can cook next time she made a feeble attempt at a smile so you did like my peanutbutterandjelly special just like mom used to make she doubted that his mother had ever made a sandwich in her life people who had that kind of money also had a houseful of servants as she stood feeling foolish he set the wine on the counter to breathe arent you going to take off your coat oh sure she shrugged out of it and hung it on a hook by the door is there anything you want me to do yes relax i am you were selecting two glasses from above the rack he examined them im not sure what has you tied up again cilia but were going to talk it through this time why dont you go sit by the fire ill bring out the wine if he read her this easily after a matter of weeks cilia thought as she went into the living room how much would he see in a year she settled on a low cushion near the fire she wasnt going to think of a year or even a month when he came in she offered him a much brighter smile and reached for her wine thanks its a good thing i didnt come here before i went househunting i never would have settled on a house without a fireplace in silence he settled beside her look at me he said at length are you worried about going back to work no then she sighed a little i trust you and thea and i know youre doing what you can but i am scared do you trust me i said i did but she didnt meet his eyes he touched a fingertip to her cheek until she faced him again not just as a cop she winced looked away again no not just as a cop and thats the trigger he mused the fact that i am a cop its none of my business we both know better i dont like it she said evenly i dont expect you to understand i think i do understand he leaned back against a chair watching her as he sipped his wine ive done some checking cilia necessary to the investigation but i wont pretend thats the only reason i looked what do you mean i looked into your background because i need to protect you and i need to understand you you told me your mother was a cop it wasnt hard to track down what happened she clutched her glass in both hands and stared straight ahead into the flames after all these years the pain was just as deadly so you punched some buttons on your computer and found out my mother was killed line of duty thats what they call it line of duty she repeated her voice dull as if it were part of a job description it is he said quietly there was a flicker of fear in her eyes when she looked at him then quickly away again yeah right it was just part of her job to be shot that day too bad about my father though he just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time the old innocent bystander cilia nothings as blackandwhite as that and nothings that simple simple she laughed and dragged her hair back from her face no the words ironic the cop and the public defender who just happen to be married are going headtohead over a case they never agreed never once can i remember them looking at any one thing from the same angle when this happened they were talking about a separation again just a trial one they said with a thoughtful frown she studied her glass looks like im out of wine saying nothing boyd poured her more so i guess you read the official report she swirled the wine then drank they brought this little creep in for interrogation threetime loser armed robbery assault drugs he wanted his lawyer present while the investigating officer questioned him talked about making a deal he knew there wouldnt be any deal they had him cold and he was going to do hard time he had two people to blame for it in his head anyway his lawyer and the cop who had collared him it was painful still so painful to remember to try to picture an event she hadnt seen one that had so drastically altered her life they caught the guy who smuggled him the gun she said softly hes still doing time taking a moment she soothed her throat with wine there they were sitting across from each other at the table just as they might have been in our own kitchen arguing about the law the sonofabitch took out that smuggled snubnosed and shot them both she looked down at her glass again a lot of people lost their jobs over that incident my parents lost their lives im not going to tell you that cops dont die by mistake unnecessarily even uselessly when she looked at him her eyes were eloquent good and i dont want the crap about how proud were supposed to be of our valiant boys in blue damn it she was my mother he hadnt just read the reports hed pored over them the papers had called it a disgrace and a tragedy the investigation had lasted more than six months and when it was over eight officials had resigned or been replaced but over and above the facts he remembered a file picture cilia her face blank with grief standing by the two graves clutching deborahs hand in hers it was a horrible way to lose them he said she just shook her head yes but in most ways id already lost my mother the day she joined the force she had an impressive record boyd said carefully it wasnt easy for a woman back then and its always tough on a cops family how do you know she demanded youre not the one who sits at home and sweats from the day i was old enough to understand i waited for her captain to come to the door and tell us she was dead cilia you cant live your life waiting for the worst i lived my life waiting for a mother the job always came first nerves were coming back he noted with some frustration he wondered if she knew how relaxed she had been that morning when she had stretched against him waking gradually turning to him so that they could make slow lazy love now when he touched her hair she jolted before she leaned back against his hand i like your place slick im glad he intended to come back here with her year after year her

it came before dad before me before deb she was never there when i needed her she snatched her hand aside before he could grasp it i didnt care if she baked cookies or folded my socks i just wanted her to be there when i needed her but her family was never as important as the masses shed sworn to serve and protect maybe she was too focused on her career he began dont you compare me with her his brow rose i wasnt going to now he took her hand despite her resistance it sounds like you are ive had to be focused she had people who loved her who needed her but she never took time to notice cops dont have regular hours shed say cops dont have regular lives i didnt know your mother and i cant comment on the choices she made but dont you think its time to cut it loose and get on with your life i have ive done what i had to do ive done what ive wanted to do and youre scared to death of what youre feeling for me because of my job its not just a job she said desperately we both know its not just a job okay he nodded its what i do and what i am were going to have to find a way to deal with it its your life she said carefully im not asking you to change anything i didnt intend to get this involved with you but i dont regret it thanks he muttered and drained his own glass what im trying to say is that if were reasonable i think we can keep it uncomplicated he set his glass aside no no what no i dont want to be reasonable and its already complicated he gave her a long look that was very close to grim im in love with you he saw the shock it flashed into her eyes an instant before she jerked back the color drained away from her face i see that thrills the hell out of you he muttered rising he heaved a log on the fire and cursed as he watched the sparks fly cilia thought it best to stay exactly where she was loves a real big word boyd weve only known each other a couple of weeks and not under the most ideal circumstances i think im damn tired of you thinking he turned back to face her just tell me what you feel i dont know that was a lie one she knew she would hate herself for she was terrified and she was thrilled she was filled with regrets and hammered by longings boyd everything thats happened has happened fast its as if i havent had any control and that makes me uneasy i didnt want to be involved with you but i am i didnt want to care about you but i do well i finally managed to pry that out of you i dont sleep with a man just because he makes me tingle better and better he smiled as he lifted her hand to kiss her fingers i make you tingle and you care about me marry me she tried to jerk her hand free this isnt the time for jokes im not joking suddenly his eyes were very intense im asking you to marry me she heard a log shift in the grate saw the flicker of a new flame as it cast light and shadow over his face his hand was warm and firm on hers holding waiting her breath seemed to be blocked somewhere beneath her heart the effort of dragging in air made her dizzy boyd im in love with you cilia slowly his eyes steady on hers he pulled her closer with every part of you soft persuasive his lips cruised over hers i only want fifty or sixty years to show you his mouth skimmed down her throat as he lowered her to the hearth rug is that too much to ask no yes struggling to clear her mind she pressed a hand against his chest boyd im not going to marry anyone sure you are he nibbled lightly at her lips as his hands began to stroke soothing and exciting at the same time you just have to get used to the fact that its going to be me he deepened the kiss lingering over it until her hand lost its resistance and slid to his bundled in a large frayed robe her feet covered with thick rag socks cilia sampled the chili she liked sitting in the warm golden light in the kitchen seeing the blanket of snow outside the windows hearing the quiet moan of the wind through the pines what surprised her and what she wasnt ready to consider too carefully was this feeling of regret that the weekend was almost over well at boyds question she looked back from the window he sat across from her his hair still mussed from her hands like her he wore only a robe and socks though it made no sense cilia found the meal every bit as intimate as their loving in front of the fire uneasy she broke a piece of the hot crusty bread on her plate she was afraid he was going to bring up marriage again well what hows the chili the oh she spooned up another bite not sure if she was relieved or disappointed its great and surprising nervous again she reached for her wine id have thought someone in your position would have a cook and wouldnt know how to boil an egg my position i mean if i could afford to hire a cook i wouldnt hassle with making sandwiches it amused him that his money made her uncomfortable after were married we can hire one if you want very carefully she set down her spoon im not going to marry you he grinned wanna bet this isnt a game sure it is the biggest in town she made a low sound of frustration picking up her spoon again she began to tap it against the wood thats such a typically male attitude its all a game you tarzan me stupid his laughter only enraged her further why is it men think women cant resist them for sex for companionship for handling the details of life oh cilia you need me oh cilia i just want to take care of you i want to show you what lifes all about he considered a moment i dont remember saying any of those things i think what i said is i love you and i want to marry you its the same thing not even close he continued to eat undisturbed well i dont want to marry you but im sure that wont make a difference it never does he shot her one brief and dangerous look i warned you not to compare me to him i meant it im not just talking about paul i wasnt even thinking about paul after pushing her bowl aside she sprang up to find a cigarette i hadnt given him a thought in years before all of this she blew out an agitated stream of smoke and if i want to compare you to other men i will he topped off his wine then hers how many others have asked you to marry them dozens it was an exaggeration but she didnt give a damn but somehow ive found the strength to resist you werent in love with them he pointed out calmly im not in love with you her voice had a desperate edge to it and she had the sinking feeling that they both knew she was lying he knew but it still hurt the hurt settled into a dull grinding ache in his belly ignoring it he finished off his chili youre crazy about me oroarke youre just too pigheaded to admit it im pigheaded stifling a scream she crushed out the cigarette im amazed that even you have the nerve to toss that one out you havent listened to a simple no since the day i met you youre right his gaze skimmed down her and look where its got me dont be so damn smug im not going to marry you because i dont want to get married because youre a cop and because youre rich you are going to marry me he said because we both know youd be miserable without me your arrogance is insufferable its just as irritating and just as pathetic as mooneyed pleading id rather be smug he decided you know youre not the first jerk ive had to shake off she snatched up her wine before she began to pace in my business you get good at it she whirled back stabbing a finger at him youre almost as bad as this kid i had to deal with in chicago up to now hes taken the prize for arrogance but even he didnt sit there with a stupid grin on his face with him it was flowers and poetry he was just as much of a mule though i was in love with him too but i wouldnt admit it i needed him to take care of me to protect me to make my life complete she spun in a quick circle what nerve before you i thought he couldnt be topped hounding me at the station she muttered hounding me at the apartment sending me an engagement ring he bought you a ring she paused long enough for a warning look dont get any ideas slick boyd kept his voice very cool very even you said he bought you a ring a diamond i dont know she dragged a hand through her hair i didnt have it appraised i sent it back what was his name she waved a hand dismissively i dont know how i got off on this the point im trying to make is i said what was his name he rose as he asked cilia took a confused step back he wasnt just boyd now he was every inch a cop i it was john something mcgill no mcgillis i think look he was just a pest i only brought it up because you didnt work with a john mcgillis in chicago no annoyed with herself she sat down again were getting off the subject boyd i told you to tell me about anyone you were involved with i wasnt involved with him he was just a kid starstruck or something he listened to the show and got hung up i made the mistake of being nice to him and he misunderstood eventually i set him straight and that was that how long boyd asked quietly just how long did he bother you she was feeling more foolish by the minute she could barely remember the boys face three or four months maybe three or four months he repeated taking her by the arms he lifted her to her feet he kept this up for three or four months and you didnt mention it to me i never thought of it he resisted the temptation to give her a good shake barely i want you to tell me everything you remember about him everything he said everything he did i cant remember youd better releasing her he stepped back sit down she obeyed he had shaken her more than he realized she tried to comfort herself with the fact that they were no longer arguing about marriage but he had reminded her of something shed allowed herself to forget for hours all right he was a night stocker at a market and he listened to the show hed call in on his break and wed talk a little id play his requests one day i did a remote i cant remember where and he showed up he seemed like a nice kid twentythree or four i guess pretty she remembered he had a pretty sort of harmless face i gave him an autograph after that he started to write me at the station send poems just sweet romantic stuff nothing suggestive go on boyd really go on the best she could do was a muttered oath when i realized he was getting in too deep i pulled back he asked me out and i told him no embarrassed she blew out a breath a couple of times he was waiting out in the parking lot when i got off my shift he never touched me i wasnt afraid of him he was so pathetic that i felt sorry for him and that was another mistake he misunderstood i guess he followed me home from work because he started to show up at the apartment hed leave flowers and slip notes under the door kid stuff she insisted did he ever try to get in he never tried to force his way in i told you he was harmless tell me more she rubbed her hands over her face hed just beg he said he loved me that he would always love me and we were meant to be together and that he knew i loved him too it got worse he would start crying when he called he talked about killing himself if i didnt marry him i got the package with the ring and i sent it back with a letter i was cruel i felt i had to be id already accepted the job here in denver it was only a few weeks after the business with the ring that we moved has he contacted you since youve been in denver no and its not him whos calling i know id recognize his voice besides he never threatened me never he was obsessed but he wasnt violent im going to check it out he rose then held out a hand youd better get some sleep were going to head back early she didnt sleep neither did he and they lay in the dark in silence there was another who kept vigil through the night he lit the candles new ones hed just bought that afternoon their wicks were as white as the moon they darkened and flared as he set the match against them he lay back on the bed with the picture pressed against his naked breast against the twin blades of the tattooed knives though the hour grew late he remained alert anger fueled him anger and hate beside him the radio hummed but it wasnt cilias voice he heard she had gone away he knew she was with that man and she would have given herself to that man shed had no right to go she belonged to john to john and to him she was beautiful just as john had described her she had deceptively kind eyes but he knew better she was cruel evil and she deserved to die almost lovingly he reached down a hand to the knife that lay beside him he could kill her the way hed been taught quick and clean but there was little satisfaction in that he knew he wanted her to suffer first he wanted her to beg as john had begged when she was dead she would be with john his brother would rest at last and so would he chapter contents prev next the heat was working overtime in the precinct and so was boyd while maintenance hammered away at the faulty furnace he pored over his files hed long since forsaken his jacket his shoulder holster was strapped over a denver pd tshirt that had seen too many washings hed propped open a window in the conference room so that the stiff breeze from outside fought with the heat still pouring through the vents two of his ongoing cases were nearly wrapped and hed just gotten a break in an extortion scam he and althea had been working on for weeks there was a court appearance at the end of the week he had to prepare for he had reports to file and calls to make but his attention was focused on oroarke priscilla a ignoring the sweat that dribbled down his back he read over the file on jim jackson khips allnight man it interested and annoyed him cilia hadnt bothered to mention that she had worked with jackson before in richmond or that jackson had been fired for drinking on the job not only had he broadcast rambling streams of consciousness but he had taken to nodding off at the mike and leaving his audience with that taboo of radio dead air hed lost his wife his home and his prime spot as the morning jock and program director on richmonds numbertwo top station when hed gotten the ax cilia had taken over his duties as program director within six months the numbertwo station had been number one and jackson had been picked up for drunk and disorderly as althea stepped into the conference room carrying two dripping cans of soda boyd tossed the jackson file across the table saying nothing she passed one can to boyd popped the top on the second then glanced at the file hes clean except for a couple of d and ds althea commented revenge is high on the list for this kind of harassment could be hes carrying a grudge because she replaced him in richmond and outdid him boyd took a swig of the warming soda hes only had the night spot in denver for three months the station manager in richmond claims jackson got pretty bent when they let him go tossed around some threats blamed cilia for undermining his position plus you add a serious drinking problem to the grudge you want to bring him in yeah i want to bring him in okay why dont we make it a doubleheader she picked up the file on nick peters this guy looks harmless but then ive dated harmlesslooking guys before and barely escaped with my skin he doesnt date at all she shrugged out of her turquoise linen jacket and draped it carefully over her chair back it turns out that deborah has a couple of classes with him over the weekend she mentioned that he pumps her for information on cilia all the time personal stuff what kind of flowers does she like whats her favorite color is she seeing anyone she reached in her skirt pocket and drew out a bag of jelly beans carefully and after much thought she selected a yellow one apparently he got upset when deborah mentioned that cilia had been married before deborah didnt think much of it at the time put it down to his being weird but she was worried enough to mention it over the weekend shes a nice kid althea put in real sharp shes totally devoted to cilia althea hesitated over the course of the weekend she told me about their parents weve already covered that ground i know we did althea picked up a pencil ran it through her fingers then set it aside again deborah seems to think youre good for her sister she waited until boyd looked up i just wonder if her sisters good for you i can take care of myself partner youre too involved boyd she lowered her voice though it couldnt have carried over the noise outside of the closed door if the captain knew you were hung up personally with an assignment hed yank you hed be right boyd kicked back in his chair he studied altheas face a face he knew as well as his own resentment simmered in him but he controlled it i can still do my job thea if i had any doubts about that id yank myself would you his eyes narrowed yeah i would my first priority is my assignments safety if you want to go to the captain thats your right but im going to take care of cilia one way or the other youre the one whos going to get hurt she murmured one way or the other my life my problem the anger shed hoped to control bubbled to the surface damn it boyd i care about you it was one thing when you were infatuated by her voice i didnt even see it as a problem when you met her and had a few sparks flying but now youre talking serious stuff like marriage and i know you mean it shes got trouble boyd she is trouble you and i are assigned to take care of the trouble shes got as for the rest its my business thea so save the advice fine irked she flipped open another file bob williams wild bob is so clean he squeaks i havent turned up a single connection with cilia other than the station he has a good marriage goes to church belongs to the jaycees and for the last two weeks has been accompanying his wife to lamaze classes nothings turned up on the morning guys boyd took another swallow of the soda and wished it was an icecold beer khips just one big happy family so it seems boyd mumbled harrison looks solid but im cilia he needed the bond and the promise that verbal connection three words he thought a simple phrase that came easily often too easily and could change the structure of peoples lives they wouldnt come easily to cilia if she ever pushed them through the selfdoubts the barrier of defense the fear of being hurt she would mean them with all of her heart it was all he needed boyd decided and he would never let her take them back for now he had to put aside his own wants and needs and be a cop to keep her safe he had to be what she feared most for her sake he couldnt afford to think too deeply about where their lives would go once he closed the files boyd althea poked her head back in the door jacksons on his way in good we should be able to catch peters before he checks in at the station i want to he broke off when the phone rang beside him fletcher he held up a hand to wave althea inside yeah i appreciate you checking into it for me he muffled the phone for a moment chicago pd thats right he continued into the receiver john mcgillis taking up a pencil he began making notes on a legal pad in midstroke he stopped fingers tightening when his oath was strong and quiet any family he leave a note can you fax it right on the legal pad he wrote in bold letters suicide in silence althea lowered a hip to the table anything you can get me youre sure he didnt have a brother no i appreciate it sergeant he hung up and tapped the pencil against the pad son of a bitch were sure its the same mcgillis althea asked yeah cilia gave me the information she had on him plus a physical description its the same guy he cashed himself in almost five months ago he let out a long breath slit his wrists with a hunting knife it fits boyd althea leaned over to check his notes you said mcgillis was obsessing on cilia that hed threatened to kill himself if she didnt respond the guy over the phone is blaming her for the death of his brother mcgillis didnt have a brother only child survived by his mother still checking hes the one who hired her and he actively pursued her offering her a hefty raise and some tidy benefits to persuade her to move to denver and khip althea meticulously chose a red jelly bean what about the mcgillis guy im expecting a call from chicago he opened another file theres the maintenance man billy lomus war veteran purple heart and a silver star in nam did two tours of duty before the leg mustered him out he seems to be a loner never stays in one place more than a year or so he did drop down in chicago for a while a couple years back no family no close friends settled in denver about four months ago foster homes as a kid althea didnt look up rough yeah boyd studied her bent head there werent many who knew that althea grayson had been shuffled from foster home to foster home as a child it doesnt look like were going to have much luck inside the station no maybe well do better with mcgillis she looked up face calm voice even only one who knew her well would have seen that she was still angry you want to start with jackson or peters jackson okay well try it the easy way first ill call and ask him to come in thanks thea he added before she could rise you have to be hit before you can understand i cant turn off my feelings and i cant turn back from what ive been trained to do she only sighed just watch your step partner he intended to and while he was watching his step he was going to watch cilias she wouldnt care for that boyd thought as he continued to study the files from the moment he had told her that he loved her shed been trying to pull back but she wasnt afraid of him he mused she was afraid of herself the deeper her feelings for him went the more afraid she became to acknowledge them odd but he hadnt known he would need the words yet he did more than anything he could remember he needed to have her look at him and tell him that she loved him a smile a touch a moan in the night it wasnt enough not with he was unharmed and to warn him she thought frantically she wouldnt couldnt lose someone else she loved with her hair still streaming wet she dashed down the stairs and yanked open the door she nearly ran over nick peters oh god her hands clutched at her chest nick im sorry with fumbling hands he pushed up his glasses i didnt mean to scare you i have to go she was already digging in her purse for her keys he called i have to get to boyd i have to warn him hold on nick picked up the keys which shed dropped on the stoop youre in no shape to drive ive got to get to boyd she said desperately gripping nick by his coat he said he would kill him youre all worked up about the cop nicks mouth thinned he looks like he can handle himself you dont understand she began yeah i understand i understand just fine you went away with him the note of accusation surprised her and unnerved her enough that she glanced toward the blackandwhite sitting at her curb then she shook herself it was foolish absolutely foolish to be afraid of nick nick im sorry but i dont have time to talk right now can we get into this later at the station i quit he bit off the words i quit this morning oh but why youre doing so well you have a future at khip you dont even know he said bitterly and you dont care but i do when she reached out to touch his arm he jerked back you let me make a fool of myself over you oh god not again she shook her head nick no you wouldnt even let me get close and then he comes along and its all over before you let it begin now they want me to come down to the police station they want to question me his lips trembled they think im the one whos been calling you there has to be a mistake how could you he shouted how could you believe id want to hurt you he dropped the keys back into her hand i just came brother could be an emotional term a best friend maybe he knew it fit what worried him was how cilia would react the chicago police are cooperating theyre sending us what information theyve got but i think it might be worth a trip east we might get a lead from the mother althea nodded are you going to tell cilia yeah im going to tell her well talk to jackson and peters first see if we can make a connection to mcgillis across town cilia dashed from the shower to the phone she wanted it to be boyd she wanted him to tell her that hed found john mcgillis happily stocking shelves in chicago with her hair dripping down her back she snatched up the phone hello did you sleep with him did you let him touch you her damp hands shook as she gripped the receiver what do you want did you make promises to him the way you made promises to my brother does he know youre a whore and a murderer no im not i dont know why hell have to die too her blood froze the fear she thought shed come to understand clawed viciously at her throat no boyd has nothing to do with this its its between you and me just as youve said all along hes involved now he made his choice like you made yours when you killed my brother when im finished with him im coming for you do you remember what im going to do to you do you remember you dont have to hurt boyd please please ill do anything you want yes you will there was laughter too long eerily lilting youll do anything please dont hurt him she continued to shout into the phone long after the connection went dead with a sob tearing at her throat she slammed the receiver down and raced to the bedroom to dress she had to talk to boyd to see him facetoface to make certain by to let you know id quit so you dont have to worry about me bothering you again nick please wait but he was already striding off to his car he didnt look back because her knees were weak cilia lowered herself to the stoop she needed a moment she realized a moment to steady herself before she got behind the wheel of a car how could she have been so stupid so blind that she couldnt see that nicks pride and ego were on the line now she had hurt him simply by being unaware somehow she had to straighten out this mess her life had become then she had to start making amends steadier she rose carefully locked the door then walked to her car she hated police stations had from the first fingering her plastic visitors badge she walked down the corridor it had been scrubbed recently and she caught the scent of pine cleaner over the everpresent aroma of coffee phones rang an incessant strident whirl of sound punctuated by voices raised to a shout or lowered to a grumble cilia turned into a doorway to the heart of the noise and scanned the room it was different from the cramped quarters where her mother had worked and died there was more space less grime and there was the addition of several computer work stations the clicketyclack of keyboards was an underlying rhythm there were men and women jackets off shirts limp with sweat though it was a windy fiftyfive outside on a nearby bench a woman rocked a fretful baby while a cop tried to distract it by jiggling a pair of handcuffs across the room a young girl surely just a teenager related information to a trim woman cop in jeans and a sweatshirt silent tears coursed down the girls face and cilia remembered she remembered sitting in a corner of a squad room smaller hotter dingier than the one she stood in now she had been five or six and the babysitter had canceled because shed been suffering from stomach flu cilias mother had taken her to work something about a report that couldnt wait to be written so cilia had sat in a corner with a doll and a dr seuss book listening to the phones and the voices and waiting for her mother to take her home there had been a water cooler she remembered and a ceiling fan she had watched the bubbles glug in the water and the blades whirl sluggishly for hours her mother had forgotten her until suffering from the same bug as her sitter cilia had lost her breakfast all over the squad room floor shaky cilia wiped a hand over her damp brow it was an old memory she reminded herself and not all of it after she had been sick her mother had cleaned her up held her taken her home and pampered her for the rest of the day it wasnt fair to anyone to remember only the unhappy side but as she stood there she could feel all too clearly the dragging nausea the cold sweat and the misery of being alone and forgotten then she saw him stepping from another room his tshirt was damp down the front jackson was behind him his hat in place his face sheened with sweat and nerves flanking him was althea jackson saw her first he took a hesitant step toward her then stopped and shrugged cilia didnt hesitate she walked to him to take his hand in both of hers you okay sure jackson shrugged again but his fingers held tight on hers we just had to clear some things up no big deal im sorry look if you need to talk you can wait for me no im okay really he lifted a hand to adjust his cap i guess if you screw up once youve got to keep paying for it oh jim hey im handling it he gave her a quick smile ill catch you tonight sure we appreciate your cooperation mr jackson althea put in i told you anything i can do to help cilia ill do i owe you he said to cilia cutting her off before she could shake her head i owe you he repeated then crossed the room into the corridor i could have told you that you were wasting your time with him cilia stated boyd only nodded you could have told us a lot of things maybe she turned back to him i need to talk to you both of you all right boyd gestured toward the conference room its a little quieter in here you want something cold althea began before they settled i think theyve finally fixed the furnace but its still like an oven in here no thanks this wont take long she sat althea across from her boyd at the tables head she wanted to choose her words carefully can i ask why you brought jackson in you worked together in richmond boyd shoved a file aside he had a drinking problem that got him fired and you took over his job he wasnt too happy about it at the time no he wasnt why didnt you tell us about it cilia i didnt think of it she lifted a hand i honestly didnt think of it it was a long time ago and jacksons come a long way im sure he told you hes been in aa for over three years he made a point of coming to see me when i was doing my run in chicago he wanted me to know he didnt blame me for what had happened hes been putting his life back together you got him the job at khip boyd added i put in a good word for him she said i dont do the hiring he was a friend he needed a break when hes sober jacksons one of the best and he wouldnt hurt a fly and when hes drunk he breaks up bars threatens women and drives his car into telephone poles that was a long time ago cilia said struggling for calm and the point is he is sober there are some things you have to forgive and forget yes he watched her carefully there are she thought of her mother again and of that painful memory of the squad room actually i didnt come here to talk to you about jackson i got another call at home we know altheas voice was brisk and professional they relayed the information to us here then you know what he said finding altheas cool gaze unsympathetic cilia turned to boyd he wants to hurt you now he knows youre involved with me and hes dragged you into whatever sick plans he has they traced the call to another phone booth just a couple of blocks from your house boyd began didnt you hear me cilia slapped a fist on the table pencils jumped hes going to try to kill you too he didnt reach for her hand to soothe her at the moment he thought she needed him more professionally than personally since im protecting you he would have had to try all along nothings changed everythings changed she burst out it doesnt matter to him if youre with the police or not it only matters that youre with me i want you off the case i want you reassigned i dont want you anywhere near me until this is over boyd crushed a disposable cup in his hand and tossed it in a wastebasket dont be ridiculous im not being ridiculous im being practical she turned to althea her eyes full of pleas talk to him hell listen to you im sorry she said after a moment i agree with him we both have a job to do and at the moment youre it desperate cilia whipped back to boyd ill go to your captain myself he already knows about the call she sprang up ill tell him im sleeping with you sit down cilia ill insist he take you off the case sit down boyd repeated his voice was still mild but this time she relented and dropped back in her chair you can go to the captain and request another officer you can demand one it wont make any difference if he takes me off the case ill just turn in my badge her head snapped up at that i dont believe you try me he was too calm cilia realized and too determined like a brick wall she thought in despair going headtohead with him when he was like this was futile boyd dont you realize i couldnt handle it if anything happened to you yes he said slowly i think i do then you should realize im just as vulnerable where youre concerned thats the whole point she broke down enough to take his hands you are vulnerable listen to me desperate she pulled his hand to her cheek for eight years ive wondered if it had been anyone else in the room with my mother that day anyone else but my father would she have been sharper would she have been quicker would her concentration have been more focused dont make me have to ask that same question about you for the rest of my life your mother wasnt prepared i am nothing i say is going to change your mind no i love you cilia one day soon youre going to have to learn to accept that in the meantime youre going to have to trust me she took her hand away to drop it into her lap then theres nothing more to say theres this he pulled a file closer she was already upset he mused already on edge but they couldnt afford to wait john mcgillis her head aching cilia pressed the heels of her hands to her eyes what about him hes dead slowly she lowered her hands dead she repeated dully but he was just a kid are you sure are you sure its the same one yes the man wished he could spare her this the cop knew he couldnt he committed suicide about five months ago for a moment she only stared the blood drained out of her face inch by inch until it was bone white oh god oh dear god he he threatened but i didnt believe he was unstable cilia hed been in and out of therapy since he was fourteen trouble with his mother in school with his contemporaries hed already attempted suicide twice before but he was so quiet he tried so hard to make me she stopped squeezing her eyes shut he killed himself after i left chicago to come here just as he said he would he was disturbed althea said gently deeply disturbed a year before he contacted you he was involved with a girl when she broke things off he swallowed a fistful of barbiturates he was in a clinic for a while hed only been out for a few weeks when he made the connection with you i was cruel to him cilia turned her purse over and over on her lap really cruel at the time i thought it was the best way to handle it i thought he would be hurt maybe hate me for a little while then find some nice girl and but he wont im not going to tell you it wasnt your fault because youre smart enough to know that yourself boyds voice was deliberately devoid of sympathy what mcgillis did he did to himself you were just an excuse she gave a quick involuntary shudder its not as easy for me i dont live with death the way you do its never easy not for anyone he opened the file but there are priorities here and mine is to make the connection between mcgillis and the man were after you really think johns the reason im being threatened its the only thing that fits now i want you to tell us everything you remember about him she released her death grip on the bag then carefully folded her hands on the table as clearly as possible she repeated everything shed already told him did you ever see him with anyone boyd asked did he ever talk about his friends his family he was always alone like i told you he used to call the station i didnt meet him facetoface for weeks after i did all he really talked about was the way he felt about me the way he wanted us to be together her fingers twisted together he used to send me notes and flowers little presents it isnt that unusual for a fan to develop a kind of fantasy relationship with a jock but then i began to see that it wasnt she cleared her throat it wasnt the normal kind of weird if you know what i mean boyd nodded and continued to write on the pad go on the notes became more personal not sexual so much as emotional the only time he got out of hand was when he showed me his tattoo he had these knives tattooed on his chest it seemed so out of character for him and i told him i thought it was foolish for him to mark up his body that way we were out in the parking lot i was tired and annoyed and here was this kid pulling open his shirt to show me this stupid tattoo he was upset that i didnt like it angry really it was the only time i saw him angry he said that if it was good enough for his brother it was good enough for him his brother boyd repeated thats right he didnt have a brother she stopped twisting her fingers yes he did he mentioned him a couple of times by name no she hesitated tried to think no she repeated more certain now he just mentioned that his brother was living out in california he hadnt seen him for a couple of months he wanted me to meet him stuff like that he didnt have a brother althea turned the file around to skim the top sheet again he was an only child cilia shook her head so he made it up no boyd sat back studying his partner and cilia in turn i dont think the man were after is a figment of john mcgilliss imagination chapter contents prev next her head was pounding in a dull steady rhythm that made her ears ring it was too much to absorb all at once the phone call nicks visit the reminders at the station house john mcgilliss suicide for the first time in her life cilia was tempted to shut herself in her room lock the door and escape into a drugged sleep she wanted peace a few hours of peace without guilt without dreams without fears no she realized more than that much more than that she wanted control over her life again shed taken that control for granted once but she would never do so again she could think of nothing to say to boyd as he followed her into the house she was much too tired to argue particularly since she knew the argument would be futile on her side he wouldnt take himself off the case he wouldnt believe her when she told him they could have no future he refused to understand that in both instances she was looking out for his best interests going to the kitchen she went directly to the cupboard above the sink from a bottle she shook out three extrastrength aspirin boyd watched her fill a glass from the tap and swallow the pills her movements were automatic and just a little jerky as she rinsed the glass she stared out the window at the backyard there were daffodils their yellow blooms still secreted in the protective green along the low fence they sprang up like slender spears promising spring she hadnt known they were there when shed bought the house she wished they were blooming now so that she could see those cheerful yellow trumpets waving in the breeze how bad could life be if you could look through your own window and see flowers blooming have you eaten he asked her i dont remember she folded her arms and looked out at the trees there was the faintest hint of green along the branches you had to look hard to see it she wondered how long it would take for the leaves to unfurl and make shade but im not hungry theres probably something around if you are how about a nap he brought his hands to her shoulders and massaged them gently i couldnt sleep yet on a quiet sigh she lifted a hand up to lay it over his in a few weeks ill have to cut the grass i think ill like that ive never had a lawn to mow before can i come over and watch she smiled as hed wanted her to i love it here she murmured not just the house though it means a lot to stand here just here and look out at something that belongs to me its this place i havent really felt at home anywhere since i left georgia it wasnt even something i realized until i came here and felt at home again sometimes you find what you want without looking he was talking of love she knew but she was afraid to speak of it some days the sky is so blue that it hurts your eyes if youre downtown on one of those days when the wind has swept through and cleared everything the buildings look painted against the sky and you can see the mountains you can stand on the corner in the middle of rush hour and see the mountains i want to belong here he turned her to him you do i never really believed that things could last but i was beginning to before this im not sure i can belong here or anywhere until i can stop being afraid boyd she lifted her hands to his face intense she studied him as if to memorize every plane every angle im not just talking about belonging to a place but to a person i care for you more than ive cared for anyone in my life but deborah and i know thats not enough youre wrong he touched his lips to hers its exactly enough she gave him a quick frustrated shake of her head you just wont listen wrong again i listen cilia i just dont always agree with what you say you dont have to agree you just have to accept tell you what when this is over you and i will have a nice long talk about what we both have to accept when this is over you might be dead on impulse she gripped him harder do you really want to marry me you know i do if i said id marry you would you take yourself off the case would you let someone else take over and go up to your cabin until its done he struggled against a bitter anger you should know better than to try to bribe a public servant im not joking no his eyes hardened i wish you were ill marry you and ill do my best to make you happy if you do this one thing for me he set her aside and stepped back no deal oroarke damn it boyd he jammed his hands into his pockets before he exploded do you think this is some kind of tradeoff what you want for what i want damn you were talking about marriage its an emotional commitment and a legal contract not a bartering tool whats next he demanded i give up my job and you agree to have my child shock and shame robbed her of speech she held up both hands palms out im sorry im sorry she managed i didnt mean for it to sound like that i just keep thinking of what he said today how he said it and i can imagine what it would be like if you werent here she shut her eyes it would be worse than dying i am here he reached for her again and im going to stay here nothings going to happen to either of us she pulled him close pressed her face to his throat dont be angry i just havent got a good fight in me right now he relented and lifted a hand to her hair well save it for later then she didnt want to think about later only now come upstairs she whispered make love with me hand in hand they walked through the empty house up the stairs in the bedroom she closed the door then locked it the gesture was a symbol of her need to lock out everything but him for this one moment in time the sun came strong through the windows but she felt no need for dim lights or shadows there would be no secrets between them here with her eyes on his she began to unbutton her shirt only days before she thought she would have been afraid of this afraid she would make the wrong move say the wrong word offer too much or not enough he had already shown her that she had only to hold out a hand and be willing to share they undressed in silence not yet touching did he sense her mood she wondered or did she sense his all she knew was that she wanted to look to absorb the sight of him there was the way the light streamed through the window and over his hair the way his eyes darkened as they skimmed over her she wanted to savor the line of his body the ridges of muscle the smooth taut skin could she have any idea how exciting she was he wondered standing in the center of the room her clothes pooled at her feet her skin already flushed with anticipation her eyes clouded and aware he waited though he wanted to touch her so badly his fingers felt singed he waited she came to him her arms lifted her lips parted slim soft seductive she pressed against him still he waited his name was a quiet sigh as she brought her mouth to his home the thought stirred inside her a trembling wish he was home to her the strength of his arms the tenderness of his hands the unstinting generosity of his heart tears burned the backs of her lids as she lost herself in the kiss he felt the change the slow and subtle yielding it aroused unbearably strong she was like a flame smoldering and snapping with life and passion in surrender she was like a drug that seeped silently into his blood lured by lost in her total submission he lowered her to the bed her body was his and so for the first time he felt was her mind and her heart he was careful to treat each gently so sweet she thought dreamily so lovely the patient stroke of his fingers the featherbrush of his lips turned the bright afternoon into the rich secrets of midnight now that she knew where he could take her she craved the journey all the more no dark thoughts no nagging fears like flowers on the verge of blooming she wanted to celebrate life the simplicity of being alive and capable of love he aroused her thoroughly thoughtfully torturously her answering touch and her answering kiss were just as generous what she murmured to him were not demands but promises she desperately wanted to keep they knelt together in the center of the bed lips curved as they touched bodies almost painfully in tune her hair flowed through his fingers his skin quivered at her light caress soft quiet sighs hearttoheart they lowered again mouth teased mouth their eyes were open when he slid into her joined they held close absorbing a fresh riot of sensation when they moved they moved together with equal wonder the booth seemed like another world cilia sat at the console studying the controls she knew so well both her mind and body were sluggish the clearsighted control she had felt for a short time with boyd that afternoon had vanished she wanted only for the night to be over he had mentioned going to chicago the next day she intended to encourage him if she couldnt convince him to be reassigned at least she would have the satisfaction of knowing he would be miles away for a day or two away from her and safe she thought he whoever he was was closing in she could feel it when he struck she wanted boyd far away if this man was determined to punish her for what had happened to john mcgillis she would deal with it boyd had been right to a point she didnt blame herself for johns suicide but she did share in the responsibility and she couldnt keep herself from grieving for a young wasted life the police would protect her she thought as she cued up the next song and she would protect herself the new fear the grinding fear came from the fact that she didnt know how to protect boyd youre asleep at the switch boyd commented she shook herself no just resting between bouts she glanced at the clock it was nearly midnight nearly time for the request line once again the station was locked there was only the two of them youre nearly halfway home he pointed out look why dont you come back to my place tonight we can listen to my muddy waters records she decided to play dumb because she knew it amused him who come on oroarke it helped a great deal to see him grin at her it made everything seem almost normal okay ill listen to muddy whatsis waters right if you can answer these three music trivia questions shoot hold on she set the next record did a quick intro she ruffled through her papers okay youve got threeten to come up with them number one what was the first british rock group to tour the states ah a trick question the dave clark five the beatles were the second not bad for an amateur number two who was the last performer at woodstock jimi hendrix youll have to do

just answer the question slick fiftysix is that yeah thats too bad it was you lose i want to look it up go ahead now youll have to come back to my place and listen to a rolling stones retrospective she yawned hugely if you stay awake that long it pleased him that she had taken a moment out to play want some coffee she shot him a grateful look only as much as i want to breathe ill get it the station was empty he thought since nick peters had gotten his ego bruised and quit there had been no one around to brew that last pot of the evening he too glanced at the clock he wanted to have it done and be back beside her before the phones started to ring hed grab her a doughnut while he was at it boyd decided as he checked the corridor automatically a little sugar would help her get through the night before going to the lounge he moved to the front of the building to check the doors the locks were in place and the alarm was engaged his car was alone on the lot satisfied he walked through the building and gave the same careful check to the rear delivery doors before he turned into the lounge it wasnt going to go on much longer with the mcgillis lead boyd had every confidence they would tie someone to the threats in a matter of days it would be good to see cilia without those traces of fear in her eyes that tension in the set of her shoulders the restlessness would remain he thought and the energy they were as much a part of her as the color of her hair he added an extra scoop of coffee to the pot and listened to her voice over the speaker as she segued from one record to the next that magic voice he thought hed had no idea when he first heard it when he was first affected by it that he would fall in love with the woman behind it it was joan jett now blasting out i love rock and roll though the lounge speaker was turned down to little more than a murmur the feeling gritted out it should be cilias theme song he mused though hed learned in their two days in his cabin that she was just as easily fascinated by the likes of patsy cline or ella fitzgerald what they needed was a good solid week in the mountains he decided without any outside tensions to interfere he took an appreciative sniff of the coffee as it began to brew and hoped that he could get to chicago find the answers he needed and make the trip back quickly he whirled disturbed by some slight sound in the corridor a rustle a creak of a board his hand was already on the butt of his weapon drawing it turning his back to the side wall he took three careful strides to the doorway scanning getting jumpy he told himself when he saw nothing but the empty halls and the glare of security lights but instinct had him keeping the gun in his hand hed taken the next step when the lights went out cursing under his breath he moved fast though he held his weapon up for safety he was prepared to use it above from the speakers the passionate music continued to throb up ahead he could see the faint glow of lights from the booth she was there he told himself safe in those lights keeping his back to the wall skimming his gaze up and down the darkened hallway he moved toward her as he rounded the last turn in the hallway before the booth he heard something behind him he saw the storeroom door swing open as he whirled but he never saw the knife that was joan jett and the blackhearts coming at you its denver and a balmy fortytwo degrees cilia frowned at the clock and wondered why boyd was taking so long a little reminder that you can catch khips own wild bob tomorrow at the brown palace hotel downtown on th and hey if youve never been there its a very classy place tickets are still available for the banquet benefiting abused children so open your wallets its twenty dollars stag forty if you take your sweetie the festivities start at seven oclock and wild bob will be spinning those discs for you she potted up the next song now get ready for a doubleheader to take you to midnight this is cilia oroarke weve got the news then the request line coming up she switched off her mike shrugging her shoulders to loosen them she slipped off the headphones she was humming to herself as she checked the program directors hot clock a canned ad was next then shed seg into the news at the top of the hour she pushed away from the console to set up for the next segment it was then that she saw that the corridor beyond the glass door was dark at first she only stared baffled then the blood rushed to her head if the security lights were out the alarm might be out as well he was here sweat pearled cold on her brow as she gripped the back of her chair there would be no call tonight because he was here he was coming for her a scream rose in her throat to drown in a flood of panic boyd he had also come for boyd propelled by a new terror she hit the door at a run boyd she shouted for him stumbling in the dark her forward motion stopped when she saw the shadow move toward her though it was only a shape formless in the darkened corridor she knew groping behind her she stepped back wheres boyd what have you done with him she stepped back again the lights from the booth slanted through the glass and split the dark in two she started to speak again to beg then nearly fainted with relief oh god its you i didnt know you were here i thought everyone iliad left everyones gone he answered he moved fully into the light and smiled cilias relief iced over he held a knife a longbladed hunting knife already stained with blood boyd she said again he cant help you now no one can were all alone ive waited a long time for us to be alone why she was beyond fear now it was boyds blood on the blade and grief left no room for fear why billy you killed my brother no no i didnt she stepped back into the booth hot hysteria bubbled in her throat a cold chill sheened her skin i didnt kill john i hardly knew him he loved you he limped forward the knife in front of him his eyes on hers his feet were bare he wore only camouflage pants and a dark stocking cap pulled low over his graying hair and brows though he had smeared his face and chest and arms with black she could see the tattoo over his heart the twin to the one she had seen over john mcgilliss you were going to marry him he told me he misunderstood she let out a quick gasp as he jabbed with the knife her chair toppled with a crash as she fell back against the console dont lie to me you bitch he told me everything how you told him you loved him and wanted him his voice lowered wavered whispered like the voice over the phone and had her numbed heart racing how you seduced him he was so young he didnt understand about women like you but i do i would have protected him i always protected him he was good billy wiped his eyes with the hand holding the knife then drew a gun out of his pocket too good for you he fired ramming a bullet into the board above the controls cilia pressed both hands to her mouth to hold back a scream he told me how you lied how you cheated how you flaunted yourself i never wanted to hurt john she had to stay calm boyd wasnt dead she wouldnt believe he was dead but he was hurt somehow she had to get help bracing herself on the console she reached slowly behind her and opened her mike all the while keeping her eyes on his face i swear billy i never wanted to hurt your brother liar he shouted lifting the knife to her throat she arched back struggling to control her shuddering you dont care about him you never cared you just used him women like you love to use i liked him she sucked in her breath as the knife nicked her throat blood trickled warm along her skin he was a nice boy he he loved you i loved him the knife trembled in his hand but he pulled it back an inch cilia let out a long quiet breath he was the only person i ever loved who ever loved me i took care of him i know she moistened her dry lips surely someone would come someone was listening she didnt dare take her eyes from his to glance around to the phone where the lights were blinking madly he was only five when they sent me to that house i would have hated it there like id hated all the other places theyd sent me but john lived there he looked up to me he cared he needed me so i stayed until i was eighteen it was only a year and a half but we were brothers yes i joined the army when id have leave hed sneak out to see me his pig of a mother didnt want him to have anything to do with me cause id gotten in some trouble he fired again randomly and shattered the glass in the top of the door but i liked the army i liked it fine and john liked my uniform his eyes glazed over a moment as he remembered they sent us to nam messed up my leg messed up my life when we came back people wanted to hate us but not john he was proud of me no one else had ever been proud of me i know they tried to put him away twice again he squeezed the trigger a bullet plowed into the reeltoreel six inches from cilias head sweaty fear dried to ice on her skin they didnt understand him i went to california i was going to find us a nice place there i just needed to find work john was going to write poetry then he met you the glaze melted away from his eyes burned away by hate he didnt want to come to california anymore he didnt want to leave you he wrote me letters about you long letters once he called he shouldnt have spent his money but he called all the way to california to tell me he was getting married you wanted to get married at christmas so he was going to wait i was coming back for it because he wanted me there she could only shake her head i never agreed to marry him killing me isnt going to change that she said when he leveled the gun at her youre right he didnt understand me and i guess i didnt understand him he was young he imagined i was something i wasnt billy im sorry terribly sorry but i didnt cause his death you killed him he ran the flat of the blade down her cheek and youre going to pay i cant stop you i wont even try but please tell me what youve done with boyd i killed him he smiled a sweet vacant smile that made the weapons he carried incongruous i dont believe you hes dead still smiling he held the knife up to the light it was easy easier than i remembered i was quick he assured her i wanted him dead but i didnt care if he suffered not like you youre going to suffer i told you remember i told you what i was going to do if youve killed boyd she whispered youve already killed me i want you to beg he laid the knife against her throat again i want you to beg the way john begged i dont care what you do to me she couldnt feel the knife against her flesh she couldnt feel anything from a long way off came the wail of sirens she heard them without emotion without hope they were coming but they were coming too late she looked into billys eyes she understood that kind of pain she realized it came when the person who meant the most was taken from you im sorry she said prepared to die i didnt love him on a howl of rage he struck her a stunning blow against the temple with the knife handle he had planned and waited for weeks he wouldnt kill her quickly mercifully he wouldnt he wanted her on her knees crying and screaming for her life she landed in a heap driven down by the explosive pain she would have wept then with her hands covering her face and her body limp not for herself but for what she had lost they both turned as boyd staggered to the doorway seconds it took only seconds her vision cleared her heart almost burst alive he was alive her sob of relief turned to a scream of terror as she saw billy raise the gun then she was on her feet struggling with him records crashed to the floor and were crushed underfoot as they rammed into a shelf his eyes burned into hers she did beg she pleaded even as she fought him boyd dropped to his knees the gun nearly slipped out of his slickened fingers through a pale red mist he could see them he tried to shout at her but he couldnt drag his voice through his throat he could only pray as he struggled to maintain a grip on consciousness and the gun he saw the knife come up start its vicious downward sweep he fired she didnt hear the crashing glass or the clamor of feet she didnt even hear the report as the bullet struck home but she felt the jerk of his body as the knife flew out of his hand she lost her grip on him as he slammed back into the console wildeyed she whirled she saw boyd swaying on his knees the gun held in both hands behind him was althea her weapon still trained on the figure sprawled on the floor on a strangled cry cilia rushed over as boyd fell no she was weeping as she brushed the hair from his eyes as she ran a hand down his side and felt the blood please no she covered his body with hers youve got to move back althea bit down on panic as she urged cilia aside hes bleeding i know and badly she thought very badly theres an ambulance coming cilia stripped off her shirt to make a pressure bandage kneeling in her chemise she bent over boyd im not going to let him die altheas eyes met hers that makes two of us chapter contents prev next there had been a sea of faces they seemed to swim inside cilias head as she paced the hospital waiting room it was so quiet there quiet enough to hear the swish of crepesoled shoes on tile or the whoosh of the elevator doors opening closing yet in her head she could still hear the chaos of sirens voices the crackle of static on the police cruisers that had nosed together in the stations parking lot the paramedics had come hands had pulled her away from boyd pulled her out of the booth and into the cool fresh night mark she remembered it was mark who had held her back as shed run the gamut from hysteria to shock jackson had been there steady as a rock pushing a cup of some hot liquid into her hand and nick whitefaced mumbling assurances and apologies there had been strangers dozens of them who had heard the confrontation over their radios they had crowded in until the uniformed police set up a barricade then deborah had been there racing across the lot in tears shoving aside cops reporters gawkers to get to her sister it was deborah who had discovered that some of the blood on cilia was her own now dully cilia looked down at her bandaged hand she hadnt felt the knife slice into it during the few frantic seconds she had fought with billy the scratch along her throat where the blade had nicked her was more painful shallow wounds she thought they were only shallow wounds nothing compared to the deep gash in her heart she could still see how boyd had looked when they had wheeled him out to the ambulance for one horrible moment shed been afraid he was dead so white so still but he was alive althea had told her hed lost a lot of blood but he was alive now he was in surgery fighting to stay that way and she could only wait althea watched her pace for herself she preferred to sit to gather her resources and hold steady she had her own visions to contend with the jolt when cilias voice had broken into the music the race from the precinct to the radio station the sight of her partner kneeling on the floor struggling to hold his weapon he had fired only an instant before her shed been too late she would have to live with that now her partner her friend her family was lying on an operating table and she was helpless rising deborah walked across the room to put an arm around her sister cilia stopped pacing long enough to stare out the window why dont you lie down deborah suggested no i cant you dont have to sleep you could just stretch out on the couch over there cilia shook her head so many things are going through my mind you know the way hed just sit there and grin after hed gotten me mad how hed settle down in the corner of the booth with a book the calm way hed boss me around i spent most of my time trying to push him away but i didnt push hard enough and now hes you cant blame yourself for this i dont know who to blame she looked up at the clock how could the minutes go by so slowly i cant really think about that now the cause isnt nearly as important as the effect he wouldnt want you to take this on cilia she nearly smiled i havent made a habit of doing what he wanted he saved my life deb how can i stand it if the price of that is his there seemed to be no comfort she could offer if you wont lie down how about some coffee sure thanks she crossed to a pot of stale coffee resting on a hot plate when althea joined her deborah poured a second cup hows she holding up althea asked by a thread deborah rubbed her gritty eyes before she turned to althea shes blaming herself studying althea she offered the coffee do you blame her too althea hesitated bringing the coffee to her lips first shed long since stopped tasting it she looked over to the woman still standing by the window cilia wore baggy jeans and mark harrisons tailored jacket she wanted to blame cilia she realized she wanted to blame her for involving boyd past the point of wisdom she wanted to blame her for being the catalyst that had set an already disturbed mind on the bloody path of revenge but she couldnt neither as a cop nor as a woman no she said with a sigh i dont blame her shes only one of the victims here maybe you could tell her that deborah passed the second cup to althea maybe thats what she needs to hear it wasnt easy to approach cilia they hadnt spoken since they had come to the waiting room in some strange way althea realized they were rivals they both loved the same man in different ways perhaps and certainly on different levels but the emotions were deep on both sides it occurred to her that if there had been no emotion on cilias part there would have been no resentment on hers if she had remained an assignment and only an assignment althea would never have felt the need to cast blame it seemed boyd had not been the only one to lose his objectivity she stopped beside cilia stared at the same view of the dark studded with city lights coffee thanks cilia accepted the cup but didnt drink theyre taking a long time it shouldnt be much longer cilia drew in a breath and her courage you saw the wound do you think hell make it i dont know she almost said it they both knew shed thought it im counting on it you told me once he was a good man you were right for a long time i was afraid to see that but you were right she turned to face althea directly i dont expect you to believe me but i would have done anything to keep him from being hurt i do believe you and you did what you could before cilia could turn away again althea put a hand on her arm opening your mike may have saved his life i want you to think about that with a wound as serious as boyds every second counted with the broadcast you gave us a fix on the situation so there was an ambulance on the scene almost as quickly as we were if boyd makes it its partially due to your presence of mind i want you to think about that billy only went after him because of me i have to think about that as well youre trying to logic out an irrational situation it wont work the sympathy vanished from her voice if you want to start passing out blame how about john mcgillis it was his fantasy that lit the fuse how about the system that allowed someone like billy lomus to bounce from foster home to foster home so that he never knew what it was like to feel loved or wanted by anyone but a young troubled boy you could blame mark for not checking billys references closely enough or boyd and me for not making the connection quicker theres plenty of blame to pass around cilia were all just going to have to live with our share it doesnt really matter does it no matter whos at fault its still boyds life on the line detective grayson althea snapped to attention the doctor who entered was still in surgical greens damped down the front with sweat she tried to judge his eyes first they were a clear and quiet gray and told her nothing im grayson his brow lifted slightly it wasnt often you met a police detective who looked as though she belonged on the cover of vogue dr winthrop chief of surgery you operated on boyd boyd fletcher thats right hes your partner yes without conscious thought on either side althea and cilia clasped hands can you tell us how he is i can tell you hes a lucky man winthrop said if the knife had gone a few inches either way he wouldnt have had a chance as it is hes still critical but the prognosis is good hes alive cilia finally managed to force the words out yes winthrop turned to her im sorry are you a relative no i no miss oroarke is the first person boyd will want to see when he wakes up althea gave cilias hand a quick squeeze his familys been notified but they were in europe and wont be here for several hours yet i see hell be done in recovery shortly then well transfer him to icu oroarke he said suddenly of course my sons a big fan he lifted her bandaged hand gently ive already heard the story if you were my patient youd be sedated and in bed im fine frowning he studied her pupils to put it in unprofessional terms not by a long shot his gaze skimmed down the long scratch on her throat youve had a bad shock miss oroarke is there someone who can drive you home im not going home until i see boyd five minutes once hes settled in icu only five i can guarantee he wont be awake for at least eight hours thank you if he thought she would settle for five minutes he was very much mistaken someone will come by to let you know when you can go down he walked out rubbing the small of his back and thinking about a hot meal i need to call the captain it infuriated althea that she was close to tears id appreciate it if youd come back for me after youve seen him id like a moment with him myself yes of course thea letting her emotions rule cilia wrapped her arms around althea the tears didnt seem to matter nor did pride they clung together and held on to hope they didnt speak they didnt have to when they separated althea walked away to call her captain cilia turned blindly to the window hes going to be okay deborah murmured beside her i know she closed her eyes she did know the dull edge of fear was gone i just need to see him deb i need to see him for myself have you told him you love him she shook her head now might be a good time i was afraid i wouldnt get the chance and now i dont know only a fool would turn her back on something so special or a coward cilia pressed her fingers to her lips tonight all night ive been half out of my mind thinking he might die line of duty she turned to face her sister in the line of duty deborah if i let myself go if i dont turn my back how many other times might i stand here wondering if hell live or die cilia or open the door one day and have his captain standing there waiting to tell me that he was already gone the way moms captain came to the door that day you cant live your life waiting for the worst cilia you have to live it hoping for the best im not sure i can weary she dragged her hands through her hair im not sure of anything right now except that hes alive miss oroarke both cilia and deborah turned toward the nurse dr winthrop said to bring you to icu thank you her heart hammered in her ears as she followed the nurse toward the corridor her mouth was dry and her palms were damp she tried to ignore the machines and monitors as they passed through the double doors into intensive care she wanted to concentrate on boyd he was still so white his face was as colorless as the sheet that covered him the machines blipped and hummed a good sound she tried to tell herself it meant he was alive only resting tentatively she reached out to brush at his hair it was so warm and soft as was his skin when she traced the back of her knuckles over his cheek its all over now she said quietly all you have to do is rest and get better desperate for the contact she took his limp hand in hers then pressed it to her lips im going to stay as close as theyll let me i promise it wasnt enough not nearly enough she brushed her lips over his hair his cheek his mouth ill be here when you wake up she kept her word despite deborahs arguments she spent the rest of the night on the couch in the waiting room every hour they allowed her five minutes with him every hour she woke and took what she was given he didnt stir dawn broke shedding pale rosy light through the window the shifts changed cilia sipped coffee and watched the night staff leave for home new sounds began the clatter of the rolling tray as breakfast was served bright morning voices replaced the hushed tones of night checking her watch she set the coffee aside and walked out to sit on a bench near the doors of icu it was almost time for her hourly visit while she waited to be cleared a group of three hurried down the hall the man was tall with a shock of gray hair and a lean almost cadaverous face beside him was a trim woman her blond hair ruffled her suit wrinkled they were clutching hands walking with them was another woman the daughter cilia thought with dazed weariness she had her fathers build and her mothers face there was panic in her eyes even through the fatigue cilia saw it and recognized it beautiful eyes dark green just like boyds boyd fletcher the younger woman said to the nurse were his family they told us we could see him the nurse checked her list ill take you only two at a time please you go boyds sister turned to her parents ill wait right here cilia wanted to speak but as the woman sat on the opposite end of the bench she could only sit clutching her hands together what could she say to them to any of them even as she searched for words boyds sister leaned back against the wall and shut her eyes ten minutes later the fletchers came out again there were lines of strain around the womans eyes but they were dry her hand was still gripping her husbands natalie she touched her daughters shoulder hes awake groggy but awake he recognized us she beamed a smile at her husband he wanted to know what the hell we were doing here when we were supposed to be in paris her eyes filled then and she groped impatiently for a handkerchief the doctors looking at him now but you can see him in a few minutes natalie slipped an arm around her mothers waist then her fathers so what were we worried about i still want to know exactly what happened boyds father shot a grim look at the double doors boyds captain has some explaining to do well get the whole story his wife said soothingly lets just take a few minutes to be grateful it wasnt worse she dropped the handkerchief back in her purse when he was coming around he asked for someone named cilia thats not his partners name i dont believe we know a cilia though her legs had turned to jelly cilia rose im cilia three pairs of eyes fixed on her im sorry she managed boyd was he was hurt because he was protecting me im sorry she said again excuse me the nurse stood by the double doors again detective fletcher insists on seeing you miss oroarke hes becoming agitated ill go with you taking charge natalie steered cilia through the doors boyds eyes were closed again but he wasnt asleep he was concentrating on reviving the strength hed lost in arguing with the doctor but he knew the moment she entered the room even before she laid a tentative hand on his he opened his eyes and looked at her hi slick she made herself smile hows it going youre okay he hadnt been sure the last clear memory was of billy holding the knife and cilia struggling im fine deliberately she put her bandaged hand behind her back natalie noted the gesture with a frown youre the one hooked up to machines though her voice was brisk the hand that brushed over his cheek was infinitely tender ive seen you looking better fletcher he linked his fingers with hers ive felt better you saved my life she struggled to keep it light keep it easy i guess i owe you damn right he wanted to touch her but his arms felt like lead when are you going to pay up well talk about it your sisters here she glanced across the bed at natalie natalie leaned down and pressed a kiss to his brow you jerk its nice to see you too you just couldnt be a pushy uncomplicated business shark could you no he smiled and nearly floated off again but you make a great one try to keep them from worrying she sighed a little as she thought of their parents you dont ask for much im doing okay just keep telling them that you met cilia natalies gaze skimmed up measuring yes we met just now make her get the hell out of here natalie saw the shocked hurt in cilias eyes saw her fingers tighten convulsively on the bedguard she doesnt have to make me go with her last scrap of pride she lifted her chin if you dont want me around ill dont be stupid boyd said in that mild slightly irritated voice that made her want to weep he looked back at his sister shes dead on her feet last night was rough shes too stubborn to admit it but she needs to go home and get some sleep ungrateful slob cilia managed do you think you can order me around even when youre flat on your back yeah give me a kiss if i didnt feel sorry for you id make you beg she leaned close to touch her lips to his at the moment of contact she realized with a new panic that she was going to break down since you want me to clear out i will ive got a show to prep for hey oroarke she got enough of a grip on control to look over her shoulder yes come back soon well well natalie murmured as cilia hurried away well well her brother echoed he simply could not keep his eyes open another moment shes terrific isnt she i suppose she must be as soon as i can stay awake for more than an hour at a time im going to marry her i see maybe you should wait until you can actually stand up for an hour at a time ill think about it nat he found her hand again it is good to see you you bet she said as he fell asleep cilia was almost running when she hit the double doors she didnt pause not even when boyds parents both rose from the bench as her breath hitched and her eyes filled she hurried down the hall and stumbled into the ladies room natalie found her there ten minutes later curled up in a corner sobbing wretchedly saying nothing natalie pulled out a handful of paper towels she dampened a few then walked over to crouch in front of cilia here you go i hate to do this cilia said between sobbing breaths me too natalie wiped her own eyes and then without a thought to her sevenhundreddollar suit sat on the floor the doctor said theyd probably move him to a regular room by tomorrow theyre hoping to downgrade his condition from critical to serious by this afternoon thats good cilia covered her face with the cool wet towel dont tell him i cried all right there was silence between them as each worked on control i guess youd like to know everything that happened cilia said at length yes but it can wait i think boyd had a point when he told you to go home and get some sleep with very little effort she could have stretched out on the cool tile floor and winked out like a light maybe ill give you a lift no thanks ill call a cab ill give you a lift natalie repeated and rose lowering the towel cilia studied her youre a lot like him arent you so they say natalie offered a hand to help cilia to her feet boyd told me youre getting married so he says for the first time in hours natalie laughed we really will have to talk she all but lived in the hospital for the next week boyd was rarely alone though it might have frustrated him from time to time that he barely had a moment for a private word with her cilia was grateful his room was always filled with friends with family with associates as the days passed and his condition improved she cut her visits shorter and kept them farther apart they both needed the distance that was how she rationalized it they both needed time for clear thinking if she was to put the past both the distant past and the near past behind her she needed to do it on her own it was thea who filled her in on billy lomus in his troubled childhood the only bright spot had been john mcgillis as fate would have it they had fed on each others weaknesses johns first suicide attempt had occurred two months after billy left for viet nam hed been barely ten years old when billy had returned bitter and wounded john had run away to join him though the authorities had separated them they had always managed to find each other again johns death had driven billy over the fine line of reason he had walked delayed stress syndrome althea said as they stood together in the hospital parking lot paranoid psychosis obsessive love it doesnt really matter what label you put on it over these past couple of weeks ive asked myself dozens of times if there was anything i could have done differently with john mcgillis she took in a deep breath of the early spring air and there wasnt i cant tell you what a relief it is to finally be sure of that then you can put it behind you yes its not something i can forget but i can put it behind me before i do id like to thank you for everything you did and tried to do it was my job althea said simply we werent friends then i think maybe we nearly are now cilia laughed nearly so as someone whos nearly your friend theres something id like to say okay ive been watching you and boyd since the beginning observations also part of the job her eyes clear and brown and direct met cilias i still havent decided if i think youre good for boyd its not really my call but i like to form an opinion cilia looked out beyond the parking lot to a patch of green the daffodils were blooming there beautifully thea youre not telling me anything i dont already know my point is boyd thinks youre good for him thats enough for me i guess the only thing youve got to decide now is if hes good for you he thinks he is she murmured ive noticed in an abrupt change of mood althea looked toward the hospital i heard he was getting out in a couple of days thats the rumor youve already been up i take it for a few minutes his sisters there and a couple of cops they brought in a flower arrangement shaped like a horseshoe the card read tough break lucky they tried to tell him theyd confiscated it from some gangsters funeral wouldnt surprise me funny thing about cops they usually have a sense of humor just like real people she gave cilia an easy smile im going to go up should i tell him i ran into you and youre coming back later no not this time just just tell him to listen to the radio ill see if i can dig up dueling banjos dueling banjos yeah ill see you later thea sure althea watched cilia walk to her car and was grateful not for the first time not to be in love though the first couple of nights in the booth after the shooting had been difficult cilia had picked up her old routine she no longer got a flash of boyd bleeding as he knelt by the door or of billy his eyes wild holding a knife to her throat shed come to enjoy the request line again the blinking lights no longer grated on her nerves every hour she was grateful that boyd was recovering and so she threw herself into her work with an enthusiasm she had lost for too long cilia she didnt jolt at the sound of her name but swiveled easily in her chair and smiled at nick hey i ah decided to come back she kept smiling as she accepted the cup of coffee he offered i heard mark was real good about it youre an asset to the station nick im glad you changed your mind yeah well he let his words trail off as he studied the scar on the palm of her hand the stitches had come out only days earlier im glad youre okay me too you want to get me the roccos pizza commercial he nearly jumped for it sliding it out of place and handing it to her cilia popped the tape in then potted it up i wanted to apologize he blurted out you dont have to i feel like a jerk especially after i heardwell the whole story about billy and that guy from chicago youre nothing like john nick and im flattered that you were attracted to me especially since you have a class with my incredibly beautiful sister deborahs nice but shes too smart cilia had her first big laugh of the month thanks a lot kid just what does that make me i didnt mean he broke off mortally embarrassed i only meant dont bury yourself giving him a quick grin she turned on her mike hey denver were going to keep it rocking for you for the next quarter hour its on this thursday night and im just getting started she hit them with a blast of guns n roses now thats rock and roll she said to herself hey nick why dont you her words trailed off when she saw boyds mother in the doorway mrs fletcher she sprang up nearly strangling herself with her headphones i hope im not disturbing you she smiled at cilia nodded to nick no no of course not cilia brushed uselessly at her grimy jeans urn nick why dont you get mrs fletcher a cup of coffee no thank you dear i can only stay a moment nick made his excuses and left them alone so mrs fletcher said after a quick study she blinked at the posters on the wall and examined the equipment this is where you work yes id ah give you a tour but ive got thats perfectly all right the lines of strain were no longer around her eyes she was a trim attractive and perfectly groomed woman and she intimidated the hell out of cilia dont let me interrupt you no i im used to working with people around i missed you at the hospital the past few days so i thought id come by here and say goodbye youre leaving since boyd is on the mend were going back to paris its business as well as pleasure cilia made a noncommittal noise and cued up the next record i know you must be relieved that boyd well that hes all right im sure it was dreadful for you for all of us boyd explained it all to us youve had a horrible ordeal its over now yes she lifted cilias hand and glanced at the healing wound experiences leave scars some deeper than others she released cilias hand to wander around the tiny booth boyd tells me youre to be married i she shook off the shock cleared her throat excuse me a minute turning to the console she segued into the next record then pushed another switch its time for our mystery record she explained the roll of thunder plays over the song then people call in the first caller who can give me the name of the song the artist and the year of the recording wins a pair of concert tickets weve got madonna coming in at the end of the month fascinating mrs fletcher smiled a smile precisely like boyds as i was saying boyd tells me youre to be married i wondered if youd like any help with the arrangements no that is i havent said excuse me she pounced on a blinking light khip no im sorry wrong answer try again she struggled to keep her mind clear as the calls came through the fourth callers voice was very familiar hey oroarke boyd she sent his mother a helpless look im working im calling you got a winner yet no but youve got one now electric avenue eddy grant she had to smile youre pretty sharp slick looks like youve got yourself a couple of concert tickets hold on she switched on her mike weve got a winner patient mrs fletcher watched her work smiling as she heard her sons voice over the speakers congratulations cilia said after shed potted up a new record so are you going to the concert with me if youre lucky gotta go hey he shouted before she could cut him off i havent heard dueling banjos yet keep listening after a long breath she turned back to his mother im very sorry no problem no problem at all in fact shed found the interlude delightful about the wedding i dont know that theres going to be a wedding i mean there isnt a wedding she dragged a hand through her hair i dont think ah well that same faint knowing smile hovered around her mouth im sure you or boyd will let us know hes very much in love with you you know that yes at least i think i do he told me about your parents i hope you dont mind no she sat again mrs fletcher liz is fine liz i hope you dont think im playing some sort of game with boyd i wouldnt ask him to change i could never ask him to change and i just dont know if i can live with what he does because youre afraid of his being a policeman afraid he might die and leave you as your parents did cilia looked down at her hands spread her fingers i guess when you trim away all the fat thats it i understand i worry about him she said quietly i also understand hes doing what he has to do yes it is what he has to do ive given that a lot of thought since he was hurt cilia looked up again her eyes intense how do you live with it liz took cilias restless hand in hers i love him and thats enough it has to be its always difficult to lose someone you love the way you lost your parents was tragic and according to boyd unnecessary my mother died when i was only six i loved her very much though i had little time with her im sorry she cut herself in the garden one day just a little nick on the thumb she paid no attention to a few weeks later she was dead of blood poisoning all from a little cut on the thumb with a pair of rusty garden shears tragic and unnecessary its hard to say how and when a loved one will be taken from us how sad it would be not to allow ourselves to love because we were afraid to lose she touched a hand to cilias cheek i hope to see you again soon mrs fletcher liz cilia said as she stopped at the door thank you for coming it was my pleasure she glanced at a poster of a barechested rock star with shoulderlength hair and a smoldering sneer though i do prefer cole porter cilia found herself smiling as she slipped in another tape after the ad she gave her listeners fifteen uninterrupted minutes of music and herself time to think when the request line rolled around she was as nervous as a cat but her mind was made up this is cilia oroarke for khip its five minutes past midnight and our request lines are open before i take a call ive got a request of my own this one goes to boyd no its not dueling banjos slick youre just going to have to try a new memory on for size its an old one by the platters only you i hope youre listening because i want you to know for the first time in her career she choked on the air oh boy its a lot to get out i guess i want to say i finally figured out its only you for me i love you and if the offers still open youve got a deal she sent the record out and with her eyes closed let the song flow through her head struggling for composure she took call after call there were jokes and questions about boyd but none of the callers was boyd shed been so certain he would phone maybe he hadnt even been listening the thought of that had her dropping her head in her hands she had finally dragged out the courage to tell him how she felt and he hadnt been listening she got through the next two hours stepbystep it had been a stupid move she told herself it was unbelievably foolish to announce that you loved someone over the radio shed only succeeded in embarrassing herself the more she thought about it the angrier she became shed told him to listen damn it couldnt he do anything she asked him to do shed told him to go away hed stayed shed told him she wasnt going to marry him hed told everyone she was shed told him to listen to the radio hed shut it off shed bared her soul over the public airwaves for nothing that was a hell of a request jackson commented when he strolled into the booth just before two shut up right he hummed to himself as he checked the programmers clock for his shift ratings should shoot right through the roof if i wanted someone to be cheerful in here id have brought along mickey mouse sorry undaunted he continued to hum with her teeth on edge cilia opened her mike thats all for tonight denver its im turning you over to my man jackson hell be with you until six in the am have a good one and remember when you dream of me dream good she kicked her chair out of the way and if youre smart she said to jackson you wont say a word lips are sealed she stalked out snatching up her jacket and digging for her keys as she headed for the door she was going to go home and soak her head and if deborah had been listening and was waiting up it would just give her someone to chew out head down hands in her pockets she stomped to her car she had her hand on the doorhandle before she saw that boyd was sitting on the hood nice night he said what what the hell are you doing here anger forgotten she rushed around the car youre supposed to be in the hospital they havent released you yet i went over the wall come here you jerk sitting out here in the night air you were nearly dead two weeks ago and ive never felt better in my life he grabbed her by the front of her jacket and hauled her against him for a kiss and neither have you what youve never felt better in my life either she shook her head to clear it and stepped back get in the car im taking you back to the hospital like hell laughing he pulled her against him again and devoured her mouth she went weak and hot and dizzy on a little sigh she clung to him letting her hands rush over his face into his hair just to touch him to touch him and know he was whole and safe and hers lord do you know how long its been since youve kissed me like that he held her close waiting for his heart rate to level his side was throbbing in time with it those chaste little pecks in the hospital werent enough we were never alone you never stayed around long enough he pressed his lips to the top of her head i liked the song what song oh she stepped back again you were listening i liked the song a lot he took her hand and pressed his mouth to the scar but i liked what you said before it even better how about saying it again facetoface i she let out a huff of breath patient he cupped her face in his hands come on oroarke he smiled spit it out i love you she said it so quickly and with such obvious relief that he laughed again damn it its not funny i really love you and its your fault for making it impossible for me to do anything else remind me to pat myself on the back later youve got a hell of a voice cilia he wrapped his arms around her comfortably and youve never sounded better than tonight i was scared i know i guess im not anymore she rested her head against his shoulder it feels right yeah just right the offer still holds cilia marry me she took her time not because she was afraid but because she wanted to savor it she wanted to remember every second the moon was full the stars were out she could just catch the faintest drift of those fragile spring flowers theres one question i have to ask you first okay can we really hire a cook he laughed and lowered his mouth to hers absolutely then its a deal night shadow chapter contents prev next he walked the night alone restless ready clad in black masked he was a shadow among shadows a whisper among the murmurs and mumbles of the dark he was watchful always for those who preyed on the helpless and vulnerable unknown unseen unwanted he stalked the hunters in the steaming jungle that was the city he moved unchallenged in the dark spaces the blind alleys and violent streets like smoke he drifted along towering rooftops and down into dank cellars when he was needed he moved like thunder all sound and fury then there was only the flash the optical echo that lightning leaves after it streaks the sky they called him nemesis and he was everywhere he walked the night skirting the sound of laughter the cheerful din of celebrations instead he was drawn to the whimpers and tears of the lonely and the hopeless pleas of the victimized night after night he clothed himself in black masked his face and stalked the wild dark streets not for the law the law was too easily manipulated by those who scorned it it was too often bent and twisted by those who claimed to uphold it he knew oh yes he knew and he could not forget when he walked he walked for justice she of the blind eyes with justice there could be retribution and the balancing of scales like a shadow he watched the city below deborah oroarke moved quickly she was always in a hurry to catch up with her own ambitions now her neat sensible shoes clicked rapidly on the broken sidewalks of urbanas east end it wasnt fear that had her hurrying back toward her car though the east end was a dangerous place especially at night for a lone attractive woman it was the flush of success in her capacity as assistant district attorney she had just completed an interview with a witness to one of the driveby shootings that were becoming a plague in urbana her mind was completely occupied with the need to get back to her office and write her report so that the wheels of justice could begin to turn she believed in justice the patient tenacious and systematic stages of it young rico mendezs murderers would answer for their crime and with luck she would be the one to prosecute outside the crumbling building where she had just spent an hour doggedly pressuring two frightened young boys for information the street was dark all but two of the streetlights that lined the cracked sidewalk had been broken the moon added only a fitful glow she knew that the shadows in the narrow doorways were drunks or pushers or hookers more than once she had reminded herself that she could have ended up in one of those sad and scarred buildings if it hadnt been for her older sisters fierce determination to see that she had a good home a good education a good life every time deborah brought a case to trial she felt she was repaying a part of that debt one of the doorway shadows shouted something at her impersonally obscene a harsh feminine cackle followed it deborah had only been in urbana for eighteen months but she knew better than to pause or to register that she had heard at all her strides long and purposeful she stepped off the curb to get into her car someone grabbed her from behind ooh baby aint you sweet the man six inches taller than she and wiry as a spring stank but not from liquor in the split second it took her to read his glassy eyes she understood that he wasnt pumped high on whiskey but on chemicals that would make him quick instead of sluggish using both hands she shoved her leather briefcase into his gut he grunted and his grip loosened deborah wrenched away and ran digging frantically for her keys even as her hand closed over the jingling metal in her pocket he grabbed her his fingers digging in at the collar of her jacket she heard the linen rip and turned to fight then she saw the switchblade its business end gleaming once before he pressed it against the soft skin under her chin gotcha he said and giggled she went dead still hardly daring to breathe in his eyes she saw a malicious kind of glee that would never listen to pleading or logic still she kept her voice low and calm ive only got twentyfive dollars jabbing the point of the blade against her skin he leaned intimately close uhuh baby you got a lot more than twentyfive dollars he twisted her hair around his hand jerking once hard when she cried out he began to pull her toward the deeper dark of the alley go on and scream he giggled in her ear i like it when they scream go on he nicked her throat with the blade scream she did and the sound rolled down the shadowed street echoing in the canyons of the buildings in doorways people shouted encouragement to the attacker behind darkened windows people kept their lights off and pretended they heard nothing when he pushed her against the damp wall of the alleyway she was icy with terror her mind always so sharp and open shut down please she said though she knew better dont do this he grinned youre going to like it with the tip of the blade he sliced off the top button of her blouse youre going to like it just fine like any strong emotion fear sharpened her senses she could feel her own tears hot and wet on her cheeks smell his stale breath and the overripe garbage that crowded the alley in his eyes she could see herself pale and helpless she would be another statistic she thought dully just one more number among the ever increasing victims slowly then with increasing power anger began to burn through the icy shield of fear she would not cringe and whimper she would not submit without a fight it was then she felt the sharp pressure of her keys they were still in her hand closed tight in her rigid fist concentrating she used her thumb to push the points between her stiff fingers she sucked in her breath trying to channel all of her strength into her arm just as she raised it her attacker seemed to rise into the air then fly arms pinwheeling into a stand of metal garbage cans deborah ordered her legs to run the way her heart was pumping she was certain she could be in her car doors locked engine gunning in the blink of an eye but then she saw him he was all in black a long lean shadow among the shadows he stood over the knifewielding junkie his legs spread his body tensed stay back he ordered when she took an automatic step forward his voice was part whisper part growl i think dont think he snapped without bothering to look at her even as she bristled at his tone the junkie leaped up howling bringing his blade down in a deadly arc before deborahs dazed and fascinated eyes there was a flash of movement a scream of pain and the clatter of the knife as it skidded along the concrete in less than the time it takes to draw and release a single breath the man in black stood just as he had before the junkie was on his knees moaning and clutching his stomach that was deborah searched her whirling brain for a word impressive i i was going to suggest that we call the police he continued to ignore her as he took some circular plastic from his pocket and bound the stillmoaning junkies hands and ankles he picked up the knife pressed a button the blade disappeared with a whisper only then did he turn to her the tears were already drying on her cheeks he noted and though there was a hitch in her breath she didnt appear to be ready to faint or shoot off into hysterics in fact he was forced to admire her calm she was extraordinarily beautiful he observed dispassionately her skin was pale as ivory against a disheveled cloud of inkblack hair her features were soft delicate almost fragile unless you looked at her eyes there was a toughness in them a determination that belied the fact that her slender body was shaking in reaction her jacket was torn and her blouse had been cut open to reveal the icyblue lace and silk of a camisole an interesting contrast to the prim almost mannish business suit he summed her up not as man to woman but as he had countless other victims countless other hunters the unexpected and very basic jolt of reaction he felt disturbed him such things were more dangerous than any switchblade are you hurt his voice was low and unemotional and he remained in shadow no no not really there would be plenty of bruises both on her skin and her emotions but she would worry about them later just shaken up i want to thank you for she had stepped toward him as she spoke in the faint backsplash from the streetlight she saw that his face was masked as her eyes widened he saw they were blue a brilliant electric blue nemesis she murmured i thought you were the product of someones overworked imagination im as real as he is he jerked his head toward the figure groaning among the garbage he saw that there was a thin trickle of blood on her throat for reasons he didnt try to understand it enraged him what kind of a fool are you i beg your pardon this is the sewer of the city you dont belong here no one with brains comes here unless they have no choice her temper inched upward but she controlled it he had after all helped her i had business here no he corrected you have no business here unless you choose to be raped and murdered in an alley i didnt choose anything of the sort as her emotions darkened the faint hint of georgia became more prominent in her voice i can take care of myself his gaze skimmed down lingered on the shredded blouse then returned to her face obviously she couldnt make out the color of his eyes they were dark very dark in the murky light they seemed black but she could read the dismissal in them and the arrogance ive already thanked you for helping me even though i didnt need any help i was just about to deal with that slime myself really thats right i was going to gouge his eyes out she held up her keys lethal points thrusting out with these he studied her again then gave a slow nod yes i believe you could do it damn right i could then it appears ive wasted my time he pulled a square of black cloth from his pocket after wrapping the knife in it he offered it to her youll want this for evidence the moment she held it she remembered that feeling of terror and helplessness with a muffled oath she bit back her temper whoever whatever he was he had risked his life to help her i am grateful i dont look for gratitude her chin came up as he threw her words back in her face for what then he stared at her into her something came and went in his eyes that made her skin chill again as she heard his words for justice this isnt the way she began its my way werent you going to call the police yes she pressed the heel of her hand to her temple she was a little dizzy she realized and more than a little sick to her stomach this wasnt the time or the place to argue morality and law enforcement with a belligerent masked man i have a phone in my car then i suggest you use it all right she was too tired to argue shivering a bit she started down the alley at the mouth of it she saw her briefcase she picked it up with a sense of relief and put the switchblade in it five minutes later after calling and giving her location and the situation she walked back into the alley theyre sending a cruiser weary she pushed the hair back from her face she saw the junkie curled up tight on the concrete his eyes were wide and wild nemesis had left him with the promise of what would happen to him if he was ever caught again attempting to rape even through the haze of drugs the words had rung true hello with a puzzled frown she looked up and down the alley he was gone damn it where did he go on a hiss of breath she leaned back against the clammy wall she hadnt finished with him yet not by a long shot he was almost close enough to touch her but she couldnt see him that was the blessing and the curse the repayment for the lost days he didnt reach out and was curious why he wanted to he only watched her imprinting on his memory the shape of her face the texture of her skin the color and sheen of her hair as it curved gently beneath her chin if he had been a romantic man he might have thought in terms of poetry or music but he told himself he only waited and watched to make certain she was safe when the sirens cut the night he could see her rebuild a mask of composure layer by layer she took deep steadying breaths as she buttoned the ruined jacket over her slashed blouse with a final breath she tightened her grip on her briefcase set her chin and walked with confident strides toward the mouth of the alley as he stood alone in his own half world between reality and illusion he could smell the subtle sexiness of her perfume for the first time in four years he felt the sweet and quiet ache of longing deborah didnt feel like a party in her fantasy she wasnt all glossed up in a strapless red dress with plastic stays digging into her sides she wasnt wearing pinching threeinch heels she wasnt smiling until she thought her face would split in two in her fantasy she was devouring a mystery novel and chocolate chip cookies while she soaked in a hot bubble bath to ease the bruises that still ached a bit three days after her nasty adventure in the east end alley unfortunately her imagination wasnt quite good enough to keep her feet from hurting as parties went it was a pretty good one maybe the music was a bit loud but that didnt bother her after a lifetime with her sister a firstclass rock and roll fanatic she was well indoctrinated into the world of loud music the smoked salmon and spinach canapés werent chocolate chip cookies but they were tasty the wine that she carefully nursed was topnotch there was plenty of glitz and glamour lots of cheek bussing and gladhanding it was after all a party thrown by arlo stuart hotel magnate as a campaign party for tucker fields urbanas mayor it was stuarts and the present administrations hope that the campaign would end in november with the mayors reelection deborah was as yet undecided whether she would pull the lever for the incumbent or the young upstart challenger bill tarrington the champagne and pate wouldnt influence her her choice would be based on issues not party affiliations either social or political tonight she was attending the party for two reasons the first was that she was friends with the mayors assistant jerry bower the second was that her boss had used the right combination of pressure and diplomacy to push her through the gilded swinging doors of the stuart palace god you look great jerry bower trim and handsome in his tux his blond hair waving around his tanned friendly face stopped beside deborah to press a quick kiss to her cheek sorry i havent had time to talk there was a lot of meeting and greeting to do things are always busy for the big bosss right arm she smiled toasting him quite a bash stuart pulled out all the stops with a politicians eye he scanned the crowd the mix of the rich famous and influential pleased him there were of course other aspects to the campaign visibility contact with shop owners factory workers the blue the gray and the white collars press conferences speeches statements but jerry figured if he could spend a small slice of one eighteenhour day rubbing silk elbows and noshing on canapés hed make the best of it im properly dazzled deborah assured him ah but its your vote we want you might get it how are you feeling taking the opportunity in hand he began to fill a plate with hors doeuvres fine she glanced idly down at the fading bruise on her forearm there were other more colorful marks hidden under the red silk really she smiled again really its an experience i dont want to repeat but it did bring it home straight home to me that weve got a lot more work to do before urbanas streets are safe you shouldnt have been out there he mumbled he might as well have nudged a soapbox under her feet her eyes lit up her cheeks flushed her chin angled why why should there be any place any place at all in the city where a person isnt safe to walk are we supposed to just accept the fact that there are portions of urbana that are offlimits to nice people if were hold it hold it he held up a surrendering hand the only person someone in politics cant comfortably outtalk is a lawyer i agree with you okay he snagged a glass of wine from a passing waiter and reminded himself it could be his only one of the long evening i was stating a fact it doesnt make it right it just makes it true it shouldnt be true her eyes had darkened in both annoyance and frustration the mayors running on a tough anticrime campaign jerry reminded her and gave smiling nods to constituents who wandered by nobody in this city knows the statistics better than i do theyre nasty no doubt and were going to push them back it just takes time yeah sighing she pulled herself away from the brink of the argument shed had with jerry more times than she could count but its taking too much time he bit into a carrot slice dont tell me youre going to step over to the side of this nemesis character if the law wont deal with it quickly enough i will no on that she was firm the law would mete out justice in a proper fashion she believed in the law even now when it was so totally overburdened i dont believe in crusades they come too close to vigilantism though i have to admit im grateful he was tilting at windmills in that alley the other night so am i he touched her lightly on the shoulder when i think of what might have happened it didnt that helpless fear was still much too close to the surface to allow her to dwell on it and in spite of all the romantic press hes been getting up close and in person hes rude and abrupt she took another sip of wine i owe him but i dont have to like him nobody understands that sentiment more than a politician she relaxed and laughed up at him all right enough shoptalk tell me whos here that i should know and dont jerry entertained her he always did for the next few minutes he gulped down canapés and put names and tax brackets to the faces crowding the royal stuart ballroom his clever and pithy comments made her chuckle when they began to stroll through the crowd she hooked her arm easily through his it was a matter of chance that she turned her head and in that sea of people focused on one single face he was standing in a group of five or six with two beautiful women all but hanging on his arms attractive yes she thought but the room was filled with attractive men his thick dark hair framed a long lean somewhat scholarly face prominent bones deepset eyes brown eyes she realized dark and rich like bittersweet chocolate they seemed faintly bored at the moment his mouth was full rather poetic looking and curved now in the barest hint of a smile he wore his tux as if hed been born in one easily casually with one long finger he brushed a fiery curl off the redheads cheek as she leaned closer to him his smile widened at something she said then without turning his head he merely shifted his gaze and locked on deborah and she bought the little monsters a widescreen tv what she blinked and though she realized it was absurd she felt as though she had broken out of a spell what i was telling you about mrs forthwrights poodles jerry who is that over there with the redhead on one side and the blonde on the other glancing over jerry grimaced then shrugged im surprised he doesnt have a brunette sitting on his shoulders women tend to stick to him as though he was wearing flypaper instead of a tux she didnt need to be told what she could see with her own eyes who is he guthrie gage guthrie her eyes narrowed a bit her mouth pursed why does that sound familiar its splashed liberally through the society section of the world almost every day i dont read the society section well aware it was rude deborah stared stubbornly at the man across the room i know him she murmured i just cant place how youve probably heard his story he was a cop a cop deborahs brows lifted in surprise he looked much too comfortable much too much a part of the rich and privileged surroundings to be a cop a good one apparently right here in urbana a few years ago he and his partner ran into trouble big trouble the partner was killed and guthrie was left for dead her memory jogged then homed in i remember now i followed his story my god he was in a coma for nine or ten months jerry supplied he was on lifesupport and theyd just about given him up when he opened his eyes and came back he couldnt hack the streets anymore and turned down a desk job with upd hed come into a plump inheritance while he was in the twilight zone so i guess you could say he took the money and ran it couldnt have been enough she thought no amount of money could have been enough it must have been horrible he lost nearly a year of his life jerry picked through the dwindling supply on his plate looking for something interesting hes made up for lost time apparently women find him irresistible of course that might be because he turned a threemilliondollar inheritance into thirty and counting nipping a spiced shrimp jerry watched as gage smoothly disentangled himself from the group and started in their direction well well he said softly looks like the interest is mutual gage had been aware of her since the moment shed stepped into the ballroom hed watched patient as shed mingled then separated herself hed kept up a social patter though hed been wholly and uncomfortably aware of every move shed made hed seen her smile at jerry observed the other man kiss her and brush a casually intimate hand over her shoulder hed find out just what the relationship was there though it wouldnt matter couldnt matter he corrected gage had no time for sultry brunettes with intelligent eyes but he moved steadily toward her jerry gage smiled its good to see you again always a pleasure mr guthrie youre enjoying yourself of course his gaze flicked from jerry to deborah hello for some ridiculous reason her throat snapped shut deborah id like to introduce you to gage guthrie mr guthrie assistant district attorney deborah oroarke an ada gages smile spread charmingly its comforting to know that justice is in such lovely hands competent she said i much prefer competent of course though she hadnt offered it he took her hand and held it for a brief few seconds watch out the warning flashed into deborahs mind the instant her palm met his will you excuse me a minute jerry laid a hand on deborahs shoulder again the mayors signaling sure she summoned up a smile for him though she was ashamed to admit shed forgotten he was beside her you havent been in urbana long gage commented despite her uneasiness deborah met his eyes straight on about a year and a half why because id have known really do you keep tabs on all the adas no he brushed a finger over the pearl drop at her ear just the beautiful ones the instant suspicion in her eyes delighted him would you like to dance no she let out a long quiet breath no thanks i really cant stay any longer ive got work to do he glanced at his watch its already past ten the law doesnt have a time clock mr guthrie gage ill give you a lift no a quick and unreasonable panic surged to her throat no thats not necessary if its not necessary then it must be a pleasure he was smooth she thought entirely too smooth for a man who had just shrugged off a blonde and a redhead she didnt care for the idea of being the brunette to round out the trio i wouldnt want to take you away from the party i never stay late at parties gage the redhead her mouth pouty and moist swayed up to drag on his arm honey you havent danced with me not once deborah took the opportunity to make a beeline for the exit it was stupid she admitted but her system had gone haywire at the thought of being alone in a car with him pure instinct she supposed for on the surface gage guthrie was a smooth charming and appealing man but she sensed something undercurrents dark dangerous undercurrents deborah figured she had enough to deal with she didnt need to add gage guthrie to the list she stepped out into the steamy summer night hail you a cab miss the doorman asked her no gage cupped a firm hand under her elbow thank you mr guthrie she began gage my car is just here miss oroarke he gestured to a long sleek limo in gleaming black its lovely she said between her teeth but a cab will suit my needs perfectly but not mine he nodded at the tall bulky man who slipped out of the drivers seat to open the rear door the streets are dangerous at night id simply like to know youve gotten where you want to go safely she stepped back and took a long careful study as she might of a mug shot of a suspect he didnt seem as dangerous now with that half smile hovering at his mouth in fact she thought he looked just a little sad just a little lonely she turned toward the limo not wanting to soften too much she shot a look over her shoulder has anyone ever told you youre pushy mr guthrie often miss oroarke he settled beside her and offered a single longstemmed red rose you come prepared she murmured had the blossom been waiting for the blonde she wondered or the redhead i try where would you like to go the justice building its on sixth and i know where it is gage pressed a button and the glass that separated them from the driver slid open noiselessly the justice building frank yes sir the glass closed again cocooning them we used to work on the same side deborah commented which side is that law he turned to her his eyes dark almost hypnotic it made her wonder what he had seen when he had drifted all those months in that strange world of half life or half death youre a defender of the law i like to think so yet you wouldnt be adverse to making deals and kicking back charges the systems overburdened she said defensively oh yes the system with a faint movement of his shoulders he seemed to dismiss it all where are you from denver no you didnt get cypress trees and magnolia blossoms in your voice from denver i was born in georgia but my sister and i moved around quite a bit denver was where i lived before i came east to urbana her sister he noted not her parents not her family just her sister he didnt press not yet why did you come here because it was a challenge i wanted to put all those years i studied to good use i like to think i can make a difference she thought of the mendez case and the four gang members who had been arrested and were even now awaiting trial i have made a difference youre an idealist maybe whats wrong with that idealists are often tragically disappointed he was silent a moment studying her the streetlamps and headlights of oncoming traffic sliced into the car then faded sliced then faded she was beautiful in both light and shadow more than beauty there was a kind of power in her eyes the kind that came from the merging of intelligence and determination id like to see you in court he said she smiled and added yet one more element to the power and the beauty ambition it was a formidable combination im a killer i bet you are he wanted to touch her just the skim of a fingertip on those lovely white shoulders he wondered if it would be enough just a touch because he was afraid it wouldnt he resisted it was with both relief and frustration that he felt the limo glide to the curb and stop deborah turned to look blankly out of the window at the old towering justice building that was quick she murmured baffled by her own disappointment thanks for the lift when the driver opened her door she swung her legs out ill see you again for the second time she looked at him over her shoulder maybe good night he sat for a moment against the yielding seat haunted by the scent she had left behind home the driver asked no gage took a long steadying breath stay here take her home when shes finished i need to walk chapter contents prev next like a boxer dazed from too many blows gage fought his way out of the nightmare he surfaced breathless and dripping sweat as the grinding nausea faded he lay back and stared at the high ornate ceiling of his bedroom there were rosettes carved into the plaster he had counted them day after day during his slow and tedious recuperation almost like an incantation he began to count them again waiting for his pulse rate to level the irish linen sheets were tangled and damp around him but he remained perfectly still counting twentyfive twentysix twentyseven there was a light spicy scent of carnations in the room one of the maids had placed them on the rolltop desk beneath the window as he continued to count he tried to guess what vase had been used waterford dresden wedgwood he concentrated on that and the monotonous counting until he felt his system begin to level he never knew when the dream would reoccur he supposed he should have been grateful that it no longer came nightly but there was something more horrible about its capricious visits calmer he pressed the button beside the bed the drapes on the wide arching window slid open and let in the light carefully he flexed his muscles one by one assuring himself he still had control like a man pursuing his own demons he reviewed the dream as always it sprang crystal clear in his mind involving all his senses they worked undercover gage and his partner jack mcdowell after five years they were more than partners they were brothers each had risked his life to save the others and each would do so again without hesitation they worked together drank together went to ball games argued politics for more than a year they had been going by the names of demerez and gates posing as two highrolling dealers of cocaine and its even more lethal offspring crack with patience and guile they had infiltrated one of the biggest drug cartels on the east coast urbana was its center they could have made a dozen arrests but they and the department agreed that the goal was the top man his name and face remained a frustrating mystery but tonight they would meet him a deal had been set painstakingly demerez and gates carried five million in cash in their steelreinforced briefcase they would exchange it for topgrade coke and they would only deal with the man in charge they drove toward the harbor in the customized maserati jack was so proud of with two dozen men for backup and their own cover solid their spirits were high jack was a quickthinking toughtalking veteran cop devoted to his family he had a pretty quiet wife and a young pistol of a toddler with his brown hair slicked back his hands studded with rings and the silk suit fitting creaselessly over his shoulders he looked the part of the rich conscienceless dealer there were plenty of contrasts between the two partners jack came from a long line of cops and had been raised in a thirdfloor walkup in the east end by his divorced mother there had been occasional visits from his father a man who had reached for the bottle as often as his weapon jack had gone straight into the force after high school gage had come from a business family filled with successful men who vacationed in palm beach and golfed at the country club his parents had been closer to working class by the family standard preferring to invest their money their time and their dreams in a small elegant french restaurant on the upper east side that dream had ultimately killed them after closing the restaurant late one brisk autumn night they had been robbed and brutally murdered not ten feet from the doorway orphaned before his second birthday gage had been raised in style and comfort by a doting aunt and uncle hed played tennis instead of streetball and had been encouraged to step into the shoes of his late fathers brother as president of the guthrie empire but he had never forgotten the cruelty and the injustice of his parents murder instead he had joined the police force straight out of college despite the contrasts in their backgrounds the men had one vital thing in common they both believed in the law well hang his ass tonight jack said drawing deeply on his cigarette its been a long time coining gage murmured six months prep work eighteen months deep cover two years isnt much to give to nail this bastard he turned to gage with a wink course we could always take the five mil and run like hell what do you say kid though jack was only five years older than gage he had always called him kid ive always wanted to go to rio yeah me too jack flicked the smoldering cigarette out of the car window where it bounced on asphalt and sputtered we could buy ourselves a villa and live the high life lots of women lots of rum lots of sun how bout it jenny might get annoyed jack chuckled at the mention of his wife yeah that would probably tick her off shed make me sleep in the den for a month guess wed just better kick this guys butt he picked up a tiny transmitter this is snow white you copy affirmative snow white this is dopey dont i know it jack muttered were pulling in pier seventeen keep a bead on us that goes for happy and sneezy and the rest of you dwarfs out there gage pulled up in the shadows of the dock and cut the engine he could smell the water and the overripe odor of fish and garbage following the instructions theyd been given he blinked his headlights twice paused then blinked them twice again just like james bond jack said then grinned at him you ready kid damn right he lit another cigarette blew smoke between his teeth then lets do it they moved cautiously jack holding the briefcase with its marked bills and microtransmitter both men wore shoulder holsters with police issues gage had a backup strapped to his calf the lap of water on wood the skitter of rodents on concrete the dim halflight of a cloudy moon the sting of tobacco on the air from jacks cigarette the small slowmoving bead of sweat between his own shoulder blades doesnt feel right gage said softly dont go spooky on me kid were going to hit the bell tonight with a nod gage fought off the ripple of unease but he reached for his weapon when a small man stepped out of the shadows with a grin the man held up his hands palms out im alone he said just as agreed i am montega your escort he had dark shaggy hair a flowing moustache when he smiled gage caught the glint of gold teeth like them he was wearing an expensive suit the kind that could be tailored to disguise the bulk of an automatic weapon montega lowered one hand carefully and took out a long slim cigar its a nice night for a little boat ride si si jack nodded you dont mind if we pat you down wed feel better holding all the hardware until we get where were going understandable montega lit the cigar with a slender gold lighter still grinning he clamped the cigar between his teeth gage saw his hand slip the lighter casually back into his pocket then there was an explosion the sound the all too familiar sound of a bullet ripping out of a gun there was a burning hole in the pocket of the fifteenhundreddollar suit jack fell backward even now four years later gage saw all the rest in hideous slow motion the dazed already dead look in jacks eyes as he was thrown backward by the force of the bullet the long slow roll of the briefcase as it wheeled end over end the shouts of the backup teams as they started to rush in his own impossibly slow motion as he reached for his weapon the grin the widening grin flashing with gold as montega had turned to him stinking cops he said and fired even now gage could feel the hot tearing punch that exploded in his chest the heat unbearable unspeakable he could see himself flying backward flying endlessly endlessly into the dark and hed been dead hed known he was dead he could see himself hed looked down and had seen his body sprawled on the bloody dock cops were working on him packing his wound swearing and scrambling around like ants he had watched it all passionlessly painlessly then the paramedics had come somehow pulling him back into the pain he had lacked the strength to fight them and go where he wanted to go the operating room pale blue walls harsh lights the glint of steel instruments the beep beep beep of monitors the labored hiss and release of the respirator twice he had slipped easily out of his body like breath quiet and invisible to watch the surgical team fight for his life hed wanted to tell them to stop that he didnt want to come back where he could hurt again feel again but they had been skillful and determined and had dragged him back into that poor damaged body and for a while hed returned to the blackness that had changed he remembered floating in some gray liquid world that had brought back primordial memories of the womb safe there quiet there occasionally he could hear someone speak someone would say his name loudly insistently but he chose to ignore them a woman weeping his aunt the shaken pleading sound of his uncles voice there would be light an intrusion really and though he couldnt feel he sensed that someone was lifting his eyelids and shining a bead into his pupils it was a fascinating world he could hear his own heartbeat a gentle insistent thud and swish he could smell flowers only once in a while then they would be overpowered by the slick antiseptic smell of hospital and he would hear music soft quiet music beethoven mozart chopin later he learned that one of the nurses had been moved enough to bring a small tape player into his room she often brought in discarded flower arrangements and sat and talked with him in a quiet motherly voice sometimes he mistook her for his own mother and felt unbearably sad when the mists in that gray world began to part he struggled against it he wanted to stay but no matter how deep he dived he kept floating closer to the surface until at last he opened his eyes to the light that was the worst part of the nightmare gage thought now when hed opened his eyes and realized he was alive wearily gage climbed out of bed he had gotten past the death wish that had haunted him those first few weeks but on the mornings he suffered from the nightmare he was tempted to curse the skill and dedication of the medical team that had brought him back they hadnt brought jack back they hadnt saved his parents who had died before hed even known them they hadnt had enough skill to save his aunt and uncle who had raised him with unstinting love and who had died only weeks before he had come out of the coma yet they had saved him gage understood why it was because of the gift the curse of a gift hed been given during those nine months his soul had gestated in that gray liquid world and because they had saved him he had no choice but to do what he was meant to do with a dull kind of acceptance he placed his right hand against the pale green wall of his bedroom he concentrated he heard the hum inside his brain the hum no one else could hear then quickly and completely his hand vanished oh it still existed he could feel it but even he couldnt see it there was no outline no silhouette of knuckles from the wrist up the hand was gone he had only to focus his mind and his whole body would do the same he could still remember the first time it had happened how it had terrified him and fascinated him he made his hand reappear and studied it it was the same wide palmed long fingered a bit rough with callus the ordinary hand of a man who was no longer ordinary a clever trick he thought for someone who walks the streets at night searching for answers he closed the hand into a fist then moved off into the adjoining bathroom to shower at am deborah was cooling her heels at the twentyfifth precinct she wasnt particularly surprised to have been summoned there the four gang members who had gunned down rico mendez were being held in separate cells that way they would sweat out the charges of murder one accessory to murder illegal possession of firearms possession of controlled substances and all the other charges on the arrest sheet and they could sweat them out individually with no opportunity to corroborate each others stories shed gotten the call from sly parinos public defense attorney at nine sharp this would make the third meeting between them at each previous encounter she had held firm against a deal parinos public defender was asking for the world and parino himself was crude nasty and arrogant but she had noted that each time they sat in the conference room together parino sweated more freely instinct told her he did indeed have something to trade but was afraid using her own strategy deborah had agreed to the meeting but had put it off for a couple of hours it sounded like parino was ready to deal and since she had him cold with possession of the murder weapon and two eye witnesses hed better have gold chips to ante up she used her time waiting for parino to be brought in from lockup by reviewing her notes on the case because she could have recited them by rote her mind wandered back to the previous evening just what kind of man was gage guthrie she wondered the type who bundled a reluctant woman into his limo after a fiveminute acquaintance then left that limo at her disposal for two and a half hours she remembered her baffled amusement when she had come out of the justice building at one oclock in the morning only to find the long black limo with its taciturn hulk of a driver patiently waiting to take her home mr guthries orders though mr guthrie had been nowhere to be seen she had felt his presence all during the drive from midtown to her apartment in the lower west end a powerful man she mused now in looks in personality and in basic masculine appeal she looked around the station house trying to imagine the elegant just slightly rougharoundtheedges man in the tuxedo working here the twentyfifth was one of the toughest precincts in the city and where deborah had discovered when shed been driven to satisfy her curiosity detective gage guthrie had worked during most of his six years with upd it was difficult to connect the two she mused the smooth obstinately charming man with the grimy linoleum harsh fluorescent lights and odors of sweat and stale coffee underlaid with the gummy aroma of pine cleaner he liked classical music for it had been mozart drifting through the limos speakers yet he had worked for years amid the shouts curses and shrilling phones of the twentyfifth from the information shed read once shed accessed his file she knew hed been a good cop sometimes a reckless one but one who had never crossed the line at least not on record instead his record had been fat with commendations he and his partner had broken up a prostitution ring which had preyed on young runaways were given credit for the arrest of three prominent businessmen who had run an underground gambling operation that had chastised its unlucky clients with unspeakable torture had tracked down drug dealers small and large and had ferreted out a crooked cop who had used his badge to extort protection money from small shop owners in urbanas little asia then they had gone undercover to break the back of one of the largest drug cartels on the eastern seaboard and had ended up broken themselves was that what was so fascinating about him deborah wondered that it seemed the sophisticated wealthy businessman was only an illusion thinly covering the tough cop he had been or had he simply returned to his privileged background his years as a policeman the aberration who was the real gage guthrie she shook her head and sighed shed been thinking a lot about illusions lately since the night in the alley when shed been faced with the terrifying reality of her own mortality and had been saved though she firmly believed she would have saved herself by what many people thought was no more than a phantom nemesis was real enough she mused she had seen him heard him even been annoyed by him and yet when he came into her mind he was like smoke if she had reached out to touch him would her hand have passed right through what nonsense she was going to have to get more sleep if overwork caused her mind to take fantasy flights in the middle of the day but somehow she was going to find that phantom again and pin him down miss oroarke yes she rose and offered her hand to the young harriedlooking public defender hello again mr simmons yes well he pushed tortoiseshell glasses up on his hooked nose i appreciate you agreeing to this meeting cut the bull behind simmons parino was flanked by two uniformed cops he had a sneer on his face and his hands in cuffs were here to deal so lets cut to the chase with a nod deborah led the way into the small conference room she settled her briefcase on the table and sat behind it she folded her hands in her trim navy suit and white blouse she looked every inch the southern belle shed been taught her manners well but her eyes as dark as the linen of her suit burned as they swept over parino she had studied the police photos of mendez and had seen what hate and an automatic weapon could do to a sixteenyearold body mr simmons youre aware that of the four suspects facing indictment for the murder of rico mendez your client holds the prize for the most serious charges can we lose these things parino held out his cuffed hands deborah glanced at him no come on babe he gave her what she imagined he thought was a sexy leer youre not afraid of me are you of you mr parino her lips curved but her tone was frigidly sarcastic why no i squash nasty little bugs every day you however should be afraid of me im the one whos going to put you away she flicked her gaze back to simmons lets not waste time again all three of us know the score mr parino is nineteen and will be tried as an adult it is still to be determined whether the others will be tried as adults or juveniles she took out her notes though she didnt need them as more than a prop the murder weapon was found in mr parinos apartment with mr parinos fingerprints all over it it was planted parino insisted i never saw it before in my life save it for the judge deborah suggested two witnesses place him in the car that drove by the corner of third and market at june those same witnesses have identified mr parino in a lineup as the man who leaned out of that car and fired ten shots into rico mendez parino began to swear and shout about squealers about what he would do to them when he got out about what he would do to her not bothering to raise her voice deborah continued her eyes on simmons we have your client cold murder one and the state will ask for the death penalty she folded her hands on her notes and nodded at simmons now what do you want to talk about simmons tugged at his tie the smoke from the cigarette parino was puffing was drifting in his direction and burning his eyes my client has information that he would be willing to turn over to the das office he cleared his throat in return for immunity and a reduction of the current charges against him from murder one to illegal possession of a firearm deborah lifted a brow let the silence take a beat im waiting for the punch line this is no joke sister parino leaned over the table i got something to deal and youd better play with deliberate motions deborah put her notes back into her briefcase snapped the lock then rose youre slime parino nothing nothing youve got to deal is going to put you back on the street again if you think you can walk over me or the das office then think again simmons bobbed up as she headed for the door miss oroarke please if we could simply discuss this she whirled back to him sure well discuss it as soon as you make me a realistic offer parino said something short and obscene that caused simmons to lose his color and deborah to turn a cold dispassionate eye on him the state is going for murder one and the death penalty she said calmly and believe me when i say im going to see to it that your client is ripped out of society just like a leech ill get off parino shouted at her his eyes were wild as he lunged to his feet and when i do im coming looking for you bitch you wont get off she faced him across the table her eyes were cold as ice and never wavered im very good at what i do parino which is putting rabid little animals like you away in cages in your case im going to pull out all the stops you wont get off she repeated and when youre sweating in death row i want you to think of me murder two simmons said quickly and was echoed by a savage howl from his client youre going to sell me out you sonofabitch deborah ignored parino and studied simmonss nervous eyes there was something here she could smell it murder one she repeated with a recommendation for life imprisonment rather than the death penalty if youve got something that holds my interest let me talk to my client please if you could give us a minute of course she left the sweaty public defender with his screaming client twenty minutes later she faced parino again across the scarred table he was paler calmer as he smoked a cigarette down to the filter deal your cards parino she suggested i want immunity from whatever charges might be brought from the information you give me agreed she already had him where she wanted him and protection hed begun to sweat if its warranted he hesitated fiddling with the cigarette the scorched plastic ashtray but he was cornered and knew it twenty years the public defender had said hed probably cop a parole in twenty years twenty years in the hole was better than the chair anything was and a smart guy could do pretty well for himself in the joint he figured he was a pretty smart guy ive been doing some deliveries for some guys heavy hitters trucking stuff from the docks to this fancy antique shop downtown they paid good too good so i knew something was in those crates besides old vases awkward in the cuffs he lit one cigarette from the smoldering filter of another so i figured id take a look myself i opened one of the crates it was packed with coke man ive never seen so much snow a hundred maybe a hundred and fifty pounds and it was pure how do you know he licked his lips then grinned i took one of the packs put it under my shirt im telling you there was enough there to fill up every nose in the state for the next twenty years whats the name of the shop he licked his lips again i want to know if we got a deal if the information can be verified yes if youre pulling my chain no timeless thats the name its over on seventh we delivered once maybe twice a week i dont know how often we were taking in coke or just fancy tables give me some names the guy i worked with at the docks was mouse just mouse thats all i know who hired you just some guy he came into loredos the bar in the west end where the demons hang out he said he had some work if i had a strong back and knew how to keep my mouth shut so me and ray we took him up on it ray ray santiago hes one of us the demons what did he look like the man who hired you little guy kinda spooky big mustache couple of gold teeth walked into loredos in a fancy suit but nobody thought to mess with him she took notes nodded prompted until she was certain parino was wrung dry all right ill check it out if youve been straight with me youll find ill be straight with you she rose glancing at simmons ill be in touch when she left the conference room her head was pounding there was a tight sick feeling in her gut that always plagued her when she dealt with parinos type he was nineteen for gods sake she thought as she tossed her visitors badge to the desk sergeant barely even old enough to vote yet hed viciously gunned down another human being she knew he felt no remorse the demons considered drivebys a kind of tribal ritual and she as a representative of the law had bargained with him that was the way the system worked she reminded herself as she stepped out of the stuffy station house into the steamy afternoon she would trade parino like a poker chip and hope to finesse bigger game in the end parino would pay by spending the rest of his youth and most of his adult life in a cage she hoped rico mendezs family would feel justice had been served bad day still frowning she turned shaded her eyes and focused on gage guthrie oh hello what are you doing here waiting for you she lifted a brow cautiously debating the proper response today he wore a gray suit very trim and quietly expensive though the humidity was intense his white shirt appeared crisp his gray silk tie was neatly knotted he looked precisely like what he was a successful wealthy businessman until you looked at his eyes deborah thought when you did you could see that women were drawn to him for a much more basic reason than money and position she responded with the only question that seemed apt why he smiled at that he had seen her caution and her evaluation clearly and was as amused as he was impressed by it to invite you to lunch oh well thats very nice but you do eat dont you he was laughing at her there was no mistaking it yes almost every day but at the moment im working youre a dedicated public servant arent you deborah i like to think so there was just enough sarcasm in his tone to put her back up she stepped to the curb and lifted an arm to hail a cab a bus chugged by streaming exhaust it was kind of you to leave your limo for me last night she turned and looked at him but it wasnt necessary i often do what others consider unnecessary he took her hand and with only the slightest pressure brought her arm down to her side if not lunch dinner that sounds more like a command than a request she would have tugged her hand away but it seemed foolish to engage in a childish test of wills on a public street either way i have to refuse im working late tonight tomorrow then he smiled charmingly a request counselor it was difficult not to smile back when he was looking at her with humor and was it loneliness in his eyes mr guthrie gage she corrected herself before he could persistent men usually annoy me and youre no exception but for some reason i think id like to have dinner with you ill pick you up at seven i keep early hours fine ill give you my address i know it of course his driver had dropped her off at her doorstep the night before if youll give me back my hand id like to hail a cab he didnt oblige her immediately but looked down at her hand it was small and delicate in appearance like the rest of her but there was strength in the fingers she kept her nails short neatly rounded with a coating of clear polish she wore no rings no bracelets only a slim practical watch that he noted was accurate to the minute he looked up from her hand into her eyes he saw curiosity a touch of impatience and again the wariness gage made himself smile as he wondered how a simple meeting of palms could have jolted his system so outrageously ill see you tomorrow he released her and stepped away she only nodded not trusting her voice when she slipped into a cab she turned back but he was already gone it was after ten when deborah walked up to the antique store it was closed of course and she hadnt expected to find anything she had written her report and passed the details of her interview with parino on to her superior but she hadnt been able to resist a look for herself in this upscale part of town people were lingering over dinner or enjoying a play a few couples wandered by on their way to a club or a restaurant streetlights shot out pools of security it was foolish she supposed to have been drawn here she could hardly have expected the doors to have been opened so she could walk in and discover a cache of drugs in an eighteenthcentury armoire the window was not only dark it was barred and shaded just as the shop itself was under a triple cloak of secrecy she had spent hours that day searching for the name of the owner he had shielded himself well under a tangle of corporations the paper trail took frustrating twists and turns so far every lead deborah had pursued had come up hard at a dead end but the shop was real by tomorrow the day after at the latest she would have a court order the police would search every nook and cranny of timeless the books would be confiscated she would have everything she needed to indict she walked closer to the dark window something made her turn quickly to peer out at the light and shadow of the street behind her traffic rolled noisily by arm in arm a laughing couple strolled along the opposite sidewalk the sound of music through open car windows was loud and confused punctuated by the honking of horns and the occasional squeak of brakes normal deborah reminded herself there was nothing here to cause that itch between her shoulder blades yet even as she scanned the street the adjoining buildings to assure herself no one was paying any attention to her the feeling of being watched persisted she was giving herself the creeps deborah decided these little licks of fear were left over from her night in the alley and she didnt care for it it wasnt possible to live your life too spooked to go out at night so paranoid you looked around every corner before you took that last step around it at least it wasnt possible for her most of her life she had been cared for looked after even pampered by her older sister though she would always be grateful to cilia she had made a commitment when she had left denver for urbana to leave her mark that couldnt be done if she ran from shadows determined to fight her own uneasiness she skirted around the building walking quickly through the short narrow alley between the antique store and the boutique beside it the rear of the building was as secure and unforthcoming as the front there was one window enforced with steel bars and a pair of wide doors triple bolted here there were no streetlamps to relieve the dark you dont look stupid at the voice she jumped back and would have tumbled into a line of garbage cans if a hand hadnt snagged her wrist she opened her mouth to scream brought her fist up to fight when she recognized her companion you he was in black hardly visible in the dark but she knew i would have thought youd had your fill of back alleys he didnt release her though he knew he should his fingers braceleted her wrist and felt the fast hot beat of her blood youve been watching me there are some women its difficult to look away from he pulled her closer just a tug on her wrist and stunned both of them his voice was low and rough she could see anger in the gleam of his eyes she found the combination oddly compelling what are you doing here her mouth was so dry it ached he had pulled her so close that their thighs met she could feel the warm flutter of his breath on her lips to insure some distance and some control she put a hand to his chest her hand didnt pass through but met a warm solid wall felt the quick steady beat of a heart thats my business your business is to prepare cases and try them in court not to play detective im not playing she broke off eyes narrowing how do you know im a lawyer i know a great deal about you miss oroarke his smile was thin and humorless thats my business i dont think your sister worked to put you through law school and saw you graduate at the top of your class to have you sneaking around back entrances of locked buildings especially when that building is a front for some particularly ugly commerce you know about this place as i said i know a great deal she would handle his intrusion into her life later now she had a job to do if you have any information any proof about this suspected drug operation its your duty to give that information to the das office im very aware of my duty it doesnt include making deals with scum heat rushed to her cheeks she didnt even question how he knew about her interview with parino it was enough more than enough that he was holding her integrity up to inspection i worked within the law she snapped at him which is more than you can say you put on a mask and play captain america making up your own rules that makes you part of the problem not part of the solution in the slits of his mask his eyes narrowed you seemed grateful enough for my solution a few nights ago her chin came up she wished she could face him on her own ground in the light ive already thanked you for your help unnecessary though it was are you always so cocky miss oroarke confident she corrected and do you always win in court i have an excellent record do you always win he repeated no but thats not the point thats exactly the point theres a war in this city miss oroarke and youve appointed yourself general of the good guys he didnt smile no i fight alone dont you but he cut her off swiftly putting a gloved hand over her mouth he listened but not with his ears it wasnt something he heard but something he felt as some men felt hunger or thirst love or hate or from centuries ago when their senses were not dulled by civilization danger before she had even begun to struggle against him he pulled her aside and shoved her down beneath him behind the wall of the next building what the hell do you think youre doing the explosion that came on the tail of her words made her ears ring the flash of light made her pupils contract before she could close her eyes against the glare she saw the jagged shards of flying glass the missiles of charred brick beneath her the ground trembled as the antique store exploded she saw with horror and fascination a lethal chunk of concrete crash only three feet from her face are you all right when she didnt answer only trembled he took her face in his hand and turned it to his deborah are you all right he repeated her name twice before the glassy look left her eyes yes she managed are you dont you read the papers there was the faintest of smiles around his mouth im invulnerable right with a little sigh she tried to sit up for a moment he didnt move but left his body where it was where it wanted to be fitted against hers his face was only inches away he wondered what would happen to both of them if he closed that distance and let his mouth meet hers he was going to kiss her deborah realized and went perfectly still emotion swarmed through her not anger as shed expected but excitement raw and wild it pumped through her so quickly so hugely it blocked out everything else with a little murmur of agreement she lifted her hand to his cheek her fingers brushed his mask he pulled back from her touch as if hed been slapped shifting he rose then helped her to her feet fighting a potent combination of humiliation and fury she stepped around the wall toward the rear of the antique shop there was little left of it brick glass and concrete were scattered inside the crippled building fire raged the roof collapsed with a long loud groan theyve beaten you this time he murmured there wont be anything left for you to find no papers no drugs no records theyve destroyed a building she said between her teeth she hadnt wanted to be kissed she told herself shed been shaken up dazed a victim of temporary insanity but someone owns it and ill find out who that is this was meant as a warning miss oroarke one you might want to consider i wont be frightened off not by exploding buildings or by you she turned to face him but wasnt surprised that he was gone chapter contents prev next it was after one in the morning when deborah dragged herself down the hallway toward her apartment shed spent the best part of two hours answering questions giving her statement to the police and avoiding reporters even through the fatigue was a nagging annoyance toward the man called nemesis technically hed saved her life again if shed been standing within ten feet of the antique shop when the bomb had gone off she would certainly have met a nasty death but then hed left her holding the bag a very large complicated bag shed been forced to sort through assistant da or not for the police added to that was the fact he had shown in the short pithy conversation theyd had that he held no respect for her profession or her judgment she had studied and worked toward the goal of prosecutor since shed been eighteen now with a shrug he was dismissing those years of her life as wasted no she thought as she dug in her purse for her keys he preferred to skulk around the streets meting out his own personal sense of justice well it didnt wash and before it was over she was going to prove to him that the system worked and she would prove to herself that she hadnt been the least bit attracted to him you look like you had a rough night keys in hand deborah turned her acrossthehall neighbor mrs greenbaum was standing in her open doorway peering out through a pair of cherryred framed glasses mrs greenbaum what are you doing up just finished watching david letterman that boy cracks me up at seventy with a comfortable pension to buffer her against lifes storms lil greenbaum kept her own hours and did as she pleased at the moment she was wearing a tatty terrycloth robe charles and di bedroom slippers and a bright pink bow in the middle of her hennaed hair you look like you could use a drink how about a nice hot toddy deborah was about to refuse when she realized a hot toddy was exactly what she wanted she smiled dropped the keys into her jacket pocket and crossed the hall make it a double already got the hot water on you just sit down and kick off your shoes mrs greenbaum patted her hand then scurried off to the kitchen grateful deborah sank into the deep cushions of the couch the television was still on with an old blackandwhite movie flickering on the screen deborah recognized a young cary grant but not the film mrs greenbaum would know she mused lil greenbaum knew everything the twobedroom apartment mrs greenbaum kept a second bedroom ready for any of her numerous grandchildren was both cluttered and tidy tables were packed with photographs and trinkets there was a lava lamp atop the television with a huge brass peace symbol attached to its base lil was proud of the fact that shed marched against the establishment in the sixties just as she had protested nuclear reactors star wars the burning of rain forests and the increased cost of medicare she liked to protest shed often told deborah when you could argue against the system it meant you were still alive and kicking here we are she brought out two slightly warped ceramic mugs the product of one of her younger childrens creativity she flicked a glance at the television penny serenade and oh wasnt that cary grant something after setting down the mugs she picked up her remote and shut the tv off now what trouble have you been getting yourself into it shows mrs greenbaum took a comfortable sip of whiskeylaced tea your suits a mess she leaned closer and took a sniff smells like smoke got a smudge on your cheek a run in your stocking and fire in your eyes from the look in them theres got to be a man involved the upd could use you mrs greenbaum deborah sipped at the tea and absorbed the hot jolt i was doing a little legwork the building i was checking out blew up the lively interest in mrs greenbaums eyes turned instantly to concern youre not hurt no few bruises they would match the ones shed gotten the week before i guess my ego suffered a little i ran into nemesis deborah hadnt mentioned her first encounter because she was painfully aware of her neighbors passionate admiration for the man in black behind the thick frames mrs greenbaums eyes bulged you actually saw him i saw him spoke to him and ended up being tossed to the concrete by him just before the building blew up god lil pressed a hand to her heart thats even more romantic than when i met mr greenbaum at the pentagon rally it had nothing to do with romance the man is impossible very likely a maniac and certainly dangerous hes a hero mrs greenbaum shook a scarlettipped finger at deborah you havent learned to recognize heroes yet thats because we dont have enough of them today she crossed her feet so that princess di grinned up at deborah so what does he look like the reports have all been mixed one day hes an eightfoot black man another hes a palefaced vampire complete with fangs just the other day i read he was a small green woman with red eyes hes not a woman deborah muttered she could remember a bit too clearly the feel of his body over hers and i cant really say what he looks like it was dark and most of his face was masked like zorro mrs greenbaum said hopefully no well i dont know maybe she gave a little sigh and decided to indulge her neighbor hes sixone or sixtwo i suppose lean but well built what color is his hair it was covered i could see his jawline strong tensed and his mouth it had hovered for one long exciting moment over hers nothing special she said quickly and gulped more tea hmm mrs greenbaum had her own ideas shed been married and widowed twice and in between had enjoyed what she considered her fair share of affairs and romantic entanglements she recognized the signs his eyes you can always tell the make of a man by his eyes though id rather look at his tush deborah chuckled dark dark what just dark he keeps to the shadows slipping through the shadows to root out evil and protect the innocent whats more romantic than that hes bucking the system my point exactly it doesnt get bucked enough im not saying he hasnt helped a few people but we have trained law enforcement officers to do that she frowned into her mug there hadnt been any cops around either time she had needed help they couldnt be everywhere and she probably could have handled both situations herself probably she used her last and ultimate argument he doesnt have any respect for the law i think youre wrong i think he has great respect for it he just interprets it differently than you do again she patted deborahs hand youre a good girl deborah a smart girl but youve trained yourself to walk down a very narrow path you should remember that this country was founded on rebellion we often forget then we become fat and lazy until someone comes along and questions the status quo we need rebels just as we need heroes it would be a dull sad world without them maybe though she was far from convinced but we also need rules oh yes mrs greenbaum grinned we need rules how else could we break them gage kept his eyes closed as his driver guided the limo across town through the night after the explosion and the day that followed he had thought of a dozen reasons why he should cancel his date with deborah oroarke they were all very practical very logical very sane reasons to offset them had been only one impractical illogical and potentially insane reason he needed her she was interfering with his work both day and night since the moment hed seen her he hadnt been able to think of anyone else hed used his vast network of computers to dig out every scrap of available information on her he knew shed been born in atlanta twentyfive years before he knew she had lost her parents tragically and brutally at the age of twelve her sister had raised her and together they had hopscotched across the country the sister worked in radio and was now station manager at khip in denver where deborah had gone to college deborah had passed the bar the first time and had applied for a position in the das office in urbana where she had earned a reputation for being thorough meticulous and ambitious he knew she had had one serious love affair in college but he didnt know what had ended it she dated a variety of men none seriously he hated the fact that that one last piece of information had given him tremendous relief she was a danger to him he knew it understood it and seemed unable to avoid it even after their encounter the night before when she had come within a hairs breadth of making him lose control of his temper and his desire he wasnt able to shove her out of his mind to go on seeing her was to go on deceiving her and himself but when the car pulled to the curb in front of her building he got out walked into the lobby and took the elevator up to her floor when deborah heard the knock she stopped pacing the living room for the past twenty minutes shed been asking herself why she had agreed to go out with a man she barely knew and one with a reputation of being a connoisseur of women but married to his business shed fallen for the charm she admitted that smooth careless charm with the hint of underlying danger maybe shed even been intrigued and challenged by his tendency to dominate she stood for a moment hand on the knob it didnt matter she assured herself it was only one evening a simple dinner date she wasnt naive and wideeyed and expected no more than good food and intelligent conversation she wore blue somehow hed known she would the deep midnightblue silk of her dinner suit matched her eyes the skirt was snug and short celebrating the length of long smooth legs the tailored almost mannish jacket made him wonder if she wore more silk or simply her skin beneath it the lamp she had left on beside the door caught the gleam of the waterfall of blue and white stones she wore at her ears the easy flattery he was so used to dispensing lodged in his throat youre prompt he managed always she smiled at him its like a vice she closed the door behind her without inviting him in it seemed safer that way a few moments later she settled back in the limo and vowed to enjoy herself do you always travel this way no just when it seems more convenient unable to resist she slipped off her shoes and let her feet sink into the deep pewter carpet i would no hassling for cabs or scurrying to the subway but you miss a lot of life on and under the streets she turned to him in his dark suit and subtly striped tie he looked elegant and successful there were burnished gold links at the cuffs of his white shirt youre not going to tell me you ride the subway he only smiled when it seems most convenient you dont believe that money should be used as an insulator against reality no no i dont but she was surprised he didnt actually ive never had enough to be tempted to try it you wouldnt be he contented himself or tried by toying with the ends of her hair you could have gone into private practice with a dozen top firms at a salary that would have made your paycheck at the das office look like pin money you didnt she shrugged it off dont think there arent moments when i question my own sanity thinking it would be safer to move to more impersonal ground she glanced out the window where are we going to dinner im relieved to hear that since i missed lunch i meant where here he took her hand as the limo stopped they had driven to the very edge of the city to the world of old money and prestige here the sound of traffic was only a distant echo and there was the light delicate scent of roses in bloom deborah stifled a gasp as she stepped onto the curb she had seen pictures of his home but it was entirely different to be faced with it it loomed over the street spreading for half a block it was gothic in style having been built by a philanthropist at the turn of the century shed read somewhere that gage had purchased it before hed been released from the hospital towers and turrets rose up into the sky high mullioned windows gleamed with the sun that was lowering slowly in the west terraces jutted out then danced around corners the top story was dominated by a huge curving glass where one could stand and look out over the entire city i see you take the notion that a mans home is his castle literally i like space and privacy but i decided to postpone the moat with a laugh she walked up to the carved doors at the entrance would you like a tour before we eat are you kidding she hooked her arm through his where do we start he led her through winding corridors under lofty ceilings into rooms both enormous and cramped and he couldnt remember enjoying his home more than now seeing it through her eyes there was a twolevel library packed with books from first editions to dogeared paperbacks parlors with curvy old couches and delicate porcelain ming vases tang horses lalique crystal and mayan pottery walls were done in rich deep colors offset by gleaming wood and impressionist paintings the east wing held a tropical greenery an indoor pool and a fully equipped gymnasium with a separate whirlpool and sauna through another corridor up a curving staircase there were bedrooms furnished with fourposters or heavy carved headboards she stopped counting rooms more stairs then a huge office with a black marble desk and a wide sheer window that was growing rosy with sundown computers silent and waiting a music room complete with a white grand piano and an old wurlitzer jukebox almost dizzy she stepped into a mirrored ballroom and stared at her own multiplied reflection above a trio of magnificent chandeliers blazed with sumptuous light its like something out of a movie she murmured i feel as though i should be wearing a hooped skirt and a powdered wig no he touched her hair again i think it suits you just fine as it is with a shake of her head she stepped further inside then went with impulse and turned three quick circles its incredible really dont you ever get the urge to just come into this room and dance not until now surprising himself as much as her he caught her around the waist and swung her into a waltz she should have laughed have shot him an amused and flirtatious look and have taken the impulsive gesture for what it was but she couldnt all she could do was stare up at him stare into his eyes as he spun her around and around the mirrored room her hand lay on his shoulder her other caught firmly in his their steps matched though she gave no thought to them she wondered foolishly if he heard the same music in his head that she did he heard nothing but the steady give and take of her breathing never in his life could he remember being so totally so exclusively aware of one person the way her long dark lashes framed her eyes the subtle trace of bronze she had smudged on the lids the pale moist gloss of rose on her lips where his hand gripped her waist the silk was warm from her body and that body seemed to flow with his anticipating each step each turn her hair fanned out making him ache to let his hands dive into it her scent floated around him not quite sweet and utterly tempting he wondered if he would taste it if he pressed his lips to the long white column of her throat she saw the change in his eyes the deepening the darkening of them as desire grew as her steps matched his so did her need she felt it build and spread like a living thing until her body thrummed with it she leaned toward him wondering he stopped for a moment they stood reflected dozens and dozens of times a man and a woman caught in a tentative embrace on the brink of something neither of them understood she moved first a cautious halfstep in retreat it was her nature to think carefully before making any decision his hand tightened on hers for some reason she thought it was a warning i my heads spinning very slowly his hand slipped away from her waist and the embrace was broken then id better feed you yes she nearly managed to smile youd better they dined on sauteed shrimp flavored with orange and rosemary though hed shown her the enormous dining room with its heavy mahogany servers and sideboards they took their meal in a small salon at a table by a curved window between sips of champagne they could watch the sunset over the city on the table between them were two slender white candles and a single red rose its beautiful here she commented the city you can see all its possibilities and none of its problems sometimes it helps to take a step back he stared out at the city himself then turned away as if dismissing it or else those problems can eat you alive but youre still aware of them i know you donate a lot of money to the homeless and rehabilitation centers and other charities its easy to give money away when you have more than you need that sounds cynical realistic his smile was cool and easy im a businessman deborah donations are tax deductible she frowned studying him it would be a great pity i think if people were only generous when it benefited them now you sound like an idealist riled she tapped a finger against the champagne goblet thats the second time in a matter of days youve accused me of that i dont think i like it it wasnt meant as an insult just an observation he glanced up when frank came in with individual chocolate soufflés we wont need anything else tonight the big man shrugged okay deborah noted that frank moved with a dancers grace an odd talent in a man who was big and bulky thoughtful she dipped a spoon into the dessert is he your driver or your butler she asked both and neither he topped off her wine you might say hes an associate from a former life intrigued she lifted a brow which means he was a pickpocket i collared a time or two when i was a cop then he was my snitch now he drives my car and answers my door among other things she noted that gages fingers fit easily around the slender stem of the crystal glass its hard to imagine you working the streets he grinned at her yes i suppose it is he watched the way the candlelight flickered in her eyes last night he had seen the reflection of fire there from the burning building and her own smothered desires how long were you a cop one night too long he said flatly then reached for her hand would you like to see the view from the roof yes i would she pushed back from the table understanding that the subject of his past was a closed book rather than the stairs he took her up in a small smokedglass elevator all the comforts she said as they started their ascent im surprised the place doesnt come equipped with a dungeon and secret passageways oh but it does perhaps ill show you another time another time she thought did she want there to be another time it had certainly been a fascinating evening and with the exception of that moment of tension in the ballroom a cordial one yet despite his polished manners she sensed something restless and dangerous beneath the tailored suit that was what attracted her she admitted just as that was what made her uneasy what are you thinking she decided it was best to be perfectly honest i was wondering who you were and if i wanted to stick around long enough to find out the doors to the elevator whispered open but he stayed where he was and do you im not sure she stepped out and into the topmost turret of the building with a sound of surprise and pleasure she moved toward the wide curve of glass beyond it the sun had set and the city was all shadow and light its spectacular she turned to him smiling just spectacular it gets better he pushed a button on the wall silently magically the curved glass parted taking her hand he led her onto the stone terrace beyond setting her palms on the stone railing she leaned out into the hot wind that stirred the air you can see the trees in city park and the river impatiently she brushed her blowing hair out of her eyes the buildings look so pretty with their lights on in the distance she could see the twinkling lights of the dover heights suspension bridge they draped like a necklace of diamonds against the dark at dawn when its clear the buildings are pearly gray and rose and the sun turns all the glass into fire she looked at him and the city he faced is that why you bought the house for the view i grew up a few blocks from here whenever we walked in the park my aunt would always point it out to me she loved this house shed been to parties here as a child she and my mother they had been friends since childhood i was the only child for my parents and then for my aunt and uncle when i came back and learned they were gone well i couldnt think of much of anything at first then i began to think about this house it seemed right that i take it live in it she laid a hand over his on the rail theres nothing more difficult is there than to lose people you love and need no when he looked at her he saw that her eyes were dark and glowing with her own memories and with empathy for his he brought a hand to her face skimming back her hair with his fingers molding her jawline with his palm her hand fluttered up to light on his wrist and trembled her voice was just as unsteady i should go yes you should but he kept his hand on her face his eyes on hers as he shifted to trap her body between his and the stone parapet his free hand slid gently up her throat until her face was framed have you ever been compelled to take a step that you knew was a mistake you knew but you couldnt stop a haze was drifting over her mind and she shook her head to clear it i no no i dont like to make mistakes but she already knew she was about to make one his palms were rough and warm against her skin his eyes were so dark so intense for a moment she blinked assaulted by a powerful sense of deja vu but shed never been here before she assured herself as he skimmed his thumbs over the sensitive skin under her jawline neither do i she moaned and shut her eyes but he only brushed his lips over her brow the light whisper of contact shot a spear of reaction through her in the hot night she shuddered while his mouth moved gently over her temple i want you his voice was rough and tense as his fingers tightened in her hair her eyes were open again wide and aware in his she could see edgy desire i can barely breathe from wanting you youre my mistake deborah the one i never thought i would make his mouth came down on hers hard and hungry with none of the teasing seduction she had expected and told herself she would have resisted there was nothing of the smooth and sophisticated man she had dined with here this was the reckless and dangerous man she had caught only glimpses of he frightened her he fascinated her he seduced her with no hesitation no caution no thought she responded meeting power for power and need for need she didnt feel the rough stone against her back only the hard long length of him as his body pressed to hers she could taste the zing of wine on his tongue and something darker the potent flavor of passion barely in check with a groan of pleasure she pulled him closer until she could feel his heart thudding against hers beat for beat she was more than he had dreamed all silk and scent and long limbs her mouth was heated yielding against his then demanding her hands slid under his jacket fingers flexing even as her head fell back in a taunting surrender that drove him mad a pulse hammered in her throat enticing him to press his lips there and explore the new texture the new flavor before he brought his mouth back to hers with teeth he nipped with tongue he soothed pushing them closer and closer to the edge of reason he swallowed her gasp as he stroked his hands down her seeking cupping molding he felt her shudder then his own before he forced himself to grip tight to a last thin line of control very cautiously like a man backing away from a sheer drop he stepped away from her dazed deborah brought a hand to her head fighting to catch her breath she stared at him what kind of power did he have she wondered that he could turn her from a sensible woman into a trembling puddle of need she turned learning over the rail and gulping air as though it were water and she dying of thirst i dont think im ready for you she managed at length no i dont think im ready for you either but there wont be any going back she shook her head her palms were pressed so hard into the rail that the stone was biting her skin ill have to think about that once youve turned certain corners theres no place to go but forward calmer she turned back to him it was time past time to set the ground rules for both of them gage however it might appear after what just happened i dont have affairs with men i hardly know good he too was calmer his decision was made when we have ours i want it to be exclusive her voice chilled obviously im not making myself clear i havent decided if i want to be involved with you and im a long way from sure if id want that involvement to end up in bed you are involved with me reaching out he cupped the back of her neck before she could evade and we both want that involvement to end up in bed very deliberately she reached up and removed his hand i realize youre used to women falling obligingly at your feet i have no intention of joining the horde and i make up my own mind should i kiss you again no she threw a hand up and planted it solidly against his chest in an instant she was reminded of how she had stood just like this with the man called nemesis the comparison left her shaken no it was a lovely evening gage she took a long steadying breath i mean that i enjoyed the company the dinner and and the view id hate to see you spoil it completely by being arrogant and argumentative its not being either to accept the inevitable i dont have to like it to accept it something flickered in his eyes there is such a thing as destiny deborah i had a long time to consider and to come to terms with that his brows drew together in a frown as he looked at her god help both of us but youre part of mine he looked back then offered a hand ill take you home chapter contents prev next groaning her eyes firmly shut deborah groped for the shrilling phone on her nightstand she knocked over a book a brass candlestick and a notepad before she managed to snag the receiver and drag it under the pillow hello oroarke she cleared her throat yes mitchell here weve got a problem problem she shoved the pillow off her head and squinted at her alarm clock the only problem she could see was that her boss was calling her at am has the slagerman trial been postponed im scheduled for court at nine no its parino parino scrubbing a hand over her face she struggled to sit up what about him hes dead dead she shook her head to clear her groggy brain what do you mean hes dead as in doornail mitchell said tersely guard found him about half an hour ago she wasnt groggy now but was sitting ramrod straight brain racing but but how knifed looks like he went up to the bars to talk to someone and they shoved a stiletto through his heart oh god nobody heard anything nobody saw anything mitchell said in disgust there was a note taped to the bars it said dead birds dont sing somebody leaked that he was feeding us information and you can bet that im going to find out who listen oroarke were not going to be able to muzzle the press on this one i figured youd want to hear it from me instead of on the news during your morning coffee yeah she pressed a hand to her queasy stomach yeah thanks what about santiago no show yet weve got feelers out but if hes gone to ground it might be a while before we dig him up theyll be after him too she said quietly whoever arranged for parino to be murdered will be after ray santiago then well just have to find him first youre going to have to shake this off he told her i know its a tough break all around but the slagerman case is your priority now the guys got himself a real slick lawyer i can handle it never figured otherwise give him hell kid yeah yeah i will deborah hung up and stared blankly into space until her alarm went off at hey hey beautiful jerry bower charged up the courthouse steps after deborah boy thats concentration he panted when he finally snagged her arm and stopped her ive been calling you for half a block sorry im due in court in fifteen minutes he gave her a quick smiling goingover shed pinned her hair back into a simple twist and wore pearl buttons at her ears her red linen suit was severely tailored and still managed to show off each subtle curve the result was competent professional and completely feminine if i was on the jury id give you a guilty verdict before you finished your opening statement you look incredible im a lawyer she said tightly not miss november hey he had to race up three more steps to catch her hey look im sorry that was a poorly phrased compliment she found a slippery hold on her temper no im sorry im a little touchy this morning i heard about parino with a grim nod deborah continued up the steps to the high carved doors of city courthouse news travels fast he was a walking statistic deb you cant let it get to you he deserved his day in court she said as she crossed the marble floor of the lobby and started toward a bank of elevators even he deserved that i knew he was afraid but i didnt take it seriously enough do you think it would have mattered i dont know it was that single question she would have to live with i just dont know look the mayors got a tough schedule today theres this dinner tonight but i can probably slip out before the brandy and cigar stage how about a late movie im lousy company jerry you know that doesnt matter it matters to me a ghost of a smile touched her lips id bite your head off again and hate myself she stepped into the elevator counselor jerry grinned and gave her a thumbsup before the doors slid shut the press was waiting for her on the fourth floor deborah had expected no less moving quickly she waded through them dispensing curt answers and no comments do you really expect to get a jury to convict a pimp for knocking around a couple of his girls i always expect to win when i go into court are you going to put the prostitutes on the stand former prostitutes she corrected and let the question go unanswered is it true mitchell assigned you to this case because youre a woman the da doesnt choose his prosecutors by their sex do you feel responsible for the death of carl parino that stopped her on the threshold of the courtroom she looked around and saw the reporter with curly brown hair hungry brown eyes and a sarcastic smirk chuck wisner shed run foul of him before and would again in his daily column in the world he preferred the sensational to the factual the das office regrets that carl parino was murdered and not allowed his day in court in a quick practiced move he blocked her way but do you feel responsible after all youre the one who turned the deal she choked back the urge to defend herself and met his eyes levelly were all responsible mr wisner excuse me he simply shifted crowding her back from the door any more encounters with nemesis what can you tell us about your personal experiences with the citys newest hero she could feel her temper begin to fray strand by strand worse she knew that was exactly what he was hoping for nothing that could compete with your fabrications now if youll move aside im busy not too busy to socialize with gage guthrie are you and he romantically involved it makes a wild kind of triangle doesnt it nemesis you guthrie get a life chuck she suggested then elbowed him aside she barely had enough time to settle behind the prosecutors table and open her briefcase when the jury filed in she and the defense counsel had taken two days to select them and she was satisfied with the mix of genders and races and walks of life still she would have to convince those twelve men and women that a couple of prostitutes deserved justice turning slightly she studied the two women in the first row they had both followed her instructions and dressed simply with a minimum of makeup and hair spray she knew they were on trial today as much as the man charged with assault and battery they huddled together two young pretty women who might have been mistaken for college students deborah sent them a reassuring smile before she shifted again james p slagerman sat at the defense table he was thirtytwo dashingly blond and handsome in a dark suit and tie he looked precisely like what he claimed he was a young executive his escort service was perfectly legitimate he paid his taxes contributed to charity and belonged to the jaycees it would be deborahs primary job to convince the jury that he was no different than a street pimp taking his cut from the sale of a womans body until she did that she had no hope of convicting him on assault as the bailiff announced the judge the courtroom rose deborah kept her opening statement brief working the jury dispensing facts she didnt attempt to dazzle them she was already aware that this was the defense counsels style instead she would underplay drawing their attention with the contrast of simplicity she began her direct examination by calling the doctor who had attended marjorie lovitz with a few brief questions she established the extent of marjories injuries on the night she and suzanne mcroy had been brought into emergency she wanted the jury to hear of the broken jaw the blackened eyes the cracked ribs even before she entered the photographs taken of the women that night into evidence she picked her way slowly carefully through the technicalities doctors ambulance attendants uniformed cops social workers she weathered her opponents parries by the noon recess she had laid her groundwork she hustled marjorie and suzanne into a cab and took them across town for lunch and a last briefing do i have to go on the stand today miss oroarke marjorie fidgeted in her seat and ate nothing though her bruises had faded over the weeks since the beating her jaw still tended to ache maybe what the doctors and all said was enough and suzanne and i wont have to testify marjorie she laid a hand over the girls and found it icecold and trembly theyll listen to the doctors and theyll look at the pictures theyll believe you and suzanne were beaten but its you both of you who will convince them that slagerman was the one who did it that he is not the nice young businessman he pretends to be without you hell walk away and do it again suzanne bit her lip jimmy says hes going to get off anyway that people will know were whores even though you helped us get regular jobs he says when its over hes going to find us and hurt us real bad when did he say that he called last night marjories eyes filled with tears he found out where were living and he called he said he was going to mess us up she wiped at a tear with the heel of her hand he said he was going to make us wish wed never started this i dont want him to hurt me again he wont i cant help you unless you help me unless you trust me for the next hour she talked soothing bullying cajoling and promising at two oclock both frightened women were back in court the state calls marjorie lovitz deborah announced and flicked a cool glance at slagerman gage slipped into the courtroom just as she called her first witness for the afternoon session hed had to cancel two meetings in order to be there the need to see her had been a great deal stronger than the need to hear quarterly reports it had been gage admitted stronger than any need he had ever experienced for three days hed kept his distance three very long days life was often a chess match he thought and you took what time you needed to work out your next move he chose a seat in the rear of the courtroom and settled back to watch her work how old are you marjorie deborah asked twentyone have you always lived in urbana no i grew up in pennsylvania with a few casual questions she helped marjorie paint a picture of her background the poverty the unhappiness the parental abuse when did you come to the city about four years ago when you were seventeen why did you come i wanted to be an actress that sounds pretty dumb but i used to be in plays in school i thought it would be easy was it no no it was hard real hard most of the time i didnt even get to audition you know and i ran out of money i got a job waiting tables parttime but it wasnt enough they turned off the heat and the lights did you ever think of going home i couldnt my mother said if i took off then she was done with me and i guess i thought i still thought i could do okay if i just got a break did you get one i thought i did this guy came into the grill where i worked we got kind of friendly talking you know i told him how i was an actress he said hed known it as soon as hed seen me and what was i doing working in a dump like that when i was so pretty and so talented he told me he knew lots of people and that if i came to work for him hed introduce me he gave me a business card and everything is the man you met that night in the courtroom marjorie sure it was jimmy she looked down quickly at her twisting fingers jimmy slagerman did you go to work for him yeah i went the next day to his offices he had a whole suite all these desks and phones and leather chairs a real nice place uptown he called it elegant escorts he said i could make a hundred dollars a night just by going to dinner and parties with these businessmen he even bought me clothes pretty clothes and had my hair done and everything and for this hundred dollars a night all you had to do was go to dinner or parties thats what he told me at first and did that change after a while he took me out to nice restaurants and places dress rehearsals he called them he bought me flowers and did you have sex with him objection irrelevant your honor the witnesss relationship her physical relationship with the defendant is very relevant overruled youll answer the question miss lovitz yes i went to bed with him he treated me so nice after he gave me money for the bills he said and you accepted it yes i guess i knew what was going on i knew but i pretended i didnt a few days later he told me he had a customer for me he said i was to dress up real nice and go out to dinner with this man from dc what instructions were you given by mr slagerman he said marjorie youre going to have to earn that hundred dollars i said i knew that and he told me i was going to have to be real nice to this guy i said i would did mr slagerman define nice for you marjorie she hesitated then looked down at her hands again he said i was to do whatever i was told that if the guy wanted me to go back to his hotel after i had to go or i wouldnt get my money it was all acting he said i acted like i enjoyed the guys company like i was attracted to him and i acted like i had a great time in bed with him did mr slagerman specifically tell you that you would be required to have sex with this customer he said it was part of the job the same as smiling at bad jokes and if i was good at it hed introduce me to this director he knew and you agreed he made it sound okay yes and were there other occasions when you agreed to exchange sex for money in your capacity as an escort for mr slagermans firm objection ill rephrase she flicked a glance at the jury did you continue in mr slagermans employ yes maam for how long three years and were you satisfied with the arrangement i dont know you dont know if you were satisfied i got used to the money marjorie said painfully honest and after a while you get so you can forget what youre doing if you think about something else when its going on and was mr slagerman happy with you sometimes fearful she looked up at the judge sometimes hed get real mad at me or one of the other girls there were other girls about a dozen sometimes more and what did he do when he got mad hed smack you around you mean hed hit you hed just go crazy and objection sustained did he ever strike you marjorie yes deborah let the simplicity of the answer hang over the jury will you tell me the events that took place on the night of february of this year as shed been instructed marjorie kept her eyes on deborah and didnt let them waver back to slagerman i had a job but i got sick the flu or something i had a fever and my stomach was really upset i couldnt keep anything down suzanne came over to take care of me suzanne suzanne mcroy she worked for jimmy too and we got to be friends i just couldnt get up and go to work so suzanne called jimmy to tell him her hands began to twist in her lap i could hear her arguing with him over the phone telling him i was sick suzanne said he could come over and see for himself if he didnt believe her and did he come over yes the tears started big silent drops that cruised down her cheeks he was really mad he was yelling at suzanne and she was yelling back telling him i was really sick that i had a fever like a hundred and two he said she licked her lips he said we were both lazy lying sluts i heard something crash and she was crying i got up but i was dizzy she rubbed the heel of her hands under her eyes smearing mascara he came into the bedroom he knocked me down you mean he bumped into you no he knocked me down backhanded me you know yes go on then he told me to get my butt up and get dressed he said the customer had asked for me i was going to do it he said all i had to do was lie on my back and close my eyes anyway she fumbled for a tissue blew her nose i told him i was sick that i couldnt do it he was yelling and throwing things then he said hed show me how it felt to be sick and he started hitting me where did he hit you everywhere in the face in the stomach mostly my face he just wouldnt stop did you call for help i couldnt i couldnt hardly breathe did you try to defend yourself i tried to crawl away but he kept coming after me kept hitting me i passed out when i woke up suzanne was there and her face was all bloody she called an ambulance gently deborah continued to question when she took her seat at the prosecutors table she prayed that marjorie would hold up under crossexamination after almost three hours on the witness stand marjorie was pale and shaky despite the defense counselors attempt to destroy her character she stepped down looking young and vulnerable and it was that picture deborah thought with satisfaction that would remain in the jurys mind excellent job counselor deborah turned her head and with twin pricks of annoyance and pleasure glanced up at gage what are you doing here watching you work if i ever need a lawyer im a prosecutor remember he smiled then ill just have to make sure i dont get caught breaking the law when she stood he took her hand a casual gesture even a friendly one she couldnt have said why it seemed so possessive can i offer you a lift dinner dessert a quiet evening and shed said he wouldnt tempt her again fat chance im sorry i have something to do tilting his head he studied her i think you mean it i do have work no i mean that youre sorry his eyes were so deep so warm she nearly sighed against my better judgment i am she started out of the courtroom into the hall just the lift then she sent him a quick exasperated look over her shoulder didnt i tell you once how i felt about persistent men yes but you had dinner with me anyway she had to laugh after all the tense hours in court it was a relief well since my cars in the shop i could use a lift he stepped into the elevator with her its a tough case youve taken on here and a reputation maker her eyes cooled really youre getting national press i dont take cases for clippings her voice was as frigid as her eyes if youre going to be in for the long haul youll have to develop a thicker skin my skins just fine thanks i noticed relaxed he leaned back against the wall i think anyone who knows you realizes the press is a byproduct not the purpose youre making a point here that no one no matter who or what they are should be victimized i hope you win she wondered why it should have unnerved her that he understood precisely what she was reaching for i will win she stepped out of the elevator into the marble lobby i like your hair that way he commented pleased to see hed thrown her off very cool very competent how many pins would i have to pull out to have it fall loose i dont think thats relevant he supplied it is to me everything about you is since i dont seem to be able to stop thinking about you she kept walking quickly it was typical she imagined that he would say such things to a woman in a lobby swarming with people and make her feel as though they were completely alone im sure youve managed to keep busy i noticed a picture of you in this mornings paper there was a blonde attached to your arm candidate tarringtons dinner party she set her teeth when he kept smiling you switch your allegiances quickly politically speaking i have no allegiances politically speaking i was interested to hear what fieldss opposition had to say i was impressed she remembered the lush blonde in the skinny black dress i bet this time he grinned im sorry you werent there i told you before i dont intend to be part of a horde at the wide glass doors she stopped braced speaking of hordes head up she walked into the crowd of reporters waiting on the courthouse steps they fired questions she fired answers still as annoyed as she was with him she was grateful to see gages big black limo with its hulk of a driver waiting at the curb mr guthrie whats your interest in this case i enjoy watching justice at work you enjoy watching gorgeous das at work wisner pushed his way through his associates to shove a recorder into gages face come on guthrie whats happening between you and darling deb hearing her low snarl gage put a warning hand on deborahs arm and turned to the reporter i know you dont i wisner smirked sure we ran into each other plenty in those bad old days when you worked for the city instead of owning it yeah wisner he summed the man up with one quick careless look maybe my memorys faulty but i dont recall you being as big a jerk then as you are now he bundled a chuckling deborah into the limo nicely done she said ill have to consider buying the world just to have the pleasure of firing him i have to admire the way you think with a sigh she slipped out of her shoes and shut her tired eyes she could get used to traveling this way she thought big cushy seats and mozart playing softly in the speakers a pity it wasnt reality my feet are killing me im going to have to buy a pedometer to see how many miles i put in during an average day in court will you come home with me if i promise you a foot massage she opened one eye hed be good at it she thought at massaging a womans foot or anything else that happened to ache no she shut her eye again i have to get back to my office and im sure there are plenty of other feet you can rub gage opened the glass long enough to give frank their destination is that what concerns you the other feet in my life she hated the fact that it did theyre your business i like yours your feet your legs your face and everything in between she ignored tried to ignore the quick frisson of response do you always try to seduce women in the back of limos would you prefer someplace else she opened both eyes some things she thought were better handled facetoface gage ive done some thinking about this situation his mouth curved charmingly situation yes she didnt chose to call it a relationship im not going to pretend im not attracted to you or that im not flattered you seem to be attracted to me but but he picked up her hand rubbed his lips over her knuckles the skin there smelled as fresh and clear as rainwater dont her breath caught when he turned her hand over to press a slow warm kiss in the palm dont do that i love it when youre cool and logical deborah it makes me crazy to see how quickly i can make you heat up he brushed his lips over her wrist and felt the fast thud of her pulse you were saying was she what woman could be cool and logical when he was looking at her touching her she snatched her hand away reminding herself that was precisely the problem i dont want this situation to go any further for several good reasons mmmhmm she knocked his hand away when he began to toy with the pearl at her ear i mean it i realize youre used to picking and discarding women like poker chips but im not interested so ante up with someone else yes she was heating up nicely thats a very interesting metaphor i could say that there are some winnings i prefer to hold on to rather than gamble with firing up she turned to him lets get this straight im not this weeks prize i have no intention of being wednesdays brunette following tuesdays blonde so were back to those feet again you might consider it a joke but i take my life personally and professionally very seriously maybe too seriously she stiffened thats my business the bottom line here is that im not interested in becoming one of your conquests im not interested in becoming tangled up with you in any way shape or form she glanced over when the limo glided to the curb and this is my stop he moved quickly surprising them both dragging her across the seat so that she lay across his lap im going to see to it that youre so tangled up youll never pull free hard and sure his mouth met hers she didnt struggle she didnt hesitate every emotion she had felt along the drive had been honed down to one desire irrevocable instantaneous irresistible her fingers dived into his hair as her mouth moved restless and hungry under his she wanted as she had never wanted before never dreamed of wanting the ache of it was so huge it left no room for reason the lightness of it was so clear it left no room for doubt there was only the moment and the taking he wasnt patient as he once had been instead his mouth was fevered as it raced over her face streaked down her throat with an urgent murmur she pulled his lips back to hers never before had he known anyone who had matched his needs so exactly there was a fire burning in her and he had only to touch to make it leap and spark hed known desire before but not this gnawing tearing desperation he wanted to drag her down on the seat pull and tug at that slim tidy suit until she was naked and burning beneath him but he also wanted to give her comfort and compassion and love he would have to wait until she was ready to accept it with real regret he gentled his hands and drew her away youre everything i want he told her and ive learned to take what i want her eyes were wide as the passion faded from them it was replaced by a dazed fear that disturbed him its not right she whispered its not right that you should be able to do this to me no its not right for either of us but its real i wont be controlled by my emotions we all are not me shaky she reached down for her shoes ive got to go he reached across her to unlatch the door you will belong to me she shook her head i have to belong to myself first climbing out she bolted gage watched her retreat before he opened his fisted hand he counted six hairpins and smiled deborah spent the evening with suzanne and marjorie in their tiny apartment over the chinese takeout shed supplied she discussed the case with them it helped pouring herself into her work helped it left little time to brood about gage and her response to him a response that worried her all the more since she had felt much the same stunning sexual pull toward another man because she wanted to turn to both she couldnt turn to either it was a matter of ethics to deborah when a woman began to doubt her ethics she had to doubt everything it helped to remind herself that there were things she could control her work her lifestyle her ambitions tonight she hoped to do something to control the outcome of the case she was trying each time the phone rang she answered it herself while marjorie and suzanne sat on the sofa hands clutched on the fifth call she hit pay dirt marjorie she took a chance no suzanne you bitch though a grim smile touched her lips she made her voice shake who is this you know damn well who it is its jimmy im not supposed to talk to you fine just listen if you think i messed you up before its nothing to what im going to do to you if you testify tomorrow you little slut i picked you up off the street where you were earning twenty a trick and set you up with high rolling johns i own you and dont you forget it do yourself a favor suze tell that tightassed da that youve changed your mind that you and marjorie lied about everything otherwise ill hurt you real bad understand yes she hung up and stared at the phone oh yeah i understand deborah turned to marjorie and suzanne keep your door locked tonight and dont go out he doesnt know it yet but he just hanged himself pleased with herself she left them it had taken a great deal of fast talking to get a tap on marjorie and suzannes line and it would take more to subpoena slagermans phone records but she would do it when slagerman took the stand in a few days both he and his defense counsel were in for a surprise she decided to walk a few blocks before trying to hunt up a cab the night was steamy even the buildings were sweating across town there was a cool room a cool shower a cool drink waiting but she didnt want to go home alone yet alone it would be too easy to think about her life about gage she had lost control in his arms in the afternoon that was becoming a habit she didnt care for it wasnt possible to deny that she was attracted to him more pulled toward him in a basic almost primitive way that was all but impossible to resist yet she also felt something a very strong something for a man who wore a mask how could she who had always prized loyalty fidelity above all else have such deep and dramatic feelings for two different men she hoped she could blame her own physicality to want a man wasnt the same as to need one she wasnt ready to need one much less two what she needed was control over her emotions her life her career for too much of her life she had been a victim of circumstance her parents tragic deaths and the depthless well of fear and grief that had followed it the demands of her sisters job that had taken them both from city to city to city now she was making her own mark in her own way in her own time for the past eighteen months she had worked hard with a singleminded determination to earn and deserve the reputation as a strong and honest representative of the justice system all she had to do was keep moving forward on the same straight path as she stepped into the shadows of the world building she heard someone whisper her name she knew that voice had heard it in her dreams dreams shed refused to acknowledge he seemed to flow out of the dark a shadow a silhouette then a man she could see his eyes the gleam of them behind the mask the longing came so quickly so strongly she nearly moaned aloud and when he took her hand to draw her into the shadows she didnt resist you seem to be making it a habit to walk the streets at night alone i had work automatically she pitched her voice low to match his are you following me he didnt answer but his fingers curled around hers in a way that spoke of possession what do you want its dangerous for you shed left her hair down he saw so that it flowed around her shoulders those who murdered parino will be watching you he felt her pulse jump but not with fear he recognized the difference between fear and excitement what do you know about parino they wont be bothered by the fact youre a woman not if youre in their way i dont want to see you hurt unable to help herself she leaned toward him why as helpless as she he lifted both of her hands to his lips he clutched them there his grip painfully tight his eyes met hers over them you know why it isnt possible but she didnt couldnt step away when he brushed a hand over her hair i dont know who you are i dont understand what you do sometimes neither do i she wanted badly to step into his arms to learn what it was like to be held by him to have his mouth hot on hers but there were reasons she told herself as she held back too many reasons she had to be strong strong enough not only to resist him but to use him tell me what you know about parino about his murder let me do my job leave it alone thats all i have to tell you you know something i can see it with a disgusted breath she stepped back she needed the distance enough of it so that she could hear her brain and remember that she was an officer of the court and he a wrench in the system in which she believed fervently its your duty to tell me i know my duty she tossed back her hair attracted to him hell no she was infuriated by him sure skulking around shadows dispensing your own personal sense of justice when and where the whim strikes thats not duty captain bonehead its ego when he didnt respond she let out a hiss of breath and stepped toward him again i could bring you up on charges for withholding information this is police business das business not a game no it isnt a game his voice remained low but she thought she caught hints of both amusement and annoyance but it has pawns i wouldnt like to see you used as one i can take care of myself so you continue to say youre out of your league this time counselor leave it alone he stepped back just hold on she rushed forward but he was gone damn it i wasnt finished arguing with you frustrated she kicked the side of the building missing his shin by inches leave it alone she muttered not on your life chapter contents prev next dripping swearing deborah rushed toward the door knocks at am were the same as phone calls at three in the morning they spelled trouble when she opened the door and found gage she knew her instincts had been on target get you out of the shower he asked her she pushed an impatient hand through her wet hair yes what do you want breakfast without waiting for an invitation he strolled inside very nice he decided shed used the soft cream of ivory with slashes of color emerald crimson sapphire in the upholstery of the low sofa in the scatter of rugs on the buffed wood floor he noted too that she had left a damp trail on that same floor looks like im about five minutes early realizing the belt of her robe was loose she snapped it tight no youre not because you shouldnt be here at all now but he cut her off with a long hard kiss mmm youre still wet she was surprised the water wasnt steaming off her surprised with the sudden urge that poured through her just to lay her head against his shoulder look i dont have time for this i have to be in court in two hours he said with a nod plenty of time for breakfast if you think im going to fix you breakfast youre doomed to disappointment i wouldnt dream of it he skimmed a glance down her short silky robe the single embrace had made him achingly aware that she wore nothing else i like you in blue you should always wear blue i appreciate the fashion advice but she broke off when another knock sounded ill get it he offered i can answer my own door she stomped over to it her temper fraying she was never at her best in the morning even when she only had herself to deal with id like to know who hung out the sign that said i was having an open house this morning wrenching the door open she was confronted by a whitejacketed waiter pushing an enormous tray ah that would be breakfast over by the window i think gage said gesturing the waiter in the lady likes a view yes sir mr guthrie deborah set her hands on her hips it was difficult to take a stand before seven in the morning but it had to be done gage i dont know what youre up to but it isnt going to work ive tried to make my position clear and at the moment i dont have the time or the inclination is that coffee yes smiling gage lifted the big silver pot and poured a cup the scent of it seduced her would you like some her mouth moved into a pout maybe you should like this blend crossing to her he held the cup under her nose its one of my personal favorites she sipped shut her eyes you dont play fair no she opened her eyes to study the waiter who moved briskly about his business what else is there shirred eggs grilled ham croissants orange juice fresh of course of course she hoped she wasnt drooling raspberries and cream oh she folded her tongue inside her mouth to keep it from hanging out would you like to sit she wasnt a weak woman deborah assured herself of that but there were rich and wonderful smells filling her living room i guess giving up she took one of the ladderback chairs the waiter had pulled up to the table gage passed the waiter a bill and gave him instructions to pick up the dishes in an hour she couldnt bring herself to complain when gage topped off her cup i suppose i should ask what brought all this on i wanted to see what you looked like in the morning he poured juice out of a crystal pitcher this seemed like the best way for now he toasted her with his cup his eyes lingering on her face free of makeup and unframed by her slickedback hair youre beautiful and youre charming she touched the petals of the red rose beside her plate but that doesnt change anything thoughtful she tapped a finger on the peachcolored cloth still i dont see any reason to let all this food go to waste youre a practical woman hed counted on it its one of the things i find most attractive about you i dont see whats attractive about being practical she cut a small slice of ham and slipped it between her lips his stomach muscles tightened it can be very attractive she did her best to ignore the tingles sprinting through her system and concentrate on a safer kind of hunger tell me do you always breakfast this extravagantly when it seems appropriate he laid a hand over hers your eyes are shadowed didnt you sleep well she thought of the long and restless night behind her no didnt the case she only shrugged her insomnia had had nothing to do with the case and everything to do with the man she had met in the shadows yet now she was here just as fascinated with just as frustrated by the man she sat with in the sunlight would you like to talk about it she glanced up in his eyes she saw patience understanding and something beneath it all she knew would burn to the touch no cautious she drew her hand away again he found himself enjoying the notsosubtle pursuit and retreat you work too hard i do what i have to do what about you i dont even know what you do not really buy and sell attend meetings read reports im sure its more complicated than that and often more boring thats hard to believe steam and fragrance erupted when he broke open a flaky croissant i build things buy things she wouldnt be put off that easily such as he smiled at her i own this building trojan enterprises owns this building right i own trojan oh her reaction delighted him most of the guthrie money came from real estate and thats still the basis weve diversified quite a bit over the past ten years so one branch handles the shipping another the mining another the manufacturing i see he wasnt an ordinary man she thought then again she didnt seem to be attracted to ordinary men lately youre a long way from the twentyfifth yeah a shadow flickered into his eyes looks that way he lifted a spoonful of berries and cream and offered it deborah let the fruit lie on her tongue a moment do you miss it he knew if he kissed her now she would taste sharp fresh alive i dont let myself miss it theres a difference yes she understood it was the same way she didnt let herself miss her family those who were gone and those who were so many miles away youre very appealing when youre sad deborah he trailed finger over the back of her hand in fact irresistible im not sad you are irresistible dont start she made a production out of pouring more coffee can i ask you a business question sure if the owner or owners of a particular piece of property didnt want that ownership publicized could they hide it easily bury it in paper corporations in different tax numbers one corporation owns another another owns that and so on why but she leaned forward waving his question aside how difficult would it be to track down the actual owners that would depend on how much trouble theyd gone to and how much reason they had to keep their names off the books if someone was determined enough and patient enough those names could be found eventually if you found the common thread common thread a name a number a place something that would pop up over and over he would have been concerned by her line of questioning if he hadnt been one step ahead of her still it was best to be cautious what are you up to deborah my job very carefully he set his cup back in its saucer does this have anything to do with parino her eyes sharpened what do you know about parino i still have contacts at the twentyfifth dont you have enough to do with the slagerman trial i dont have the luxury of working on one case at a time this is one you shouldnt be working on at all excuse me her tone had dropped twenty degrees its dangerous the men who had parino murdered are dangerous you dont have any idea what youre playing with im not playing no and neither are they theyre well protected and wellinformed theyll know what your next move is before you do his eyes darkened seemed to turn inward if they see you as an obstacle theyll remove you very quickly very finally how do you know so much about the men who killed parino he brought himself back i was a cop remember this isnt something you should be involved in i want you to turn it over to someone else thats ridiculous he gripped her hand before she could spring up i dont want you hurt i wish people would stop saying that to me pulling her hand away she rose this is my case and its going to stay mine his eyes darkened but he remained seated ambition is another attractive trait deborah until you let it blind you she turned back to him slowly fury shimmering around her all right part of it is ambition but thats not all of it not nearly i believe in what i do gage and in my ability to do it well it started out with a kid named rico mendez he wasnt a pillar of the community in fact he was a petty thief who had already done time and would have done more but he was gunned down while standing on a street corner because he belonged to the wrong gang wore the wrong colors she began to pace her hands gesturing and emphasizing then his killer is killed because he talked to me because i made a deal with him so when does it stop when do we stop and say this is not acceptable ill take the responsibility and change it he stood then and came toward her im not questioning your integrity deborah just my judgment yes and my own his hands slid up inside the sleeves of her robe i care about you i dont think no dont dont think he covered her mouth with his his fingers tightening on her arms as he pulled her against him instant heat instant need how was she to fight it his body was so solid against hers his lips were so skilled and she could feel the waves not just of desire but of something deeper and truer pouring out of him and into her as if he were already inside her she was everything when he held her he didnt question the power she had to both empty his mind and fill it to sate his hunger even as she incited it she made him strong she left him weak with her he began almost to believe in miracles again when he stepped away his hands were still on her arms she struggled for balance how could he do this to her each time every time with only a touch im not ready for this she managed neither am i i dont think it matters he brought her close again i want to see you tonight he crushed his mouth to hers i want to be with you tonight no i cant she could hardly breathe the trial he bit back an oath all right after the trial is over neither one of us can keep walking away from this no he was right it was time to resolve it no we cant but i need time please dont push me i may have to he turned for the door but paused with his hand on the knob deborah is there someone else she started to deny it but found she could only be honest with him i dont know nodding he closed the door at his back with a bitter kind of irony he realized he was competing with himself she worked late that night poring over papers and law books at the desk in her bedroom after court she had spent hours cleaning her already clean apartment it was one of the best ways she knew to relieve tension or to ignore it the other was work and she had dived into it knowing sleep was impossible as she reached for her mug of coffee the phone rang hello oroarke deborah oroarke yes who is this santiago instantly alert she grabbed a pencil mr santiago weve been looking for you yeah right id like very much to talk to you the das office is prepared to offer you cooperationand protection like parino got she smothered the quick pang of guilt youll be safer with us than on your own maybe there was fear in his voice tight and nervy im willing to set up an interview any time you agree to come in no way im not going nowhere theyd hit me before i got two blocks he began to talk quickly words tumbling over each other you come to me listen i got more than parino had lots more i got names i got papers you want to hear about it sister you come to me all right ill have the police no cops his voice turned vicious with terror no cops or no deal you come and you come alone thats it well do it your way then when now right now im at the darcy hotel east th room give me twenty minutes youre sure this is where you want to go lady though his fare was wearing worn jeans and a tshirt the cabbie could see she had too much class for an armpit like the darcy deborah looked through the hard mean rain that was falling she could see the dark windows the scarred surface of the building and the deserted street yes i dont suppose i could convince you to wait no maam i didnt think so she pushed a bill through the slot in the thick security glass keep it taking a breath holding it she plunged into the rain and up the broken steps to the entrance in the lobby she stood dripping the checkin desk was behind rusty iron bars and was deserted there was a light shooting its yellow beam over the sticky linoleum floor the air smelled of sweat and garbage and something worse turning she started up the stairs a baby was crying in long steady wails the sound of misery rolled down the graffitiwashed stairwell deborah watched something small and quick scuttle past her foot and into a crack with a shudder she continued up she could hear a man and woman voices raised in a vicious argument as she turned into the hallway of the second floor a door creaked open she saw a pair of small frightened eyes before it creaked shut again and a chain rattled into place her feet crunched over broken glass that had once been the ceiling light down the dim hall she heard the badtempered squeal of brakes from a television car chase lightning flashed outside the windows as the storm broke directly overhead at room she stopped the raucous television boomed on the other side of the door lifting a hand she knocked hard mr santiago when she received no response she knocked and called again cautious she tried the knob the door opened easily in the gray flickering light of the television she saw a cramped room with one dingy window there were heaps of clothes and garbage the single dresser had a drawer missing there was the stench of beer gone hot and food gone bad she saw the figure stretched across the bed and swore not only would she have the pleasure of conducting an interview in this hellhole she would have to sober up her witness first annoyed she switched off the television so that there was only the sound of drumming rain and the shouts of the argument down the hall she spotted a stained sink bolted to the wall a chunk of its porcelain missing it would come in handy she thought if she could manage to hold santiagos head in it mr santiago she raised her voice as she picked her way across the room trying to avoid greasy takeout bags and spilled beer ray reaching him she started to shake him by the shoulder then noted his eyes were open im deborah oroarke she began then she realized he wasnt looking at her he wasnt looking at all lifting her trembling hand she saw it was wet with blood oh god she took one stumbling step back fighting down the hot nausea that churned in her stomach another drunken step then another she turned and all but ran into a small wellbuilt man with a mustache senorita he said quietly the police she managed we have to call the police hes dead i know he smiled she saw the glint of gold in his mouth and the glint of silver when he lifted the stiletto miss oroarke ive been waiting for you he grabbed her by the hair when she lunged toward the door she cried out in pain then was silent deathly still as she felt the prick of the knife at the base of her throat no one listens to screams in a place such as this he said and the gentleness in his voice made her shudder as he turned her to face him you are very beautiful senorita what a pity it would be to damage that cheek watching her he laid the shaft of the knife against it you will tell me por favor what parino discussed with you before his accident all names all details and with whom you shared this information struggling to think through her terror she looked into his eyes and saw her fate youll kill me anyway he smiled again wise and beautiful but there are ways and ways some are very slow very painful he glided the blade lightly down her cheek you will tell me what i need to know she had no names nothing to bargain with she had only her wits i wrote them down i wrote all of it down and locked it away and told no one she swallowed i told no one he studied her for a moment twirling the stiletto i think you lie perhaps after i show you what i can do with this youll be willing to cooperate ah that cheek like satin what a pity i must tear it even as she braced there was another flash of lighting and the sound of the window glass crashing he was there all in black illuminated by a new spear of lightning this time the thunder shook the room before she could so much as breathe the knife was at her throat and a beefy arm banded her waist come closer her captor warned and i will slit her throat from ear to ear nemesis stood where he was he didnt look at her didnt dare but in his minds eye he could see her face pale with fear eyes glazed with it was it her fear or his own that had made him unable to concentrate unable to come into the room as a shadow instead of a man if he was able to do so now to divorce himself from his fear for her and vanish would it be a weapon or would it cause the stiletto to strike home before he could act he hadnt been quick enough to save her now he had to be clever enough if you kill her you lose your shield a risk we both take no closer he slid the blade more truly against her throat until she whimpered there was fear now and fury if you hurt her i will do things to you that even in your own nightmares you have never imagined then he saw the face the full looping mustache the gleam of gold he was back back on the docks with the smell of fish and garbage the sound of water lapping he felt the hot explosion in his chest and nearly staggered i know you montega his voice was low harsh ive been looking for you for a long time so you have found me though his tone was arrogant deborah could smell his sweat it gave her hope put down your weapon i dont have a weapon nemesis said his hands held out from his sides i dont need one then you are a fool montega eased his arm from around deborahs waist and slipped a hand into his pocket just as the shot rang out nemesis lunged to the side it happened so fast afterward deborah couldnt be sure who had moved first she saw the bullet smash into the stained wallpaper and plaster of the wall saw nemesis fall with a strength fueled by rage and terror she slammed her elbow into montegas stomach more concerned with his new quarry than her he shoved her away her head struck the edge of the sink there was another flash of lightning then the dark deborah deborah i need you to open your eyes please she didnt want to small vicious explosions were going off behind them but the voice was so desperate so pleading she forced her eyelids to lift nemesis swam into focus he was holding her cradling her head rocking her for a moment she could only see his eyes beautiful eyes she thought dizzily she had fallen in love with them the first time shed seen them she had looked through the crowd of people through the dazzle of lights and had seen him seen them with a little groan she lifted a hand to the knot already forming on her temple she must be concussed she thought the first time she had seen nemesis she had been in a dark alley and there had been a knife like tonight a knife she murmured he had a knife stunned by relief he lowered his brow to hers its all right he didnt get a chance to use it i thought hed killed you she lifted a hand to his face found it warm no did you kill him his eyes changed concern rushed out as fury rushed in no he had seen deborah crumpled on the floor and had known such blank terror the kind he thought hed forgotten how to feel it had been easy for montega to get away but there would be another time he promised himself that and he would have his justice and his revenge he got away for now you knew him over the pounding in her head she tried to think you called him by name yes i knew him he had a gun she squeezed her eyes tight but the pain continued to roll where did he have a gun in his pocket he makes it a habit to ruin his suits that was something she would have to consider later we have to call the police she put a hand on his arm for balance and felt the warm stickiness on her fingers youre bleeding he glanced down to where the bullet had grazed him some how badly ignoring the throbbing in her temple she pushed away before he could answer she was ripping his sleeve to expose the wound the long ugly graze had her stomach doing flipflops we need to stop the bleeding she couldnt see his lifted brow but heard it in his voice you could tear your tshirt into a tourniquet you should be so lucky she glanced around the room scrupulously avoiding looking at the form sprawled over the bed theres nothing in here that wouldnt give you blood poisoning try this he offered her a square of black cloth she fumbled with the bandage its my first gunshot wound but i think this should be cleaned ill see to it later he enjoyed having her tend to him her fingers were gentle on his skin her brows drawn together in concentration she had found a murdered man had nearly been murdered herself but she had bounced back and was doing competently what needed to be done practicality his lips curved slightly yes it could be very attractive added to that he could smell her hair as she bent close feel the softness of it as it brushed against his cheek he heard her breathing slow steady under the sound of the quieting rain having done her best deborah sat back on her heels well so much for invulnerability he smiled and stopped her heart there goes my reputation she could only stare spellbound as they knelt on the floor of the filthy little room she forgot where she was who she was unable to stop herself she lowered her gaze to his mouth what tastes would she find there what wonders would he show her he could barely breathe when she lifted her eyes to his again in hers he saw passion smoldering and an acceptance that was terrifying her fingers were still on his skin gently stroking he could see each quick beat of her heart in the pulse that hammered at her throat i dream of you he reached out to bring her unresistingly against him even when im awake i dream of you of touching you his hands slid up to cup to caress her breasts of tasting you compelled he buried his mouth at her throat where the flavor and the scent were hot she leaned toward him into him stunned and shattered by the wildly primitive urges beating in her blood his lips were like a brand on her skin and his hands oh lord his hands with a deep throaty moan she arched back eager and willing and gages face swam in front of her eyes no she jerked away shocked and shamed no this isnt right he cursed himself her circumstance how could he have touched her now here no it isnt he rose stepped away you dont belong here because she was on the verge of tears her voice was sharp and you do more than you he murmured much more than you i was doing my job santiago called me santiagos dead he wasnt she pressed her fingers to her eyes and prayed for composure he called asked me to come montega got here first yes telling herself she was strong she lowered her hands and looked at him but how how did he know where to find santiago how did he know i was coming here tonight he was waiting for me he called me by name interested nemesis studied her did you tell anyone you were coming here tonight no im beginning to believe you are a fool he swung away from her you come here to a place like this alone to see a man who would as soon put a bullet in your brain as speak to you he wouldnt have hurt me he was terrified ready to talk and i know what im doing he turned back you dont begin to know but you do of course she pushed at her tousled hair and had fresh pain shooting through her head oh why the hell dont you go away stay away i dont need this kind of grief from you ive got work to do you need to go home leave this to others santiago didnt call others she snapped he called me talked to me and if i had gotten to him first i would know everything i need to know i dont she trailed off as a thought struck my phone damn it theyve got a tap on my phone they knew i was coming here tonight my office phone too thats how they knew i was about to get a court order to deal with the antique shop her eyes blazed well we can fix that in a hurry she sprang up the room spun he caught her before she slid to the floor again youre not going to be doing anything in a hurry for a day or two smoothly he hooked an arm under her knees and lifted her she liked the feeling of being carried by him a bit too much i walked into this room zorro ill walk out he carried her into the hall are you always so thickheaded yes i dont need your help i can see youre doing just dandy on your own i may have had some trouble before she said as he started down the stairs but now i have a name montega fiveeight a hundred and sixty brown hair brown eyes brown mustache two gold incisors it shouldnt be too hard to run a make on him he stopped and his eyes were ice montegas mine the law doesnt make room for personal vendettas youre right the law doesnt he shifted her slightly as he came to the base of the stairs there was something in his tone disillusionment that had her lifting a hand to his cheek was it very bad yes god how he wished he could turn to her bury his face in her hair and let her soothe him it was very bad let me help you tell me what you know and i swear ill do everything i can do to see that montega and whoever is behind him pays for what theyve done to you she would try realizing it moved something in him even as it frightened him i pay my own debts my own way damn it talk about thickheaded she squirmed as he carried her into the rain im willing to bend my principles and work with you to form a partnership and you i dont want a partner she could feel him stiffen with the words all but feel the pain rush through him but she wouldnt soften not again fine just great oh put me down you can hardly carry me a hundred blocks i dont intend to but he could have he could imagine carrying her through the rain to her apartment inside to the bed instead he walked to the end of the block toward the lights and the traffic at the curb he stopped hail a cab hail a cab like this he wondered why she could make him burn and want to laugh at the same time he turned his head and watched the heat flare in her eyes as their lips hovered an inch apart you can still lift your arm cant you yes i can lift my arm she did so stewing as they stood and waited after five soaking minutes a cab cruised up the curb miffed as she was she had to bite back a smile at the way the drivers mouth fell open when he got a load of her companion jeez youre him aint ya youre nemesis hey buddy want a ride no but the lady does effortlessly he slid deborah into the back seat his gloved hand brushed once over her cheek like a memory id try an ice pack and some aspirin thanks thanks a lot listen im not finished but he stepped back disappearing into the dark thin rain that was really him wasnt it the cabbie craned his neck around to deborah ignoring the badtempered honks around him whatd he do save your life or something or something she muttered jeez wait till i tell the wife grinning he switched off the meter this rides on me chapter contents prev next grunting his body running with sweat gage lifted the weights again he was on his back on the bench press stripped down to a pair of jogging shorts his muscles were singing but he was determined to reach his quota of a hundred presses perspiration soaked his sweatband and ran into his eyes as he concentrated on one small spot on the ceiling there was a satisfaction even in pain he remembered too well when hed been so weak hed barely been able to lift a magazine there had been a time when his legs had turned to rubber and his breath had been ragged at trying to walk the length of the hospital corridor he remembered the frustration of it and more the helplessness hed resisted therapy at first preferring to sit alone and brood then hed used it like a punishment because hed been alive and jack had been dead the pain had been excruciating and one day weak sick darkly depressed hed stood weaving in his hospital room braced against the wall hed wished with all of his strength with all of his will that he could simply vanish and he had hed thought hed been hallucinating going mad then terrified and fascinated hed tried it again and again going so far as to tilt a mirror across the room so that he could watch himself fade back fade into the pastel wall beside his bed he would never forget the morning a nurse came in with his breakfast tray walked right past him without seeing him grumbling about patients who didnt stay in bed where they belonged and hed known what hed brought out of the coma with him hed known it had come with him for a purpose so therapy had become like a religion something hed dedicated every ounce of strength to every particle of will hed pushed himself harder harder still until his muscles had toned and firmed he had thrown himself into lessons in the martial arts spent hours with weight lifting the treadmills the punishing laps in the pool every day he had exercised his mind as well reading everything pushing himself to understand the myriad businesses he had inherited spending hours day after day until he was skilled with complex computer systems now he was stronger faster sharper than he had been during his years on the force but he would never wear a badge again he would never take another partner he would never be helpless his breath hissed out and he continued to lift when frank strolled in with a tall glass of iced juice setting the glass on the table beside the bench press frank watched in silence for a moment pushing it a bit today he commented course you pushed it a bit yesterday too and the day before frank grinned what is it about some women that makes guys go out and lift heavy objects go to hell frank shes a looker all right he said unoffended smart too i guess being a lawyer and all must be hard to think about her mind though when she looks at you with those big blue eyes with a last grunt gage set the bar in the safety go lift a wallet now you know i dont do that anymore his wide face split with a new grin nemesis might get me he plucked up a towel from the neatly folded pile beside the bench saying nothing gage took it and swiped at the sweat on his face and chest hows the arm fine gage didnt bother to glance at the neat white bandage frank had used to replace deborahs effort must be getting slow never known you to catch one before do you want to be fired again nah he waited patient while gage switched to leg presses im looking for job security if you go out and get yourself killed ill have to go back to fleecing tourists then ill have to stay alive the tourists have enough trouble in urbana wouldnt have happened if id been with you gage flashed him a look and continued to push i work alone you know the deal she was there and that was the problem she doesnt belong on the streets she belongs in a courtroom you dont want her in a courtroom you want her in the bedroom the weights came down with a crash drop it hed known gage too long to be intimidated look youre crazy about her and its throwing you off messing up your concentration it isnt good for you im not good for her he stood and grabbed the glass of juice she has feelings for me and she has feelings for nemesis its making her unhappy so tell her shes only got feelings for one guy and make her happy what the hell am i supposed to do he drained the glass and barely prevented himself from heaving it against the wall take her out to dinner and over cocktails i could say oh by the way deborah besides being a businessman and a pillar of the damn community i have this sideline an alter ego the press likes to call him nemesis and were both nuts about you so when i take you to bed do you want it with the mask or without frank considered a moment something like that with a half laugh gage set down the glass shes a straight arrow frank i know because i used to be one myself she sees things in black and white the law and the crime suddenly tired he looked out over the sparkling water of the pool shed never understand what i do or why i do it and shed hate me for lying to her because every time im with her im deceiving her i dont think youre giving her enough credit youve got reasons for what you do yeah absently he touched the jagged scar on his chest ive got reasons you could make her understand if she really does have feelings for you shed have to understand maybe just maybe shed listen even accept without agreeing she might even forgive the lies but what about the rest he set his hand down on the bench waited watched it disappear into the damp leather how do i ask her to share her life with a freak frank swore once violently youre not a freak youve got a gift yeah gage lifted his hand flexed his fingers but im the one who has to live with it at twelvefifteen sharp deborah walked into city hall she made her way to the mayors office walking under the sternfaced portraits of former mayors governors presidents she moved past marble busts of the countrys founding fathers the current mayor of urbana liked having his walls lined with tradition his floor carpeted in red she didnt begrudge him in fact deborah appreciated the hushed reverential feel of tradition she enjoyed walking past the doors and hearing the quiet hum of keyboards the click of copiers the muted phone conversations as people worked for the city she paused in the reception area tucker fieldss secretary glanced up and recognizing her smiled miss oroarke hes expecting you just let me buzz him within an efficient twenty seconds she was escorted into the mayors office fields sat behind his desk a trim and tidy man with a fringe of snowy hair and the ruddy outdoor complexion of his farmer forebears beside him jerry looked like a preppy executive fields had earned a reputation during his six years in office as a man not afraid to get his hands dirty to keep his city clean at the moment his jacket was off his white shirtsleeves rolled up his sinewy forearms his tie was askew and he reached up to straighten it as deborah entered deborah always a pleasure to see you good to see you mayor hello jerry have a seat have a seat fields gestured her to a chair as he settled back against the cushy leather of his own so hows the slagerman trial going very well i think hell take the stand after the noon recess and youre ready for him more than good good he waved in his secretary as she came to the door with a tray i thought since im making you miss lunch i could at least offer you some coffee and a danish thank you she took the cup exchanged idle conversation though she knew she hadnt been sent for to drink coffee and chat heard you had some excitement last night yes it was no more than shed expected we lost ray santiago yes i heard its unfortunate and this nemesis character he was there as well yes he was he was also there the night the antique store on seventh blew up steepling his fingers fields sat back one might begin to think he was involved no not in the way you mean if he hadnt been there last night i wouldnt be sitting here now though it annoyed her she was compelled to defend him hes not a criminal at least not in the standard sense the mayor merely lifted a brow in whatever sense i prefer to have the police enforce the law in my city yes i agree satisfied he nodded and this man he pushed through the papers on his desk montega enrico montega deborah supplied also known as ricardo sanchez and enrico toya a colombian national who entered the us about six years ago hes suspected of the murder of two drug merchants in columbia he was based in miami for a while and vice there has a fat file on him as does interpol allegedly he is the top enforcer on the east coast four years ago he murdered a police officer and seriously wounded another she paused thinking of gage youve been doing your homework fields commented i always like a firm foundation when i go after someone hmm you know deborah mitchell considers you his top prosecutor fields grinned not that hed admit it mitch doesnt like to hand out compliments im aware of that were all very pleased with your record and particularly with the way the slagerman case seems to be going both mitch and i agree that we want you to concentrate more fully on your litigation so weve decided to take you off this particular case she blinked stunned i beg your pardon weve decided you should turn your notes your files over to another da youre pulling me he held up a hand were simply beefing up the police investigation with your caseload we prefer to have you turn over your files on this to someone else she set her cup down with a snap parino was mine parino is dead she shot a glance at jerry but he only lifted his hands she rose fighting to hold her temper this sprang out of that all of it this is my case it has been all along and youve endangered yourself and the case twice already ive been doing my job someone else will be doing it this part of it after today he spread his hands deborah this isnt a punishment merely a shifting of responsibilities she shook her head and snatched up her briefcase not good enough not nearly im going to speak with mitchell myself turning she stormed out she had to struggle to maintain her dignity and not give in to the urge to slam the door behind her jerry caught up with her at the elevators deb wait dont even try it what to soothe and placate after jamming the down button she whirled on him what the hell is this jerry like the mayor said dont hand me that you knew you knew what was going on why i was being called in and you didnt tell me not even a warning so i could prepare myself deb he laid a hand on her shoulder but she shrugged it off look not that i dont agree with everything the mayor said you always do i didnt know i didnt know damn it he repeated when she only stared at him not until ten oclock this morning and whatever i think i would have told you she stopped pounding her fist against the down button okay im sorry i jumped all over you but its not right somethings not right about all this you nearly got yourself killed he reminded her when guthrie came in this morning gage she interrupted gage was here the tenoclock appointment i see hands fisted she whirled back to the elevator so hes behind it he was concerned thats all he suggested i get the picture she cut him off again and stepped into the elevator this isnt finished and you can tell your boss i said so she had to bank her temper when she walked into court personal feelings personal problems had no place here there were two frightened young women and the justice system depending on her she sat taking careful notes as the defense counsel questioned slagerman she blanked gage and his handiwork out of her mind when it came time for crossexamination she was ready she remained seated a moment studying slagerman you consider yourself a businessman mr slagerman yes and your business consists of hiring escorts both male and female for clients thats right elegant escorts provides a service finding suitable companions for other businessmen and women often from out of town she let him ramble a few moments describing his profession i see rising she strolled past the jury and is it in lets say the job description of any of your employees to exchange sex for money with these clients absolutely not attractive and earnest he leaned forward my staff is wellscreened and welltrained its a firm policy that if anyone on staff develops this kind of a relationship with a client it would result in termination are you aware that any of your employees have indeed exchanged sex for money i am now he aimed a pained look at suzanne and marjorie did you request that marjorie lovitz or suzanne mcroy entertain a client on a sexual level no but youre aware that they did so if he was surprised by her train of questioning he didnt bat an eye yes of course they admitted to it under oath yes they were under oath mr slagerman just as you are have you ever struck an employee certainly not yet both miss lovitz and miss mcroy claim under oath that you did theyre lying and he smiled at her mr slagerman didnt you go to miss lovitzs apartment on the night of february th angry that she was unable to work and in your anger beat her thats ridiculous you swear that under oath objection asked and answered withdrawn mr slagerman have you contacted either miss lovitz or miss mcroy since this trial began no you have not telephoned either of them no nodding she walked back to her table and picked up a stack of papers is the number familiar to you he hesitated no thats odd its your private line mr slagerman shouldnt you recognize your own private telephone number though he smiled she saw the icy hate in his eyes i call from it not to it so i dont have to remember it i see and did you on the night of june use that private line to call the apartment where both miss lovitz and miss mcroy now live no objection your honor this is leading nowhere deborah shifted again facing the judge and leaving the jurys view of slagerman unobstructed your honor ill show you where it leads in just a moment overruled mr slagerman perhaps you could explain why according to your phone records a call was placed from your private line to the number at miss lovitz and miss mcroys apartment at pm on june anybody could have used my phone your private line she lifted a brow its hardly worth having a private line if anyone can use it the caller identified himself as jimmy you are known as jimmy arent you me and a lot of other people did you speak to me on the phone on the night of june ive never spoken with you on the phone she smiled coolly and moved closer to the chair have you ever noticed mr slagerman how to some men all womens voices sound alike how to some men all women look alike how to some men womens bodies are for one purpose your honor defense counsel leaped to his feet withdrawn deborah kept her eyes level with slagermans can you explain mr slagerman how someone using your private line using your name called miss mcroy on the night of june and how when i answered the phone this person using your line and your name mistook my voice for hers and threatened miss mcroy she waited a beat would you like to know what that person said sweat was beading on his upper lip you can make up whatever you want thats true fortunately we had a tap on miss mcroys phone i have the transcript she turned over a sheet of paper should i refresh your memory she had won though there were still closing arguments to take place she knew she had won now as she stormed through the justice building she had other business to tend to she found mitchell in his office a phone to his ear he was a big bullchested man who had played linebacker in college pictures of him in his jersey were scattered on the wall among his degrees he had short red hair and a sprinkling of freckles that did nothing to soften his leathered looks when he spotted deborah he waved her in gestured toward a chair but she remained standing until hed completed his call slagerman ive got him nailed she took a step closer to the desk you sold me out thats bull what the hell do you call it i get pulled into the mayors office and get the brushoff damn it mitch this is my case its the states case he corrected chomping on the end of his unlit cigar youre not the only one who can handle it i made parino i made the deal she slapped her palms down on his desk so they were eye to eye im the one whos been busting my tail over this and youve been overstepping your bounds youre the one who taught me that trying a case takes more than putting on a pinstriped suit and dancing in front of a jury i know my job damn it going to see santiago alone was an error in judgment now that is bull he called me he asked for me you tell me what youd have done if hed called you he scowled at her thats entirely different thats entirely the same she snapped back certain from the look in his eyes that he knew it if id screwed things up id expect to get bumped but i havent im the one whos been sweating and frying my brains over this case now when i get a lead i find out guthrie chirps up and you and the mayor keel over still the old boys network is it mitch he stabbed the cigar toward her face dont pull that feminist crap on me i dont care what way you button your shut im telling you mitch if you pull me off this without good cause im gone i cant work for you if i cant depend on you so i might as well go out on my own and take on divorce cases for three hundred an hour i dont like ultimatums neither do i he leaned back measuring her sit down i dont want damn it oroarke sit tightlipped and fuming she did so he rolled the cigar between his fingers if santiago had called me i would have gone just like you but he continued before she could speak your handling of this case isnt the only reason ive considered pulling you considered took her position back several notches calming a bit she nodded well then youve been getting a lot of press on this i hardly see what that has to do with it did you see this mornings paper he snatched it up from his desk and waved it in her face read the headline because she had and had winced over it already she simply shrugged darling deb swept through city in arms of nemesis so some cab driver wanted his name in the paper what does that have to do with the case when my prosecutors start having their names linked with the masked marauder it has everything to do with everything he popped the cigar back in his mouth gnashing it i dont like the way you keep running into him neither did she look if the police cant stop him i can hardly be responsible for his popping up all over the place and id hate to think youd take me off a case because some jerk had to fill his column personally mitch hated the weasely reporter and he hadnt cared for the strongarm tactics the mayor had used youve got two weeks thats hardly enough time to two weeks take it or leave it you bring me something we can take to a jury or i pass the ball got it yeah she rose i got it she stormed out past snickering associates a paper was tacked on the door of her office someone had used magic markers and highlighter pens to draw a caricature of deborah being carried in the arms of a lanternjawed musclebound masked man under it was a caption the continuing adventures of darling deb on a snarl she ripped it down balling it into her pocket as she stomped out she had another stop to make she kept her finger pressed to the button of gages doorbell until frank pulled the door open is he in yes maam he stepped back as she pushed past him hed seen furious women before frank would have preferred to have faced a pack of hungry wolves where hes up in his office ill be glad to tell him youre here ill announce myself she said as she started up the steps frank looked after her lips pursed he considered buzzing gage on the intercom and giving him fair warning but he only grinned surprises were good for you deborah didnt bother to knock but pushed open the door and strode in gage was behind his desk a phone in one hand a pen in the other computer screens blinked across from him sat a trim middleaged woman with a steno pad at deborahs unannounced entrance she rose and glanced curiously at gage ill get back to you he said into the receiver before lowering it to the cradle hello deborah she tossed her briefcase onto a chair i think you might prefer to have this conversation in private he nodded you can transcribe those notes tomorrow mrs brickman its late why dont you go home yes sir she gathered her things and made a fast discreet exit deborah hooked her thumbs in the pockets of her skirt like a gunfighter hooking thumbs in a holster hed seen her take that pose in court it must be nice she began sitting up here in your lofty tower and dispensing orders i bet it feels just dandy not all of us are so fortunate we dont have enough money to buy castles or private planes or thousanddollar suits we work on the streets but most of us are pretty good at our jobs and happy enough as she spoke she walked slowly toward him but you know what makes us mad gage you know what really ticks us off thats when someone in one of those lofty towers sticks his rich influential nose in our business it makes us so mad that we think real hard about taking a punch at that interfering nose should we break out the boxing gloves i prefer my bare hands as she had in mitchells office she slapped them down on his desk who the hell do you think you are going to the mayor pressuring him to take me off this case i went to the mayor he said slowly and gave him my opinion your opinion she blew a breath between her teeth and snatched up an onyx paperweight from the desk though she gave careful consideration to heaving it through the plate glass at his back she contented herself with passing it from hand to hand and i bet he just fell all over himself to accommodate you and your thirty million gage watched her pace and waited until he was sure he could speak rationally he agreed with me that youre more suitable to a courtroom than a murder scene who are you to say whats more suitable for me she whirled back her voice rich with fury i say it not you all my life ive prepared myself for this job and im not having anyone come along and tell me im not suitable for any case i take on she snapped the paperweight back on the desk a hard crack of stone against stone you stay out of my business and out of my life no he realized he wasnt going to be able to be rational are you finished no before i leave i want you to know that it didnt work im still on this case and im staying on so you wasted your time and mine and lastly i think youre arrogant officious and overbearing his hands were fisted beneath the desk are you finished he asked again you bet i am she snatched up her briefcase turned on her heel and headed for the door gage pushed a button under the desk and had the locks snap into place im not he said quietly she hadnt known she could be more furious but as she spun back to him a red haze formed in front of her eyes unlock that door immediately or ill have you up on charges youve had your say counselor he rose now ill have mine not interested he came around the desk but only leaned back against it he didnt trust himself to approach her not yet youve got all the evidence dont you counselor all your neat little facts so ill save time and plead guilty as charged then we have nothing more to say isnt the prosecution interested in motive she tossed back her head bracing as he crossed to her something about the way he moved just then slowly soundlessly set off a flash of memory but it was gone overwhelmed by her own temper motive isnt relevant in this case results are youre wrong i went to the mayor i asked him to use his influence to have you taken off the case but im guilty of more than that im guilty of being in love with you her tensed hands went limp at her side so that the briefcase fell to the floor though she opened her mouth to speak she could say nothing amazing his eyes were dark and furious as he took that final step toward her a sharp woman like you being surprised by that you should have seen it every time i looked at you you should have seen it every time i touched you he put his hands on her shoulders you should have tasted it every time i kissed you pushing her back against the door he brushed his mouth over hers once twice then he devoured her lips her knees were weak she hadnt thought it was possible but they were shaking so she had to hold on to him or slide bonelessly to the floor even clinging she was afraid for she had seen it had felt it had tasted it but that was nothing compared to hearing him say it or to hearing the echo of her own voice repeating the words inside her mind he was lost in her and the more she opened to him the deeper he fell he took his hands over her face through her hair down her body wanting to touch all of her and to know as he did that she trembled in response when he lifted his head she saw the love and she saw the desire with them was a kind of war she didnt understand there were nights he said quietly hundreds of nights when i lay awake sweating and waiting for morning id wonder if id ever find someone i could love that i could need no matter how i drew the fantasy its nothing compared to what i feel for you gage she lifted her hands to his face wishing with all her heart knowing well that heart was already lost to him but she remembered that she had swayed close to another man only the night before i dont know what im feeling yes you do all right i do but im afraid to feel it its not fair im not being fair but i have to ask you to let me think this through im not sure i can a little while longer please unlock the door and let me go it is unlocked he stepped back to open it for her but he blocked her exit for one last moment deborah i wont let you go the next time she looked up again and saw the truth of his words in his eyes i know chapter contents prev next he jury was out deborah spent their deliberating time in her office using both her telephone and computer to try to track down what gage had referred to as the common thread the antique shop timeless had been owned by imports incorporated whose address was a vacant lot downtown the company had filed no insurance claim on the loss and the manager of the shop had vanished the police had yet to locate the man parino had referred to as mouse more digging turned up the triad corporation based in philadelphia a phone call to triad put deborah in touch with a recording telling her that the number had been disconnected as she placed a call to the das office in philadelphia she inputted all of her known data into the computer two hours later she had a list of names social security numbers and the beginnings of a headache before she could make her next call the receiver rang under her hand deborah oroarke is this the same deborah oroarke who cant keep her name out of the paper cilia at the sound of her sisters voice the headache faded a bit how are you worried about you what else is new deborah rolled her shoulders to relieve the stiff muscles then leaned back in the chair coming tinnily through the earpiece was the music deborah imagined was pulsing in cilias office at the radio station hows boyd thats captain fletcher to you captain she sat straight again when did that happen yesterday the pride and pleasure came through clearly i guess ill really have to watch myself now sleeping with a police captain tell him im proud of him i will we all are now how are the kids deborah had learned to stall and evade long before taking the bar exam its dangerous to ask a mother how her kids are during summer vacation no elementary school no kindergarten so they outnumber me and the cop three to two cilia gave a rich warm laugh all three members of the demon brigade are fine allison pitched a shutout in a little league game last week then got into a wrestling match with the opposing pitcher sounds like he was a rotten loser yeah and allisons always been a rotten winner i practically had to sit on her to make her give over lets see bryant knocked out a tooth rollerskating then being a clever little capitalist sold it to the boy next door for fifty cents keenan swallowed it swallowed what the fifty cents five dimes my youngest son eats anything im thinking about putting in a hot line to the emergency room now lets talk about you im fine how are things at khip about as chaotic as they are around the house all in all id rather be in maui cilia recognized the delaying tactics well and pushed a little harder deborah i want to know what youre up to work in fact im about to win a case she glanced at the clock and calculated how long the jury had been out i hope sometimes cilia mused you just had to be direct since when have you started dating guys in masks stalling couldnt last forever she thought with regret come on cilia you dont believe everything you read in the paper right or everything that comes over the wire even though we ran your latest adventure at the top of every hour yesterday even if i didnt go to the trouble to get the urbana papers id have heard all the noise youre making national news out there kid and i want to know whats going on thats why im asking you it was usually easier to evade if you added a couple of dashes of truth this nemesis character is a nuisance the press is glorifying him and worse just this morning at a shop two blocks from the courthouse i saw a display of nemesis tshirts isnt merchandising wonderful but cilia wasnt about to be distracted again deborah ive been in radio too long not to be able to read voices especially my baby sisters whats between you nothing she insisted wanting it to be true ive simply run into him a couple of times during this investigation im doing the press plays it up ive noticed darling deb oh please i do want to know whats going on but its more to the point right now why youre involved in something so dangerous and why i had to read in the paper that some maniac had a knife to my sisters throat its exaggerated oh so no one held a knife to your throat no matter how well she lied deborah thought cilia would know it wasnt as dramatic as it sounds and i wasnt hurt knives at your throat cilia muttered buildings blowing up in your face damn it deb dont you have a police force out there i was just doing some legwork dont start she said quickly cilia do you know how frustrating it is to have to keep repeating that you know what youre doing that you can take care of yourself and do your job cilia let out a long breath yeah i cant stop worrying about you deborah just because youre a couple thousand miles away its taken me years to finally accept what happened to mom and dad if i lost you i couldnt handle it youre not going to lose me right now the most dangerous thing im facing is my computer okay okay arguing with her sister wouldnt change a thing cilia knew and whatever answers deborah gave her she would keep right on worrying listen i also saw a picture of my little sister with some millionaire im going to have to start a scrapbook anything you want to tell me the automatic no caught in her throat i dont know things are pretty complicated right now and i havent had time to think it through is there something to think through yes the headache was coming back she reached into her drawer for a bottle of aspirin a couple of things she murmured thinking of gage and of nemesis that was something not even cilia could help her with but there were other matters cilia since youre married to a police captain how about using your influence to have him do me a favor ill threaten to cook hell do anything i want with a laugh deborah picked up one of her printouts id like him to check out a couple of names for me george p drummond and a charles r meyers both with denver addresses she spelled out both names then added social security numbers got it mmmhmm cilia murmured as she scribbled the information and theres a solar corporation also based in denver drummond and meyers are on the board of directors if boyd could run these through the police computer it would save me several steps through the bureaucracy ill threaten him with my pot roast that should do the trick deb you will be careful wont you absolutely give everyone a hug for me i miss you all of you mitchell came to the door and signaled ive got to go cilia the jurys coming back deep in the recesses of his home in an echoing cavern of a room gage studied a bank of computers there was some work he couldnt do in his office some work he preferred to do in secret with his hands hooked in the pockets of his jeans he watched the monitors names and numbers flashed by he could see on one of the monitors just what deborah had inputted in her computer across town she was making progress he thought slow it was true but it still worried him if he could follow the steps she was taking so could others eyes intent face sober he took his fingers flying over one keyboard then another and still another he had to find the link once he did he would carefully systematically locate the name of the man responsible for jacks death as long as he found it before deborah she was safe the computers offered him one way or he could take another leaving the machines to their work he turned pressed a button on the wall on the far side of the highceilinged curving room a huge map slid into place crossing to it he studied a very largescaled detail of the city of urbana using yet another keyboard he had colored lights blinking at various parts of the city each represented a major drug exchange many of which were as yet unknown to the upd they flashed in the east end and the west in the exclusive neighborhoods uptown in the barrios in the financial district there seemed to be no pattern yet there was always a pattern he had only to find it as he studied the map his gaze lit and lingered on one building deborahs apartment was she home yet he wondered was she safe inside was she wearing her blue robe and studying files the television news murmuring in the background was she thinking of him gage rubbed his hands over his face frank was right she was interfering with his concentration but what could he do about it every attempt he made to see that she withdrew from the case had failed she was too stubborn to listen he smiled a bit he hadnt believed he would ever fall in love how inconvenient he thought wryly that when he did it was with a dedicated public servant she wouldnt budge he knew it and neither would he but however much discipline he had over his body and his mind he seemed to have none over his heart it wasnt just her beauty though he had always loved beautiful things and had grown up learning to appreciate them for no more than their existence after hed come out of the coma he had found a certain comfort in surrounding himself with beauty all that color all that texture after so much flat gray it wasnt just her mind though he respected intelligence as a cop and as a businessman he had learned that a sharp mind was the most powerful and the most dangerous weapon there was something some indefinable something beyond her looks and her mind that had captured him because he was just as much her prisoner as he was of his own fate and he had no idea how to resolve the two he was only sure that the first step would be to find the key himself to find the name and to find the justice when this was behind him and her there might be a chance for a future clearing his mind he studied the lights then bending over a computer went to work balancing a pizza box a bottle of lambrusco and a briefcase full of paperwork deborah stepped off the elevator as she wondered how she would manage to dig for her keys she glanced up at the door of her apartment colorful draping letters crossed the door congratulations deborah mrs greenbaum she thought with a grin even as she turned toward her neighbors apartment mrs greenbaums door opened i heard it on the sixoclock news you put that little weasel away mrs greenbaum adjusted the hem of her tiedyed tshirt how do you feel good i feel good how about some celebratory pizza you twisted my arm mrs greenbaum let her door slam then crossed the hall in her bare feet i guess you noticed the airconditionings on the fritz again i got the picture during my steam bath in the elevator this time i think we should mobilize the rest of the tenants she gave deborah a shrewd look especially if we had some sharp fasttalking lawyer lead the way youre already leading the way deborah said as she shifted the wine but if its not on within twentyfour hours ill contact the landlord and put on the pressure she fumbled around in her pocket now if i could just get my keys ive got the copy you gave me reaching into the pocket of her baggy jeans mrs greenbaum produced a key ring crowded with keys here we go thanks inside deborah set the pizza box on a table ill get some glasses and plates lil lifted the lid and saw with approval that the pizza was loaded with everything you know a pretty young girl like you should be celebrating with some pretty young boy on a friday night instead of with an old woman what old woman deborah called from the kitchen and made lil laugh with a slightly abovemiddleaged woman then what about that mouthwatering gage guthrie i cant imagine him eating pizza and drinking cheap wine she walked back in carrying the bottle and two glasses paper plates and napkins tucked under her arm hes more the caviar type something wrong with that no she frowned no but im in the mood for pizza and after i gorge myself i have work honey dont you ever let up ive got a deadline deborah said and found she still resented it she poured two glasses handed one to her friend to justice she said the most beautiful lady i know just as they sat gooey slices of pizza split between them there was a knock on the door licking sauce from her fingers deborah went to answer she saw a huge basket of red roses that appeared to have legs delivery for deborah oroarke got someplace i can put this thing lady oh yes ah here she stood on tiptoe and got a glimpse of the deliverymans head under the blossoms on the coffee table they not only sat on the coffee table deborah noted as she signed the clipboard they covered it from end to end thanks she dug into her wallet for a bill well lil demanded when they were alone again who are they from though she already knew deborah picked up the card nice work counselor gage she couldnt prevent the softening or the smile that bloomed on her lips theyre from gage the man knows how to make a statement behind her lenses lils eyes sparkled there was nothing she liked better than romance unless it was a good protest rally must be five dozen in there theyre beautiful she slipped the card into her pocket i suppose ill have to call him and thank him at least lil bit into the pizza why dont you do it now while its on your mind and while she could eavesdrop deborah hesitated the scent of the flowers surrounding her no she thought with a shake of her head if she called him now while his gesture weakened her she might do or say something rash later she decided ill call him later stalling lil said over a mouthful of pizza yeah not ashamed to admit it deborah sat again she ate for a moment in silence then picked up her wine mrs greenbaum she began frowning into her glass you were married twice so far lil answered with a grin you loved both of them absolutely they were good men her sharp little eyes became young and dreamy both times i thought it was going to be forever i was about your age when i lost my first husband in the war we only had a few years together mr greenbaum and i were a bit luckier i miss both of them have you ever wondered i guess its an odd sort of question but have you ever wondered what would have happened if youd met both of them at the same time lil arched her eyebrows intrigued with the notion that would have been a problem you see what i mean you loved both of them but if they had come into your life at the same time you couldnt have loved both of them theres no telling what tricks the heart will play but you cant love two men the same way at the same time she leaned forward her own conflict showing clearly on her face and if somehow you did or thought you did you couldnt make a commitment to either one without being unfaithful to the other taking her time lil topped off both glasses are you in love with gage guthrie i might be deborah glanced back at the basket bursting with roses yes i think i am and with someone else with her glass cupped in her hand deborah pushed away from the table and rose to pace yes but thats crazy isnt it not crazy lil thought nothing to do with love was ever crazy and for some such a situation would be delightful and exciting not for deborah for deborah she understood it would only be painful are you sure its love on either side and not just sex after letting out a long breath deborah sat again i thought it was just physical i wanted it to be but ive thought about it tried to be honest with myself and i know its not i even get them mixed up in my mind not just comparisons but well as if im trying to make them one man so it would be simpler she drank again gage told me he loves me and i believe him i dont know what to do follow your heart lil told her i know that sounds trite the truest things often do let your mind take a back seat and listen to your heart it usually makes the right choice at eleven deborah switched on the late news she wasnt displeased to see her victory in the slagerman case as the top story she watched her own image give a brief statement on the courthouse steps frowning a bit when wisner pushed through to ask his usual nonsense about nemesis the news team segued from that into nemesiss latest exploits the liquor store robbery he had scotched the mugger he had captured the murder he had prevented busy man deborah muttered and drained the last of the wine if mrs greenbaum hadnt spent most of the evening with her deborah thought she would have contented herself with one glass of wine rather than half the bottle well tomorrow was saturday she thought with a shrug as the anchorman reported on the upcoming mayoral debates she could sleep a little late before she went into the office or if she was lucky she would uncover something that evening but she wouldnt get anything done if she continued to sit in front of the television she waited long enough to hear the weather report which promised continuing heat raging humidity and chances of thunderstorms switching off the set she went to the bedroom to settle at her desk shed left the window open in the vain hope of catching a breeze the traffic noise was a steady din from five stories down the heat rose from the street intensifying on its upward journey she could all but see it hot nights hot needs she walked to the window hoping for a breath of air to ease the aching even the wine hadnt dulled but it remained a deep slow throb was he out there she wondered then put a hand to her temple she wasnt even sure which man she was thinking of and it would be best she knew if she thought of neither turning on her desk lamp she opened a file then glanced at the phone shed called gage an hour before only to be told by the taciturn frank that mr guthrie was out for the evening she could hardly call him again she thought it would look as though she were checking up on him something she had no right to do especially since she was the one who had asked for the time and space that was what she wanted she assured herself what she had to have and thinking of him wouldnt help her find the answers that were buried somewhere in the papers on her desk she began to read through them again making notations on a legal pad as she worked time slipped past and thunder muttered in the distance he shouldnt have come he knew it wasnt right but as he had walked the streets his steps had taken him closer and closer to her apartment draped in shadows he looked up and saw the light in her window in the heatdrenched night he waited telling himself if the light switched off he would leave he would go but it remained a pale yet steady beacon he wondered if he could convince himself he wanted only to see her to speak with her it was true that he needed to find out how much she knew how close she was facts on her computer didnt take in her intuition or her suspicions the closer she came to answers the more jeopardy she was in even more than he wanted to love her he needed to protect her but that wasnt why he crossed the street why he swung himself onto the fire escape and began to climb what he did he did because he couldnt stop himself through the open window he saw her she was seated at a desk the slant of light directed onto the papers she read through a pencil moved quickly in her hand he could smell her the tauntingly sexy scent she wore reached out to him like an invitation or a dare he could see only her profile the curve of her cheek and jaw the shape of her mouth her short blue robe was loosely tied and he could see the long white column of her throat as he watched she lifted a hand to rub at the back of her neck the robe shifted sliding up her thighs parting gently as she crossed her legs and bent over her work again deborah read the same paragraph three times before she realized her concentration had been broken she rubbed her eyes intending to begin again and her whole body stiffened heat rushed over her skin slowly she turned and saw him he was standing inside the window away from the light her heart was hammering not in shock she realized in anticipation taking a break from crime fighting she asked hoping the sharp tone of her voice would cover her trembling according to the elevenoclock news youve been busy he hadnt bothered to concentrate this time at least this time hed needed to come to her whole so have you and i still am she pushed at her hair and discovered her hand wasnt quite steady how did you get in when he glanced toward the window she nodded ill have to remember to keep that locked it wouldnt have mattered not after i saw you every nerve in her body was on edge telling herself it would add more authority she rose im not going to let this go on you cant stop it he stepped toward her neither can i his gaze shifted to the papers on her desk you havent listened no i dont intend to ill wade through all the lies navigate all the dead ends until i find the truth then ill finish it her stance was tense and watchful her eyes challenged him if you want to help me then tell me what you know i know i want you he hooked a hand in the belt of her robe to hold her still at that moment she was his only need his only quest his only hunger now tonight you have to go she could do nothing to prevent the shudder of response or the flare of desire integrity warred with passion you have to leave do you know how i ache for you his voice was harsh as he jerked her against him there is no law i wouldnt break no value i wouldnt sacrifice to have you do you understand that kind of need yes it was clawing her yes its wrong right or wrong its tonight with one sweep of his hand he sent the lamp crashing to the floor as the room was plunged into darkness he lifted her into his arms we cant but her fingers dug hard into his shoulder negating the denial we will even as she shook her head his mouth came down on hers fast and fevered strong and seductive the power of it slammed into her leaving her reeling and rocky and helpless helpless to resist her own answering need her lips softened without yielding parted without surrendering as she tumbled deaf and blind into the kiss her mind heard what her heart had been trying to tell her he pressed her into the mattress his mouth frantic and impatient as it roamed her face his hands already tearing at the thin robe that covered her beneath it she was just as hed dreamed hot and smooth and fragrant stripping off his gloves he let himself feel what he had craved like a river she flowed under his hands he could have drowned in her though he burned to see what he was making his he contented himself with texture with taste with scent in the hot stormhaunted night he was relentless he was still a shadow but she knew him and wanted him with all reason all rationality aside she clung to him mouth seeking mouth as they rolled over the bed desperate to feel him against her to feel the wild beat of his heart match the wild beat of hers she pulled at his shirt there were harshly whispered words against her lips against her throat her breast as she frantically undressed him then he was as vulnerable as she his skin as slick his hands as greedy thunder rumbled lightning flickered in the moonless night the scent of roses and passion hung heavy in the air she shuddered mindless with the pleasures he so recklessly showed her it was all heat all ache all glory even as she wept with it she strained against him demanding more before she could demand he gave sending her soaring again dark secret delights moans and whispers bruising caresses insatiable hungers when she thought she would surely go mad he plunged inside her and it was madness she gave herself to it to him with all her strength all her eagerness i love you she wrapped tight around him as the words poured out they filled him even as he filled her they moved him even as their bodies moved together he buried his face in her hair her nails dug into his back he felt his own shattering release then hers as she cried out his name he lay in the dark the roaring in his head gradually subsided until all he heard was the sound of traffic on the street below and deborahs deep unsteady breaths her arms were no longer tight around him but had slid off she was still now and quiet slowly unnerved by his own weakness he shifted from her she didnt move didnt speak in the dark he touched a hand to her face and found it damp and he hated that part of him that had caused her grief how long have you known not until tonight before he could touch her again she turned away and groped for her robe did you think i wouldnt know when you kissed me didnt you realize that no matter how dark it was no matter how confused you made me once this happened i would know it wasnt just anger in her voice but pain he could have withstood the anger no i didnt think of it didnt you she switched on the bedside lamp and stared at him but youre so clever gage so damn clever to have made such a mistake he looked at her her hair was tumbled her pale skin still flushed and warm from his hands there were tears in her eyes and behind them a bright anger maybe i did know maybe i just didnt want to let it matter he rose and reached for her deborah she slapped him once then twice damn you you lied to me you made me doubt myself my values you knew you had to know i was falling in love with you with a halflaugh she turned away with both of you please listen when he touched her on the shoulder she jerked away it wouldnt be wise to touch me just now all right he curled his hand into a fist i fell in love with you so fast i couldnt think all i knew was that i needed you and that i wanted you to be safe so you put on your mask and looked out for me i wont thank you for it for any of it the finality in her voice had panic racing through him deborah what happened here tonight yes what happened here you trusted me enough for this she gestured to the bed but not for the rest not for the truth no i didnt i couldnt because i know how you feel about what im doing thats a whole different story isnt it she swiped away tears the anger was dying away to misery if you knew you had to lie to me why didnt you just stay away from me he forced himself not to reach for her again he had lied and by lying hurt her now he could only offer the truth and hope it would begin to heal youre the only thing in four years i havent been able to overcome youre the only thing in four years ive needed as much as ive needed to live i dont expect you to understand or even accept but i need you to believe me i dont know what to believe gage since i met you ive been torn in two different directions believing i was falling in love with two different men but its just you i dont know what to do on a sigh she shut her eyes i dont know whats right i love you deborah nothings lighter than that give me a chance to show you time to explain the rest i dont seem to have much choice gage i cant condone she opened her eyes and for the first time focused on the long jagged scars on his chest pain slammed into her all but bringing her to her knees dulled with horror her eyes lifted to his they did that to you she whispered his body stiffened i dont want pity deborah be quiet she moved quickly going to him wrapping her arms around him hold me she shook her head no tighter i might have lost you all those years ago before i ever had the chance to have you there were tears in her eyes again as she lifted her head i dont know what to do or whats right but tonight its enough that youre here youll stay he touched his lips to hers as long as you want chapter contents prev next deborah always awakened reluctantly she snuggled into sleep easily blocking out the honks and gunning engines from the street a jackhammer was machinegunning the concrete but she only yawned and shifted if she put her mind to it she could sleep through an atomic bomb it wasnt the noise that had her opening her groggy eyes it was the faint and glorious scent of brewing coffee tenthirty she noted peering at the clock tenthirty deborah struggled to sit up and discovered she was alone in bed gage she thought pressing the heels of her hands to her eyes had he ordered breakfast again eggs benedict belgian waffles strawberries and champagne god what she would have given for a simple cup of black coffee and a stale doughnut pushing herself from the bed she reached down for her robe which was lying in a heap on the floor beneath it was a swatch of black cloth she picked it up then lowered herself to the bed again a mask she balled the material in her hand so it hadnt been a dream it was real all of it he had come to her in the night loved her in the night both of her fantasies the charming businessman the arrogant stranger in black they were one man one lover on a low groan she buried her face in her hands what was she going to do how the hell was she going to handle this as a woman as a da god she loved him and by loving him she betrayed her principles if she revealed his secret she betrayed her heart and how could she love him without understanding him yet she did and there was no way she could take back her heart they had to talk she decided calmly and sensibly she could only pray she would find the strength and the right words it wouldnt be enough to tell him she disapproved he already knew it it wouldnt be enough to tell him she was afraid that would only prompt him to reassure somehow she had to find the words to convince him that the path he had taken was not only dangerous but wrong deborah braced herself prepared when the phone rang she muttered an oath struggling into her robe she climbed across the bed to snatch up the receiver deborahs sister cilias voice held both amusement and curiosity and how are you fine thanks gage said deborahs still sleeping would you like me to im right here sighing deborah pushed at her tousled hair hello cilia hi goodbye cilia deborah heard gage set the phone on the hook there was a moment of humming silence ahi guess i called at a bad time no i was just getting up isnt it a bit early in denver with three kids this is the middle of the day bryant take that basketball outside out no dribbling in the kitchen deb yes sorry anyway boyd checked out those names and i thought youd like the information right away thats great she picked up a pen ill let boyd fill you in the phone rattled no ill take him keenan dont put that in your mouth good grief boyd whats all over his face there was some giggling a crash as the receiver hit the kitchen floor and the sound of running feet deb congratulations captain fletcher thanks i guess cilias been bragging again hows it going she looked down at the mask she still held in her hand im not at all sure shaking off the mood she smiled into the phone things sound normal out there nothings ever normal out here hey allison dont let that dog there was another crash and a flurry of barking too late yes it sounded perfectly normal boyd i appreciate you moving so fast on this no problem it sounded important it is well it isnt much george p drummond was a plumber owned his own business was deborah interrupted yeah he died three years ago natural causes he was eightytwo and had no connection with a solar corporation or any other she shut her eyes and the other charles r meyers high school science teacher and football coach deceased five years they were both clean as a whistle and the solar corporation we cant find much so far the address you gave cilia was nonexistent i should have guessed every time i turn a corner on this i run into a dead end i know the feeling ill do some more digging sorry i cant be more helpful but you have been two dead guys and a phony address not much deborah weve been following the papers out here can you tell me if this business has anything to do with your masked phantom she balled the black cloth in her hand again off the record yes i imagine cilias already said it but be careful okay i will she wants to talk to you again there was some muttering a chuckle something about a man answering your phone boyd laughed again and deborah could almost see them wrestling over the receiver i just want to know cilia was breathless boyd cut it out go feed the dog or something i just want to know she repeated into the receiver who owns the terrific sexy voice a man i figured that out does he have a name yes well do you want me to guess phil tony maximillion gage deborah muttered giving up the millionaire nice going cilia i know i know youre a grown woman a sensible woman with a life of her own i wont say another word but is he before you take this any further i should warn you i havent had coffee yet okay but i want you to call me and soon i need details ill let you know when i have them ill be in touch youd better she hung up and sat a moment it seemed she was back to square one all around but first things first she reminded herself and followed the scent of coffee into the kitchen gage was at the stove in jeans and bare feet his shirt unbuttoned she wasnt surprised to see him there but she was surprised at what he was doing youre cooking she said from the doorway he turned the impact of seeing her there in the strong sunlight her eyes sleepy and cautious nearly bowled him over hi sorry about the phone i thought i could get it before it woke you up its all right i was awake feeling awkward she took a mug from a hook over the sink and poured coffee it was my sister right he put his hands on her shoulders running his hands gently down to her elbows and back when she stiffened he felt the pain knife into him would you rather i wasnt here i dont know she drank without turning around i guess we have to talk but she couldnt bring herself to face it yet what are you making french toast you didnt have much in the fridge so i went down the corner and picked some things up so normal she thought as her stomach clenched so easy how long have you been up two or three hours when he walked back to the stove she turned around you didnt get much sleep his eyes met hers she was holding back he thought on both the hurt and the anger but they were there i dont need much not anymore he added two eggs to the milk he already had in a bowl i spent the better part of a year doing nothing but sleeping after i came back i didnt seem to need more than four hours a night i guess thats how you manage to run your businesses and the other yeah he continued to mix ingredients then dunked bread into the bowl you could say my metabolism changed among other things coated bread sizzled when he placed it in the skillet do you want me to apologize for what happened last night she didnt speak for a moment then opened a cupboard ill get some plates he bit off an oath fine this only takes a few minutes he waited until they were seated by the window deborah said nothing while she toyed with her breakfast her silence and the miserable look in her eyes were more disturbing to him than a hundred shouted accusations its your call he said quietly her eyes lifted to his i know i wont apologize for being in love with you or for making love with you being with you last night was the most important thing thats ever happened to me he waited watching her you dont believe that do you im not sure what i believe what i can believe she cupped her hands around her mug her fingers tense youve lied to me gage from the very beginning yes i have he banked down on the need to reach out for her just to touch her apologies for that really dont matter much it was deliberate and if it had been possible i would have continued to lie to you she pushed away from the table to wrap her arms around herself do you know how that makes me feel i think i do hurting she shook her head you couldnt possibly know you made me doubt myself on the most basic of levels i was falling in love with you with both of you and i was ashamed oh i can see now that i was a fool not to have realized it sooner my feelings were exactly the same for what i thought were two different men i would look at you and think of him look at him and think of you she pressed her fingers to her lips the words were pouring out too quickly that night in santiagos room after i came to and you were holding me i looked up into your eyes and remembered the first time i had seen you in the ballroom at the stuart palace i thought i was going crazy it wasnt done to hurt you only to protect you from what she demanded from myself from you every time you touched me i her breath hitched as she fought for composure that was her problem after all her emotions i dont know if i can forgive you gage or trust you even loving you i dont know he sat where he was knowing she would resist if he tried to approach her i cant make up for what was done i didnt want you deborah i didnt want anyone who could make me vulnerable enough to make a mistake he thought of his gift his curse i dont even have the right to ask you to take me as i am with this she pulled the mask from the pocket of her robe no you dont have the right to ask me to accept this but thats just what youre doing youre asking me to love you and youre asking me to close my eyes to what youre doing i dedicated my life to the law am i supposed to say nothing while you ignore it his eyes darkened i nearly lost my life to the law my partner died for it ive never ignored it gage this cant be personal the hell it cant its all personal whatever you read in your law books whatever precedents or procedures you find it all comes down to people you know that you feel that ive seen you work within the law she insisted gage you must see what youre doing is wrong not even to mention dangerous you have to stop his eyes were very dark very clear not even for you and if i go to mitchell to the police commissioner to fields then ill do whatever i have to do but i wont stop why she crossed to him the mask fisted in her hand damn it why because i dont have a choice he rose his hands gripping her shoulders hard before he let go and turned away theres nothing i can do to change it nothing i would do i know about montega when he turned back she saw the pain im sorry gage so sorry for what happened to you for what happened to your partner well bring montega in i swear it but revenge isnt the answer for you it cant be what happened to me four years ago changed my life thats not trite thats reality he laid his hand against the wall stared at it then pulled it back to stick it into his pocket you read the reports of what happened the night jack was killed yes i read them all the facts he murmured but not all the truth was it in the report that i loved him that he had a pretty wife and a little boy who liked to ride a red tricycle oh gage she couldnt prevent her eyes from filling or her arms from reaching out but he shook his head and moved away was it in the report that we had given nearly two years of our lives to break that case two years of dealing with the kind of slime who have big yachts big houses fat portfolios all from the money they earn selling drugs to smaller dealers who pay the rent by putting it out on the streets and the playgrounds and the projects two years working our way in our way up because we were cops and we believed we could make a difference he put his hands on the back of the chair fingers curling uncurling she could only stand and watch in silence as he remembered jack was going to take a vacation when it was over not to go anywhere just to sit around the house mow the grass fix a leaky sink spend time with jenny and his kid thats what he said i was thinking about going to aruba for a couple of weeks but jack he didnt have big dreams just ordinary ones he looked up out the window but he didnt see the sunlight or the traffic crowding the streets effortlessly he slid into the past we got out of the car we had a case full of marked bills plenty of backup and a solid cover what could go wrong we were both ready really ready we were going to meet the man in charge it was hot you could smell the water hear it lapping against the docks i was sweating not just because of the heat but because it didnt feel right but i didnt listen to my instincts and then montega gage could see him standing in the shadows of the docks gold glinting in his grin stinking cops he killed jack before i could even reach for my weapon and i froze just for an instant just for a heartbeat but i froze and he had me she thought of the scars on his chest and could hardly breathe to have watched his partner murdered to have had that moment that instant of time to see his own death coming the sharp shuddering pain that ripped through her was all for him dont what good does it do to go back and remember you couldnt have saved jack no matter how quick you had been no matter what you had done you couldnt have saved him he looked back at her not then i died that night the way he said it so flat so passionlessly had her blood going cold youre alive deaths almost a technical term these days technically i died and part of me slipped right out of my body her face grew only paler as he spoke but she had to know he had to tell her i watched them working on me there on the docks and again in the operating room i almost almost floated free and then i was trapped i dont understand back in my body but not back he lifted his hands spread them hed never tried to explain it to anyone before and wasnt certain he could sometimes i could hear voices the classical music the nurse left playing by the bed crying or id smell flowers i couldnt speak i couldnt see but more than that i couldnt feel anything he let his hands drop again i didnt want to then i came back and i felt too much it was impossible to imagine but she felt the pain and the despair in her own heart i wont say i understand what you went through no one could but it hurts me to think of it of what youre still going through he looked at her watched a tear slide down her cheek when i saw you that night in the alley my life changed again i was just as helpless to stop it as i had been the first time his gaze shifted down to the mask she held tight now my lifes in your hands i wish i knew what was right he came to her again lifting his hands to her face give me some time a few more days you dont know what youre asking me i do he said holding her still when she would have turned away but i dont have a choice deborah if i dont finish what ive started i might as well have died four years ago her mouth opened to argue to protest but she saw the truth of his words in his eyes isnt there another way not for me a few more days he repeated after that if you feel you have to take what you know to your superiors ill accept it and take the consequences she shut her eyes she knew what he could not that she would have given him anything mitchell gave me two weeks she said dully i cant promise you any longer he knew what it cost her and prayed he would find the time and the place to balance the scales i love you she opened her eyes looked into his i know she murmured then laid her head against his chest the mask dangled from her fingers i know you do she felt his arms around her the solid reality of them she lifted her head again to meet his lips with hers to let the kiss linger warm and promising even while her conscience waged a silent battle what was going to happen to them afraid she tightened her grip and held on why cant it be simple she whispered why cant it be ordinary he couldnt count the times he had asked himself the same questions im sorry no shaking her head she drew away im sorry it doesnt do any good to stand here whining about it with a sniffle she brushed away tears i may not know whats going to happen but i know what has to be done i have to go to work maybe i can find a way out of this thing she lifted a brow why are you smiling because youre perfect absolutely perfect as he had the night before he hooked a hand in the belt of her robe come to bed with me ill show you what i mean its nearly noon she said as he lowered his head to nibble at her ear i have work are you sure her eyes drifted closed her body swayed toward his ah yes she pulled away holding both palms out yes really i dont have much time neither of us do all right he smiled again when her lips moved into a pout at his easy acquiescence perhaps with luck he could give her something ordinary on one condition which is i have a charity function tonight a dinner a couple of performers dancing at the parkside the parkside she thought of the old exclusive and elegant hotel overlooking city park are you talking about the summer ball yeah thats it id considered skipping it but ive changed my mind will you go with me she lifted a brow youre asking me at noon if ill go with you to the biggest glitziest event in the city which begins eight hours from now and youre asking me when ive got to go to work have absolutely no hope of getting an appointment at a hairdresser no time to shop for the right dress that about covers it he said after a moment she blew out a breath what time are you going to pick me up at seven deborah stepped under a steaming hot shower she didnt believe it could possibly ease all the aches and she was over her quota of aspirin for the day six hours in front of a computer terminal a phone receiver at her ear had brought her minimal results each name she had checked had turned out to belong to someone long dead each address was a blind alley and each corporation she investigated led only to a maze of others the common thread as gage had termed it seemed to be frustration more than ever she needed to find the truth it wasnt only a matter of justice now it was personal though she knew that warped her objectivity it couldnt be helped until this was resolved she couldnt begin to know where her future and gages lay perhaps nowhere she thought as she bundled into a towel they had come together like lightning and thunder but storms passed she knew that an enduring relationship required more than passion her parents had had passion and no understanding it required even more than love her parents had loved but they had been unhappy trust without trust love and passion faded paled and vanished she wanted to trust him and to believe in him yet he didnt trust her there were things he knew that could bring her closer to the truth in the case they were both so involved in instead he kept them to himself determined that his way and only his way was the right one with a sigh she began to dry her hair wasnt she just as determined that her way only her way was the right one if they were so opposed on this one fundamental belief how could love be enough but she had agreed to see him that night not because she wanted to go to a fancy ball she thought if he had asked her for hot dogs and bowling she would have gone because she couldnt stay away if she was honest she would admit she didnt want to stay away she would give herself tonight deborah thought carefully applying blusher but like cinderella when the ball was over she would have to face reality moving briskly she walked into the bedroom spread over the bed was the dress she had bought less than an hour before fate she mused running a hand over its shimmering sequins hed said he liked her in blue when shed rushed into the dress shop frantic it had been there waiting a liquid column of rich royal blue studded with silvery sequins and it fit like a glove from its highbanded collar to its ankleskimming hem deborah had winced at the price tag then had gritted her teeth shed thrown caution and a months pay to the winds now looking in the mirror she couldnt regret it the rhinestone swirls at her ears were the perfect match with her hair swept up and back her shoulders were bare she shifted so was most of her back she was just slipping on her shoes when gage knocked his smile faded when she opened the door her own lips curved at the sudden and intense desire she saw in his eyes very slowly she turned a full circle what do you think he discovered if he did so very slowly he could breathe im glad i didnt give you more time to prepare why i couldnt have handled it if you were any more beautiful she tilted her chin show me he was almost afraid to touch her very gently he laid his hands on her shoulders lowered his mouth to hers but the taste of her punched into his system making his fingers tighten his mouth greedy with a murmur he shifted reaching out to shut the door oh no she was breathless and unsteady enough to have to lean back against the door but she was also determined for what i paid for this dress i want to take it out in public always practical he gave her one last lingering kiss we could be late she smiled at him well leave early when they arrived the ballroom was already crowded with the glamorous the influential the wealthy over champagne and appetizers deborah scanned the tables and the tablehoppers she saw the governor gladhanding a wellknown actress a publishing tycoon cheekbussing an opera star the mayor exchanging grins and guffaws with a bestselling author your usual crowd deborah murmured smiling at gage a few acquaintances he touched his glass to hers mmm thats tarrington isnt it she nodded her head toward a young earnestlooking man what do you think his chances are in the debates he has a lot to say gage commented sometimes a bit tactlessly but he has a point still hell have a hard time swaying the overforty vote gage arlo stuart stopped at their table patting his hand on gages shoulder good to see you glad you could make it wouldnt have missed it a tall tanned man with a wavy mane of snowy hair and clear green eyes he gestured with his glass of scotch youve done nice things in here i havent been in since you finished the renovations we like it it took deborah only a minute to realize they were talking about the hotel and that the hotel belonged to gage she glanced up at the opulent crystal chandeliers she should have known i like knowing my competition has class his gaze flicked to deborah speaking of class your face is very familiar and im too old for you to consider that a line arlo stuart deborah oroarke he took deborahs hand holding it in a hearty squeeze oroarke oroarke his eyes were both friendly and crafty youre the hot lawyer arent you the da who knocked that little creep slagerman down a peg the newspaper pictures arent even close mr stuart the mayor has good things to say about you very good things well have to have a dance later so you can tell me all you know about our friend nemesis her hand jerked in his but she managed to keep her eyes level it would be a short conversation not according to our favorite journalist of course wisners an ass he had yet to release her hand where did you meet our upandcoming da gage i must be frequenting the wrong places at your hotel he said easily the mayors fundraiser stuart gave a hearty laugh well that will teach me to run around drumming up votes for fields wont it dont forget that dance i wont she said grateful to have her hand sore fingers and all back in her lap when he walked away deborah wiggled her fingers is he always so exuberant yes gage picked up her hand and kissed it anything broken i dont think so content to have her hand in his she glanced around the room lush palms a musical fountain mirrored ceilings this is your hotel yeah do you like it its okay she gave a little shrug when he grinned shouldnt you be socializing i am he touched his lips to hers if you keep looking at me like that go on please she let out one long unsteady breath i think ill take a trip to the powder room halfway across the ballroom she was waylaid by the mayor id like a moment deborah of course with an arm around her waist flashing a broad political smile he steered her expertly through the crowd and through the high ballroom doors i thought we could use a little privacy glancing back she noted that jerry was moving their way at a signal from the mayor he stopped sent deborah an apologetic look and merged back with the crowd its quite an elaborate event deborah began schooled enough to know the mayor preferred to launch a topic himself i was surprised to see you here he nudged her away from the doors toward an alcove that held potted plants and pay phones then again perhaps i shouldnt have been since your and guthries names have been linked so often lately im seeing gage she said coolly if thats what you mean on a personal level she was already weary of playing politics is that what you wanted to talk to me about mayor my social life only as it affects your professional one i was disturbed and disappointed to learn that against my wishes youre remaining on this investigation your wishes she countered or mr guthries i respected and agreed with his viewpoint there was a flash of anger in his eyes he rarely showed outside of the privacy of his own offices frankly im displeased with your performance on this matter your excellent record in the courtroom does not override your reckless mistakes outside of it reckless believe me mayor fields i havent begun to be reckless im following my superiors orders in pursuing this matter i began it and i intend to finish it since were supposed to be on the same side id think youd be pleased with the dedication of the das office in this case not only with our persistence in tracking down and prosecuting the men trafficking drugs but in finding montega a known cop killer and bringing him to justice dont tell me whose side im on clearly on the edge of losing control he wagged a finger in her face ive worked for this city since before you could tie your own shoes you dont want to make an enemy of me young lady i run urbana and i intend to keep right on running it young overeager prosecutors are a dime a dozen are you threatening to have me fired im warning you with an obvious effort of will he brought himself under control you either work with the system or you work against it i know that her fingers tightened on her evening bag i admire you deborah he said more calmly but while you have enthusiasm you lack experience and a case like this requires more experienced hands and minds she stood her ground mitchell gave me two weeks im aware of that make sure you play by the book for the time you have left though his eyes were still hot he laid an avuncular hand on her arm enjoy yourself this evening the menus excellent when he left her she stood there for a moment quietly shaking with rage grappling for control she strode toward the ladies room inside she stormed through two arching ficus trees and into the adjoining room with its rosecolored chairs and mintgreen counters still seething she tossed her bag onto the counter and plopped down into a chair in front of one of the oval lighted mirrors so the mayor was displeased she thought he was disappointed he was disturbed she grabbed a lipstick out of her purse and concentrated on painting her lips what he was she thought was spitting mad because she had bucked him did he think there was only one way to do things only one route to take what the hell was wrong with taking a few detours as long as they led to the same destination especially if they got you there quicker she tossed the lipstick back into her purse and reached for her compact in the glass she met her own eyes what was she thinking only twentyfour hours before she had been sure there was only one way only one route and though she wouldnt have appreciated the mayors tactics she would have applauded his sentiments and now she dropped her chin on her hand and now she just wasnt sure wasnt she even at this moment veering outside of the system that she believed in wasnt she allowing her feelings her personal feelings for gage to interfere with her professional ethics or did it all come down to a matter of right and wrong with her not knowing which was which how could she continue how could she function as a lawyer if she couldnt see clearly what was right maybe it was time to examine the facts along with her own conscience and ask herself if it wouldnt be better for everyone if she did withdraw as she sat studying her own face and her own values the lights went out chapter contents prev next deborah clutched her evening bag and set one hand on the counter to orient herself big fancy hotel like this she thought and it blows a fuse though she tried to see the humor of it as she stood her heart was pounding she swore when her hip bumped the chair as she groped through the dark though it was foolish she was afraid and felt both trapped and smothered by the dark the door creaked open there was a shaft of light then blackness hey pretty lady she froze holding her breath i got a message for you the voice was high and piping with a giggle at the end of each sentence dont worry im not going to hurt you montega wants you all for himself and hed get real mad if i messed you up any first her skin iced over he couldnt see her deborah reminded herself as she fought the paralyzing fear that evened the odds who are you me another giggle youve been looking for me but im hard to find thats why they call me mouse i can get in and out of anyplace he was moving toward her soundlessly deborah could only guess at the direction of his voice you must be very clever after she spoke she too moved shifting a careful foot to the left im good im the best aint nobody better than old mouse montega wanted me to tell you hes real sorry you didnt get to talk more before he wants you to know hes keeping an eye on you all the time and on your family for an instant her blood stopped flowing her thoughts of outmaneuvering him of slipping past him to the door vanished my family he knows people in denver too real slick people he was closer now so close she could smell him but she didnt move away if you cooperate hell make sure your sister and the rest stay safe and snug in their beds tonight get the picture she reached into her bag felt the cool metal in her hand yes i get the picture pulling it out she aimed in the direction of his voice i and fired screaming he crashed into the chairs deborah sprinted around him ramming her shoulder against one wall then another until she located the door mouse was weeping and cursing as she tugged and found the door jammed oh god oh god panicked she continued to pull deborah she heard her name shouted get away from the door step back from the door she took one stumbling step backward and heard the heavy thud another and the door crashed open she ran into the light and gages arms youre all right his hands were running over her checking for hurts yes yes she buried her face in his shoulder ignoring the gathering crowd hes inside when he started to push away deborah held on tighter no please his face grim gage nodded to a pair of security guards come and sit down no im okay though her breath was still shuddering she drew away to look at his face she saw murder there and tightened her hold on him really he didnt even touch me he was trying to frighten me gage he didnt hurt me his voice was low as he studied her pale face is that supposed to make me want to kill him less with a burly guard on each arm the weeping mouse stumbled out his hands covering his face deborah noted he was wearing a waiters uniform alarmed by the look in gages eyes she pulled his attention back to her hes in a lot worse shape than i am i used this with an unsteady hand deborah held up a can of mace ive been carrying it with me since that night in the alley gage wasnt sure if he should laugh or swear instead he pulled her against him and kissed her it looks as though i cant let you out of my sight deborah jerry elbowed through the onlookers are you all right i am now the police i called them myself jerry glanced up at gage you should get her out of here im fine deborah insisted glad the fulllength dress concealed her knocking knees ill have to go down to the police station and make a statement but i need to make a phone call first ill call whomever you like jerry gave her hand a quick squeeze thanks but i need to do this behind him she spotted the mayor you could do me a favor and hold fields off my back for a while done he looked at gage again take care of her i intend to keeping deborah tight at his side gage led her away from the crowd he moved quickly across the lobby and toward a bank of elevators where are we going i keep an office here you can make the call from there inside the elevator he turned her to him again and held tight what happened well i didnt get to powder my nose she turned her face into his collar breathing deeply first fields waylaid me and read me the riot act hes not pleased with my performance when the elevator doors opened she loosened her hold so they could walk into the hallway when we parted ways i was seeing red i sat down in the powder room to repair my makeup and my composure she was calming and grateful the shaking had stopped very elegant by the way he shot her a look as he slid a key into a lock im glad you approve i liked it a lot she stepped into the parlor of a suite and crossed the thick oatmealcolored carpet until the lights went out i was just orienting myself when the door opened and he came in the elusive mouse she said as her stomach began to churn again he had a message for me from montega the name just the name had gages muscles tensing sit down ill get you a brandy the phone right there go ahead gage was fighting his own demons as he moved to the bar for the decanter and two snifters shed been alone and however resourceful she was shed been vulnerable when hed heard the screaming his fingers went white on the decanter if it had been montega instead of his messenger boy she could have been dead and he would have been too late nothing that had happened to him before nothing that could happen to him in the future would be more devastating than losing her she was sitting now very straight very tense her face too pale her eyes too dark in one hand she held the receiver while the other vised around the cord she was talking fast to her brotherinlaw gage realized after a moment they had threatened her family he could see the possibility they would be harmed was more terrifying to her than any attempt on her own life i need you to call me every day she insisted youll make sure cilia has guards at the radio station the children she covered her face with her hand god boyd she listened a moment nodding trying to smile yes i know i know you didnt make captain for nothing ill be fine yes and careful i love you all of you she paused again inhaling deeply yes i know bye she replaced the receiver saying nothing gage pushed the snifter into her hands she cupped it a moment staring down at the amber liquid on another deep breath she tipped the glass to her lips and drank deeply she shuddered drank again thanks your brotherinlaws a good cop he wont let anything happen to them he saved cilias life years ago thats when they fell in love abruptly she looked up her eyes wet and eloquent i hate this gage theyre my family all i have left of family the idea that something ive done something im doing could she broke off pulling herself back from the unthinkable when i lost my parents i didnt think anything would ever be as bad but this with a shake of her head she looked down at the brandy again my mother was a cop he knew he knew it all but he only covered her hand with his and let her talk she was a good one or so i was told i was only twelve when it happened i didnt know her very well not really she wasnt cut out to be a mother she shrugged it off but even in that casual dismissive gesture he saw the scars and my father she continued he was a lawyer a public defender he tried hard to keep it all together the family the illusion of family but he and my mother just couldnt pull it off she sipped the brandy again grateful for its numbing smoothness two uniforms came to school that day picked me up took me back to the house i guess i knew i knew my mother was dead they told me as gently as possible that it was both of them both of them some creep my father was defending managed to smuggle in a gun when they were in the conference room he cut loose im sorry deborah i know how hard it is to lose family she nodded setting the empty snifter aside i guess thats why i was determined to be a lawyer a prosecutor both of my parents dedicated their lives and lost them defending the law i didnt want it to have been for nothing do you understand yes he brought her hands to his lips for whatever reason you chose to be a lawyer it was the right decision youre a good one thanks deborah he hesitated wanting to phrase his thoughts carefully i respect both your integrity and your abilities i feel a but coming on i want to ask you again to back off from this to leave the rest to me youll have your chance to do what you do best and thats prosecute montega and the rest of them she gave herself a moment wanting as he had to make her thoughts clear gage tonight after the mayor came down on me i sat in the powder room once i got over being mad i started to think to examine my position and my motives i began to think maybe the mayor was right maybe it would be better if i turned this over to someone with more experience and less personal involvement then she shook her head and i cant especially now they threatened my family if i stepped back id never be able to trust myself again to believe in myself i have to finish this before he could speak she put her hands on his shoulders i dont agree with you i dont know if i ever can but i understand in my heart what youre doing and why you have to do it thats all im asking from you how could he refuse then i guess we have a stalemate for now i have to go down and make my statement she rose held out a hand will you come with me they wouldnt let her talk to mouse deborah figured she could work around that eventually by monday she would have the police reports if nothing else with mouse under tight security it was unlikely the same kind of accident could befall him as it had parino for the answers she needed she would bargain with mouse just as she would have bargained with the devil she gave her statement wearily waited while it was typed for her signature on saturday night the station was hopping hookers and pimps dealers and mugging victims gang members and harried public defenders it was reality an aspect of the system she represented and believed in but it was with relief that she stepped outside long night she murmured you handled yourself very well he laid a hand on her cheek you must be exhausted actually im starving her lips curved we never did have dinner ill buy you a hamburger with a laugh she threw her arms around him perhaps some things some very precious things could be simple my hero he pressed his lips to the side of her throat ill buy you a dozen hamburgers he murmured then for gods sake deborah come home with me yes she turned her lips to his yes he knew how to set the stage perfectly when deborah walked into the bedroom beside him there was moonlight drifting through the windows stardust filtering through the skylight candle glow warming the shadows roses the scent of them sweetened the air the sound of a hundred violins romanced it she didnt know how hed managed it all with the single phone call hed made from the noisy little diner where they had eaten she didnt care it was enough to know he would have thought of it its lovely she was nervous she realized ridiculously so after the passion of the previous night but her legs were unsteady as she crossed to where a bottle of champagne sat nestled in a crystal bowl of ice you thought of everything only of you his lips brushed her shoulder before he poured the wine ive pictured you here a hundred times a thousand he offered her a glass so have i her hand trembled as she lifted her glass desire fighting to break free the first time you kissed me up in the tower whole worlds opened up its never been like that for me before i nearly begged you to stay that night even though you were angry he slipped off one of her earrings then let his fingers rub over the sensitive lobe i wonder if you would have i dont know i would have wanted to thats almost enough he drew off her other earring set them both on the table slowly he slid out one of her hairpins then another watching her always watching her youre shivering his hands were so gentle his eyes so urgent i know he took the glass from her limp fingers and set it aside with his eyes on hers he continued to free her hair the whisper of his fingertips on the nape of her neck youre not afraid of me of what you can do to me something flared in his eyes dark and dangerous but he lowered his head to gently kiss her temple heavyeyed and sultry she looked up at him kiss me gage i will his mouth trailed over her face teasing never satisfying her i am her breath was already coming fast you dont have to seduce me he ran a finger up and down her bare spine smiling when she shuddered its my pleasure and he wanted it to be hers the night before all the passion all the fierce and angry needs had clawed their way out of him tonight he wanted to show her the softer side of love when she swayed against him he withstood the swift arrows of desire we made love in the dark he murmured as his fingers flicked open the trio of buttons at the back of her neck tonight i want to see you the dress shimmered down her a glittery blue pool at her feet she wore only a lacy womans fancy that lifted her breasts and skimmed transparent to her hips her beauty struck him breathless every time i look at you i fall in love again then dont stop looking she reached up to undo the formal tie her fingers slid down to unfasten the unfamiliar studs dont ever stop she parted his shirt with her hands then pressed her mouth to the heated skin beneath the tip of her tongue left a moist trail before she lifted her head let it fall back in invitation her eyes were a rich blue gleam beneath her lashes kiss me now as seduced as she he branded her lips with his twin moans low and throaty shuddered through the room her hands slid slowly up his chest to his shoulders to push the dinner jacket aside her fingers tightened then went bonelessly lax as he softened the kiss deepened it gentled it he lifted her into his arms as though she were fragile crystal rather than flesh and blood with his eyes on hers he held her there a moment letting his mouth tease and torment hers he continued those featherlight kisses as he carried her to the bed he sat holding her cradled in his lap his mouth continued its quiet devastation of her reason he could almost see her float her eyes drifted shut her limbs were fluid in arousing contrast her heart pounded under his hand he wanted her like this totally pleasured totally his as he drew more and more of that warm exotic flavor from her mouth he thought he could stay just so for hours for days she felt each impossibly tender touch the stroke of a fingertip the brush of his palm the ohsopatient quest of his lips her body seemed as light as the rosescented air yet her arms were too heavy to lift the music and his murmurs merged in her mind into one seducing song beneath it was the violent roar of her own speeding pulse she knew she had never been more vulnerable or more willing to go wherever he chose to take her and this was love a need more basic than hunger than thirst one quiet helpless gasp escaped her when his lips whispered over the tops of her breasts slowly erotically his tongue slid under the lace to tease her hardened nipples his fingers played over the skin above her stockings lightly so lightly gliding beneath the sheer triangle of material with one touch he sent her over the first towering peak she arched like a bow and the pleasure arrowed out of her into him then she seemed to melt in his arms breathless almost delirious she reached for him gage let me i will he covered her next stunned cry with his mouth and while she was still shuddering he laid her on the bed now he thought he could take her now while she lay hot and damp in surrender there was moonlight on her skin on her hair the white lace she wore was like an illusion when she looked at him from beneath those heavy lashes he saw the dark flicker of desire he had more to show her his knuckles brushed her skin making her jolt as he unhooked her stocking almost lazily he slid it down her leg following the route with soft openmouthed kisses his tongue glided over the back of her knee down her calf until she was writhing in mindless pleasures trapped in gauzy layers of sensation she reached for him again only to have him evade and repeat each devastating delight on her other leg his mouth journeyed up lingering pausing until it found her his name burst from her lips as she reared up nearly weeping she grasped him against her and at the first touch the strength seemed to pour into her furnace hot her flesh met his but it wasnt enough urgent her fingers pulled at his open shirt tearing seams in her desperation to find more of him as she ripped the silk away her teeth nipped into his shoulder she felt his stomach muscles quiver heard the quick intake of his breath as she pulled at the waistband of his trousers buttons popped off i want you her mouth fixed ravenously to his oh lord i want you the control he had held so tightly slipped through his tensed fingers desire overpowered him she overpowered him with her desperate hands her greedy mouth the breath was clogging in his lungs burning as he struggled out of his clothes then they were kneeling in the middle of the ravaged bed bodies trembling eyes locked he hooked a hand in the bodice of the lace and rent it ruthlessly down the center with his fingers digging into her hips he pulled her against him during the rough reckless ride she arched back her hands slid down his slick shoulders then found purchase she sobbed out his name as she tumbled off the razors edge of sanity he gripped her hair in his hand and drove her up again again then he closed his mouth over hers and followed weak she lay on the bed one arm tossed across her eyes the other hanging limply off the mattress she knew she couldnt move wasnt sure she could speak doubted that she was even breathing yet when he pressed a kiss to her shoulder she shuddered again i meant to be gentle with you she managed to open her eyes his face was close she felt his fingers move in her hair then i guess youll just have to try again until you get it right a smile curved his mouth i have a feeling thats going to take a long time good she traced his smile with a fingertip i love you gage thats the only thing that seems to matter tonight its the only thing that matters he put a hand over hers there was a bond in the touch every bit as deep and as intimate as their lovemaking ill get you some wine with a contented sigh she settled back as he got up i never thought it could be like this i never thought i could be like this like what she caught a glimpse of herself in the wide mirror across the room sprawled naked over pillows and rumpled sheets so wanton i guess she laughed at her choice of words in college i had a reputation for being very cool very studious and very unapproachable schools out he sat on the bed handed her a glass then tapped his against it i guess but even after when i started in the das office the reputation remained she wrinkled her nose earnest oroarke i like it when youre earnest he sipped i can see you in a law library poring over thick dusty books scribbling notes she made a face thats not exactly the image i prefer at the moment i like it he lowered his head to capture her chin gently between his teeth youd be wearing one of those conservatively tailored suits in those very unconservative colors you like she frowned a bit making him chuckle sensible shoes and very discreet jewelry you make me sound like a prude and under it all would be something thin and sexy he hooked a finger in a torn swatch of lace and lifted it to the light a very personal choice for a very proper attorney then youd start quoting precedents and making me crazy like warner v kowaski mmm he switched to her ear just like and id be the only one who knew that it takes six pins to hold your hair back in that very proper twist i know i can be too serious she murmured its only because what i do is so important to me she looked down at her wine i have to know what im doing is right that the system i represent works when he drew away to study her she sighed i know part of its ego and ambition but another part of it is so basic gage so ingrained thats why i worry how you and i are going to resolve this we wont resolve it tonight i know but not tonight he said laying a finger over her lips tonight its just you and me i need that deborah and so do you she nodded youre right im being too earnest again we can fix that he grinned and held up his glass to the light the champagne bubbled by getting drunk she said brow lifted more or less when his eyes met hers there was a smile in them why dont i show you a less serious way to drink champagne he tilted his glass and had a trickle of cool wine sliding over her breast chapter contents prev next gage lost track of time as he watched her sleep the candles had gutted out in their own hot fragrant wax so that their scent drifted quiet as a memory she had a hand in his holding lightly even in sleep the shadows lifted fading in the pearl gray of dawn he watched the growing light fall over her hair her face her shoulders just as softly he followed its path with his lips but he didnt want to wake her there was too much to be done too much he still refused to make her a part of he knew that over a matter of weeks the goals he carried inside him for more than four years had become mixed it was not enough now to avenge his partners death it was not enough now to seek and find payment for the time and the life that had been stolen from him even justice that driving force was not enough he would have to move quickly now for each day that passed without answers was another day deborah was in jeopardy there was nothing more important than keeping her safe he slid away from her moving soundlessly from the bed to dress there was time to make up all the hours he had spent with her rather than on the streets or at his work he glanced back when she shifted and snuggled deeper into the pillow she would sleep through the morning and he would work he pushed a button beneath the carved wood on the wall farthest from the bed a panel slid open gage stepped into the dark and let it close again at his back with the husky morning greeting still on her tongue deborah blinked sleepily had she been dreaming she wondered she would have sworn gage had stepped into some kind of secret passageway baffled she pushed up on her elbows in sleep she had reached for him and finding him gone had awakened just at the moment when the wall had opened not a dream she assured herself for he wasnt beside her and the sheets where he had lain were already cooling more secrets she thought and felt the sorrow of his distrust envelop her after the nights they had spent together the love he had shown her he still wouldnt give her his trust so she would take it deborah told herself as she pushed herself out of bed she would not sit and sulk or wish and whine but demand fumbling in his closet she located a robe soft cotton in steel gray it hit her midcalf impatient she bundled the sleeves up out of her way and began to search for the mechanism that opened the panel even knowing the approximate location it took her ten frustrating minutes to find it and another two to figure out how it worked her breath hissed out in satisfaction as the panel slid open without hesitation she stepped into the dark narrow corridor keeping one hand on the wall for guidance she started forward there was no dank disused smell as she might have expected the air was clean the wall smooth and dry even when the panel behind her closed her completely into the dark she wasnt uneasy there would be no scratching or skittering sounds here it was obvious gage used the passage and whatever it led to often she picked her way along straining her eyes and ears corridors veered off twisting like snakes from the main passage but she followed instinct and kept to the same straight path after a moment she saw a dim glow up ahead and moved a bit more quickly a set of stone stairs with pieshaped treads curved into a tight semicircle as it plunged downward with one hand tight on the thin iron rail she wove her way to the bottom where she was faced with three tunnels leading in different directions the lady or the tiger she thought then shook her head at her own fancy damn you gage where did you go her whisper echoed faint and hollow then died bracing her shoulders she started through one archway changed her mind and backtracked to the middle again she hesitated then she heard it dim and dreamy down the last tunnel music she plunged into the dark again following the sound moving cautiously down the sloping stone floor she had no idea how deep she was traveling underground but the air was cooling rapidly the music grew in volume as degree by faint degree the tunnels light increased she heard a mechanical hum and a clatter like typewriter keys hitting a platen when she stepped into the mouth of the tunnel she could only stand and stare it was an enormous room with curving stone walls cavernlike with its arching ceiling and echoes it spread more than fifty feet in every direction but it wasnt primitive she thought as she gathered gages robe close around her throat rather than appearing gloomy it was brilliantly lit equipped with a vast computer system printers and monitors blinking away television screens were bolted to one wall an enormous topographic map of urbana spread over another music eerily romantic poured out of speakers she couldnt see granitegray counters held work stations telephones stacks of photographs and papers there was a control panel studded with switches and buttons and levers gage sat in front of it his fingers moving over the map lights blinked on he shifted working the controls on a computer screen the map was reproduced he looked like a stranger his face grimly set and intense she wondered if his choice of a black sweater and jeans had been deliberate she stepped forward down a trio of stone steps well she began as he turned quickly you didnt include this on my tour deborah he stood automatically turning off the monitor id hoped youd sleep longer im sure you did she stuck her tensed hands into the deep pockets of his robe apparently ive interrupted your work an interesting getaway she decided nemesiss style id say dramatic secretive she moved past a bank of computers toward the map and thorough she murmured very thorough she whirled around one question just the one that seems to matter the most at the moment who am i sleeping with im the same man you were with last night are you are you the same man who told me he loved me who showed me he did in dozens of beautiful ways is that the same man who left me in bed to come down here how long are you going to lie to me it isnt a matter of lying to you this is something i have to do i thought you understood that then you were wrong i didnt understand that you would keep this from me that you would work without me holding information from me he seemed to change before her eyes growing distant and cool and aloof you gave me two weeks damn you i gave you more than that i gave you everything her eyes were brilliant with emotion as hurt and anger battled for priority but she flung up a hand before he could cross to her no dont you wont use my feelings this time all right though his own were straining for release it isnt a matter of feelings but logic you should appreciate that deborah this is my work your presence here is as unnecessary as mine would be in the courtroom with you logic she spat out the word its only logical if it suits your purposes do you think im a fool do you think i cant see whats happening here she gestured sharply toward one of the monitors and well keep it strictly professional you have all the information ive been painfully digging up all the names all the numbers and more much more than ive been able to uncover yet you havent told me and wouldnt have the cloak came around him again impenetrable i work alone yes im aware of that the bitterness seeped into her voice as she walked toward him no partners except in bed im good enough to be your partner there one has nothing to do with the other everything she all but shouted one has everything to do with the other if you cant trust me in every way respect me in every way and be honest with me in every way then theres nothing between us damn it deborah you dont know everything he gripped her arms you dont understand everything no i dont because you wont let me cant let you he corrected holding her still when she would have pulled away theres a difference between lying to you and holding back information this isnt blackandwhite yes it is these are vicious men without conscience without morals theyve already tried to kill you and youd hardly broken the surface i wont risk you if you want blackandwhite there it is he shook her punctuating each word i will not risk you you cant prevent me from doing my job or what i feel is right by god if i have to lock you upstairs until im done with this to keep you safe i will and then what will the same thing happen the next time and the next ill do whatever it takes to protect you that wont change maybe youve got a nice little plastic bubble you could stick me in she put her hands on his forearms willing him to understand if you love me then you have to love the whole person i am i demand that just as i demand to know and love the whole person you are she saw something flicker in his eyes and pushed her point i cant become something different for you someone who sits and waits to be taken care of im not asking you to arent you if you cant accept me now you never will gage i want a life with you not just a few nights in bed but a life children a home a history but if you cant share with me what you know and who you are there cant be a future for us she broke away from him and if thats the case it would be better for both of us if i left now dont he reached out for her before she could turn away however deep his own need for survival ran it was nothing compared to the possibility of life without her i need your word his fingers tightened on hers that you wont take any chances and that youll move in here with me at least until its over whatever we find here has to stay here you cant risk taking it to the da not yet gage im obligated to no he cut her off whatever we do whatever we find stays here until were ready to move i cant give you more than that deborah im only asking for a compromise and it was costing him she could see that all right i wont take anything to mitchell until were both sure but i want it all gage everything her voice calmed her hands gentled dont you see i know youre holding something back from me something basic that has nothing to do with secret rooms or data i know and it hurts me he turned away if he was to give her everything he had no choice but to begin with himself the silence stretched between them before he broke it there are things you dont know about me deborah things you may not like or be able to accept the tone of his voice had her mouth growing dry and her pulse beating irregularly do you have such little faith in me he was putting ail his faith in her he thought ive had no right to let things go as far as they have between us without letting you know what i am he reached out to touch her cheek hoping it wouldnt be the last time i didnt want to frighten you youre frightening me now whatever you have to tell me just tell me well work it out without speaking he walked away from her toward the stone wall he turned and with his eyes on her vanished deborahs mouth opened but the only sound she could make was a strangledgasp with her eyes riveted to where gage should be had to be her confused brain insisted she stumbled back her unsteady hand gripped the arm of a chair as she let her numbed body slide into it even while her mind rejected what her eyes had seen he returned materializing ten feet from where he had disappeared for an instant she could see through him as if he were no more than the ghost of the man who stood in front of her deborah started to rise decided against it then cleared her throat its an odd time for magic tricks it isnt a trick her eyes were still huge with shock as he walked toward her wondering if she would stiffen or jerk away at least not the way you mean all these gadgets youve got down here she said clinging desperately to the lifeline of logic in a sea of confusion whatever youre using it produces quite an optical illusion she swallowed i imagine the pentagon would be very interested its not an illusion he touched her arm and though she didnt pull away as hed feared she would her skin was cold and clammy youre afraid of me now thats absurd but her voice was shaking she forced herself to stand it was just a trick an effective one but she broke off when he placed his hand palm down on the counter beside them it vanished to the wrist dark and dazed her eyes lifted to his oh god its not possible terrified she pulled his arm and was almost faint with relief when she saw his hand whole and warm its possible he brought the hand gently to her face its real she lifted her trembling fingers to his give me a minute moving carefully she turned and walked a few steps away rejection sliced through him a dull angry blade im sorry with great effort he controlled his voice kept it even i didnt know of a better way an easier way to show you if i had tried to explain you wouldnt have believed me no no i wouldnt have she had seen it yet her mind still wanted to argue that she could not have seen it a game a trick nothing more though there was a comfort in the denial she remembered how time and again nemesis had seemed to vanish before her eyes she turned back and saw that he was watching her his body tensed and ready no game when she accepted the truth her trembling only increased briskly she rubbed her hands up and down her arms hoping to warm and steady the muscles how do you do this im not completely sure he opened his hands stared at them then fisted them to push them impotently into his pockets something happened to me when i was in the coma something changed me a few weeks after i came back i discovered it almost by accident i had to learn to accept it to use it because i know it was given to me for a reason and so nemesis yes and so nemesis he seemed to steady himself deborah saw that his eyes were level and curiously blank when he looked at her i have no choice in this deborah but you do i dont think i understand she lifted a hand to her head and gave a quick shaky laugh i know i dont understand i wasnt honest with you about what i am the man you fell in love with was normal baffled she let her hand fall to her side again im not following you i fell in love with you damn it im not normal his eyes were suddenly furious ill never be ill carry this thing with me until i die i cant tell you how i know i just do gage but when she reached out to him he backed away i dont want your pity you dont have it she snapped back why should you youre not ill youre whole and youre healthy if anything im angry because you held this back from me too and i know why she dragged both hands through her hair as she paced away from him you thought id walk didnt you you thought i was too weak too stupid or too fragile to handle it you didnt trust me to love you her fury built so quickly she was all but blind with it you didnt trust me to love you she repeated well the hell with you i do and i always will she turned sprinting for the stairs he caught her at the base of them turning her back to him and pulling her close while she cursed at him and struggled call me anything you like he grabbed her shoulders and shook once slap me again if you want but dont leave you expected me to didnt you she demanded she tossed her head back as she strained away from him you expected me to turn around and walk away yes she started to shout at him then she saw what was in his eyes what he held back with such rigid control it was fear accusations melted away you were wrong she said quietly with her eyes still on his she lifted her hands to his face rose on her toes and kissed him a shudder from him from her twin waves of relief he drew her closer crushing consuming as huge as his fear had been a need sprang up to replace it it was not pity he tasted on her lips but passion small seductive sounds hummed in her throat as she struggled out of the robe it was more than an offering of herself it was a demand that he take her as she was that he allow himself to be taken with an oath that ended in a groan he moved his hands over her he was caught in the madness a purifying madness impatient she tugged at his shirt make love with me her head fell back and her eyes were as challenging as her voice make love with me now she pulled at his clothes even as they lowered to the floor frenzied and frantic heated and hungry they came together power leaped like windfed flames it was always so between them she thought as her body shuddered shuddered shuddered yet now there was more here was a unity here was compassion trust vulnerability to mix with hungers she had never wanted him more her hands clenched in his dark hair as she rose above him she needed to see his face his eyes i love you the breath tore in her throat let me show you how i love you agile quick greedy she moved over him taking her mouth down his throat over his chest down to where his taut stomach muscles quivered under her moist seeking lips the blood pounded in his head his heart his loins she was a miracle the second hed been given in a lifetime when he reached for her he reached for love and for salvation they rolled a tangle of limbs and needs unmindful of the hard unyielding floor the clatter and hum of machines blindly working breath came fast heartbeats galloped each taste each touch seemed more potent more pungent than ever before his fingers dug into her hips when he lifted her she sheathed him surrounded him the pleasure speared them both their hands slid toward each others palm against palm then fingers locked tight they held on eyes open bodies joined until they took the final leap together boneless she slid down to him her mouth brushed his once then again before she lay her head on his shoulder never had she felt more beautiful more desirable more complete than in feeling his heart thunder wildly beneath hers her lips curved as she turned and pressed them to his throat that was my way of saying youre stuck with me i like the way you get your point across gently he ran a hand up and down her spine she was his hed been a fool to ever doubt it or her does this mean im forgiven not necessarily bracing her hands on his shoulders she pushed herself up i dont understand who you are maybe i never will but understand this i want all or i want nothing i saw what evasions denials refusals did to my parents marriage i wont live with that he put a hand on hers very lightly is that a proposal she didnt hesitate yes do you want an answer now her eyes narrowed yes and dont think you can get out of it by disappearing ill just wait until you come back he laughed amazed that she could joke about something hed been so sure would repel her then i guess youll have to make an honest man out of me i intend to she kissed him briefly then shifted away to bundle into the robe no long engagement okay as soon as we put a cap on this thing and cilia and boyd can arrange to bring the kids out we get married agreed humor danced in his eyes anything else i want children right away he hitched on his jeans any particular number one at a time sounds reasonable and shut up a minute he took her hands deborah i want to be married to you to spend the rest of my life knowing when i reach out ill find you there and i want a family our family he pressed his lips to the fingers that curled over his i want forever with you he watched her blink back tears and kissed her gently right now i want something else what breakfast with a strangled laugh she threw her arms around him me too they ate in the kitchen laughing and cozy as if they always shared the first meal of the day together the sun was bright the coffee strong deborah had dozens of questions to ask him but she held them back for this one hour she wanted them to be two ordinary people in love ordinary she thought strange but she felt they were and could be ordinary even with the very extraordinary aspects of their lives all they needed were moments like this where they could sit in the sunshine and talk of inconsequential things when frank walked in he paused at the kitchen doorway and gave deborah a polite nod is there anything you need this morning mr guthrie she knows frank gage laid a hand over deborahs she knows everything a grin split franks wide sober face well its about time all pretense of formality dropped as he lumbered across the room to pluck up a piece of toast he took a seat at the semicircular breakfast nook bit into the toast and gestured with the half that was left i told him you wouldnt head for the hills when you found out about his little vanishing act youre too tough for that thank you i think deborah chuckled and the rest of the toast disappeared in one healthy bite i know people frank said taking the tray of bacon gage passed him in my profession my former profession you had to be able to make somebody quick and i was good real good right gage thats right frank i could spot a patsy two blocks away he wagged a piece of bacon at deborah you aint no patsy and shed thought of him as the strong silent type deborah mused she was fascinated by the way he made up for lost time rattling quickly as he steamshoveled food away youve been with gage a long time eight years not counting the couple of times he sent me up kind of like kato to his green hornet he grinned again then let out a series of guffaws hey i like her gage shes okay i told you she was okay yes you did deborahs going to be staying frank how would you like to be best man no kidding deborah didnt think franks grin could stretch any wider then she saw the gleam of tears in his eyes at that moment her heart was lost to him no kidding she shifted took his big face in her hands and kissed him firmly on the mouth there youre first to kiss the bridetobe how about that deborah had to bite back a chuckle as a beetred blush stained franks face how about that id like deborah to move in a few things today gage put in she glanced down at the robe besides the borrowed garment she had an evening dress a pair of stockings and an evening bag i could use a few things but she was thinking of the big room downstairs the computers the information gage had at his fingertips gage had little trouble following the direction of her thoughts do you have someone who could put what you need together frank could go by your apartment and pick them up yes she thought of mrs greenbaum ill just make a call within a half an hour she was back in gages secret room wearing a pair of his jeans hitched up with the belt of his robe and a crisply pressed linen shirt skimming her thighs hands on her hips she studied the map as gage explained these are drop points major drug deals ive been able to run makes on a handful of the messengers why havent you fed this information to the police he glanced at her briefly on this point they might never agree it wouldnt help them get any closer to the top men right now im working on the pattern he moved to one of the computers and after a moment signaled to her none of the drops are less than twenty blocks apart he motioned to the reproduction on the monitor the time span between them is fairly steady he punched a few buttons a list of dates rolled onto the screen two weeks sometimes three frowning in concentration she studied the screen can i have a printout of this why id like to run it through my computer at the office see if i can find any correlation it isnt safe before she could argue he took her hand and led her to another work station he tapped a code in the keyboard and brought up a file deborahs mouth opened in surprise as she saw her own work reproduced on the screen youve tapped into my system she murmured in more ways than one the point is if i can so can someone else anything you need you can find here apparently she sat far from sure how she felt about gage or anyone else peeking over her shoulder as she worked am i on the right track saying nothing he tapped in a new code youve been going after the corporations and the directors a logical place to start whoever set up the organization knows business four years ago we didnt have the information or the technology to get this close so we had to go in and physically infiltrate names flipped by some she recognized some she didnt they were all tagged deceased it didnt work because there was a leak someone who knew about the undercover operation passed the information to the other side montega was waiting for us and he knew we were cops though deborah felt a chill he said it calmly he also had to know exactly how we were set up that night to the man otherwise he could never have slipped through the backup another cop its a possibility we had ten handpicked men on the team that night ive checked out every one of them their bank accounts their records their lifestyle so far i havent found a thing who else knew my captain the commissioner the mayor he made a restless movement with his shoulders maybe more we were only cops they didnt tell us everything when you find the pattern what then i wait i watch and i follow the man with the money leads me to the man in charge and hes the one i want she suppressed a shudder promising herself she would somehow convince him to let the police take over when they had enough information while youre looking for that id like to concentrate on finding names that common thread all right he ran a hand over her hair until it rested on her shoulder this machine is similar to the one you use in the office it has a few more how do you know she interrupted how do i know what what machine i use in the office he had to smile deborah lightly lingering he bent down to kiss her theres nothing about you i dont know uncomfortable she shifted away then rose will i find my name programmed on one of these machines he watched her knowing he would have to tread lightly yes i told myself it was routine but the truth was i was in love with you and greedy for every detail i know when you were born to the minute and where i know you broke your wrist falling off a bike when you were five that you moved in with your sister and her husband after the death of your parents and when your sister divorced you moved with her richmond chicago dallas finally denver where you zipped through college in three years cum laude drove yourself through law school to graduate in the top five percent of your class and passed your bar on the first attempt with enough finesse to bring you offers from four of the top law firms in the country but you chose to come here and work in the das office she rubbed her palms over the thighs of her jeans its odd to hear an encapsulated version of my life story there were things i couldnt learn from the computer the important things he thought the vital things the way your hair smells the way your eyes go to indigo when youre angry or aroused the way you make me feel when you touch me i wont deny i invaded your privacy but i wont apologize for it no you wouldnt she said after a moment she let out a little breath and i suppose i cant be overly offended since i ran a make on you too he smiled i know she laughed shaking her head okay lets get to work they had hardly settled when one of the three phones on the long counter rang deborah barely glanced over as gage lifted a receiver guthrie gage its frank im at deborahs apartment youd better get over here chapter contents prev next her heart beating erratically deborah sprinted out of the elevator and down the hall one step in front of gage franks phone call had had them shooting across town in gages aston martin in record time the door was open deborahs breath stopped as she stood on the threshold and saw the destruction of her apartment curtains slashed mementos crushed tables and chairs viciously broken and tossed in pieces on the floor the first groan escaped before she spotted lil greenbaum propped on the remains of the torn and tattered sofa her face deathly white oh god kicking debris aside she rushed over to drop to her knees mrs greenbaum she took the cold frail hand in hers lils thin lids fluttered up and her myopic eyes struggled to focus without the benefit of her glasses deborah though her voice was weak she managed a faint smile they never would have done it if they hadnt caught me by surprise they hurt you she looked up as frank came out of the bedroom carrying a pillow did you call an ambulance she wouldnt let me gently he slipped the pillow under lils head dont need one hate hospitals just a bump on the head lil said and squeezed deborahs hand ive had one before do you want me to worry myself sick as she spoke deborah slipped her fingers down to monitor lils pulse your apartments in worse shape than i am its easy to replace my things how would i replace you she kissed lils gnarled knuckles please for me defeated lil let out a sigh okay ill let them poke at me but i wont stay in the hospital good enough she turned but gage was already lifting the phone its dead mrs greenbaums apartment is right across the hall gage nodded to frank the keys deborah began frank doesnt need keys he crossed over to crouch beside deborah mrs greenbaum can you tell us what happened she studied him narrowing and widening her eyes until she brought him into shaky focus i know you dont i you picked deborah up last night all spiffed up in a tux you sure can kiss he grinned at her but his hand slipped to her wrist just as deborahs had thanks youre the one with pots of money right she may have had a bump on the head gage thought but her mind seemed to work quickly enough right she liked the roses mooned over them mrs greenbaum deborah sat back on her heels you dont have to play matchmaker weve taken care of it ourselves tell us what happened to you im glad to hear it young people today waste too much time mrs greenbaum all right all right i had the list of things youd called for i was in the bedroom going through the closet neat as a pin by the way she said to gage the girls very tidy im relieved to hear it i was just taking out the navy pinstriped suit when i heard a sound behind me she grimaced more embarrassed now than shaken id have heard it before but i turned on the radio when i came in thatll teach me to listen to the top countdown i started to turn and boom somebody put my lights out deborah lowered her head to lils hand emotions screamed through her tangled and tearing fury terror guilt she was an old woman deborah thought as she struggled for control what kind of person strikes a seventyyearold woman im sorry she said as levelly as she could im so sorry its not your fault yes it is she lifted her head this was all for my benefit all of it i knew they were after me and i asked you to come in here i didnt think i just didnt think now this is nonsense im the one who got bashed and i can tell you im damn mad about it if i hadnt been caught off guard id have put some of my karate training into use lils mouth firmed id like to have another go at it wasnt too many years ago i could deck mr greenbaum and im still in shape she glanced up as the paramedics came through the door oh lord she said in disgust now im in for it with gages arm around her shoulders deborah stood back while lil ordered the paramedics around complaining about every poke and prod she was still chattering when they lifted her onto a stretcher and carried her out shes quite a woman gage commented shes the best when tears threatened she bit her lip i dont know what id do if shes going to be fine her pulse was strong her mind was clear he gave her a quick squeeze then turned to frank whats the story the door wasnt locked when i got here the big man jerked his thumb toward the opening they did a messy job forcing it i walked into this he gestured around the chaos of the living room i thought i should check out the rest of the place before i called you and found the lady in the bedroom she was just coming to tried to take a swing at me he smiled at deborah shes one tough old lady i calmed her down then i called you his mouth tightened there had been a time he hadnt been above pinching a purse from a nice little old lady but hed never laid a finger on one i figure i missed them by ten or fifteen minutes his big fists bunched otherwise they wouldnt have walked out of here gage nodded i have a couple of things id like you to do he turned back to deborah gently cradling her face in his hands ill have him call the police he said knowing how her mind worked meanwhile why dont you see if you can salvage anything you might need until tomorrow all right she agreed because she needed a moment alone in the bedroom she pressed her hands to her mouth there had been such viciousness here such fury yet there was a cold kind of organization to the destruction that made it all the more frightening her clothes were torn and shredded the little antique bottles and jars shed collected over the years broken and smashed over the heaps of silk and cotton her bed had been destroyed her desk littered with ugly words someone had carved deeply in the wood with a knife everything she owned had been pulled out or torn down kneeling she picked up a ragged scrap of paper it had once been a photograph one of the many of her family she had treasured gage came in quietly after a moment he knelt beside her and laid a hand on her shoulder deborah let me take you out of here theres nothing left she pressed her lips together determined to keep her voice from shaking i know theyre only things but theres nothing left slowly she curled her fingers around the remains of the photograph my parents she shook her head then turned her face into his shoulder his own anger was a bright steady flame in his chest he held her letting her grieve while he promised himself he would find the men who had hurt her and all the while he couldnt get past the sick terror that lodged in his throat she might have been there she might have been alone in this room when theyd come in instead of trinkets and mementos he could have found her broken on the floor theyll pay he promised her i swear it yes they will when she lifted her head he saw that her grief had passed into fury it was just as deep just as sharp whatever i have to do im going to bring them down after pushing back her hair she stood up if they thought they could scare me away by doing this theyre going to be disappointed she kicked at the remains of her favorite red suit lets go to work they spent hours in the cavern beneath his house checking data inputting more deborahs head was throbbing in time with the machines but she continued to push gage busied himself across the room but they rarely spoke they didnt need to perhaps for the first time their purposes meshed and their differences in viewpoints no longer seemed to matter they were both anxious to make up the time lost while talking to the police and evading the enterprising wisner who had shown up at the apartment in their wake shed be a mondaymorning headline again deborah thought impatiently the press would only bring more pressure from city hall she was ready for it she no longer swore when she slammed into a dead end but meticulously backtracked with a patience she hadnt been aware of possessing when the phone rang she didnt even hear it gage had to call her name twice before she broke out of her concentrated trance yes what its for you he held up the receiver jerry bower with a frown for the interruption she walked over to take the call jerry good god deborah are you all right yes im fine how did you know where i was she could hear him take two long breaths ive been trying to reach you for hours to make sure you were okay after last night i finally decided just to go by your place and see for myself i ran into a pack of cops and that little weasel wisner your place i know i wasnt there thank god what the hells going on deb were supposed to have a handle on these things down at city hall but i feel like im boxing in the dark the mayors going to blow when he hears this what am i supposed to tell him tell him to concentrate on the debates next week she rubbed her temple i already know his stand on this and he knows mine youre only going to drive yourself crazy trying to arbitrate look i work for him but youre a friend there might be something i can do i dont know she frowned at the blinking lights on the map someones sending me a message loud and clear but i havent worked out how to send one back you can tell the mayor this if i manage to work this out before the election hes going to win by a landslide there was a slight hesitation i guess youre right jerry said thoughtfully that might be the best way to keep him from breathing down your neck just be careful okay i will she hung up then tilted her head from one side to the other to work out kinks gage glanced over i wouldnt mind taking out a full page ad in the world to announce our engagement confused she blinked then laughed jerry dont be stupid were just pals mmmhmm she smiled then walked over to hook her arms around his waist not one big sloppy kiss between us which is exactly what i could use right now i guess ive got at least one in me he lowered his head when his lips met hers she felt the tension seep out of her layer by layer degree by degree with a murmur she slid her hands up his back gently kneading the muscles soothing them as his lips soothed her quiet content relaxed she could bring him to that just as she could make him shudder and ache with a soft sound of pleasure he changed the angle of the kiss and deepened it for both of them sorry to break this up frank came through the tunnel bearing a large tray but since youre working so hard he grinned hugely i figured you should eat to keep up your strength thanks deborah drew away from gage and took a sniff oh lord what is it my special burnthroughtheribs chili he winked at her believe me itll keep you awake it smells incredible dig in you got a couple of beers a thermos of coffee and some cheese nachos deborah rolled a chair over frank you are a man among men he blushed again delighting her she took her first bite scorched her mouth her throat and her stomach lining and this she said with real pleasure is a bowl of chili he shuffled his feet glad you like it i put mrs greenbaum in the gold room he told gage i thought shed get a kick out of the bed curtains and stuff shes having some chicken soup and watching king kong on the vcr thanks frank gage scooped up his own spoon of chili just give me a ring if you need anything else deborah listened to the echo of franks footsteps in the tunnel you had her brought here she said quietly she didnt like the hospital he shrugged frank talked to the doctor she only had a mild concussion which was a miracle in someone her age her hearts strong as an elephant all she needs is some quiet and pampering for a few days so you had her brought here she shouldnt be alone she leaned over and kissed his cheek i love you very much when they had finished and were back to work deborah couldnt stop her mind from wandering in his direction he was such a complicated man arrogant as the devil when it suited him rude when it pleased him and as smooth and charming as an irish poet when the mood struck him he ran a multimilliondollar business and he walked the streets at night to ward off muggers thieves rapists he was the lover every woman dreamed about romantic erotic yet solid and dependable as granite yet he carried something intangible inside him that allowed him to vanish like smoke into the wall slip without a shadow through the night she shook her head she was far from ready far from able to dwell on that aspect of him how could he a man she knew to be flesh and blood become insubstantial at will yet she had seen it with her own eyes she pressed her fingers against those eyes for a moment and sighed things werent always what they seemed straightening her shoulders she doubled her concentration if numbers began to blur she downed more coffee already she had a half dozen more names names she was sure she would find attached to death certificates it seemed hopeless but until this avenue was exhausted she had no other mumbling to herself she punched up screen after screen abruptly she stopped cautious eyes sharpened she backtracked one screen two she held back a smile afraid to believe shed finally broken through after another five minutes of careful work she called gage i think ive found something so had he but he chose to keep his information to himself what this number when he bent over her shoulder she ran a finger below it on the screen its all mixed with the corporation number the tax number and all the other identification numbers of this company when he lifted a hand to rub at the base of her neck she leaned back into the massage gratefully a supposedly bankrupt corporation by the way out of business for eighteen months now look at this she punched up a new screen different company different location different names and numbers except this one she tapped a finger on the screen its in a different place here but the numbers the same and here she showed him again screen after screen its the corporation number on one the company branch on another tax id here a file code there social security number gage muttered what nine digits id say its a social security number an important one he turned to walk quickly to the control board what are you doing finding out who it belongs to she blew out a breath a bit annoyed that he hadnt seemed more enthusiastic about her find her eyes were all but falling out of her head and she didnt even get a pat on the back how it seems worth going to the main source the screen above him began to blink which is the irs the she was out of her chair like a shot youre telling me you can tap into the irs computers thats right his concentration was focused on the panel almost got it thats illegal a federal offense mmmhmm want to recommend a good lawyer torn she gripped her hands together its not a joke no but his lips curved as he followed the information on the screen all right were in he shot her a look the internal war she was waging showed clearly on her face you could go upstairs until ive finished that hardly matters i know what youre doing that makes me a part of it she closed her eyes and saw lil greenbaum lying pale and hurt on her broken couch go ahead she said and put a hand on his arm were in this together he tapped in the numbers she had found pushed a series of buttons and waited a name flashed up on the screen oh god deborahs fingers dug into gages shoulder he seemed to be made of stone at that moment unmoving almost unbreathing his muscles hard as rock tucker fields he murmured son of a bitch then he moved so quickly deborah nearly stumbled with a strength born of desperation she grabbed him dont you cant she saw his eyes burn as she had seen them behind the mask they were full of fury and deadly purpose i know what you want she said quickly clinging you want to go find him right now you want to tear him apart but you cant that isnt the way im going to kill him his voice was cold and flat understand that nothings going to stop me the breath was searing and clogging in her lungs if he left now she would lose him and accomplish what it wont bring jack back it wont change what happened to you it wont even finish what you both started that night on the docks if you kill fields someone will replace him and itll go on we need to break the back of the organization gage to bring it all out to the public so that people will see if fields is responsible if she took a careful steadying breath and kept her grip on him tight we dont have enough not yet i can build a case if you give me time and bring them down bring them all down my god deborah do you really think youll get him in court a man with that much power hell slip through your fingers like sand the minute you start an investigation hell know and hell cover himself then youll do the investigating here and ill throw dust in his eyes from my office she spoke quickly desperate to convince him and she was sure to save them both ill make him think im on the wrong track gage we have to be sure you must see that if you go after him now like this everything youve worked for everything weve started to build together will be destroyed he tried to have you killed gage put his hands to her face and though his touch was light she could feel the tension in each finger dont you understand that nothing not even jacks murder signed his death warrant more indelibly she brought her hands to his wrists im here with you thats whats important we have more work to do to prove that fields is involved to find out how far down the line the corruption runs youll have justice gage i promise slowly he relaxed she was right at least in some ways she was right killing fields with his bare hands would have been satisfying but it wouldnt complete the job he had begun so he could wait for that there was another stone to uncover and he had less than a week to wait until he did so all right he watched the color seep slowly back into her face i didnt mean to frighten you well i hope you never mean to because you scared me to death she turned her head pressing her lips to his palm then managed a shaky smile since weve already broken a federal law why dont we go a step forward and look at the mayors tax records for the last few years minutes later she was seated beside gage at the console five hundred and sixtytwo thousand she murmured when she read fieldss declared income for the previous tax year a bit more than the annual salary for urbanas mayor its hard to believe hes stupid enough to put that much on record gage flipped back another year i imagine hes got several times that much in swiss accounts i never liked him personally deborah put in but i always respected him she rose to pace when i think about the kind of position hes been in a direct line to the police to the das office to businesses utilities nothing goes on in urbana he doesnt know about and he can put his people everywhere how many city officials are on his private payroll how many cops how many judges he thinks hes got it covered gage pushed away from the console what about bower jerry deborah sighed and rubbed her stiff neck loyal to the bone and with political aspirations of his own he might overlook a few underthetable machinations but nothing so big as this fields was clever enough to pick someone young and eager with a good background and unblemished reputation she shook her head i feel badly that i cant pass this along to him mitchell no id bet my life on mitch hes been around a long time hes never been fieldss biggest fan but he respects the office hes by the book because he believes in the book he even pays his parking tickets what are you doing it doesnt hurt to check to deborahs consternation he pulled up jerrys then mitchells tax returns finding nothing out of the ordinary he moved toward another console we can start pulling up bank accounts we need a list of people who work at city hall the department the das office he glanced up at her youve got a headache she realized she was rubbing at her temple just a little one instead of turning on the machine he shut the others down youve been working too hard im fine weve got a lot to do weve already done a lot and he was cursing himself for pushing her so hard for so long a couple of hours off wont change anything he slipped an arm around her waist how about a hot bath and a nap mmm she leaned her head against his shoulder as they started down the tunnel that sounds incredible and a back rub yes oh yes and why dont i give you that foot rub thats long overdue she smiled had she ever really been worried about something as foolish as other women why dont you deborah was already halfasleep by the time they came through the panel into gages bedroom she stopped in midyawn and stared at the boxes covering the bed whats all this at the moment all you have is my shirt on your back and though i like it he flicked a finger down the buttons a lot i thought you might want some replacements replacements she pushed at her tumbled hair how i gave frank a list he can be very enterprising frank but its sunday half the stores are closed she pressed a hand to her stomach oh god he didnt steal them did he i dont think so then he laughed and caught her in his arms how am i going to live with such a scrupulously honest woman no theyre paid for i promise its as easy as making a few calls youll notice the boxes are from athenas she nodded it was one of the biggest and slickest department stores in the city and the light dawned you own it guilty he kissed her anything you dont like can go back but i think i know your style and your size you didnt have to do this from the tone of her voice he understood she wished he hadnt done it patient he tucked her tumbled hair behind her ear this wasnt an attempt to usurp your independence counselor no and she was sounding very ungrateful but be practical how would it look for you to show up at the office tomorrow in my pants he tugged the belt loose and had the jeans sliding to her feet outrageous she agreed and smiled when he lifted her up and set her down beside the heap of denim and my shirt he began to undo the buttons ridiculous youre right you were being very practical she took his hands to still them before he could distract her and i appreciate it but it doesnt feel right you buying my clothes you can pay me back over the next sixty or seventy years he cupped her chin when she started to speak again deborah ive got more money than any one man needs youre willing to share my problems then it should follow that youll share my fortunes i dont want you to think that the money matters to me that it makes any difference in the way i feel about you he studied her thoughtfully you know i didnt realize you could come up with anything quite that stupid she lifted her chin but when he smiled at her she could only sigh it is stupid i love you even though you do own hotels and apartment buildings and department stores and if i dont open one of these boxes im going to go crazy why dont you keep your sanity then and ill go run the bath when he walked into the adjoining room she grabbed one at random shook it then pulled off the lid under the tissue paper she found a long sheer sleeping gown in pale blue silk well she held it up noting the back was cut below the waist frank certainly has an eye for lingerie i wonder what the boys in the office will say if i wear this in tomorrow unable to resist she stripped off the shirt and let the cool thin silk slide over her head and shoulders a perfect fit she mused running her hands over her hips delighted she turned to the mirror just as gage came back into the room he couldnt speak any more than he could take his eyes from her the long sleek shimmer of silk whispered against her skin as she turned to him her eyes were dark as midnight and glistening with a womans secret pleasure her lips curved slowly was there a woman alive who didnt dream about having the man she loved stare at her with such avid hunger deliberately she tilted her head and lifted one hand to run her fingertips lazily down the center of the gown and just as lazily up again watching his eyes follow the movement what do you think his gaze trailed up until it met hers again i think frank deserves a very large raise as she laughed he came toward her chapter contents prev next over the next three days and the next three evenings they worked together piece by steady piece they built a case against tucker fields at her office deborah pursued avenues she knew would lead nowhere carefully laying a false trail as she worked she continued to fight the rugged tugofwar inside her ethics versus instinct each night gage would slip out of bed clothe himself in black and roam the streets they didnt speak of it if he knew how often deborah lay awake anxious and torn until he returned just before dawn he offered no excuses or apologies there were none he could give her the press continued to herald nemesiss exploits those secret nocturnal activities were never mentioned and stood between them like a thick silent wall that couldnt be breached on either side she understood but couldnt agree he understood but couldnt acquiesce even as they worked toward a single goal their individual beliefs forced them at crosspurposes she sat in her office the evening paper beside a stack of law books nemesis bags east end ripper she hadnt read the copy couldnt bring herself to read it she already knew about the man who had killed four people in the past ten days with his favored weapon a hunting knife the headline was enough to tell her why she had found traces of blood in the bathroom sink when was it going to end she asked herself when was he going to stop a psychotic with a knife had nothing to do with fields and the drug cartel how much longer could they go on pretending that their relationship their future could be normal he wasnt pretending deborah admitted with a sigh she was oroarke mitchell slapped a file on her desk the city doesnt pay you this princely salary to daydream she looked at the file that had just landed on a pile of others i dont suppose it would do any good to remind you that my caseload has already broken the worlds record sos the citys crime rate because she looked exhausted he walked over to her coffee machine to pour her a cup of the bitter bottomofthepot brew maybe if nemesis would take some time off we wouldnt be so overworked her frown turned into a grimace as she sipped the coffee that sounded almost like a compliment just stating facts i dont have to approve of his methods to like the results surprised she looked up into mitchells round sturdy face do you mean that this ripper character carved up four innocent people and was starting on a fifth when nemesis got there its hard to complain when anybody even a misguided masked wonder drops a creep like that in our laps and saves the life of an eighteenyearold girl yes deborah murmured yes it is not that im going out and buying a tshirt and joining his fan club mitchell pulled out a cigar and ran it through his stubby fingers so making any progress on your favorite case she shrugged evasively ive got another week youre hardheaded oroarke i like that her brows rose now that was definitely a compliment dont let it swell your pinstripes the mayors still unhappy with you and the polls are happy with him if he knocks tarrington out in the debates tomorrow you could have a hard road until the next election the mayor doesnt worry me suit yourself wisners still pumping your name into copy he held up a hand before she could snarl im holding fields off but if you could keep a lower profile yeah it was really stupid of me to have my apartment trashed okay okay he had the grace to flush were all sorry about that but if you could try to keep out of trouble for a while it would make it easy on everyone ill chain myself to my desk she said between her teeth and the minute i get the chance im going to kick wisner right in his press card mitchell grinned get in line hey ah let me know if you need a few extra bucks before the insurance takes over thanks but im fine she looked at the files besides with all this who needs an apartment when he left her alone deborah opened the new case file and dropped her head in her hands was it a twisted kind of irony or fate that shed been assigned to prosecute the east end ripper her chief witness she thought her lover was the one man she couldnt even discuss it with at seven gage waited for her at a quiet corner table in a french restaurant skirting city park he knew it was almost over and that when it was he would have to explain to deborah why he hadnt trusted her with all the details she would be hurt and angry rightfully so but he preferred her hurt and angry and alive he was well aware how difficult the past few days and nights had been for her if there had been a choice he would have given up everything including his conscience to keep her happy but he had no choice hadnt had a choice since the moment hed come out of the coma he could do nothing but tell her and show her how completely he loved her and to hope that between the very strong and opposing forces that drove each of them there could be a compromise he saw her come in slim and lovely in a sapphirecolored suit trimmed and lined with chartreuse flashy colors and sensible shoes was there lace or silk or satin beneath he had an urge to sweep her up then and there take her away and discover the answer for himself im sorry im late she began but before the maitre d could seat her gage had risen to pull her to him his kiss was not discreet not brief before he released her nearby diners were looking on with curiosity and envy the breath she hadnt been aware of holding rushed out between her parted lips her eyes were heavy her body vibrating i im awfully glad i wasnt on time you worked late there were shadows under her eyes he hated seeing them knowing hed caused them yes still breathless she took her seat i had another case dumped on my desk just before five anything interesting her gaze came to his and held the east end ripper he watched her unwaveringly i see do you gage i wonder if you do she drew her hand from his and laid it in her lap i felt i should disqualify myself but what reason could i give there is no reason deborah i stopped him but its your job to see that he pays for the crimes one does not have to interfere with the other i wish i could be sure she took up her napkin pleating it between her fingers part of me sees you as a vigilante another part a hero and the truth lies somewhere in between he reached for her hand again whatever i am i love you i know her fingers tightened on his i know but gage she broke off when the waiter brought over the champagne gage had ordered while waiting for her the drink of the gods the waiter said in a rich french accent for a celebration nestce pas a beautiful woman a beautiful wine at gages nod of approval he popped the cork with a flourish that had the bubbling froth lapping at the lip of the bottle before teasingly retreating monsieur will taste he poured a small amount into gages glass excellent gage murmured but his eyes were on deborah mais oui the waiters gaze slid approvingly over deborah before he filled her glass then gages monsieur has the most exquisite taste when the waiter bowed away deborah chuckled and touched her glass to gages youre not going to tell me you own this place too no would you like to though she shook her head she had to laugh are we celebrating yes to tonight and to tomorrow he took a small velvet box from his pocket and offered it to her when she only stared at it his fingers tensed panic rushed through him but he kept his voice light you asked me to marry you but i felt this privilege was mine she opened the box in the candlelight the center sapphire glittered a deep and dark blue surrounding that bold square was a symphony of icewhite diamonds they flashed triumphantly in the setting of pale gold its exquisite hed chosen the stones himself but he had hoped to see pleasure in her eyes not fear nor had he thought to feel fear himself are you having doubts she looked up at him and let her heart speak not about the way i feel about you i never will im afraid gage ive tried to pretend im not but im afraid not only of what you do but that it might take you away from me he wouldnt make her promises that could be impossible to keep i was brought out of that coma the way i was brought out for a reason i cant give you logic and facts on this one deborah only feelings and instinct if i turned my back on what im meant to do id die again her automatic protest clogged in her throat you believe that i know that how could she look at him and not see it too how many times had she looked in his eyes and seen something different special frightening she knew he was flesh and blood yet he was more it wouldnt be possible to change that and for the first time she realized she didnt want to i fell in love with you twice with both sides of you she looked down at the ring took it out of its box where it flashed like lightning in her hand until then i was sure of my direction of what i wanted needed and was working for i was certain so certain that when i fell in love it would be with a very calm very ordinary man she held the ring out to him i was wrong you didnt come back just to fight for your justice gage you came back for me then she smiled and held her hand out to him thank god he slipped the ring on her finger i want to take you home even as he brought her hand to his lips the waiter bounced back to their table i knew it henri is never wrong deborah chuckled as he made a business out of topping off their glasses you have chosen my table so you have chosen well you must leave the menu to me you must i will make a night such as you will never forget it is my pleasure ah monsieur you are the most fortunate of men he grabbed deborahs hand and kissed it noisily deborah was still laughing as he hurried away but when she looked at gage she saw his attention was elsewhere what is it fields gage lifted his glass but his eyes followed the mayors progress across the room he just came in with arlo stuart and a couple of other big guns with your friend bower bringing up the rear tensed deborah turned her head they were heading for a table for eight she recognized a prominent actress and the president of a major auto manufacturer power meeting she muttered hes got the theater industry finance and the art worlds all represented neatly at one table before the evenings over someone will come along and take a few candid shots it wont matter she covered gages hand with hers in another week it wont matter in less than that he thought but nodded stuarts coming over well now stuart clamped a hand on gages shoulder this is a nice coincidence you look stunning as always miss oroarke thank you great restaurant this nobody does snails better he beamed at both of them hate to waste them talking business and politics now youve got the right idea here champagne candlelight his sharp gaze fell on deborahs ring hand well thats a pretty little thing he grinned at gage got an announcement to make you caught us in the act arlo glad to hear it you take your honeymoon in any of my hotels he winked at deborah on the house still grinning he signaled to the mayor it wouldnt hurt fieldss image he thought to be in on the first congratulations to one of the citys top businessmen and the most recognizable da gage deborah though fieldss smile was broad his nod of greeting was stiff nice to see you if you havent ordered perhaps youd like to join us not tonight stuart answered before gage could weve got ourselves a newly engaged couple here tuck they dont want to waste the evening talking campaign strategy fields glanced down at deborahs ring the smile still in place but he wasnt pleased congratulations i like to think we brought them together always exuberant stuart tossed an arm around fieldss shoulder after all they met at my hotel during your fundraiser i guess that makes us one big happy family fields looked at gage he needed guthries support youre marrying a fine woman a tough lawyer shes given me a few headaches but i admire her integrity gages voice was cool but perfectly polite so do i stuart gave another booming laugh ive admired more than her integrity he winked at deborah again no offense now well get back to politics and leave you two alone bastard deborah mumbled when they were out of earshot she snatched up her wine he was sucking up to you no gage tapped his glass to hers to both of us over her shoulder he saw the minute jerry bower heard the news the man jolted glanced up and over gage could almost hear him sigh as he stared at deborahs back i cant wait until we nail him there was such venom in her voice that gage covered her hand with his and squeezed just hold on it wont take much longer she was so lovely gage lingered in bed just looking at her he knew she was sleeping deeply sated by love exhausted from passion he wanted to know that she would dream content until morning he hated knowing there were times she woke in the middle of the night to find him gone but tonight when he could all but feel the danger tripping through his blood he needed to be sure she would sleep safe silently he rose to dress he could hear her breathing slow and steady and it soothed him in the sprinkle of moonlight he saw his reflection in the mirror no not a reflection he thought a shadow after flexing his hands in the snug black gloves he opened a drawer inside was a a regulation police issue revolver whose grip was as familiar to him as a brothers handshake yet he had not carried it since the night on the docks four years before he had never needed to but tonight he felt that need he no longer questioned instinct but tucked the gun into a holster and belted it on so that the weapon fit at the small of his back he opened the panel then paused he wanted to see her again sleeping he could taste the danger now bitter on his tongue in his throat his only respite from it was knowing she wouldnt be affected he would come back he promised himself and her fate could not deal such a killing blow twice in one lifetime he slipped away in the dark more than an hour later the phone rang pulling deborah from sleep out of habit she groped for it murmuring to gage as she rattled the receiver from the hook hello senorita the sound of montegas voice had her icy and awake what do you want we have him the trap was so easily sprung what panicked she reached out for gage but even before her hands slid over empty sheets she knew terror made her voice shake what do you mean hes alive we want to keep him alive for now if you wish the same youll come quickly and alone well trade him for all your papers all your files everything you have she pressed a hand to her mouth trying to stall until she could think youll kill us both possibly but i will surely kill him if you dont come there is a warehouse on east river drive three twentyfive east river drive it will take you thirty minutes any longer and i remove his right hand a rancid sickness heaved her stomach ill come dont hurt him please let me talk to him first but the phone went dead deborah sprang out of bed dragging on a robe she rushed out to franks room when one glance told her it was empty she bounded down the hall to find mrs greenbaum sitting up in bed with an old movie and a can of peanuts frank where is he he went out to the allnight video store and for pizza we decided to have a marx brothers festival whats wrong but deborah only covered her face with her hands and rocked she had to think hell be back in twenty minutes thats too late she dropped her hands she couldnt waste another moment you tell him i got a call i had to go tell him it involves gage youre in trouble tell me just tell him please the moment he comes in ive gone to east river drive you cant lil was climbing out of bed you cant go there at this time of night by yourself i have to tell frank i had to she gripped lils hands its life or death well call the police no no just frank tell him everything i said and tell him what time i left promise me of course but but deborah was already racing out it took several precious minutes to throw on clothes and to push stacks of printouts in her briefcase her hands were slick with sweat when she reached her car in her mind like a chant she said gages name over and over as she streaked down the streets sickness stayed lodged in her throat as she watched the clock on the dash tick away the minutes like a ghost nemesis watched the exchange of drugs for money thousands of bills for thousands of pounds of pain the buyer slit one sample bag open scooped out a touch of white powder and tapped it into a vial to test the purity the seller flipped through stacks of bills when both were satisfied the deal was made there were few words exchanged it was not a friendly business he watched the buyer take his miserable product and walk away even though nemesis understood he would find the man again and quickly there was regret if he had not been stalking larger game it would have given him great pleasure to have thrown both merchants and their product into the river footsteps echoed the acoustics were good in the high spreading cinderblock building boxes and crates were piled beside walls and on long metal shelves tools and twobyfours crowded workbenches a large forklift was parked by the aluminum garage doors there to lift the stacks of lumber stored within though the scent of sawdust remained the enormous saws were silent he saw with bloodboiling fury montega walk into the room our first prize tonight he strode to the suitcase of cash waving the underlings aside but we have richer coming he closed the suitcase locked it when he comes show him here as he stood as insubstantial as the air he breathed nemesis fisted his hands it was now he thought it was tonight a part of him that thirsted only for revenge burned to take the gun he carried and fire it coldblooded but his blood was too hot for such a quick and anonymous solution his lips curved humorlessly there were better ways more judicious ways even as he opened his mouth to speak he heard voices the sound of shoes rushing over the concrete floor his heart froze to a ball of ice in his chest he had left her sleeping while his blood ran cold the sweat of terror pearled on his brow the danger he had tasted not for himself dear god not for himself but for her he watched deborah rush into the room followed by two armed guards for an instant he slipped wavering between nemesiss world of shadows and hers where where is he she faced montega like a tigress head back eyes blazing if youve hurt him ill see you dead i swear it with an inclination of his head montega tapped his hands together in applause magnificent a woman in love there was no room for fear of him not when all her fear was for gage i want to see him you are prompt senorita but have you come with what i asked for she heaved the briefcase at him take it to hell with you montega passed the briefcase to a guard and with a jerk of his head had the man take it into an adjoining room patience montega said holding up a hand would you like to sit no you have what you want now give me what i came for the door opened again eyes wide she stared jerry over surprise came the first wave of relief not gage she thought they had never had gage it had been jerry moving quickly she went over to take his hands im sorry im so sorry this happened i had no idea i know he squeezed her hands i knew youd come i was counting on it i wish i thought it was going to help either of us it already has he put an arm around her shoulder as he faced montega the deal went smoothly i take it as expected mr bower excellent jerry gave deborahs shoulder a friendly pat we have to talk she knew the color had drained from her face she had felt it you youre not a hostage here at all are you he allowed her to step away even holding up a hand to signal the guards back there was nowhere for her to go and he was feeling generous no and unfortunately neither are you i regret that i dont believe it shaken she lifted both hands to her temples i knew i knew how blindly you stood behind fields but this in the name of god jerry you cant possibly let yourself be a part of this you know what hes doing the drugs the murders this isnt politics its madness its all politics deb he smiled mine you dont honestly believe that a spineless puppet like fields is behind this organization this time he laughed and signaled for a chair but you did you did because i laid a nice neat trail of bread crumbs for you and anyone else who decided to look putting a hand on her shoulder he pushed her into the chair you she stared at him head reeling youre telling me youre in charge that fields is no more than a pawn for more than six years ive stood two paces behind him picking up all the flack and pushing all the buttons fields couldnt run a dime store much less a city or the state he took a seat himself as i will in five years she wasnt afraid fear couldnt penetrate the numbness this was a man she had known for nearly two years one she had considered a friend and who she had judged as honest if a bit weak how money power brains he ticked the three points off on his fingers i had the brains fields supplied the power believe me hes been more than willing to leave the details administrative and otherwise to me he makes a hell of a speech knows whose butt to kick and whose to kiss the rest of it i do and have since i was put in his office six years ago by whom you are sharp still smiling he gave her an admiring nod arlo stuart hes the money the problem has been that his businesses the legitimate ones dug a bit deeper into his profits than he cared for being a businessman he saw another way to make that profit margin sing the drugs right again casually he crossed his legs and gave an almost disinterested glance at his watch there was time yet to indulge her he thought since this was the last time hes been the head man on the east coast for over twelve years and it pays i worked my way up in the organization he likes initiative i had the knowledge law political science and he had fields questions she ordered herself she had to think of questions and keep him answering until would gage come she wondered was there a way for frank to contact him so the three of you worked together she said not fields id hate to give him credit in your mind because i do respect your mind hes nothing but a handy pawn and he hasnt a clue about our enterprise or if he does hes wise enough to overlook it he moved his shoulders it didnt matter either way when the time is right well expose the tax information and so forth that youve already discovered no one will be more surprised than fields since ill be the one who righteously and regretfully exposes him it should be very simple to step into his place then beyond it wont work im not the only one who knows guthrie jerry linked his fingers over his knee oh i intend to see to guthrie i ordered montega to remove him four years ago and the job was incomplete you she whispered you ordered arlo leaves that kind of detail to me he leaned forward so only she could hear him i like details such as what your new fiancé does in his spare time his lips curved when her color drained you led me to him this time deborah i dont know what youre talking about im a good judge of people i have to be and you are a very predictable person you a woman of integrity intelligence and fierce loyalties involved with two men it didnt seem likely tonight i became sure of what ive suspected for several weeks theres only one man one man who would have recognized montega one man who would have won your heart one man with enough reason to fanatically pursue me he patted her hand when she remained silent thats our little secret i enjoy secrets his eyes chilled again as he rose and though i regret it sincerely only one of us can walk out of here tonight with that secret ive asked montega to be quick for old times sake though her body was shaking she made herself stand ive learned to believe in destiny jerry you wont win hell see to that youll kill me and hell come after you like a fury you think you know him but you dont you dont have him and you never will if it gives you comfort he stepped away from her we dont have him at the moment youre wrong every head in the room turned at the voice there was nothing but blank walls and piles of lumber deborahs knees went so weak she almost folded to the ground then everything seemed to happen at once a guard standing beside the wall jerked back his eyes bright with surprise while his body struggled and strained the rifle he was holding began to spray bullets men shouted diving for cover the guard screamed stumbled away from the wall his own men cut him down dashing behind a line of shelves deborah searched frantically for a weapon laying her hands on a crowbar she stepped back ready to defend herself before her astonished eyes a weapon was grappled away from a goggleeyed guard mad with fear he raced away screaming stay back the voice floated out toward her thank god i thought that just stay back ill deal with you later she stood gripping the crowbar nemesis was back she thought and gritted her teeth and as arrogant as ever sliding a box aside she peeked through the opening to the melee beyond there were five men left the guards montega and jerry they were firing wildly as terrified as they were confused when one of the bullets plowed into the wall a scant foot from her head she crouched lower someone screamed the sound made her squeeze her eyes shut a hand grabbed her hair dragging her up what is he jerry hissed in her ear though his hand was shaking it maintained a firm grip what the hell is he hes a hero she said looking defiantly into his wild eyes something youll never understand hell be a dead one before this is over youre coming with me he jerked her in front of him if you try anything ill shoot you in the back and take my chances deborah took a deep breath and slammed the crowbar into his stomach when he keeled over retching she raced out weaving and dodging around workbenches and shelving he recovered quickly half running half crawling until his hand reached out and slipped over her ankle cursing she kicked him off knowing any minute she could feel a bullet slam into her back she scrambled up a graduated hack of lumber thinking if she could climb to safety he couldnt use her as a shield she could hear him clambering behind her gaining ground as he got back his wind desperate she imagined herself like a lizard quick and sure clinging to the wood she couldnt fall all she knew was that she couldnt fall splinters dug into her fingers unfelt with all her strength she heaved the crowbar at him it struck him on the shoulder making him curse and falter knowing better than to look back she set her teeth and jumped from the stack of lumber to a narrow metal ladder sweaty her hands slipped but she clung climbing up to the next level her breath was coming fast as she raced across the steel landing crowded with rolls of insulation and building material but there was no place to go as she reached the far side she saw that she was trapped he had nearly reached the top she couldnt go down had no hope of making the fivefoot leap to the overhang of metal shelving that held more supplies he was breathing hard and there was blood on his mouth and a gun in his hand deborah took an unsteady step back looking down twentyfive feet to where nemesis battled three to one she couldnt call to him she realized to distract him even for an instant could mean his death instead she turned and faced her onetime friend you wont use me to get him with the back of his hand he wiped blood and spittle from his lip one way or another no she stepped back again and bumped into a hoist chain it was thick and hooked and heavy used she realized quickly to lift the huge stacks of material to the next level for storage no she said again and using all her strength swung the chain at his face she heard the sound of bones breaking and then his scream one horrible scream before she covered her own face he had whittled things down to montega when nemesis looked up and saw her white as a ghost and swaying on the brink of a narrow metal ledge he didnt spare a glance for the man who had fallen screaming to the concrete below as he sprinted toward her he heard a bullet whistle past his head no she shouted at him pushing aside the faintness hes behind you she saw with relief and montega with disbelief that he veered left and disappeared cautious wanting to draw montegas attention from deborah nemesis moved along the wall he would call tauntingly then move right or left before montega could aim his trembling gun and fire i will kill you shaking with fear montega fired again and again into the walls ive seen you bleed i will kill you it wasnt until he was certain deborah was down and safely huddled in the shadows that he reappeared six feet from montega youve already killed me once nemesis held his gun steady at montegas heart he had only to pull the trigger he thought and it would be over four years of hell would be over but he saw deborah her face white and sheened with sweat slowly his finger relaxed on the trigger i came back for you montega youll have a long time to wonder why drop your weapon speechless he did so sending it clattering onto the concrete pale but steady deborah stepped forward to pick it up who are you montega demanded what are you a scream of warning burst from deborahs lips as montega slipped a hand into his pocket two more gunshots ripped the air even as they echoed montega sprawled lifelessly on the floor staring at him nemesis stepped closer im your destiny he whispered then turned and caught deborah in his arms they said they had you they were going to kill you you should have trusted me he turned her away determined to shield her from the death surrounding them but you were here she said then stopped why were you here how did you know the pattern sit down deborah youre shaking i have a feeling its going to be from anger in a minute you knew they would be here tonight yes i knew sit let me get you some water stop it just stop it she snatched at his shirtfront with both hands you knew and you didnt tell me you knew about stuart about jerry not about jerry and he would always regret it until he walked in here tonight and i heard what he told you i was focused on fields then why were you here i broke the pattern a few days ago every drop had been made in a building stuart owned and each drop was at least two weeks apart in a different section of the city i spent a couple of nights casing a few other spots but honed in here and i didnt tell you he continued when her eyes scraped at him because i wanted to avoid exactly what happened here tonight damn it when im worried about you i cant concentrate i cant do my job her body was braced as she held out her hand do you see this ring you gave this to me only hours ago im wearing it because i love you and because im teaching myself how to accept you your feelings and your needs if you cant do the same for me youll have to take it back behind his mask his eyes were dark and flat its not a matter of doing the same its exactly that i killed a man tonight her voice shook but she pushed him away when he would have held her again i killed a man i knew i came here tonight ready willing to exchange not only my ethics but my life for yours dont you ever protect me pamper me or think for me again are you through no but she did lean against the chair i know you wont stop what you do that you cant ill worry about you but i wont stand in your way you wont stand in mine either he nodded is that all for now youre right she opened her mouth shut it then blew out a long breath would you say that again youre right i kept things from you and instead of protecting you i put you in more danger for that im sorry and besides admitting that i think you should know i wasnt going to kill him he looked down at montega but cupped deborahs chin in his hand before she could follow his direction i wanted to for an instant i tasted it but if he had surrendered i would have turned him over to the police she saw the truth of it in his eyes why because i looked at you and i knew i could trust you to see there was justice he held out a hand deborah i need a partner she was smiling even as her eyes overflowed so do i instead of taking his hand she launched herself into his arms nothings going to stop us she murmured in the distance she heard the first sirens i think franks bringing the cavalry she kissed him ill explain later at home youd better go with a sigh she stepped back its going to take a good lawyer to explain all of this at the sound of rushing feet he moved back then into the wall behind her ill be here she smiled spreading her palm on the wall knowing he was doing the same on the shadowy other side im counting on it nightshade prologue contents prev next it was a hell of a place to meet a snitch a cold night a dark street with the smell of whiskey and sweat seeping through the pores of the bar door at his back colt drew easily on a slim cigar as he studied the spindly bag of bones whod agreed to sell him information not much to look at colt mused short skinny and ugly as homemade sin in the garish light tossed fitfully by the neon sign behind them his informant looked almost comical but there was nothing funny about the business at hand youre a hard man to pin down billings yeah yeah billings nibbled on a grimy thumb his gaze sweeping up and down the street a guy keeps healthy that way heard you were looking for me he studied colt his eyes flying up then away soaring on nerves man in my position has to be careful you know what you want to buy it dont come cheap and its dangerous id feel better with my cop generally i work through the cop but i aint been able to get through all day id feel better without your cop and im the one whos paying to illustrate his point colt drew two fifties from his shirt pocket he watched billingss eyes dart toward the bills and linger greedily colt might be a man whod take risks but buying a pig in a poke wasnt his style he held the money out of reach talk better if i had a drink billings jerked his head toward the doorway of the bar behind them a womans laugh high and shrill burst through the glass like a gunshot you talk just fine to me the man was a bundle of raw nerves colt observed he could almost hear the thin bones rattle together as billings shifted from foot to foot if he didnt press his point now the man was going to run like a rabbit and hed come too far and had too much at stake to lose him now tell me what i need to know then ill buy you a drink youre not from around here no colt lifted a brow waited is that a problem nope better you arent they get wind of you billings swiped the back of his hand over his mouth well you look like you can handle yourself okay ive been known to he took one last drag before flicking the cigar away its single red eye gleamed in the gutter information billings to show good faith colt held out one of the bills lets do business even as billingss eager fingers reached out the frigid air was shattered by the shriek of tires on pavement colt didnt have to read the terror in billingss eyes adrenaline and instinct took over with a kick as quick and hard as a mules he was diving for cover as the first shots rang out chapter contents prev next althea didnt mind being bored after a rough day a nice spot of tedium could be welcome giving both mind and body a chance to recharge she didnt really mind coming off a tough tenhour shift after an even more grueling sixtyhour week and donning cocktail wear or slipping her tired feet into threeinch heels she wouldnt even complain about being stuck at a banquet table in the ballroom of the brown house while speech after droning speech muddled her head what she did mind was having her dates hand slide up her thigh under cover of the white linen tablecloth men were so predictable she picked up her wineglass and shifting in her seat nuzzled her dates ear jack his fingers crept higher mmmhmm if you dont move your hand say within the next two seconds im going to stab it really really hard with my dessert fork it would hurt jack she sat back and sipped her wine smiling over the rim as he arched a brow you wouldnt play racket ball for a month jack holmsby eligible bachelor feared prosecutor and guest of honor at the denver bar association banquet knew how to handle women and hed been trying to get close enough to handle this particular woman for months thea he breathed her name gifting her with his most charming crooked smile were nearly done here why dont we go back to my place we can he whispered into her ear a suggestion that was descriptive inventive and possibly anatomically impossible althea was saved from answering and jack was spared minor surgery by the sound of her beeper several of her tablemates began shifting checking pockets and purses inclining her head she rose pardon me i believe its mine she walked away with a subtle switch of hips a long flash of leg the compact body in the backless purple dress glinting with silver beading caused more than one head to turn blood pressures were elevated fantasies were woven not unaware but certainly unconcerned althea strode out of the ballroom and into the lobby toward a bank of phones opening her beaded evening bag which contained a compact lipstick id emergency cash and her ninemillimeter she fished out a quarter and made her call grayson while she listened she pushed back her fall of flamecolored hair her eyes a tawny shade of brown narrowed im on my way she hung up turned and watched jack holmsby hurry toward her an attractive man she thought objectively nicely polished on the outside a pity he was so ordinary on the inside sorry jack i have to go irritation scored a deep line between his brows he had a bottle of napoleon brandy a stack of apple wood and a set of white satin sheets waiting at home really thea cant someone else take the call no the job came first it always came first its handy i had to meet you here jack you can stay and enjoy yourself but he wasnt giving up that easily he dogged her through the lobby and out into the brisk fall night why dont you come by after youve finished we can pick up where we left off we havent left off jack she handed her parking stub to an attendant you have to start to leave off and i have no intention of starting anything with you she only sighed as he slipped his arms around her come on thea you didnt come here tonight to eat prime rib and listen to a bunch of lawyers make endless speeches he lowered his head and murmured against her lips you didnt wear a dress like that to keep me at arms length you wore it to make me hot and you did mild irritation became brittle and keen i came here tonight because i respect you as a lawyer the quick elbow to his ribs had his breath woofing out and allowed her to step back and because i thought we could spend a pleasant evening together what i wear is my business holmsby but i didnt choose it so that youd grope me under the table or make ludicrous suggestions as to how i might spend the rest of my evening she wasnt shouting but neither was she bothering to keep her voice down anger glinted in her voice like ice under fog appalled jack tugged at the knot of his tie and darted glances right and left for gods sake althea keep it down exactly what i was going to suggest to you she said sweetly though the attendant was all eyes and ears he politely cleared his throat althea turned to accept her keys thank you she offered him a smile and a generous tip the smile had his heart skipping a beat and he didnt glance at the bill before tucking it into his pocket he was too busy dreaming ah drive carefully miss and come back soon real soon thanks she tossed her hair back then slid gracefully behind the wheel of her reconditioned mustang convertible see you in court counselor althea gunned the engine and peeled out murder scenes whether indoors or out in an urban suburban or pastoral setting had one thing in common the aura of death as a cop with nearly ten years experience althea had learned to recognize it absorb it and file it away while going about the precise and mechanical business of investigation when althea arrived a half block had been secured the police photographer had finished recording the scene and was already packing up his gear the body had been identified that was why she was here three blackandwhites sat their lights flashing blue and their radios coughing static spectators for death always drew them were straining against the yellow police tape greedy althea knew for a glimpse of death to reaffirm that they were alive and untouched because the night was cool she grabbed the wrap shed tossed into the back seat of her car the emeraldgreen silk kept the chill off her arms and back flashing her badge to the rookie handling crowd control she slipped under the barricade she was grateful when she spotted sweeney a hardbitten cop who had twice her years on the job and was in no hurry to give up his uniform lieutenant he nodded to her then took out a handkerchief and made a valiant attempt to clear his stuffy nose what have we got here sweeney driveby he stuffed the handkerchief back into his pocket dead guy was standing in front of the bar talking he gestured to the shattered window of the tick tock witnesses say a car came by moving north fast sprayed the area with bullets and kept going she could still smell the blood though it was no longer fresh any bystanders hit nope couple of cuts from flying glass thats all they hit their mark he glanced over his shoulder and down he didnt have a chance lieutenant sorry yeah me too she stared down at the form sprawled on the stained concrete thered been nothing much to him to begin with she thought now there was less hed been fivefive maybe a hundred and ten soaking wet spindly bones and had had a face even a mother would have been hardpressed to love wild bill billings parttime pimp parttime grifter and fulltime snitch and damn it hed been hers forensics been and gone sweeney confirmed were ready to put him on ice then do it got a list of witnesses yeah mostly useless it was a black car it was a blue car one drunk claims it was a chariot driven by flaming demons he swore with inventive expertise knowing althea well enough not to worry about her taking offense well take what we can get she scanned the crowd bar types teenagers looking for action a scattering of the homeless and her antenna vibrated as she locked in on one man unlike the others he wasnt goggleeyed with either revulsion or excitement he stood at his ease his leather bomber jacket open to the wind revealing a chambray shirt a glint of silver on a chain his rangy build made her think hed be fast on his feet snug worn jeans rode down long legs and ended at scuffed boots hair that might have been dark blond or brown ruffled in the breeze and curled well over his collar he smoked a thin cigar his eyes scanning the scene as hers had the light wasnt good but she decided he looked tanned which suited the sharply defined face the eyes were deepset and the nose was long and just shy of being narrow the mouth was strong the kind that looked as though it could thin into a sneer easily some instinct had her dubbing him a pro before his eyes shifted and locked on hers with an impact like a barefisted punch whos the cowboy sweeney the oh sweeneys tired face creased in what might have been a smile damned if she hadnt called it he thought the guy looked as though he should be wearing a stetson and riding a mustang witness he told her victim was talking to him when he got hit is that so she didnt look around when the coroners team dealt with the body there was no need to hes the only one to give us a coherent account sweeney pulled out his pad wet his thumb and flipped pages says it was a black buick sedan colorado plates able charlie frank says he missed the numbers cause the plate lights were out and he was a little busy diving for cover says the weapon sounded like an ak sounded like interesting she thought shed kept her eyes level with her witnesss maybe she broke off when she spotted her captain crossing the street captain boyd fletcher walked directly to the witness shook his head then grinned and enveloped the other man in the masculine equivalent of an embrace there was a lot of backthumping looks as though the captains handling him for now althea pocketed her curiosity as she would a treat to be saved for later lets finish up here sweeney colt had watched her from the moment one long smooth leg swung out of the door of the mustang a lady like that was worth watching well worth it hed liked the way she moved with an athletic and economical grace that wasted neither time nor energy certainly hed liked the way she looked her neat sexy little body had just enough curves to whet a mans appetite and with all that greenandpurple silk rippling in the wind the sunburst of hair blowing away from a cool cameo face brought much more interesting things to a mans mind than his grandmothers heirloom jewelry it was a cold night and one look at that wellpacked number had colt thinking about heat it wasnt such a bad way to keep warm while he waited he wasnt a man who waited well under the best of circumstances he hadnt been particularly surprised to see her flash id to the babyfaced cop at the barricade she carried authority beautifully on her luscious swimmers shoulders idly lighting a cigar he decided she was an assistant da then realized his error when she went into conference with sweeney the lady had cop written all over her late twenties he figured maybe fivefour without those anklewrecking heels and a tidy oneten they sure were making cops in interesting packages these days so he waited sizing up the scene he didnt have any feelings one way or the other about the remains of wild bill billings the man was no good to him now hed dig up something or someone else colt nightshade wasnt a man to let murder get in his way when he felt her watching him he drew smoke in lazily chuffed it out then he shifted his gaze until it met hers the tightening in his gut was unexpected it was raw and purely sexual the one fleeting instant when his mind was wiped clean as glass was more than unexpected it was unprecedented power slapped against power she took a step toward him he let out the breath hed just realized he was holding his preoccupation made it easy for boyd to come up behind him and catch him unawares colt son of a bitch colt turned braced and ready for anything but the flat intensity in his eyes faded into a grin that might have melted any woman within twenty paces fletch with the easy warmth he reserved for friends colt returned the bear hug before stepping back to take stock he hadnt seen boyd in nearly ten years it relieved him to see that so little had changed still got that pretty face dont you and you still sound like youve just ridden in off the range god its good to see you whend you get into town couple of days ago i wanted to take care of some business before i got in touch boyd looked past him to where the coroners van was being loaded was that your business part of it i appreciate you coming down like this yeah boyd spotted althea acknowledging her with an imperceptible nod did you call a cop colt or a friend colt looked down at the stub of his cigar dropped it near the gutter and crushed it with his boot its handy you being both did you kill that guy it was asked so matteroffactly that colt grinned again he knew boyd wouldnt have turned a hair if hed confessed then and there nope boyd nodded again going to fill me in yep why dont you wait in the car ill be with you in a minute captain boyd fletcher colt shook his head and chuckled though it was after midnight he was as alert as he was relaxed a cup of bad coffee in his hand and his scruffy boots propped on boyds desk aint that just something i thought you were raising horses and cattle in wyoming i do his voice was a drawl with the faintest whisper of a twang now and again i do what happened to the law degree oh its around somewhere and the air force i still fly just dont wear a uniform anymore how longs it going to take for that pizza to get here just long enough for it to be cold and inedible boyd leaned back in his chair he was comfortable in his office he was comfortable on the street and as he had been twenty years ago in their prep school days he was comfortable with colt you didnt get a look at the shooter hell fletch i was lucky to make the car before i was diving for cover and chewing asphalt not that thats going to help much odds are it was stolen lieutenant graysons tracking it now why dont you tell me what you were doing with wild bill he contacted me ive bee he broke off when althea strolled in she hadnt bothered to knock and she was carrying a flat cardboard box you two order pizza she dropped the box onto boyds desk held out a hand ten bucks fletcher althea grayson colt nightshade colts an old friend boyd dug ten dollars out of his wallet after folding the bill neatly and tucking it in a pocket of her purse she set her beaded bag on a stack of files mr nightshade ms grayson lieutenant grayson she corrected popping up the lid on the box she perused the contents chose a slice i believe you were at my crime scene sure did look that way he lowered his legs so that he could lean forward and take a piece himself he caught her scent over the aroma of cooling sausage pizza it was a whole lot more tantalizing thanks she murmured when boyd passed her a napkin i wonder what you were doing there getting shot at with my snitch colts eyes narrowed your snitch thats right like his hair his eyes couldnt seem to decide what color they should be althea thought they were caught somewhere between blue and green and at the moment they were as cold as the wind whipping at the window bill told me he tried to reach his police contact off and on all day i was in the field colts brow arched as he skimmed his gaze over the swirl of emerald silk some field lieutenant grayson spent all day putting the cap on a drug operation boyd interjected now kids why dont we start over and at the beginning fine setting her halfeaten slice down althea wiped her fingers then removed her wrap colt clenched his teeth to keep his tongue from falling out because she was turned away from him colt had the painful pleasure of gauging just how alluring a naked back could be when it was slim straight and framed in purple silk after laying her coat over a file cabinet althea reclaimed her pizza and sat on the corner of boyds desk she knew just what she did to a man colt realized he could see that smug faintly amused female knowledge in her eyes colt had always figured every woman knew her own arsenal down to the last eyelash but it was tough on a man when the woman was as heavily armed as this wild bill mr nightshade althea began what were you doing with him talking he knew his answer was obstinate but at the moment he was trying to judge whether there was anything between the sexy lieutenant and his old friend his old married friend colt mused he was relieved and more than a little surprised not to scent even a whiff of attraction between them about altheas voice was still patient even pleasant as if colt thought she were questioning a small boy who was mentally deficient the victim was theas snitch boyd reminded colt if she wants the case and i do then its hers to buy himself time colt reached for another slice of pizza he was going to have to do something he hated something that stuck in his craw like bad beef jerky he was going to have to ask for help and to get it he was going to have to share what he knew it took me two days to track down billings and get him to agree to talk to me it had also cost him two hundred in bribes to clear the path but he wasnt one to count the cost until the final tally he was nervous didnt really want to talk unless he had his police contact with him so i made it worth his while he glanced back at althea the lady was wiped out he realized the fatigue was hard to spot but it was there in the slight drooping of her eyelids the faint shadows under them im sorry you lost him but i dont think your being there would have changed anything we wont know that will we she wouldnt let the regret color her voice or her judgment why did you go to so much trouble to contact bill he used to have a girl working for him jade probably her street name althea let her mind click back nodded yeah little blonde babyface she took a couple of busts for solicitation ill have to check but i dont think shes worked the stroll for four or five weeks thatd be about right colt rose to fill his cup with more of the sludge from the automatic brewer it would have been about that long ago that billings got her a job in the movies if he was going to drink poison hed take it like a man without any cream or sugar to cut the bite sipping he turned back i aint talking hollywood this was the downanddirty stuff for private viewers who have the taste and the money to buy thrills videotapes for hardcore connoisseurs he shrugged and sat again cant say it bothers me any if were talking about consenting adults though i prefer my sex in the flesh but were not talking about you mr nightshade oh you dont have to call me mister lieutenant seems cold when were discussing such warm topics smiling he leaned back he had yet to ruffle her feathers and for reasons he wasnt going to take the time to explore he wanted to ruffle them good and proper well as it happens something spooked jade and she lit out im not one to think a hookers got a heart of gold but this one at least had a conscience she sent off a letter to a mr and mrs frank cook he shifted his gaze to boyd frank and marleen cook marleen boyds brows shot up marleen and frank the same colts smile was wry more old friends lieutenant as it happens i was what you might call intimate friends with mrs cook about a million years ago being a woman of sound judgment she married frank settled down in albuquerque and had herself a couple of beautiful kids althea shifted crossed her legs with a rustle of silk the silver dangling over his shirt was a saint christopher medal she noted the patron saint of travelers she wondered if mr nightshade felt the need for spiritual protection i assume this is leading somewhere other than down memory lane oh its leading right back to your professional front door lieutenant i just prefer the circular route now and then he took out a cigar running it through his long fingers before reaching for his lighter about a month ago marleens oldest girl thats elizabeth you ever meet liz boyd boyd shook his head he didnt like where this was heading not one bit not since she was in diapers what is she twelve thirteen just colt flicked his lighter on sucked his cigar to life though he knew all too well that the tang of smoke wouldnt cloud the bitter taste in his throat pretty as a picture like her mama got marleens hairtrigger temper too there was some trouble at home the kind i imagine most families have some time or other but liz got her back up and took off she ran away althea understood the runaways mind well too well tossed a few things in her backpack and took off needless to say marleen and frank have been living in hell the past few weeks they contacted the police but the official route wasnt getting them very far he blew out smoke no offense ten days ago they called me why althea asked told you were friends do you usually track down pimps and dodge bullets for friends she had a way with sarcasm all right colt mused it was one more weapon in the arsenal i do favors for people are you a licensed investigator pursing his lips colt studied the tip of his cigar im not big on licenses i put out some feelers had a little luck tracing her north then the cooks got jades letter clamping his cigar between his teeth he drew a folded sheet of floral stationery from his inside jacket pocket save time if you read it yourself he said and passed it to boyd althea rose going behind boyds back laying a hand on his shoulder as she read with him it was a curiously intimate and yet asexual gesture one colt decided that spoke of friendship and trust the handwriting was as girlishly fussy as the paper but the content althea noted had nothing to do with flowers and ribbons and childhood fancies dear mr and mrs cook i met liz in denver she is a nice kid i know she is really sorry she ran away and would come back now if she could i would help her out but i got to get out of town liz is in trouble i would go to the cops but im scared and i dont think they listen to someone like me she is not cut out for the life but they wont let her go she is young and so pretty and they are making lots of money from the movies i think i have been in the life for five years but some of the stuff they want us to do for the camera gives me the creeps i think they killed one of the girls so i am getting out before they kill me liz gave me your address and asked me to write and say she was sorry shes real scared and i hope you find her okay jade ps they have a place up in the mountains where they do the movies and there is an apartment on second avenue boyd didnt give the letter back but laid it on his desk he had a daughter of his own he thought of allison sweet feisty and six and had to swallow a hot ball of sick rage you could have come to me with this you should have come to me im used to working alone colt drew on his cigar again before tamping it out in any case i intended to come to you after i put a few things together i got the name of jades pimp and i wanted to shake him down and now hes dead altheas voice was flat as she turned to stare out of boyds window yeah colt studied her profile it wasnt just anger he felt from her there was a lot more mixed up with it word must have gotten back that i was looking for him and that he was willing to talk to me leads me to think that were dealing with wellconnected slime and slime that doesnt blink at murder this is a police matter colt boyd said quietly no argument ready to deal he spread his hands its also a personal matter im going to keep digging fletch theres no law against it im the cooks representative their lawyer if we need a handle is that what you are her emotions under control again althea turned back to him a lawyer when it suits me i dont want to interfere with your investigation he said to boyd i want the kid back safely back with marleen and frank ill cooperate completely anything i know youll know but it has to be quid pro quo give me a cop to work with on this boyd he smiled a little just a quirk at the corner of his mouth as if he were amused at himself and you of all people know how much i hate asking for an official partner on a job but its liz that matters all that matters you know im good he leaned forward you know i wont back off let me have your best man and lets get these bastards boyd pressed his fingers to his tired eyes he could of course order colt to back off and hed be wasting his breath he could refuse to cooperate could refuse to share any information the department unearthed and colt would work around him yes he knew colt was good and he had some idea of the kind of work hed done while in the military it would hardly be the first time boyd fletcher had bent the rules his decision made he gestured toward althea shes my best man chapter contents prev next if a man had to have a partner she might as well be easy on the eyes in any case colt didnt intend to work with althea so much as through her she would be his conduit to the official end of the investigation hed keep his word he always did except when he didnt and feed her whatever information he gleaned not that he expected her to do much with it there were only a handful of cops colt respected with boyd topping the list as far as lieutenant grayson was concerned colt figured shed be decorative marginally helpful and little else the badge the bod and the sarcasm would probably be useful when it came to interviewing any possible connections at least hed had a decent nights sleep all six hours of it he hadnt protested when boyd insisted he check out of his hotel and check into the fletcher household for the duration of his stay colt liked families other peoples in any case and hed been curious about boyds wife hed missed their wedding though he wasnt particularly fond of the spit and polish ceremonies called for he would have gone but it was a long way from beirut to denver and hed been busy with terrorists at the time he was delighted with cilia the woman hadnt turned a hair at having her husband bring home a strange man at am bundled in a terrycloth robe shed offered him the guest room with the suggestion that if he wanted to sleep in he should put the pillow over his head the kids apparently rose at seven to get ready for school hed slept like a rock and when hed awakened to the sounds of shouts and clomping feet hed taken his hostesss advice and had caught another hour of sleep with his head buried now fortified by an excellent breakfast and three cups of firstclass coffee prepared by the fletchers housekeeper he was ready to roll his agreement with boyd made the precinct house his first stop hed check in with althea grill her on any associates of billingss then go his own way it seemed to him that his old friend ran a tight ship there was the usual din of ringing phones clattering keyboards and raised voices inside the station there were the usual scents of coffee industrialstrength cleaners and sweaty bodies but there was also an underlying sense of organization and purpose the desk sergeant had colts name and he handed him a visitors badge and directed him to altheas office past the bull pen and two doors down a narrow corridor he found her door it was shut so he rapped once before pushing it open he knew she was there before he saw her he scented her as a wolf scents his mate or his prey gone were the bold silks but she still looked more the fashion plate than the cop the tailored slacks and jacket in smoke gray did nothing to suggest masculinity nor did he think she chose to deny her sex for shed accented the suit with a soft pink blouse and a starshaped jeweled lapel pin her mass of hair had been trained back in some complicated braid that left her face softly framed two heavy twists of gold glinted at her ears the result was as neat as any maiden aunt could want and still had the knockout punch of frosted sex a lesser man might have licked his lips grayson nightshade she gestured toward a chair have a seat there was only one to spare straightbacked and wood colt turned it around and straddled it as he did he noted that her office was less than half the size of boyds and ruthlessly organized file drawers were neatly closed papers properly stacked pencils sharpened to lethal points there was a plant on one of the rear corners of the desk that he was sure was meticulously watered there were no pictures of family or friends the only spot of color in the small windowless room was a painting an abstract in vivid blues greens and reds slashes of colors that clashed and warred rather than melded some instinct told him it suited her down to the ground so he folded his arms over the back of the chair and leaned forward you run the shooters car through motor vehicles didnt have to it was on this mornings hot sheet she took her copy and offered it reported stolen at eleven oclock last night owners had been out for dinner came out of the restaurant and found the car gone dr and dr wilmer a couple of dentists celebrating their fifth anniversary looks like theyre clean probably he tossed the sheet back onto her desk he hadnt really believed hed find a connection through the car dont guess its turned up not yet ive got jades rap sheet if youre interested after replacing the hot sheet in its proper place she picked up a file janice willowby age twentytwo couple of busts for solicitation a few charges as a juvie for more of the same one possession arrest also as a juvenile when she got rousted with a couple of joints in her purse went through the social services route a halfway house counseling then turned twentyone and went back on the streets it wasnt a new story have we got any family she might head home a mother in kansas city or she was in kansas city as of eighteen months ago im trying to track her down youve been busy not all of us start our day at she looked down at her watch ten i do better at night lieutenant he took out a cigar althea eyed it shook her head not in here pal agreeably colt tapped the cigar back into his pocket who did billings trust other than you i dont know that he trusted anybody but it hurt because she knew he had trusted somebody hed trusted her and somehow shed missed a step and now he was dead we had an arrangement i gave him money he gave me information what kind with wild bill it came in a variety pack he had his fingers in a lot of pies little pies mostly she shifted some papers on her desk tapping the edges neatly together he was strictly smalltime but he had big ears knew how to fade into the background so you forgot he was around people talked around him because he looked like his brain would fit in a teacup but he was smart her voice changed tipping colt off to something she had yet to admit even to herself she was grieving smart enough to keep from crossing the line that would send him up to hard time smart enough to keep from stepping on the wrong toes until last night i didnt make any secret of the fact i was looking for him and for information he could give me but i sure as hell didnt want him dead im not blaming you no no she pushed away from the desk far enough to allow her to swivel the chair around and face him people like bill no matter how smart have short life expectancies if hed have been able to contact me i might have met him at the same spot you did with the same results shed thought that through carefully ruthlessly i might not like your style nightshade but im not pinning this on you she sat very still he noted no gestures no shrugs no restless tapping like the painting on the wall behind her she communicated vibrant passion without movement and just what is my style lieutenant youre a renegade the kind who doesnt just refuse to play by the rules but rejoices in breaking them her eyes stayed level with his and were cool as lake water he wondered what it would take to warm them up you start things but you dont always finish them maybe that means you bore easily or you just run out of energy either way it doesnt say much about your dependability her rundown of his personality annoyed him but when he spoke again his slow southwestern drawl was amused you figured all that out since last night i ran a make on you the prep school where you hung out with boyd surprised me her lips curved but the eyes had yet to warm you dont look like the preppie type my parents thought it would tame me he grinned guess not neither did harvard where you got your law degree which you havent put to much use parts of your military career were classified but all in all i got the picture there was a dish of sugared almonds on her desk althea leaned over and after careful deliberation chose the one she wanted i dont work with someone i dont know me either so why dont you fill me in on althea grayson im the cop she said simply and youre not i assume you have a recent picture of elizabeth cook yeah i got one but he didnt reach for it he didnt have to take this kind of bull from some glamourpuss with a badge tell me lieutenant just who jammed a stick up your the phone cut him off which considering the flash in altheas eyes might have been for the best at least he knew how to defrost those eyes now grayson she waited a beat then jotted something down on a pad notify forensics im on my way she rose tucking the pad into a snakeskin purse we found the car she was frowning when she slung the bag over her shoulder since boyd wants you in you can come along for the ride as an observer only got it oh yeah i got it fine he followed her out then quickly moved up so that they walked side by side the woman had the best rear view this side of the mississippi and colt didnt care to be distracted i didnt have much time to play catchup with boyd last night he began i wondered how it was that youre on such easy terms with your captain she was walking down the stairs to the garage and she stopped turned aimed one razorsharp glance what he demanded as she assessed him silently im trying to decide if youre insulting me and boyd in which case id have to hurt you or if you simply phrased your question badly he lifted a brow try the second choice all right she continued down we were partners for over seven years she reached the bottom of the steps and turned sharply to the right the flat heels of her suede half boots clicked busily on the concrete when you trust someone with your life on a daytoday basis youd better be on easy terms then he made captain thats right after taking out her keys she unlocked her car sorry but the passenger seats stuck all the way forward i havent had time to take it in and get it fixed colt looked down at the spiffy sports car with some regret a sexy car sure but with the seat in that position he was going to have to fold himself up like an accordion and sit with his chin on his knees and you dont have a problem with that boyds being captain althea slid in gracefully smirking a bit as colt grunted and arranged himself beside her no am i ambitious yes do i resent having the best cop i ever worked with as my superior no do i expect to make captain myself within another five years you bet your butt she pushed mirrored aviator sunglasses over her eyes fasten your seat belt nightshade with that she peeled out shooting up the ramp of the garage and out onto the street he had to admire her driving he had no choice since she was behind the wheel and his life was in her hands easy terms he wondered yeah right so you and boyd are friends thats right why i just wanted to establish that it wasnt all goodlooking men of a certain age who put your back up he grinned at her as she downshifted around a comer i like knowing its just me makes me feel kind of special you know she smiled then and shot him what could have been a friendly look it certainly was no more than friendly and it really shouldnt have had his heart doing a slow roll in his chest i wouldnt say you put my back up nightshade i just dont trust hotdoggers but since were both after the same thing here and since boyds a pal on both sides we can try to get along sounds reasonable weve got the job and boyd in common maybe we can find a couple of other things her radio was turned down low colt flicked the volume up and nodded approval at the slow pulsepumping blues there thats one more thing how do you feel about mexican food i like my chili hot and my margaritas cold progress he tried to shift in his seat rapped his knee on the dash and swore if were going to do any more driving together we take my fourwheel well discuss it she turned the music down again when she heard the police radio squawk to life all units in the vicinity of sheridan and jewell in progress althea swore as the dispatcher continued to call for assistance thats only a block down she turned left and aimed a quick dubious look at colt shots fired she told him police business got it sure this is unit six responding she said into the transmitter im on the scene after squealing to a halt behind her blackandwhite she shoved open her door stay in the car with that terse order she drew her weapon and headed for the entrance of a fourstory apartment building she paused at the door sucking in her breath the minute she bolted through she heard the blast of another gunshot one floor up she thought maybe two with her body braced and flattened against the wall she scanned the cramped deserted entryway then started up screaming no she thought crying a child her mind cold her hands steady she swung her weapon toward the first landing then followed it a door opened to her left crouching she aimed toward the movement and stared into the face of an elderly woman with terrified eyes police althea told her stay inside the door shut a bolt turned althea shifted toward the second staircase she saw them then the cop who was down and the cop who was huddled over him officer there was the snap of authority in her voice when she dropped a hand on the uninjured cops shoulder whats the status here he shot jim he came running out with the kid and opened up the uniformed cop was sheetwhite she noted as pale as his partner who was bleeding on the stairway she couldnt tell which of them was shaking more violently whats your name harrison don harrison he was pressing a soaked handkerchief to the gaping wound low on his partners left shoulder officer harrison im lieutenant grayson give me the situation here and make it fast sir he took two short quick breaths domestic dispute shots fired a white male assaulted the woman in apartment d he opened fire on us and headed upstairs with a small female child as a shield as he finished a woman stumbled out of the apartment above where she clutched her side blood trickled through her fingers he took my baby charlie took my baby please god she fell weeping to her knees hes crazy please god officer harrison a sound on the stairs had althea moving fast then swearing she should have known colt wouldnt stay in the car get on the horn now she continued call for backup officer and civilian down hostage situation now tell me what he was carrying looked like a make the call then get in here and back me up she spared one look at colt make yourself useful do what you can for these two she raced up the stairs she could hear the baby crying again long terrified wails that echoed in the narrow corridors by the time she reached the top floor she heard the slam of a door the roof she decided braced on one side of the door she turned the knob kicked it open and went in low he fired once wildly the bullet sang more than a foot to her right althea took her stand and faced him police she shouted put down your weapon he stood near the edge of the roof a big man linebackersize she noted his skin flushed with rage his eyes glazed by chemicals that she could handle it was a he was carrying she could handle that as well but it was the child the little girl of perhaps two that he was holding by one foot over the edge of the roof that she wasnt sure she could deal with ill drop her he shouted it like a chant against the brisk wind ill do it ill do it i swear to god ill drop her like a stone he shook the child who continued to scream one of her little pink tennis shoes flew off and fell five long stories you dont want to make a mistake do you charlie althea inched away from the door sidestepping slowly her ninemillimeter aimed at the broad chest bring her back from the edge im going to drop the little bitch he grinned when he said it his teeth bared his eyes glittering shes just like her mother whining and crying all the damn time thought they could get away from me i found them didnt i lindas real sorry now isnt she real damn sorry now yes she is she had to get to the kid there had to be a way to get to the child unbidden an old obscene memory flashed through her head the shouting the threats the fear althea tramped on them as she would a roach you hurt the little girl and its all over charlie dont tell me its over enraged he swung the child like a sack of laundry altheas heart stopped and so did the screaming the little girl was merely sobbing now quietly helplessly her arms dangling limply her huge blue eyes fixed and glazed she tried to tell me it was over its over charlie he mimicked in a singsong voice so i knocked her around some god knows she deserved it nagging me about getting work nagging about every damn thing and as soon as the kid came along everything changed i got no use for bitches in my life but i say when its over the wail of sirens rose up in the air althea sensed movement behind her but didnt turn didnt dare she needed the man focused on her only on her bring the kid in and you might get away you want to get away dont you charlie come on give her to me you dont need her you think im stupid his lips curled into a snarl youre just one more bitch i dont think youre stupid she caught a movement out of the corner of her eye and would have sworn if shed dared it wasnt harrison it was colt slipping like a shadow toward the mans blind side i dont think youd be stupid enough to hurt the kid she was closer now five feet away althea knew that it might as well be fifty im going to kill her he shouted and im going to kill you and im going to kill anybody who gets in my way nobody says its over till i say its over it happened then fast like a blur at the corner of a dream colt lunged wrapping one arm around the childs waist althea caught the flash of metal in his hand and recognized it as a he might have used it if saving the child hadnt been his priority he pivoted back swinging the child so that his body was her shield and by the time hed brought his weapon to bear it was over althea watched the arch from her toward colt and the girl and she fired the bullet drove him back his knees hit the low curbing at the edge of the roof he was the one who dropped like a stone althea didnt permit herself even a sigh she holstered her weapon and strode to where colt was cuddling the weeping child she okay looks like in a move so natural she would have sworn hed spent his life doing it he settled the girl on his hip and kissed her damp temple youre okay now baby nobodys going to hurt you mama choking on tears she buried her face in colts shoulder mama well take you to your mama honey dont you worry colt still held his gun but his other hand was busy stroking the girls wispy blond hair nice work lieutenant althea glanced over her shoulder cops were already pounding up the stairs ive done better you kept him talking so the kid had a shot then you took him down it doesnt get better than that and there had been a look in her eyes from the moment shed started up the steps with a cops blood on her hands and it hadnt faded yet a look hed seen before colt mused one hed always termed a warriors look her eyes held his for another minute lets get her out of here was all she said fine they started toward the door just one thing nightshade he smiled a little certain this was the moment shed thank him whats that have you got a permit for that gun he stopped stared then his smile exploded into a deep rich laugh charmed the little girl looked up sniffled and managed a watery smile she didnt think about killing didnt permit herself shed killed before and knew she would likely do so again but she didnt think about it she knew that if she reflected too deeply on that aspect of the job she could freeze or she could drink or she could grow callous or worse infinitely worse she could grow to enjoy it so she filed her report and put it out of her mind or tried to she handcarried a copy of the report to boyds office laid it on his desk his eyes flicked down to it then back to hers the cop barkley hes still in surgery the womans out of danger good hows the kid she has an aunt in colorado springs social services contacted her the creep was her father history of battering and drugs his wife took the kid about a year ago and went to a womens shelter filed for divorce she moved here about three months ago got herself a job started a life and he found her and he found her well he wont find her again she turned toward the door but boyd was up and walking around the desk thea he shut the door cutting off most of the din from the bull pen are you okay sure i dont see iad hassling me on this one im not talking about internal affairs he tilted his head a day or two off wouldnt hurt it wouldnt help either she lifted her shoulders let them fall to boyd she could say things she could never say to anyone else i didnt think id get to her in time i didnt get to her she added colt did and he shouldnt have been there he was there gently boyd laid his hands on her shoulders ohoh its the supercop complex i can see it coming dodging bullets filing reports screaming down dark alleys selling tickets to the policemens ball ridding the world of bad guys and saving cats from the tops of trees she can do it all shut up fletcher but she smiled i draw the line at saving cats want to come to dinner tonight she rested a hand on the knob whats to eat he shrugged grinned cant say its marias night off cilias cooking she gave him a pained sorrowful look i thought we were friends well send out for tacos deal when she walked back into the bull pen she spotted colt he had his boots up on a desk and a phone at his ear she strolled over sat on the corner and waited for him to finish the call paperwork done he asked her nightshade i dont suppose i have to point out that this desk this phone this chair are department property and offlimits to civilians he grinned at her nope but go right ahead if you want to you look good enough to eat when youre spouting proper procedure why your compliments just take my breath away she knocked his feet off the desk the stolen cars been impounded the lab boys are going over it so i dont see the point in rushing to take a look got a different plan starting with the tick tock im going to hit a few of wild bills hangouts talk to some people im with you dont rub it in when she started toward the garage he took her arm my car this time remember with a shrug she went with him out to the street his rugged black fourwheeler had a parking ticket on the windshield colt stuffed it in his pocket i dont suppose i can ask you to fix this no althea climbed in thats okay fletchll do it she slanted him a look and what might have been a smile before turning to stare out of the windshield again you did good with that kid today it galled her a bit to admit it but it had to be done i dont think shed have made it without you us he said some people might have called it teamwork she fastened her belt with a jerk of her wrist some people dont take it so hard thea whistling through his teeth he shoved the gearshift into first and cruised into traffic now where were we before we were interrupted oh yeah you were telling me about yourself i dont think so okay ill tell me about you youre a woman who likes structure depends on it no no its more that you insist on it he said thats why youre so good at your job all that law and order she snorted you should be a psychiatrist nightshade who could have guessed a cop would prefer law and order dont interrupt im on a roll youre what twentyseven twentyeight thirtytwo you lost your roll ill pick it up again he glanced down at her naked ring finger youre not married another brilliant deduction you have a tendency toward sarcasm and an affection for wearing silk and expensive perfume real nice perfume thea the kind that seduces a mans mind before his body gets involved maybe you should be writing ad copy theres nothing subtle about your sexuality its just there in big capital letters now some women would exploit it some would disguise it you dont do either so i figure youve decided somewhere along the line that its up to a man to deal with it and thats not only smart its wise she didnt have an answer to that he thought or didnt choose to give him one you dont waste time you dont waste energy that way when you need either one youve got them theres a cops brain inside there so you can size up a situation fast and act on it and i figure you can handle a man every bit as coolly as you do your gun an interesting analysis nightshade you didnt flinch when you took that guy out today it bothered you but you didnt flinch he pulled up in front of the tick tock and turned off the ignition if ive got to work with somebody with the possibility of heading into a nasty situation i like knowing she doesnt flinch well gee thanks now i can stop worrying that you dont approve of me her temper on the boil she slammed out of the car finally colt reached her in a few longlegged strides and swung his arm over her shoulder a little heat its a relief to see theres some temper in there too she surprised them both by ramming an elbow into his gut you wouldnt be relieved if i cut it loose take my word for it they spent the next two hours going from bar to pool hall to grubby diner it wasnt until they tried a holeinthewall called clancys that they made some progress the lights were dim a sop to the early drinkers who liked to forget that the sun was still up a radio behind the bar scratched out country music that told a sad tale of cheating and empty bottles several of those early customers were already scattered at the bar or at tables most of them doing their drinking steadily and solo the liquor was watered and the glasses were dingy but the whiskey came cheap and the atmosphere was conducive to getting seriously drunk althea walked to the end of the bar and ordered a club soda she had no intention of sampling colt opted for the beer on tap she lifted a brow had a tetanus shot recently she took out a twenty but kept her finger on the corner of the bill as their drinks were served wild bill used to come in here pretty regular the bartender glanced down at the bill and back at althea bloodshot eyes and the map of broken capillaries over his broad face attested to the fact that he swallowed as much as he served althea prompted him wild bill billings so he was a friend of mine looks like you lost a friend i was in here with him a couple of times althea drew the twenty back a fraction maybe you remember my memorys real selective but it dont have no trouble making a cop good then you probably figured out that bill and i had an arrangement i probably figured out the arrangement got him splattered all over the sidewalk youd have figured that one wrong he wasnt snitching for me when he got hit and me im just the sentimental type i want who did him and im willing to pay she shoved the bill forward a lot more than this i dont know nothing about it but the twenty disappeared into his pocket but you might know people who know people who know something she leaned forward a smile in her eyes if you put the word out id appreciate it he shrugged and would have moved away but she put a hand on his arm i think that twentys worth a minute or two more bill had a girl named jade shes skipped he had a couple others didnt he a couple he wasnt much of a pimp got a name he took out a dirty rag and began to wipe the dirty bar a blackhaired girl named meena she worked out of here sometimes havent seen her lately if you do you give me a call she took out a card and dropped it onto the bar you know anything about movies private movies with young girls he looked blank and shrugged but not before althea saw the flash of knowledge in his eyes i aint got time for movies and thats all you get for twenty thanks althea strolled out give him a minute she said under her breath to colt then she peered through the dirty window look at that funny that hed get an urge to make a call just now colt watched the bartender hurry to the wall phone drop in a quarter i like your style lieutenant lets see how much you like it after a few hours in a cold car weve got a stakeout tonight nightshade im looking forward to it chapter contents prev next she was right about the cold he didnt mind it so much not with long johns and a sheepskin jacket to ward it off but he did mind the dragging inactivity hed have sworn that althea thrived on it she was settled comfortably in the passenger seat working a crossword puzzle by the dim glow of the glovecompartment light she worked methodically patiently endlessly he thought while he tried to stave off boredom with the b b king retrospective on the radio he thought of the evening theyd both missed at the fletchers hot food blazing fire warm brandy it had even occurred to him that althea might have defrosted a bit in unofficial surroundings it might not have helped matters to think of her that way the ice goddess melting but it did something for his more casual fantasies in his current reality she was all cop and emotionally as distant from him as the moon but in the daydream assisted by the slow blues on the radio she was all woman seductive as the black silk he imagined her wearing enticing as the crackling fire he pictured burning low in a stone hearth soft as the white fur rug they lowered themselves to and her taste once his mouth sampled hers was honeyed whiskey drugging sweet potent her scent tangled up with her flavor in his senses until they were one and the same an opiate a man could drown in the silk slipped away inch by seductive inch revealing the alabaster flesh beneath rosepetal smooth flawless as glass firm and soft as water and when she reached for him drew him in her lips moved against his ear in whispered invitation want more coffee huh he snapped back swiveling his head around to stare at her in the shadowed car she held a thermos out to him what coffee intrigued by the look on his face she picked up his cup herself and filled it halfway at first glance she would have said there was temper in his eyes ripe and ready to rip but she knew that look and knew it well this was desire equally ripe equally ready taking a side trip nightshade yeah he accepted the cup and drank deep wishing it was whiskey but his lips curved his amusement with himself and the ridiculous situation easing the discomfort in his gut one hell of a trip well try to keep up with our tour will you she sipped from her own cup and offered him a share of her bag of candy there goes another one efficient she set aside her cup and picked up her camera she took two quick shots of the man entering the bar he was only the second who had gone in during the past hour they dont exactly do a thriving business down here do they most people like a little ambience with their liquor ferns and canned music she set the camera aside again clean glasses for a start i doubt were going to see one of our moviemakers down here then why are we sitting in a cold car looking at a dive at eleven oclock at night because its my job she chose a single piece of candy popped it into her mouth and because im waiting for something else it was the first hed heard of it want to clue me in no she chose another piece and went back to her crossword puzzle okay that tears it he ripped the paper out of her hands you want to play games grayson let me tell you how i play i get peeved when people hold out on me i get especially peeved when im bored senseless while theyre doing it then i get mean excuse me she said in a mild tone that was in direct contrast to the fire in her eyes i can hardly speak for the ball of terror in my throat you want to be scared he moved fast eerily so she wouldnt have been able to evade him if shed tried so she submitted without any show of resistance when he grabbed her by the shoulders i figure i ought to be able to put the fear of god into you thea and liven things up a bit for both of us back off if youve finished your imitation of machismo what ive been waiting for is about to walk into the bar what he turned his head which presented althea with the perfect opportunity to grab his thumb and twist it viciously when he swore she released him meena wild bills other girl althea lifted her camera and took another shot i got her picture out of the files this afternoon shes done time solicitation running a confidence game possession with intent to sell disorderly behavior a sweet girl our meena your meena althea told him since you play the big bad type so well you can go on in and charm meena get her out here so we can talk opening her purse althea took out an envelope with five crisp tendollar bills and if your charm fails offer her fifty you want me to go in and convince her im looking to party thats the ticket fine hed certainly done worse in his career than play the eager john in a seedy bar but he shoved the envelope back into her lap ive got my own money althea watched him cross the street waiting until hed disappeared inside then she leaned back and indulged herself for one moment by closing her eyes and letting out a long long breath a dangerous man colt nightshade she thought a deadly man she hadnt felt simple anger when he lunged toward her and grabbed she hadnt felt simple anything what shed experienced was complex convoluted and confusing what shed felt was arousal gutdeep redhot soulsearing arousal mixed with a healthy dose of primal fear and teethbaring fury it wasnt like her she told herself as she took the time alone to gather her wits coming that close to losing control because a man pushed the wrong buttons or the right ones was uncharacteristic of her she pushed the buttons that was althea graysons number one hardandfast rule and if colt thought he could break that one he was in for a big disappointment shed worked too hard forming herself into what she was laying out the stages of her life and following them shed come from chaos and shed beaten it back certainly it was necessary from time to time to change the pattern she wasnt rigid but nothing absolutely nothing jarred that pattern it was the case itself she supposed the child being held by strangers almost certainly being abused another pattern she thought bitterly all too familiar to her and the child that morning she remembered helplessly trapped by the adults around her she shook that off picked up the crumpled newspaper to fold it neatly and set it aside she was just tired she told herself the drug bust the week before had been vicious and to tumble from that into this would have shaken anyone what she needed was a vacation she smiled to herself imagining a warm whitesand beach blue water a tall spear of glistening hotel behind her a big bed room service mud packs and a private whirlpool and that was just what she was going to have when she capped this case and sent colt nightshade back to his cattle or his law practice or whatever the hell he called his profession glancing toward the bar again she was forced to nod in approval less than ten minutes had passed and he was coming out meena in tow oh a group thing meena studied althea through heavily kohled eyes she pushed back her stiff black curls and smirked well now honey thats going to cost you extra no problem gallantly colt helped her into the back seat i guess a guy like you can handle the two of us she settled back reeking of floral cologne i dont think thatll be necessary althea took out her badge flashed it meena swore shot colt a look of intense dislike then folded her arms havent you cops got anything better to do than roust us working girls we wont have to take you in meena if you answer a few questions drive around a little will you colt as he obliged althea turned in her seat wild bill was a friend of mine yeah right he did some favors for me i did some for him yeah i bet meena broke off narrowed her eyes you the cop he snitched for the one he called classy meena relaxed a little there was a pretty good chance she wouldnt be spending the night in lockup after all he said you were okay said you always slipped him a few without whining about it althea noted meenas greedy little smile and lifted a brow im touched maybe he shouldve said i paid when he had something worth buying do you know jade sure she hasnt been around for a few weeks bill said she skipped town meena dug in her red vinyl purse and pulled out a cigarette when colt clicked on his lighter and offered the flame she cupped her hand over his and slanted him a warm look under thickly blackened lashes thanks honey how about this girl colt took the snapshot of elizabeth out of his pocket after turning on the dome light he offered it to meena no she started to pass it back then frowned i dont know maybe while she considered she blew out a stream of smoke clouding the car not on the stroll seems like maybe i saw her somewhere with bill althea asked hell no bill didnt deal in jailbait who does meena shifted her eyes to colt georgie cools got a few young ones in his stable nobody as fresh as this though did bill get you a gig meena a movie gig althea asked maybe he did the answers yes or the answers no althea took back the photo of liz you waste my time i dont waste my money well hell it dont bother me if some guy wants to take videos while i work they paid extra for it have you got a name meena snorted in altheas direction we didnt exchange business cards sweetie but you can give me a description how many were involved where it went down probably the sly look was back as meena blew out smoke if i had some incentive your incentives not to spend time in a cell with a twohundredpound swede named big jane althea said mildly you cant send me up ill scream entrapment scream all you want with your record the judge will just chuckle come on thea colts drawl seemed to have thickened give the lady a break shes trying to cooperate arent you meena sure meena butted out her cigarette licked her lips sure i am what shes trying to do is hose me althea realized she and colt had picked up the good cop bad cop routine without missing a beat and i want answers shes giving them to us he smiled at meena in the rearview mirror just take your time there were three of them meena said and set her cherryred lips in a pout the guy running the camera another guy sitting back in a corner i couldnt see him and the guy who was like performing with me you know the guy with the camera was bald a black guy really big like a wrestler or something i was there about an hour and he never opened his mouth once althea flipped open her notebook did they call each other by name no meena thought it through shook her head no thats funny isnt it they didnt talk to each other at all as i remember the one i was working with was a little guy except for certain vital parts she chuckled and reached for another cigarette now he did some talking trash talk get it like for the camera some guys like that he was i dont know in his forties maybe skinny had his hair pulled back in a ponytail that hit his shoulder blades he wore this lone ranger mask im going to want you to work with a police artist althea told her no way no more cops we dont have to do it at the station althea played her trump card if you give us a good enough description one that helps us nail these film buffs theres an extra hundred for you okay meena brightened okay althea tapped her pencil against her pad where did you shoot shoot oh you mean the movie over on second real nice place it had one of them whirlpool tubs in the bathroom and mirrors for walls meena leaned forward to brush her fingertips over colts shoulder it was stimulating the address althea said i dont know one of those big condo buildings on second top floor too like the penthouse i bet youd recognize the building if we drove by it wouldnt you meena colts tone was all friendly encouragement as was the smile he shot her over his shoulder yeah sure i would and she did minutes later she was pointing out the window that place there see the one up top with the big windows and the balcony thing it was in there real class joint white carpet this really sexy bedroom with red curtains and a big round bed there was gold faucets in the bathroom shaped like swans jeez i woulda loved to go back you only went once colt asked her yeah they told billy i wasnt the right type with a sound of disgust she reached for yet another cigarette get this i was too old i just had my twentysecond birthday and those creeps tell billy im too old it really ticked me oh yeah suddenly inspired she rapped colt on the shoulder the kid the one in the picture thats where i saw her i was leaving but i went back cause i left my smokes she was sitting in the kitchen i didnt recognize her in the picture right off cause she was all madeup when i saw her did she say anything to you colt asked struggling to keep his voice quiet and even do anything no just sat there she looked stoned to me because she sensed he needed something althea slid her hand across the seat and covered colts his was rigid she was surprised but didnt protest when he turned his hand over and gripped hers palm to palm im going to want to talk to you again with her free hand althea reached into her purse for enough money to ensure meenas continued cooperation i need a number where i can reach you no sweat meena rattled it off while she counted her money i guess billy had it right youre square hey maybe you could drop me at the tick tock i think ill go in and drink one for wild bill we cant do anything without a warrant althea was repeating the statement for the third time as they stepped out of the elevator on the top floor of the building meena had pointed out you dont need a warrant to knock on a door right with a sigh althea slipped a hand inside her jacket in an automatic check of her weapon and theyre going to invite us in for coffee if you give me a couple of hours when he whirled her jaw dropped after the cool matteroffact manner in which hed handled everything up to this point the raw fury on his face was staggering get this lieutenant im not waiting another two minutes to see if liz is in there and if she is if anybody is im not going to need a damn warrant look colt i understand you dont understand diddley she opened her mouth then shut it again shocked that shed been about to shout that she did understand oh yes she understood very very well well knock she said tightly and strode to the door of the penthouse and did so maybe theyre hard of hearing colt used his fist to hammer when the summons went unanswered he moved so fast althea didnt have time to swear hed already kicked the door in good real good nightshade subtle as a brick guess i slipped he pulled his gun out of his boot and look at this the doors open dont but he was already inside cursing boyd and all his boyhood friends althea drew her weapon and went in the door behind him instinctively covering his back she didnt need the light colt turned on to see that the room was empty it had a deserted feel there was nothing left but the carpet and the drapes at the windows split colt muttered to himself as he moved quickly from room to room the bastards split satisfied she wouldnt need it althea replaced her gun i guess we know who our friendly bartender called this afternoon well see what we can get from the rental contract the neighbors yet she thought if their quarry had been this slick so far what they got would be close to useless she stepped into the bathroom it was as meena had described the big whirlpool tub the swanshaped faucets brass not gold the allaround mirrors youve just jeopardized the integrity of a possible crime scene nightshade i hope youre satisfied she could have been here he said from behind her she looked over saw their reflections trapped in the mirrored tiles it was the expression on his face one she hadnt expected to see there that softened her were going to find her colt she said quietly were going to see that she gets back home sure he wanted to break something anything it took every ounce of his will not to smash his fist through the mirrors every day theyve got her is a day shes going to have to live with forever bending he slipped his gun back in his boot god thea shes just a child children are tougher than most people think they close things off when they have to and its going to be easier because she has family who loves her easier than what than having no one but yourself she thought just easier she couldnt help it she reached out laid a hand on his cheek dont let it eat at you colt youll mess up if you do yeah he drew it back that dangerous emotion that led to dangerous mistakes but when she started to drop her hand and move past him colt snagged her wrist you know something maybe it was only because he needed contact but he tugged her an inch closer for a minute there you were almost human really their bodies were almost brushing a bad move she thought but it would be cowardly to pull back what am i usually perfect he lifted his free hand because hed wanted to almost from the first moment hed seen her and tangled his fingers in her hair its scary he said its the whole package that face the hair the body the mind a man doesnt know whether to bay at the moon or whimper at your feet she had to tilt her head back to keep her eyes level with his if her heart was beating a bit faster she could ignore it it had happened before if she felt the little pull of curiosity even of lust it wasnt the first time and it could be controlled but what was difficult very difficult to channel was the unexpected clouding of her senses that would have to be fought you dont strike me as the type to do either she said and smiled a cool tightlipped smirk that had most men backing off babbling colt wasnt most men i never have been why dont we try something else he said it slowly then moved like lightning to close his mouth over hers if she had protested if she had struggled if there had been even a token pulling back he would have released her and counted his losses maybe but she didnt that surprised them both she could have should have she would think later she could have stopped him cold with any number of defensive or offensive moves she would think later but there was such raw heat in his lips such steely strength in his arms such whirling pleasure in her own body oh yes she would think later much later it was exactly as hed imagined it and hed imagined it a lot that tart flamboyant flavor she carried on her lips was the twin of the one hed sampled in his mind it was as addicting as any opiate when she opened for him he dived deeper and took more she was as small as slim as supple as any man could wish and as strong her arms were locked hard around him and her fingers were clutching at his hair the low deep sound of approval that vibrated in her throat had his blood racing like a fastmoving river murmuring her name he spun her around ramming her against the mirrors covering her body with his his hands ran over her in a greedy sprint to take and touch and possess then his fingers were jerking at the buttons on her blouse in a desperate need to push aside the first barrier he wanted her now no no he needed her now he realized the way a man needed sleep after a vicious day of hard labor the way he needed to eat after a long long fast he tore his mouth from hers to press it against her throat reveling in the sumptuous taste of flesh halfdelirious she arched back moaning at the thrill of his hungry mouth on her heated skin without the wall for support she knew she would already have sunk to the floor and it was there just there that he would take her that they would take each other on the cool hard tile with dozens of mirrors tossing back reflections of their desperate bodies here and now and like a thief sneaking into a darkened house an image of meena and what had gone on in that apartment crept into her mind what was she doing good lord what was she doing she raged at herself as she levered herself away she was a cop and she had been about to indulge in some wild bout of mindless sex in the middle of a crime scene stop her voice was harsh with arousal and selfdisgust i mean it colt stop now what like a diver surfacing from fathomsdeep he shook his head nearly swayed good lord his knees were weak to compensate he braced a hand on the wall as he stared down at her hed loosened her hair and it spilled rich and red over her shoulders her eyes were more gold than brown now huge and seductively misted her mouth was full reddened by the pressure and demand of his and her skin was flushed a pale lovely rose youre beautiful impossibly beautiful gently he skimmed a finger down her throat like some exotic flower behind glass a man just has to break that glass and take it no she grabbed his hand to keep from losing her mind again this is insane completely insane yeah he couldnt have agreed more and it felt great this is an investigation nightshade and were standing in what is very possibly the scene of a major crime he smiled and lifted her hand to nip at her fingers just because this was a dead end for their investigation didnt mean all activity had to come to a halt so lets go someplace else we are going someplace else she shoved him away and quickly competently redid her blouse separately she wasnt steady she realized damn him damn her she wasnt steady he felt that the safest place for his hands at the moment was his pockets so he shoved them in she was right one hundred percent right and that was the worst of it you want to pretend this didnt happen i dont pretend anything settling on dignity she pushed her tumbled hair back smoothed down her rumpled jacket it happened now its done not by a long shot lieutenant were both grownups and though i can only speak for myself that kind of connection just doesnt happen every day youre right she inclined her head you can only speak for yourself she made it back to the living room before he grabbed her arm and spun her around to face him you want me to press the point now his voice was quiet deadly quiet or do you want to be straight with me all right fine she could be honest because lies wouldnt work if i were interested in a quick hot affair id certainly give you a call as it happens i have other priorities at the moment youve got a list right she had to take a moment to get her temper back under wraps do you think that insults me she asked sweetly i happen to prefer organizing my life compartmentalizing she arched a brow whatever for better or worse we have a professional relationship i want that girl found colt every bit as much as you do i want her back with her family eating hamburgers and worrying over her latest math test and i want to bring down the bastards who have her more than you could possibly understand then why dont you help me understand im a cop she told him thats enough no its not there had been passion in her face the same kind of passion hed felt when he had her in his arms fierce and ragged and at the edge of control not for you or for me either he let out a deep breath and rubbed the base of his neck where most of his tension had lodged they were both tired he realized tired and strung out it wasnt the time and it wasnt the place to delve into personal reasons hed need to find some objectivity if he wanted to figure out althea grayson look id apologize for back there if i was out of line but we both know i wasnt im here to get liz back and nothings going to stop me and after a taste of you thea im going to be just as determined to have more im not the soup du jour nightshade she said wearily youll only get what i give his grin flashed quick and easy thats just the way i want it come on ill drive you home saying nothing althea stared after him she had the uncomfortable feeling that they hadnt resolved matters precisely as shed wanted chapter contents prev next armed with a second cup of coffee colt stood at the edge of a whirlwind it was obvious to him that getting three kids out of the house and onto a school bus was an event of major proportions he could only wonder how a trio of adults could handle the orchestration on a daily basis and remain sane i dont like this cereal bryant complained he lifted a spoonful and scowling let the soggy mess plop back into his bowl it tastes like wet trees you picked it out because it had a whistle inside cilia reminded him as she slapped peanutbutterandjelly sandwiches together you eat it put a banana on it boyd suggested while he struggled to bundle allisons pale flyaway hair into something that might have passed for a braid ouch daddy youre pulling sorry whats the capital of nebraska lincoln his daughter said with a sigh i hate geography tests while she pouted over it she practiced her plies for ballet class how come i have to know the stupid states and their stupid capitals anyway because knowledge is sacred with his tongue caught in his teeth boyd fought to band the wispy braid and once you learn something you never really forget it well i cant remember the capital of virginia its ah as the sacred knowledge escaped him boyd swore under his breath what the hell did he care he lived in colorado one of the major problems with having kids as he saw it was that the parents were forced to go back to school itll come to you mom brys feeding bongo his cereal allison sent her brother a smug smarmy smile of the kind that only a sister can achieve cilia turned in time to see her son thrusting his spoon toward their dogs eager mouth bryant fletcher youre going to be wearing that cereal in a minute but look mom even bongo wont eat it its crap dont say crap cilia told him wearily but she noted that the big scruffy dog who regularly drank out of toilet bowls had turned up his nose after one sample of soggy rocket crunchies eat the banana and get your coat mom keenan the youngest scrambled into the room he was shoeless and sockless and was holding one grubby hightop sneaker in his hand i cant find my other shoe its not anywhere somebody musta stole it call a cop cilia muttered as she dumped the last peanutbutterandjelly sandwich into a lunch box ill find it senora maria wiped her hands on her apron bless you bad guys took it maria keenan told her his voice low and serious they came in the middle of the night and swiped it daddyll go out and lock them up of course he will equally sober maria took his hand to lead him toward the stairs now we go look for clues si umbrellas cilia turned from the counter running a hand through her short crop of brown hair its raining do we have umbrellas we used to have umbrellas his hairstyling duties completed boyd poured himself another cup of coffee somebody stole them probably the same gang who stole keenans shoe and bryants spelling homework ive already put a task force on it big help you are cilia went to the kitchen doorway maria umbrellas she turned back tripping over the dog swore then grabbed three lunch boxes coats she ordered youve got five minutes to make the bus there was a mad scramble impeded by bongo who decided this was the perfect time to jump on everyone in sight he hates goodbyes boyd told colt as he deftly collared the mutt the shoe was in the closet maria announced as she hustled keenan into the kitchen the thieves must have hidden it there its too diabolical she offered him his lunch box kiss keenan grinned and planted a loud smack on her lips i get to be the milk monitor all week its a tough job but i know youre up to it bry the banana peel goes in the trash as she handed him his lunch box she hooked an arm around his throat making him giggle as she kissed him goodbye allison the capital of virginias richmond i think okay after everyone exchanged kisses including colt noted with some amusement bongo cilia held up one hand anyone leaving their umbrella at school will be immediately executed scram they all bolted the door slammed cilia closed her eyes ah another quiet morning at the fletchers colt what can i offer you bacon eggs whiskey ill take the first two reserve the last grinning he took the chair bryant had vacated you put on this show everyday with matinees on saturdays she ruffled her hair again checked the clock on the stove id like to hang around with you guys but ive got to get ready for work ive got a meeting in an hour if you find yourself at loose ends colt stop by the radio station ill show you around i might just do that maria do you need me to pick up anything no senora she already had the bacon sizzling gracias i should be home by six cilia paused by the table to run a hand over her husbands shoulder i hear theres a big poker game here tonight thats the rumor boyd tugged his wife down to him and colt saw their lips curve before they met you taste pretty good oroarke strawberry jelly catch you later slick she gave him one last lingering kiss before she left him colt listened to her race up the stairs you hit the bullseye didnt you fletch hmm terrific wife great kids and the first time out looks that way i guess i knew cilia was it for me almost from the first remembering made him smile took a little while to convince her she couldnt live without me though it was tough not to envy that particular smile colt mused you and althea you were partners when you met cilia right yeah all three of us were working nights in those days thea was the first woman id ever partnered with turned out to be the best cop id ever partnered with as well i have to ask you dont have to answer but i have to ask and how best to pose the question colt wondered as he picked up a fork and tapped it on the edge of the table you and thea before cilia there was nothing personal theres plenty personal when youre partners working together sometimes around the clock he picked up his coffee his smile easy but there was nothing romantic if thats what youre dancing around its none of my business colt shrugged annoyed by just how much boyds answer relieved him i was curious curious why i didnt try to move in on a woman with her looks her brains her whats the best word for it amused by colts obvious discomfort he chuckled as maria silently served their breakfast thanks maria well call it style for lack of something better its simple colt im not going to say i didnt think about it could be thea gave it a couple moments of her time too but we clicked as partners we clicked as friends and it just didnt take us down any of those other alleys he scooped up some eggs arched a brow you thinking about it colt moved his shoulders again toyed with his bacon i cant say weve clicked as partners or as friends for that matter but i figure weve already turned down one of those other alleys boyd didnt pretend to be surprised anyone who said oil and water didnt mix just hadnt stirred them up enough there are some women who get under your skin some that get into your head and some who do both yeah so whats the story on her shes a good cop a person you can trust like anybody else shes got some baggage but she carries it well if you want to know personal stuff youll have to ask her he lifted his cup and shed get the same answer from me about you has she asked nope boyd sipped to hide his grin now why dont you tell me your progress in finding liz we got a tip on the place on second avenue but theyd already split it still frustrated him the whole bloody business frustrated him figured id talk to the apartment manager the neighbors theres a witness who might be able to id one or more of our movie moguls thats a good start anything i can do to help ill let you know theyve already had her a couple of weeks fletch im going to get her back he lifted his gaze and the quiet rage in it left no room for doubt what worries me is what shape shell be in when i do take it one step at a time that sounds like the lieutenant colt preferred to take leaps rather than steps i cant hook up with her until later this afternoon shes in court or something in court boyd frowned then nodded right the marsten trial armed robbery assault she made a good collar on that one do you want me to send a uniform with you to second avenue no id just as soon handle it myself it was good to be back on his own colt decided working alone meant you didnt have to worry about stepping on your partners toes or debating strategy and as far as althea was concerned it meant he didnt have to work overtime trying to keep himself from thinking of her as a woman first he rousted the apartment manager nieman a short balding man who obviously thought his position required him to wear a threepiece suit a brutally knotted tie and an ocean of pinescented aftershave ive already given my statement to the other officer he informed colt through the twoinch crack provided by the security chain on his door now youll have to give it to me colt saw no need to disabuse nieman of the notion that he was with the police do you want me to shout my questions from out in the hall mr nieman no nieman shot the chain back clearly annoyed havent i already had enough trouble i was hardly out of my bed this morning before you people were banging on my door now the phone has been ringing off the hook with tenants calling demanding to know what the police are doing sealing off the penthouse the resulting publicity will take weeks for me to defuse you got a real tough job mr nieman colt scanned the apartment as he entered it wasnt as plush or as large as the empty penthouse but it would do in a pinch nieman had furnished it in fussy french rococo colt knew his mother would have adored it you cant imagine it resigned nieman gestured toward an ornately carved chair tenants are such children really they need someone to guide them someone to slap their hands when they break the rules ive been a resident apartment manager for ten years three in this building and the stories i could tell because colt was afraid he would do just that he cut nieman off why dont you tell me about the penthouse tenants theres very little i can tell nieman plucked at the knees of his slacks before sitting he crossed his legs at the ankles and revealed patterned argyle socks as i explained to the other detective i never actually met them they were only here four months dont you show the apartment to tenants mr nieman take their applications as a rule certainly in this particular case the tenant sent references and a certified check for first and last months rent via the mail is it usual for you to rent an apartment that way not usual no after clearing his throat nieman fiddled with the knot of his tie the letter was followed up with a phone call mr davis the tenant explained that he was a friend of mr and mrs ellison they had the penthouse before for three years lovely couple elegant taste they moved to boston as hed been acquainted with them he had no need to view the apartment he claimed to have attended several dinner parties and other affairs in the penthouse he was quite anxious to have it you see and as his references were impeccable you checked them out of course lips pursed nieman drew himself up i take my responsibilities seriously what did this davis do for a living hes an engineer with a local firm when i contacted the firm they had nothing but the highest regard for him what firm i still have the file out nieman reached to the coffee table for a slim folder foxx engineering he began then recited the address and phone number naturally i contacted his landlord as well we apartment managers have a code of ethics i was assured that mr davis was an ideal tenant quiet responsible tidy and that his rent was always timely this proved to be the case but you never actually saw mr davis this is a large building there are several tenants i dont see its the troublemakers you meet regularly and mr davis was never any trouble never any trouble colt thought grimly as he completed the slow process of doortodoor he carried with him copies of the lease the references and daviss letter it was past noon and hed already interviewed most of the tenants whod answered his knock only three of them claimed to have seen the mysterious mr davis colt now had three markedly different descriptions to add to his file the police seal on the penthouse door had barred his entrance he could have picked the lock and cut the tape but hed doubted hed find anything worthwhile so hed started at the top and was working his way down he was currently canvassing the third floor with a vicious case of frustration and the beginnings of a headache he knocked at and felt himself being sized up through the peephole the chain rattled the bolt turned now he was being sized up facetoface by an old woman with a wild mop of hair dyed an improbable orange she had bright blue eyes that sprayed into dozens of wrinkles as she squinted to peer at him her denver broncos sweatshirt was the size of a tent covering what colt judged to be two hundred pounds of pure bulk she had two chins and was working on a third youre too goodlooking to be selling something i dont want no maam if colt had had a hat hed have tipped it im not selling anything at all the police are conducting an investigation id like to ask you a few questions regarding some of your neighbors in the building are you a cop youd have a badge if you were it looked as though she were a great deal sharper than nieman no maam im not a cop im working privately a detective the blue eyes brightened like light bulbs like sam spade i swear that humphrey bogart was the sexiest man ever born if id have been mary astor i wouldnt have thought twice about some dumb bird when i could have had him no maam it took colt a moment but he finally caught on to her reference to the maltese falcon i kind of went for lauren bacall myself they sure did set things humming in the big sleep pleased she let out a loud lusty laugh damned if they didnt well come on in no use standing here in the doorway colt entered and immediately had to start dodging furniture and cats the apartment was packed with both tables chairs lamps some of them superior antiques others yardsale rejects were set helterskelter throughout the wide living room half a dozen cats of al descriptions were curled draped and stretched out with equal abandon i collect she told him then plopped herself down on a louis xv love seat her girth took up threequarters of the cushions so colt wisely chose a ratty armchair with a faded pattern of colonial soldiers fighting redcoats im esther mavis colt nightshade colt took it philosophically when a lean gray cat sprang into his lap and another leapt onto a wing of the chair to sniff at his hair well just what are we investigating mr nightshade were doing a check on the tenant who occupied the penthouse the one who just moved out she scratched one of her chins saw a bunch of burly men carrying stuff out to a van yesterday so had several other people colt thought no one had bothered to note whether the van had carried the name of a moving company did you notice what kind of van mrs mavis miss she told him a big one they didnt act like any movers i ever saw oh they worked fast not like people who get paid by the hour you know moved out some good pieces too her bright eyes scanned her living room i like furniture there was this belker table id have liked to get my hands on dont know where id put it but i always find room could you describe any of the movers dont notice men unless theres something special about them she winked slyly how about mr davis did you ever see him cant say for sure i dont know most of the people in the building by name me and my cats keep to ourselves what did he do were looking into it playing it close to the vest huh well bogey wouldve done the same so hes moved out it looks that way i guess i wont be able to give him his package then package just came yesterday messenger brought it dropped it here by mistake davis mavis she shook her head people dont pay enough attention to details these days i know what you mean colt cautiously plucked a cat from his shoulder what sort of a package miss mavis a package package with a few grunts and whistles she hauled herself to her feet put it back in the bedroom meant to take it up to him today she moved with a kind of tanklike grace through the narrow passages between the furniture and came back with a sealed padded bag maam id like to take that with me if you have a problem with that you can call captain boyd fletcher denver pd no skin off my nose she handed colt the package maybe when youve cracked the case youll come let me know whats what ill just do that on impulse he took out the photo of liz have you seen this girl miss mavis looked at it frowned over it then shook her head no not that i recollect is she in trouble yes maam does it have something to do with upstairs i think so she handed the photo back shes a pretty little thing i hope you find her real soon so do i it wasnt his usual operating procedure colt couldnt have said why he made the exception why he felt he had to instead of opening the package and dealing with its contents immediately he left it sealed and drove to the courthouse he was just in time to hear the defenses cross of althea she was dressed in a rustcolored suit that should have been dull instead the effect was subtly powerful with her vibrant hair twisted up off her neck and a single strand of pearls at her throat colt took a seat at the back of the courtroom and watched as she competently patiently and devastatingly ripped the defense to shreds she never raised her voice never stumbled over words anyone looking or listening including the jury would have judged her a cool detached professional and so she was colt mused as he stretched out his legs and waited certainly no one watching her now would imagine her flaming like a rocket in a mans arms his arms no one would picture this tidy controlled woman arching and straining as a mans hands his hands raced over her but he was damned if he could forget it and studying her now when she was unaware of him and completely focused on the job at hand he began to notice other things little things she was tired he could see it in her eyes now and again there was the faintest whisper of impatience in her voice as she was called on to repeat herself she shifted crossing her legs it was a smooth movement economical as always but he sensed something else beneath it not nerves he realized restlessness she wanted this over with when the cross was complete the judge called for a fifteenminute recess she winced as the gavel struck it was just a flicker of a movement across her face but he caught it jack holmsby caught her arm before she could move by him nice job thea thanks you shouldnt have any trouble nailing him im not worried about it he shifted just enough to block her path listen im sorry things didnt work out the other night why dont we give it another shot say dinner tomorrow night just you and me she waited a beat not so much amazed by his gall as fatigued by it jack do the words no way in hell have any meaning for you he only laughed and gave her arm an intimate little squeeze for one wild moment she considered decking him and taking the rap for assault come on althea id like a chance to make it up to you jack we both know youd like a chance to make me and it isnt going to happen now let go of my arm while were both on the same side of the law theres no need to be lieutenant colt drawled out the word he let his gaze sweep over holmsby got a minute nightshade it annoyed the hell out of her that hed witnessed the little tussle excuse me jack ive got work to do she strode out of the courtroom leaving colt to follow if youve got something thats worth my time spill it she ordered im not real pleased with lawyers at the moment darling i dont have any briefs with me except the ones im wearing youre a riot nightshade you look like a lady who could use a laugh he took her arm and felt his own temper peak when she stiffened battling it down he steered her toward the doors my cars out front why dont we take a ride while we catch up fine i walked over from the precinct you can take me back right he found another ticket on his windshield not surprising since hed parked in a restricted zone he pocketed it and climbed in sorry i interrupted your mating ritual kiss my butt she snapped her seat belt into place lieutenant ive been dreaming of doing just that reaching over he popped open the glove compartment this time she didnt stiffen at the contact only seemed to withdraw here what she glanced down at the bottle of aspirin for your headache im fine it wasnt exactly a lie she thought what she had couldnt be termed a mere headache it was more like a freight train highballing behind her eyes i hate a martyr leave me alone she closed her eyes and effectively cut him off she was far from fine she hadnt slept over the years shed become accustomed to rolling on two or three hours a night but last night she hadnt slept at all and she was too proud to lay the blame where it belonged right at colts door shed thought of him and shed berated herself shed run over the impossible scene in the penthouse and shed ached then shed berated herself again shed tried a hot bath a boring book yoga warm brandy nothing had done the trick so shed tossed and turned and eventually shed crawled out of bed to roam restlessly through her apartment and shed watched the sun come up since dawn shed worked it was now slightly past one and shed been on the job for nearly eight hours without a break and what made it worse what made it next to intolerable was that she could very well be stuck with colt for another eight she opened her eyes again when he stopped with a jerk of brakes they were parked in front of a convenience store i need something he muttered and slammed out fine terrific she thought and shut her eyes again dont bother to ask if maybe i need something like a chain saw to slice off my head for instance she heard him coming back odd she mused that she recognized the sound of his stride the click of his boot heels after so short a time in defense or simply out of obstinacy she kept her eyes shut here he pushed something against her hand tea he told her when she opened her eyes to stare down at the paper cup to wash down the aspirin he popped the top on the bottle himself and shook out the medication now take the damn pills althea and eat this you probably havent eaten anything all day unless its chocolate bits or candied nuts ive never seen a woman pick her way through a pound bag of candy the way you do sugars loaded with energy but she took the pills and the tea the package of cheese and crackers earned a frown didnt they have any cupcakes you need protein theres probably protein in cupcakes the tea was too strong and quite bitter but it helped nonetheless thanks she sipped again then broke down and opened the package of crackers it was important to remember that she was responsible for her own actions her own reactions and her own emotions if she hadnt slept it was her own problem the lab boys should have finished at the penthouse by now they have ive been there she muttered over a mouthful id rather you didnt go off on your own i cant please everybody so i please myself i talked to the little weasel who manages the place he never set eyes on the topfloor tenant while althea chewed her way through the impromptu meal he filled her in i knew about davis she told him when he finished i got nieman out of bed this morning already called the references phone disconnect on both there is no foxx engineering at that address or at any other address in denver same for the apartment davis used as a reference mr and mrs ellison the former tenants have never heard of him youve been busy watching her he tapped a finger on the steering wheel what was that you meant about not going off on your own she smiled a little the headache was backing off i carry a badge she said deadpan you dont your badge didnt get you into miss maviss apartment should it have i think so darkly pleased to be one up on her colt reached into the back and showed althea the package messenger delivered it to the cat lady by mistake cat lady you had to be there uhuh he snatched it out of reach as she made a move toward it my take darling im willing to share her temper spiked then leveled off when she noticed that the package was still intact its still sealed seemed fair he said meeting her eyes i figured we should open it together looks like you figured right this time lets have a look colt reached down and drew a knife out of his boot as he slit open the package althea narrowed her eyes i dont think that toys under the legal limit champ nope he said easily and slid the knife back into his boot reaching into the package he pulled out a videotape and a single sheet of paper final edit okay for dupes heavy snows expected by weekend supplies good next drop send extra tapes and beer roads may be closed althea held the sheet by a corner then dug a plastic bag out of her purse well have it checked for prints we could get lucky it might tell us who it wont tell us where colt slid the tape back into the bag want to go to the movies yeah althea set the bag on her lap tapped it but i think this one calls for a private screening ive got a vcr at home she also had a comfortable couch crowded with cushy pillows gleaming hardwood floors were accented by navaho rugs the art deco prints on the walls should have been at odds with the southwestern touches but they werent neither were the homey huddle of lush green plants on the curvy iron tea cart the two goldfish swimming in a tubeshaped aquarium or the footstool fashioned to resemble a squat grinning gnome interesting place was the best colt could do it does the job she walked to a chromeandglass entertainment center stepping out of her shoes on the way colt decided that single gesture told him more about althea grayson than a dozen indepth reports would have with her usual efficiency she popped in the tape and flicked both the vcr and tv on there was no need to fastforward past the fbi warning because there wasnt one after a fivesecond lag the tape faded from gray and the show began even for a man with colts experience it was a surprise he tucked his hands in his pockets and rocked back on his heels it was foolish he supposed seeing as they were both adults both professionals but he felt an undeniable tug of embarrassment i ah guess they dont believe in whetting the audiences appetite althea tilted her head studying the screen with a clinical detachment it wasnt lovemaking it wasnt even sex according to her definition it was straight porn more pathetic than titillating ive seen hotter stuff at bachelor parties colt took his eyes from the screen long enough to arch a brow her oh really tapes surprisingly good quality and the camera work if you can call it that seems pretty professional she listened to the moans sound too she nodded as the camera pulled back for a long shot not the penthouse must be the place in the mountains highclass rustic from the paneling bed looks like a chippendale how do you know my mothers big on antiques look at the lamp by the bed its tiffany or a damn fine imitation ah the plot thickens they both watched as another woman walked into the frame a few lines of dialogue indicated that she had come upon her lover and her best friend the confrontation turned violent i dont think thats fake blood althea hissed through her teeth as the first woman took a hard blow to the face and i dont think she was expecting that punch colt swore softly as the rest of the scene unfolded the mixture of sex and violence violence that was focused on the women made an ugly picture he had to clench his fists to keep himself from slamming the television off it was no longer a matter of amused embarrassment it was a matter of revulsion you handling this nightshade althea laid a hand on his arm they both knew what he feared most that liz would come onscreen i dont guess ill be wanting any popcorn instinctively althea left her hand where it was and moved closer there was a plot of sorts and she began to follow it a weekend at a ski chalet two couples who mixed and mingled in several ways she moved beyond that picking up the details the furnishings colt had been right they were firstclass different camera angles showed that it was a twostory with an open loft and high beamed ceilings stone fireplace hot tub in a few artistic shots she saw that it was snowing lightly she caught glimpses of screening trees and snowcapped peaks in one outdoor scene that must have been more than uncomfortable for the actors she noted that there was no other house or structure close by the tape ended without credits and without liz colt didnt know whether he was relieved or not i dont think its got much of a shot in the oscar race althea kept her voice light as she rewound the tape you okay he wasnt okay there was a burning in his gut that needed some sort of release they were rough on the women he said carefully really vicious offhand id say the main customers for this kind of thing would be guys who fantasize about dominance physical and emotional i dont think you can apply the word fantasy in conjunction with something like this not all fantasies are pretty she murmured thinking you know the quality was good but some of the acting and i use the term loosely was downright pitiful could be they let some of their clients live out those fantasies on film lovely he took one careful cleansing breath jades letter mentioned that she thought one of the girls had been killed looks like she might have been right sadisms a peculiar sexual tool and one that can often get out of hand we might be able to make the general area from the outside shots she started to eject the tape but he whirled her around how can you be so damn clinical didnt that get to you doesnt anything whatever does i deal with it lets leave personalities out of this no it goes back to knowing who youre working with were talking about the fact that some girl might have been killed for the camera there was a fury in him that he couldnt control and a terrible need to vent it weve just seen two women slapped shoved punched and threatened with worse i want to know what watching that did to you it made me sick she snapped back jerking away and it made me angry and if id let myself it would have made me sad but all that matters all that really matters is that we have our first piece of hard evidence she snatched out the tape and replaced it in its bag now if you want to do me a favor youll drop me back at the precinct so that i can turn this over then you can give me some space sure lieutenant he strode to the door to yank it open ill give you all the space you need chapter contents prev next colt was holding three ladies and he thought it was really too bad that the lady he wanted was sitting across the table from him upping his bet theres your twentyfive nightshade and twentyfive more althea tossed chips into the kitty she held her cards close to her vest like her thoughts ah well sweeney heaved a sigh and studied the trash in his hand as if wishing alone might turn it to gold too rich for my blood from her seat between sweeney and a forensic pathologist named louie cilia considered her pair of fives what do you think deadeye keenan dressed for bed in a denver nuggets jersey bounced on her lap throw the money in easy for you to say but her chips clattered onto the pile after a personal debate that included a great deal of muttering shifting and head shaking louie tossed in his chips as well ill see your twentyfive colt drawled he kept his cigar clamped between his teeth as he counted out chips and bump it again boyd just grinned pleased that hed folded after the draw the bet made the rounds again with only althea cilia and colt remaining in three pretty queens he announced and laid down his cards altheas eyes glinted when they met his nice but we dont have room for them in my full house she spread her cards revealing three eights and a pair of deuces that puts my two fives to shame cilia sighed as althea raked in the pot okay kid you cost me seventyfive cents now you have to die she hauled a giggling keenan up as she rose daddy he spread his arms and grinned help me dont let her do it sorry son boyd ruffled keenans hair and gave him a solemn kiss looks like youre doomed were going to miss you around here always ready to prolong the inevitable keenan hooked his arms around colts neck save me colt kissed the waiting lips and shook his head only one thing in this world scares me partner and thats a mama youre on your own levering in cilias arms the boy made the rounds of the table when he got to althea his eyes gleamed okay can i it was an old game one she was willing to play for a nickel i can owe you you already owe me eight thousand dollars and fifteen cents i get my allowance friday okay then she took him onto her lap for a hug and he sniffed her hair like a puppy colt saw her face soften watched her hand slide up to stroke the tender nape of the boys neck its good keenan announced taking one last exaggerated sniff dont forget that eight thousand on friday now beat it after a kiss she passed him back to cilia deal me out cilia suggested and settling her son on her hip she carried him upstairs to bed a boy who can talk his way into a womans laps a boy to be proud of sweeney grinned as he gathered the cards my deal ante up during the next hour altheas pile of chips grew slowly steadily she enjoyed the monthly poker games that had become a routine shortly after cilia and boyd were married the basic challenge of outwitting her opponents relaxed her almost as much as the domestic atmosphere that had seeped into every corner of the fletcher home she was a cautious player one who gambled only when satisfied with the odds and who bet meticulously thoughtfully even then she noted that colts pile multiplied as well but in fits and starts he wasnt reckless she decided ruthless was the word often he bumped the pot when he had nothing or sat back and let others do the raising when he had a handful of gold no pattern she mused which she supposed was a pattern of its own after sweeney won a piddling pot with a heart flush she pushed back from the table anybody want a beer everybody did althea strolled into the kitchen and began to pop tops she was pouring herself a glass of wine when colt walked in thought you could use some help i can handle it i dont figure theres much you cant handle damn the woman was prickly he thought i just thought id lend a hand maria had prepared enough sandwiches to satisfy a hungry platoon on a long march for lack of anything better to do colt shifted some from platter to plate he had to get it out he decided now that they were alone and he had the opportunity he wasnt sure how to start ive got something to say about this afternoon oh her tone frosty althea turned to the refrigerator and took out a bowl of marias incomparable guacamole dip im sorry and nearly dropped it excuse me damn it im sorry okay he hated to apologize it meant he had made a mistake one that mattered watching that tape got to me it made me want to smash something someone the closest i could come to it was ripping into you because it was the last thing she would have expected she was caught off guard she stood with the bowl in her hand unsure of her next move all right i was afraid id see liz he continued compelled to say it all i was afraid i wouldnt at a loss he picked up one of the opened beers and took a long swallow im not used to being scared like this there was very little he could have said and nothing he could have done that would have gotten through her defenses more thoroughly touched and shaken she set the bowl on the counter and opened a bag of chips i know it got to me too its not supposed to but it did she poured the chips into the bowl wishing there was something else she could do anything else im sorry things arent moving faster colt they havent been standing still either and ive got you to thank for most of that he lifted a hand then dropped it thea there was something else i wanted to do this afternoon besides punching somebody i wanted to hold you he saw the wariness flash into her eyes quick as a heartbeat and had to grind down his temper not jump you thea hold you theres a difference yes there is she let out a long quiet breath there was need in his eyes not desire just need the need for contact for comfort for compassion that she understood i guess i could have used it too i still could it cost him to make the first move this sort of move but he stepped toward her and held out his arms it cost her as well to respond to move into his arms and encircle him with her own and when they were close when her cheek was resting against his shoulder and his against her hair they both sighed the tension drained away like water through a broken dam he didnt understand it wasnt sure he could accept it but he realized it felt right very simply right unlike the first time hed held her there was no punch of lust no molten fire in his blood but there was a warmth sweet and spreading and solid he could have held her like that just like that for hours she didnt often let herself relax so completely not with a man and certainly not with a man who attracted her but this was so easy so natural the steady thudding of his heart lulled her she nearly nuzzled the urge was there to rub her cheek against him to close her eyes and purr when she felt him sniffing her hair she laughed the kids right he murmured its good thats going to cost you a nickel nightshade put it on my tab he told her as she lifted her head to smile at him was it because shed never looked at him quite that way that it hit him so hard he couldnt be sure all he knew was that she was outrageously beautiful her hair loose and tumbling into his hands glinting like flame in the hard kitchen light her eyes were smiling deep and tawny and warm with humor and her mouth unpainted curved slightly parted irresistible he tilted his head lowered it waiting for her to stiffen or draw back she did neither though the humor in her eyes had turned to awareness the warmth remained so he touched his lips to hers gently testing an experiment in emotions with their eyes open they watched each other as if each were waiting for the other to move back or leap forward when she remained pliant in his arms he changed the angle nipping lightly he felt her tremble only once as her eyes darkened clouded but they remained open and on his she wanted to see him needed to she was afraid that if she closed her eyes she might fall into whatever pit it was that yawned before her she had to see who he was to try to understand what there was about this one man that made him capable of turning her system to mush no one had done so before and shed been proud of her ability to resist or to control and smugly amused by men and women who fell under the spell of another in falling they had suffered the torments of love she had never been certain the joys balanced those torments but as he deepened the kiss slowly persuasively deepened it so that not only her lips but also her mind her heart her body were involved in that contact she wondered what she had missed by never allowing surrender to mix with power althea he whispered her name as he again teasingly changed the angle of the kiss come with me she understood what he was asking he wanted her to let go to tumble with him wherever the moment took them to yield to him even as he yielded to her to gamble when she wasnt sure of the odds he closed his eyes first the soft drowsy warmth slid seamlessly into a numbing ache an ache that was all pleasure her eyes fluttered closed on a sigh hey how about those beers oops boyd winced and struggled not to grin he slipped his hands into his pockets and had to prevent himself from whistling a tune as his old friend and his former partner jumped apart like thieves caught in a bust sorry guys he strolled over to gather up the beer bottles himself it occurred to him that in all the years hed known althea hed never seen that bemused punchdrunk look on her face must be something about this kitchen he added as he headed for the door cant tell you how many times ive found myself occupied the same way in here the door swung shut behind him althea blew out a long breath oh boy was the best she could manage colt laid a hand on her shoulder not for balance he assured himself though his legs were weak just to keep things nice and light he looked pretty damned pleased with himself didnt he hell razz me about this she muttered and hell tell cilia so she can razz me too theyve probably got better things to do theyre married she shot back married people love talking about other peoples other peoples what stuff the more unraveled she became the more colt liked it he was positive that only a privileged few had ever seen the cool lieutenant flustered he wanted to savor every moment of the experience grinning he leaned back against the counter so if you really want to drive them crazy you could let me come home with you tonight in your dreams nightshade he lifted a brow her voice hadnt been quite steady he liked that a whole lot well theres truth in that darling might as well be straight and tell you im not willing to wait much longer to turn that dream into reality she needed to calm down needed to do something with her hands killing two birds with one stone she picked up her wine and sipped is that a threat althea there was a world of patience in his voice that amused him he couldnt recall ever having been patient about anything before we both know what just went on here cant be turned into a threat it was nice he flicked a finger down her hair if wed been alone somewhere it would have turned out a lot nicer the intent flickered in his eyes too quickly for her to avoid the result his hand fisted in her hair held her still i want you althea and i want you bad you can make out of that whatever you choose she felt a skip of something sprint down her spine it wasnt fear shed been a cop long enough to recognize fear in all its forms and shed lived her life her own way long enough to remain cautious it seems to me that you want a great many things you want liz back you want the men responsible for keeping her from her parents caught and punished you want to do those things your way with my cooperation and she sipped her wine again her eyes cool and level you want to go to bed with me she was amazing colt reflected she had to be feeling some portion of the need and the desperation he was experiencing yet she might have been discussing a change in the weather that about sums it up why dont you tell me what you want she was afraid she knew exactly what she wanted and it was standing almost close enough to taste the difference between you and me nightshade is that i know you dont always get what you want now im going to pack it in ive had a long day you can check with me tomorrow well have the sketches from meena something might turn up when we run them all right hed let her go for now he thought the trouble with a woman like althea he mused was that a man would always be tempted to seduce her and he would always crave her coming to him freely thea she paused at the kitchen door looked back yes what are we going to do about this she felt a sigh building not one of weariness one of longing and choked it off i dont know she said as truthfully as she could i wish i did by ninethirty the following morning colt was cooling his heels in altheas office there wasnt much room in her cubbyhole to cool anything out of sheer boredom he flipped through some of the papers on her desk reports he noted in that peculiar language cops used a language that was both concise and florid vehicles proceeded in a southwesterly direction alleged perpetrators created disturbances arresting officers apprehended suspects after responding to s and s she wrote a damn good report if you were into such bureaucratic hogwash which he decided she obviously was rulesandregulations grayson he thought and closed the file maybe his biggest problem was that hed seen that there was a lot more to her than the straightarrow cop hed seen her hold a gun steady as a rock while her eyes were alive with fear and determination hed felt her respond like glory to an impulsive and urgent embrace hed watched her cuddle a child soften with compassion and freeze like a hailstone hed seen too much and he knew he hadnt seen nearly enough liz was his priority had to be yet althea remained lodged inside him like a bullet in the flesh hot painful and impossible to ignore it made him angry it made him itchy and when she swept into the room it made him snarl ive been waiting for the best part of a damn hour i havent got time for this thats a shame she dropped another file onto her desk noting immediately that her papers had been disturbed could be youre watching too much tv nightshade thats the only place a cop gets to work on one case at a time im not a cop thats more than obvious and next time you have to wait for me keep your nose out of my papers listen lieutenant he broke off swearing when her phone rang grayson she slipped into her chair as she spoke her hand already reaching for a pencil yeah yeah i got it that was quick work sergeant i appreciate it ill be sure to do that if i get over your way thanks again she broke the connection and immediately began to dial again kansas city located jades mother she told colt shed moved from the kansas side to missouri is jade with her thats what im going to try to find out as she completed the call althea checked her watch she waits tables at night odds are ill catch her at home at this hour before colt could speak again althea shot up a hand for silence hello id like to speak with janice willowby a sleepy and obviously irritated voice informed her that janice didnt live there is this mrs willowby mrs willowby this is lieutenant grayson denver police no maam she hasnt done anything she isnt in any trouble we believe she might be of some help to us on a case have you heard from your daughter in the last few weeks she listened patiently as the woman denied having been in contact with janice and irritably demanded information mrs willowby janice isnt a fugitive from justice or under any sort of suspicion however we are anxious to contact her her eyes hardened quickly coldly excuse me since im not asking you to turn your daughter in i dont see a reward as being applicable if colt thrust a hand over the receiver five thousand he stated if she gets us jade and jade leads us to liz he saw the spitting denial in her eyes but held firm its not up to you the rewards private althea sucked in her disgust mrs willowby there is a private party authorizing the sum of five thousand for information on janice on the condition that this then results in the satisfactory close of the investigation yes im quite sure you can have it in cash oh yes im sure you will see what you can do you can reach me twentyfour hours a day at this number she repeated it twice collect of course thats lieutenant althea grayson denver i hope you do after hanging up the phone she sat simmering its no wonder girls like jade take off and end up on the streets she didnt give a damn about her daughter just wanted to be sure no backlash was going to come her way if jade had been in any trouble shed have been willing to trade her for cash in the blink of an eye not everybody has the maternal instincts of donna reed youre telling me because emotions would interfere with the job at hand althea shelved them meenas been working with the police artist and shes come up with some pretty good likenesses one of them matches one of the stars from the production we watched yesterday which one the guy in the red leather gstring were running a make through vice to start itll take time i dont have time she set aside the pencil folded her hands she wouldnt lose her temper she promised herself not again do you have a better way no he turned away then swung back any prints on the car used to hit billings clean the penthouse no prints some hair fibers they wont help us catch them but theyll be good for tying it up in court the labs working on the tape and the note we could get lucky how about missing persons a jane doe at the morgue jade said she thought one of the girls was killed nothings turned up if they did kill someone and shed been in the life for a while a missingpersons reports unlikely ive checked all the unidentified and suspicious deaths over the last three months nobody fits the profile any luck in the homeless shelters runaway hostels halfway houses not yet she hesitated then decided it was best that they talk it through theres something ive been kicking around go ahead kick it my way weve got a couple of babyfaces on the force good cops we can put them undercover out on the street see if they get a movie offer colt rolled it around in his head that too would take time he mused but at least it was a chance its a tricky spot do you have anyone good enough to handle it i said i did id do it myself no his abrupt denial was like the lash of a whip althea inclined her head and continued without a flinch i said id do it myself but i cant pass for a teenager apparently our producer prefers kids ill set it in motion okay can you get me a dupe of the tape she smiled evenings too dull for you very funny can you she thought it through it wasnt strictly procedure but it couldnt do any harm ill check with the lab meanwhile im going to roust the bartender at clancys im betting hes the one who tipped off the bunch on second avenue we might sweat something out of him ill go with you she shook her head im taking sweeney she smiled fully easily a big irish cop a bar called clancys it just seems to fit hes a lousy poker player yeah but a darlin man she said surprising him by slipping into a perfect irish brogue how about i go along anyway how about you wait for me to call you she rose pulled a navy blazer from the back of her chair she wore pleated slacks of the same color and texture and a paler blue blouse in a silky material her shoulder harness and weapon looked so natural on her they might have been fashion accessories you will call me i said i would because it seemed right he laid his hands on her shoulders and briefly rested his brow on hers marleen called me this morning i dont like to think i was giving her false hope but i told her we were getting closer i had to tell her that whatever eases her mind is the right thing to say she couldnt help it she pressed a hand briefly to his cheek in comfort then let it drop hang tough nightshade weve gathered a lot of information in a short amount of time yeah he lifted his head and slid his hands down her arms until he could link fingers with her ill let you go find your intimidating irishman but theres one more thing he raised their linked hands studying the contrast of texture tone and size sooner or later well be going off the clock his gaze shifted to meet hers then well have to deal with other things then well deal with them but you may not like the way it shakes down he caught her chin in one hand kissed her hard then released her before she could do more than hiss same goes you be careful out there lieutenant i was born careful nightshade she walked away shrugging into the blazer as she went ten hours later she parked her car in her buildings garage and headed for the elevator she was ready for a hot bath pregnant with bubbles a glass of icy white wine and some slow blues heavy on the bass as she rode to her floor she leaned against the back wall and shut her eyes they hadnt gotten very far with the bartender leo dorsetti bribes hadnt worked and veiled threats hadnt either althea didnt doubt he had connections with the pornography ring nor did she doubt that he was worried that the same fate might befall him that had wild bill so she needed more than a threat she needed to dig up something on leo dorsetti something solid enough that she could drag him downtown and into interrogation once she had him she could crack him she was damn sure of that she jingled her keys as she walked through the open elevator doors and into the hall now it was time to put the cop on hold at least for an hour or two obsessing over a case usually equaled making mistakes on a case so shed pack it away into a corner of her mind let it sit let it ripen while the woman indulged in a purely selfish evening shed already unlocked the door pushed it open when the alarm went off in her head she didnt question what tripped it just whipped out her weapon automatically she followed standard entry procedure checking in corners and behind the door her eyes scanned the room noting that nothing was out of place unless she counted the bessie smith record currently playing on the turntable and the scent she took a quick whiff identifying cooking something spicy it made her mouth water in response even as her mind stayed alert a sound from the kitchen had her whirling in that direction ending in the spreadlegged police stance her weapon steady in both hands colt stopped in the doorway wiping his hands on a dishcloth smiling he leaned back against the jamb hi there darling and how was your day chapter contents prev next althea lowered her gun she didnt raise her voice the words she chose quiet and precise made her feelings known with more clarity than a shout could have when shed finished colt could only shake his head in admiration i dont believe ive ever been cussed out with more style now id be obliged if youd holster that gun not that i figure youd use it and risk getting blood all over your floor it might be worth it she slapped her gun back in place but her eyes never left his you have the right to remain silent she began wisely colt stifled a chuckle he held up a hand whatre you doing im reading you your rights before i haul your butt in for nighttime breaking and entering he didnt doubt shed do it shed have him booked fingerprinted and photographed without breaking stride ill waive them providing you listen to an explanation it better be good shrugging out of her blazer she tossed it over the back of the chair how did you get in here i ah through the door her eyes narrowed you have the right to an attorney obviously humor wasnt going to do the trick okay im busted he tossed up both hands in a gesture of surrender i picked the lock its a damn good one too or maybe im getting rusty you picked the lock she nodded as if it were no more than shed expected you carry a concealed weapon an asp ninemillimeter good eye lieutenant and a knife that likely exceeds the legal limit she continued now it appears you also carry lock picks they come in handy and it was something he preferred not to dwell on when she was in this sort of mood now i figured you had a rough day and you deserved coming home to a hot meal and some cold wine i also figured youd be a little testy coming in and finding me here but i have to believe youll come around after youve had a taste of my linguine maybe she thought maybe if she closed her eyes for a minute it would all go away but when she tried it he was still there grinning at her your linguine linguine marinara id claim it was my sainted mothers recipe but she never boiled an egg in her life how about that wine sure why the hell not thats the way he stepped back into the kitchen deciding she could always kill him later althea followed the aromas drifting through the air were heaven you like white he said as he poured two glasses using her best crystal this is a nice fullbodied italian that wont embarrass my sauce bold but classy see if it suits you she accepted the glass allowed him to clink his against hers then sipped the wine tasted like liquid heaven who the hell are you nightshade why im the answer to your prayers why dont we go in and sit down you know you want to take your shoes off she did but she obstinately kept them on as she walked back and lowered herself onto the couch explain i just did if you cannot afford an attorney god youre tough he let out a long breath and stretched out beside her okay i have a couple of reasons one i know youve been putting in a lot of extra time on my business its my job he finished for her maybe but i know when someones taking those extra steps the kind that eat into personal time and fixing you dinners just a way of saying thanks it was a damn nice gesture too she thought though she wasnt willing to say so yet you might have mentioned the idea to me earlier it was an impulse you ever have them dont push your luck nightshade right well to get back to the whys theres also the fact that i havent been able to snatch more than an hour at a time to clear this whole mess out of my head cooking helps me recharge maria wasnt likely to turn her stove over to me so i thought of you he reached out to curl a lock of her hair around his finger i think of you a lot and finally and simply i wanted the evening with you he was getting to her althea wanted to believe that it was the glorious scents sneaking out of the kitchen that were weakening her but she didnt believe it so you broke into my home and invaded my privacy the only thing i poked into was your kitchen cupboards it was tempting he admitted but i didnt go any farther than that frowning althea swirled the wine in her glass i dont like your methods nightshade but i think im going to like your linguine she didnt like it she adored it it was difficult to harbor resentments when her palate was being so thoroughly seduced shed had men cook for her before but she couldnt remember ever being so completely charmed here was colt nightshade very possibly armed to the teeth beneath his faded jeans and chambray shirt serving her pasta by candlelight not that it was romantic she thought she was too smart to fall for any conventional trappings but it was funny and oddly sweet by the time shed worked her way through one helping and was starting on a second shed filled him in on her progress the lab reports were expected within twentyfour hours the bartender at clancys was under surveillance and an undercover officer was being prepped to hit the streets colt filed her information away and traded it for some of his own hed talked to some of the local working girls that afternoon whether due to his charm or to the money that had changed hands hed learned that a girl who went by the street name lacy hadnt been seen in any of her usual haunts for the past several weeks she fits the profile he continued topping off altheas wineglass young tiny girls said she was a brunette but liked to wear a blond wig did she have a pimp uhuh freelancer i went by the rooms shed been renting colt broke a piece of garlic bread in two and passed althea half talked to the landlord a prince of a guy since shed missed a couple of weekly rent payments hed packed up her stuff pawned what was worth anything trashed the rest ill see if anybody at vice knows about her good i hit some of the shelters again he went on the halfway houses showing lizs picture around and the police sketches he frowned toying with the rest of his meal i couldnt get anyone to id had a hard enough time convincing any of the kids that they should look at the pictures most of the kids want to act tough invincible and all you see is the confusion in their eyes when youre dealing with that kind of confusion you have to be tough most of them come from homes that are torn apart by drugs drinking physical and sexual abuse or they got into substance abuse all on their own and dont know how to get out again she moved her shoulders either way running seems like the best way out it wasnt like that for liz no she agreed it was time for him to turn it off as well she decided if only for a few minutes she scraped a last bite from her plate you know nightshade you could give up playing the adventurer and go into catering youd make a fortune he understood what she was doing and he put some effort into accommodating her i prefer small private parties her gaze flicked up to his then back to her glass so if it wasnt your sainted mother who taught you to make worldclass linguine who did we had this terrific irish cook when i was growing up mrs omalley an irish cook who taught you italian cuisine she could make anything from lamb stew to coq au vin colt me boy she used to tell methe best thing a man can do for himself is to learn to feed himself well depending on a woman to fill your bellys a mistake the memory made him grin when id gotten into trouble which was most of the time shed sit me down in the kitchen id get lectures on behavior and the proper way to debone a chicken quite a combination the stuff on behavior didnt stick he toasted her but i make a hell of a chicken pot pie and when mrs omalley retired oh almost ten years ago now my mother went into a dark state of depression altheas lips curved on the rim of her glass and hired another cook a french guy with a bad attitude she loves him a french chef in wyoming i live in wyoming he said they live in houston we get along better that way what about your family are they from around here i dont have one what about your law degree why havent you done anything with it i didnt say i hadnt he studied her for a moment shed certainly dropped his question like a hot coal it was something hed have to come back to i found out i wasnt suited to spending hours hunched over law books trying to outwit justice on technicalities so you went into the air force it was a good way to learn how to fly but youre not a pilot sometimes i am he smiled sorry thea i dont fit into a slot ive got enough money that i can do what suits me when it suits me that wasnt good enough and the military didnt suit you for a while it did then i had enough he shrugged and sat back the candlelight flickered on his face and in his eyes i learned some things just like i learned from mrs omalley and from prep school from harvard and from this old indian horse trainer i met in tulsa some years back you never know when youre going to use what youve learned who taught you to pick locks youre not going to hold that against me are you he leaned forward to flick a finger over her hair and to pour more wine i picked it up in the service i was in what you might call a special detachment covert operations she said translating it was no surprise thats why so much of your records classified its old news should be declassified by now but thats the way of it isnt it bureaucrats like secrets almost as much as they like red tape what i did was gather information or plant information maybe defuse certain volatile situations or stir them up depending on the orders he drank again i guess we could say i started doing favors for people only these people ran the government his lip curled or tried to you dont like the system do you i like what works for an instant only his eyes darkened i saw plenty that didnt work so he shrugged and the mood was gone i got out bought myself a few horses and cows played rancher looks like old habits die hard because now i do favors for people again only now i have to like them first some people might say that youve had a hard time deciding what you want to do when you grow up some people might i figure ive been doing it what about you whats the back story on althea grayson its nothing that would sell to the movies relaxed she rested her elbows on the table running a finger around the rim of her glass until the crystal sang i went straight into the academy when i was eighteen no detours why why a cop she mulled over her answer because i do like the system its not perfect but if you keep at it you can make it work and the law there are people out there who want to make it work too many lives get lost in the cracks it means something when you can pull one out i cant argue with that without thinking about it he laid a hand over hers i could always see that boyd was meant to make law and order work until recently he was about the only cop i respected enough to trust i think you just gave me a compliment you can be sure of it the two of you have a lot in common a clearsightedness a stubborn kind of valor a steady compassion he smiled toying with her fingers the kid we got off the roof i went to see her too she had a lot to say about the pretty lady with the red hair who brought her a baby doll so i did a followup its my job to bull delighted with her response he picked up her hand kissed it it had nothing to do with duty and everything to do with you having a soft side doesnt make you less of a cop thea it just makes you a kinder one she knew where this was leading but she didnt pull her hand away just because i have a soft spot for kids doesnt mean ive got one for you but you do he murmured i get to you watching her he skimmed his lips down to her wrist the pulse there beat steady but it also beat fast im going to keep getting to you maybe you do she was too smart to continue to deny the obvious that doesnt mean anythings going to come of it i dont sleep with every man who attracts me im glad to hear it then again youre going to do a lot more than sleep with me he chuckled and kissed her hand again god i love it when you smirk thea it drives me crazy what i was going to say was when we get each other to bed sleepings not going to be a priority so maybe you should catch some shuteye he rose pulling her to her feet kiss me goodnight and ill let you get some now the surprise in her eyes made him grin again hed wait until later to pat himself on the back for his strategy you thought i cooked you dinner and kept you company so i could use it as a springboard to seduction on a windy sigh he shook his head althea im wounded close to crushed she laughed keeping a friendly hand in his you know nightshade sometimes i almost like you almost see thats just a couple of short steps away from you being nuts about me he gathered her close and the instant twisting in his gut mocked his light tone if id bothered to make dessert youd be begging for me amused she tucked her tongue in her cheek your loss everybody knows cannoli turns me into a wild woman ill sure as hell remember that he kissed her lightly watched her smile and felt his heart turn over there must be a bakery around here where i can pick up some italian pastries nope you missed your shot she brought a hand to his chest telling herself she was going to end the interlude now while she could still feel her legs under her thanks for the pasta sure but he continued to stare down at her his eyes sharpening focusing as if he were struggling to see past the ivory skin the delicate bones something was happening here he realized something internal that he couldnt quite get a grip on you have something in your eyes her nerves were dancing what i dont know he spoke slowly as if measuring each word sometimes i can almost see it when i do it makes me wonder where youve been where were going her lungs were backing up she took a careful breath to clear them you were going home yeah in a minute too easy to tell you youre beautiful he murmured as if speaking to himself you hear that too much and its too superficial to carry any weight with you it should be enough for me but theres something else in there i keep coming back to it still seeking he drew her closer what is it about you althea what is it i cant shake loose theres nothing youre too used to looking for shadows no youve got them slowly he slid a hand up to cup her cheek and what i have is a problem what problem try this he lowered his mouth to hers and had every muscle in her body going lax it wasnt demanding it wasnt urgent it was devastating the kiss tumbled her deeper deeper bombarding her with emotions she had no defense against his feelings were free and ripe and poured over her into her so that she was covered and filled and surrounded by them no escape she thought and heard her own muffled sound of despair with a dull acceptance hed breached a defense she had taken for granted one she might never fully shore up again she could tell herself again and again that she wouldnt fall in love that she couldnt fall in love with a man she hardly knew but her heart was already laughing at logic he felt her give not all the way not yet but give yet another degree of self there was more than heat here though sweet heaven there was heat but there was a kind of discovery as well for colt it was a revelation to discover that one woman this woman could tangle up his mind rip open his heart and leave him helpless im losing ground here he kept his hands firm on her shoulders as he pulled back im losing it fast its too much it was a poor response but the best she could summon youre telling me there was tension in her shoulders again and in his it compelled him to step away ive never felt like this before and thats no line he said when she turned away from him i know i wish it were she gripped the back of the chair where her shoulder holster hung a symbol of duty she thought of control of what she had made of herself colt i think were both getting in deeper than we might like maybe weve been treading water long enough she was very much afraid that she was ready willing even eager to sink i dont let personal business interfere with my job if we cant keep this under control you should consider working with someone else weve been working together just fine he said between his teeth dont pull out any lame excuses because you dont want to face up to whats going on between us its the best ive got her knuckles had turned white on the chair and its not an excuse only a reason you want me to say you scare me all right you scare me this scares me and i dont think you want a partner who cant focus because you make her nervous maybe im happier with that than with one whos so focused its hard to tell if shes human she wasnt going to pull away from him now hed be damned if hed let her dont tell me you cant work on two levels thea or that you cant function as a cop when youve got a problem in your personal life maybe i just dont want to work with you thats tough youre stuck if you want to put this on hold ill try to oblige you but youre not backing off from liz because youre afraid to let yourself feel something for me im thinking about liz and whats best for her how the hell would you know he exploded and if it was unreasonable he didnt give a damn he was on the edge of falling in love with a woman who was calmly telling him she didnt want him in any area of her life he was desperate to find a frightened girl and the person whod helped him make progress toward doing so was threatening to pull out how the hell would you know about her or anyone else youve got yourself so wrapped up in regulations and procedure that you cant feel no not cant wont you wont feel youll risk your life but one brush with emotion and up goes the shield everythings so tidy for you isnt it althea theres some poor scared kid out there but shes just another case for you just another job dont you tell me how i feel her control snapped as she shoved the chair aside clattering to the floor between them dont tell me what i understand you cant possibly know whats inside me do you think you know liz or any of those girls you talked with today youve walked into shelters and halfway houses and you think you understand her eyes glinted not with tears but with a rage so sharp he could only stand and let it slice at him i know there are plenty of kids who need help and not always enough help to go around oh thats so easy she strode across the room and back in a rare show of useless motion write a check pass a bill make a speech its so effortless you havent a clue what its like to be alone to be afraid or to be caught up in that grinding machine we toss displaced kids into i spent most of my life in that machine so dont tell me i dont feel i know what its like to want out so bad you run even when theres no place to go and i know what its like to be yanked back to be helpless to be abused and trapped and miserable i understand plenty and i know that liz has a family that loves her and well get her back to them no matter what well get her back and she wont be caught in that cycle so dont you tell me shes just another case because she matters they all matter she broke off running a shaky hand through her hair at the moment she wasnt sure which was bigger her embarrassment or her anger id like you to go now she said quietly id really like you to go sit down when she didnt respond he walked over and pressed her into a chair she was trembling and the fact that hed played a part in causing that made him feel as if hed punched a hole in something precious and fragile im sorry thats a record for me apologizing to the same person twice in one day he started to brush a hand over her hair but stopped himself do you want some water no i just want you to leave i cant do it he lowered himself to the footstool in front of her so that their eyes were level althea she sat back her eyes shut she felt as though shed raced to the top of a mountain and leapt off nightshade im not in the mood to tell you my life story so if thats what youre waiting for you know where the door is thatll keep he took a chance and reached for her hand it was steady now he noted but cold lets try something else what weve got here are two separate problems finding liz is number one shes an innocent a victim and she needs help i could find her on my own but that would take too long every day that goes by well too many days have gone by already i need you to work with me because you can cut through channels it would take me twice as long to circumvent and because i trust you to put everything youve got into getting her home all right she kept her eyes closed willing the tension away well find her if not tomorrow the next day but well find her second problem he looked down at their hands studying the way the second hand on her watch ticked off the time i think ah and since this is a new area for me i want to qualify it by saying that its only an opinion nightshade she opened her eyes again and there was a ghost of a smile in them i swear you sound just like a lawyer he winced shifted i dont think you should insult a man whos about to tell you hes pretty sure hes in love with you she jolted hed have bet the farm that he could pull a gun and she wouldnt flinch but mention love and she jumped six inches off the chair dont panic he continued while she searched for her voice i said i think that leaves us with a safe area to play with sounds more like a mine field to me because she was afraid it might start shaking again she drew her hand away from his i think it would be wise under the circumstances to table that for the time being now who sounds like a lawyer he grinned not at all sure why it seemed so appropriate to laugh at himself darling you think it puts the fear of god into you picture what it does to me i only brought it up because im hoping thatll make it easier to deal with for all i know its just a touch of the flu or something that would be good she choked back a laugh terrified it would sound giddy get plenty of rest drink fluids ill give that a try he leaned forward not displeased to see the wariness in her eyes or the bracing of her shoulders but if its not the flu or some other bug im going to do something about it whatever that might be can wait until weve settled the first problem until we do i wont bring up love or all the stuff that generally follows along after it you know like marriage and family and a twocar garage for the first time since hed known her he saw her totally at a loss her eyes were huge and her mouth was slack he would have sworn that if he tapped her shed keel over like a sapling in a storm guess its just as well i dont since talking about them in the abstract sense seems to have put you in a coma i she managed to close her mouth swallow then speak i think youve lost your mind me too lord knew why he felt so cheerful about it so for now lets concentrate on digging up those bad guys deal and if i agree youre not going to sneak in any of that other stuff his smile spread slowly are you willing to take my word on it no she steadied herself and smiled back but im willing to bet i can deflect anything you toss out ill take that bet he held out a hand partner they shook solemnly now why dont we the phone interrupted what althea was sure would have been an unprofessional suggestion she slipped by colt and picked up the extension in the kitchen it gave him a moment to think about what hed started to smile to think about how hed like to finish it before hed wound his fantasy up she was striding back she righted the chair snagged her shoulder harness our friend leo the bartender we just busted him for selling coke out of his back room the warrior look was back on her face as she shrugged into the harness theyre bringing him in for interrogation im right behind you behind me is just where youll stay nightshade she said as she slipped into her blazer if boyd clears it you can observe through the glass but thats the best deal youll get he chafed at the restraint let me sit in ill keep my mouth shut dont make me laugh she grabbed her purse on the way to the door take it or leave it partner he swore at her and slammed the door behind him ill take it chapter contents prev next colts initial frustration at being stuck behind the twoway glass faded as he watched althea work her patient detailbydetail interrogation had a style all its own it surprised colt to label that style not only meticulous but relentless as well she never allowed leo to draw her off track never betrayed any reaction to his sarcasm and never not even when leo tried abusive language and veiled threats raised her voice she played poker the same way he remembered coolly methodically without a flicker of emotion until it was time to cash in her chips but colt was beginning to see through the aloof shell into the woman behind it certainly hed been able to surprise many varied emotions from the selfcontained lieutenant passion anger sympathy even speechless shock he had a feeling hed only scratched the surface there was a wealth of emotions beneath that tidy professional and undeniably stunning veneer he intended to keep digging until he unearthed them all long night boyd came up behind him bearing two mugs of steaming coffee ive had longer colt accepted the mug sipped this stuffs strong enough to do the tango he winced and drank again does the captain usually come in for a routine interrogation the captain does when he has a personal interest fletcher watched althea a moment noting that she sat serene and unruffled as leo jerkily lit one cigarette from the butt of another is she getting anything with some effort colt restrained an urge to beat against the glass just to prove he could do something hes still tap dancing hell wear out long before she does ive already figured that out for myself they both lapsed into silence as leo snarled out a particularly foul insult and althea responded by asking if hed like to repeat that statement for the record she doesnt ruffle colt commented fletch have you ever seen the way a catll sit outside a mouse hole he flicked a glance at boyd then looked back through the glass that cat just sits there hardly blinking maybe for hours inside the hole the mouse starts to go crazy he can smell that cat see those eyes staring in at him after a while i guess the mouse circuits in his brain overload and he makes a break for it the cat just whips out one paw and its over colt sipped more coffee nodded at the glass thats one gorgeous cat youve gotten to know her pretty well in a short amount of time oh ive got a ways to go yet all those layers he murmured almost to himself cant say ive ever run into a woman who had me just as interested in peeling the layers of her psyche as peeling off her clothes the image had boyd scowling into his coffee althea was a grown woman he reminded himself and more than able to take care of herself boyd remembered hed been amused to find colt and his former partner in a clinch in his kitchen but the idea of it going further of his friends leaping into the kind of quick physical relationship that could leave them both battered at the finish disturbed him particularly when he thought of colts talent with women it was a talent they both had and both of them had enjoyed the benefits of that talent over the years but they werent discussing just any woman this time this was althea you know boyd began feeling his way with the care of a blind man in a maze theas special she can handle pretty much anything that comes her way and does colt added yeah and does but thats not to say that she doesnt have her vulnerabilities i wouldnt want to see her hurt i wouldnt like that at all mildly surprised colt lifted a brow a warning sounds like the same kind you gave me about your sister natalie about a million years ago comes to the same thing theas family and you think i could hurt her boyd let out a weary breath he wasnt enjoying this conversation im saying if you did id have to bruise several of your vital organs id be sorry but id have to do it colt acknowledged that with a thoughtful nod who won the last time we went at it despite his discomfort boyd grinned i think it was a draw yeah thats how i remember it it was over a woman then too wasnt it cheryl anne madigan this time boyds sigh was nostalgic little blonde nope tall brunette big blue eyes right colt laughed shook his head i wonder whatever happened to pretty cheryl anne they fell into a comfortable silence for a moment reminiscing through the speakers they could hear altheas calm relentless questioning altheas a long way from cheryl anne madigan colt murmured i wouldnt want to hurt her but i cant promise it wont happen the thing is fletch for the first time ive run into a woman who matters enough to hurt me back colt took another bracing sip i think im in love with her boyd choked and was forced to set down his mug before he dumped the contents all over his shirt he waited a beat tapped a hand against his ear as if to clear it you want to say that again i dont think i caught it you heard me colt muttered leave it to a friend he thought to humiliate you at an emotionally vulnerable moment i got almost the same reaction from her when i told her you told her boyd struggled to keep one ear on the interrogation while he absorbed this new and fascinating information what did she say not much of anything the frustration in colts voice tickled boyd so much he had to bite the tip of his tongue to keep from grinning well at least she didnt laugh in your face she didnt seem to think it was very funny colt blew out a breath and wished boyd had thought to lace the coffee with a good dose of brandy she just sat there going pale kind of gaping at me thats a good sign boyd patted colts shoulder comfortingly its real hard to throw her off that way i figured it was best if it was out you know it would give us both time to decide what to do about it he smiled through the glass at althea who continued to sit cool and unruffled while leo gulped down water with a trembling hand though ive pretty much figured out what im going to do about it which is well unless i wake up some morning real soon and realize ive had some sort of brain seizure im going to marry her marry her boyd rocked back on his heels and chuckled you and thea lord wait until i tell cilia the murderous look colt aimed at him only made boyds grin widen i cant thank you enough for your support here fletch boyd gamely swallowed another chuckle but he couldnt defeat the grin oh youve got it pal all the way its just that i never thought id be using the word marriage in the same sentence with colt nightshade or althea grayson for that matter believe me im with you all the way inside the interrogation room althea continued to wear down her quarry she scented his fear and used it ruthlessly you know leo a little cooperation would go a long way sure a long way to seeing me greased like wild bill althea inclined her head as much as it pains me to offer it youd have protection right leo snorted out smoke you think i want cops on my butt twentyfour hours a day you think it would work if i did maybe not she used her disinterest as another tool slowing down the pace of the interview until leo was squirming in his chair but then again no cooperation no shield you go out of here naked leo ill take my chances thats fine youll make bail on the drug charges probably deal them down so you wont do any time to speak of but its funny how word spreads on the street dont you think she let that thought simmer in his brain interested parties already know youve been tagged leo and when you walk out they wont be real sure about what you might have spilled while you were inside i didnt tell you anything i dont know anything thats too bad because it might work against you this ignorance you see were closing in and those same interested parties might wonder if you helped out casually she opened a file and revealed the police sketches they might wonder if i got the descriptions of these suspects from you i didnt give you anything sweat popped out on leos forehead as he stared at the sketches i never seen those guys before well that may be but id have to say if the subject came up that i talked with you a long time and that i have detailed sketches of suspects you know leo she added leaning toward him some people add two and two and get five happens all the time that aint legal he moistened his lips its blackmail dont hurt my feelings you want me to be your friend leo she nudged the sketches toward him you see its all a matter of attitude and whether or not i care if you walk out of here and end up a smear on the sidewalk cant say i do at the moment she smiled chilling him now if you were my friend id do everything i could to make sure you lived a long and happy life maybe not in denver maybe someplace new you know leo a change of scene can work wonders change your name change your life something flickered in his eyes she knew it was doubt you talking witness protection program i could be but if im going to ask for something that big i have to be able to prime the pump when he hesitated she sighed you better choose sides pal remember wild bill all he did was meet a guy they might have been talking about the broncos chances for the superbowl nobody gave him the benefit of the doubt they just iced him the fear was back running in the sweat down his temples i get immunity and you drop the drug charges leo leo althea shook her head a smart man like you knows how life works you give me something if its good enough i give you something back its the american way he licked his lips again lit yet another cigarette maybe ive seen these two before these two althea tapped the sketches and then like a cat she pounced tell me it was am before she was finished shed questioned leo listened to his long rambling story made notes made him backtrack repeat expand then shed called in a police stenographer and had leo go over the same ground again making an official statement for the tape she was energized as she strode back to her office she had names now names to run through the computer she had threads thin threads perhaps but threads nonetheless tying an organization together much of what leo had told her was speculation and gossip but althea knew that a viable investigation could be built on less peeling off her jacket she sat at her desk and booted up her computer she was peering at the screen when colt walked in and stuck a cup under her nose thanks she sipped winced and spared him a glance what is this it tastes like a meadow herbal tea he told her youve had enough coffee nightshade youre not going to spoil our relationship by thinking you have to take care of me are you she set the cup aside and went back to the screen youre wired lieutenant i know how much i can take before the system overloads arent you the one who keeps saying times what we dont have yeah from his position behind her chair he lowered his hands to her shoulders and began to rub you did a hell of a job with leo he said before she could shrug his hands off if i ever decide to go back to law id hate to have you take on one of my clients more compliments his fingers were magic easing without weakening soothing without softening i didnt get as much as i wanted but i think i got all he had hes smalltime colt agreed passing a little business to the big boys taking his commission he doesnt know the main player im sure he was telling the truth about that but he idd the two meena described remember the cameraman shed told us about the big africanamerican look she gestured toward the screen matthew dean scott alias dean miller alias tidal wave dean catchy he played some semipro football about ten years ago made a career out of unnecessary roughness he broke an opposing quarterbacks leg these things happen after the game ah a poor sport what else have we got on him ill tell you what else ive got on him she said but she couldnt resist leaning back against his massaging hands he was fired for breaking training having a woman in his room boys will be boys this particular woman was tied up and screaming her lungs out they dealt it down from rape to assault but scotts football days were over after that weve got him on a couple more assaults indecent exposure drunk and disorderly petty larceny lewd behavior she punched another button on the keyboard that was up to four years ago after that nothing you figure he turned over a new leaf became a pillar of the community sure just like i believe men read girlie magazines because of the erudite articles thats what motivates me grinning he leaned down to kiss the top of her head i bet weve got a similar history on contestant number two she continued harry kline a smalltime actor from new york whose rap sheet includes drunk and disorderly possession sexual assault several dwis he drifted into porno films about eight years ago and was incredibly enough fired from several jobs because of his violent and erratic behavior he headed west got a few similar gigs in california then was arrested for raping one of his costars the defense pleaded it down and due to the victims line of work made it all go away the victims only justice came from the fact that harry was finished in film blue or otherwise nobody even partially legit would touch him that was five years ago theres been nothing on him since once again one would think our friends either became solid citizens or died in their sleep or found a handy hole to hide in leo claimed that he was first approached by kline two maybe three years ago he knows it was at least two kline wanted women young women who were interested in making private films citing free enterprise leo obliged him and took his commission the number he was given to contact kline is out of service ill run it through the phone company to see if it was the penthouse or another location he never saw the other man the one meena said sat off in the comer no his only contacts were scott and kline apparently scott would drop in for a few drinks and brag about how good he was with a camera and how much money he was pulling in and about the girls colt said under his breath the fingers rubbing altheas shoulders went rigid how he and his friends had how did he put it the pick of the litter dont think about it instinctively she lifted a hand to cover his dont colt youll mess up if you do were a big step closer to finding her thats what you have to concentrate on i am he turned away and paced to the far wall im also concentrating on the fact that if i find out either of those slime touched liz im going to kill them he turned back his eyes blank you wont stop me thea yes i will she rose and went to him to take both of his fisted hands in hers because i understand how much youll want to and that if you do it wont change what happened it wont help liz but well cross that bridge after we find her she gave his hands a hard squeeze dont go renegade on me now nightshade im just starting to like working with you he pulled himself back let himself look down at her though her eyes were shadowed and her cheeks were pale with fatigue he could feel energy vibrating from her she was offering him something compassion with restrictions of course and hope without any the viciousness of his anger faded into the very human need for the comfort of contact althea his hands relaxed let me hold you will you she hesitated her brow lifting in surprise he could only smile you know im beginning to read you pretty well youre worried about your professional image snuggling up against a guy in your office sighing he brushed a hand through her hair lieutenant its almost three in the morning theres nobody here to see and i really need to hold you once again she let instinct rule and she moved into his arms every time she mused as she settled her head in the curve of his neck every time they stood like this they fitted perfectly and each time it was easier to admit it feel better she asked and felt him move his head against her hair yeah he didnt know anything about lacy the girl whos missing no without thinking she stroked his back soothing muscles there as he had soothed hers and when i mentioned the possibility of murder he was genuinely shaken he wasnt faking that thats why im certain he gave us everything he had the house in the mountains colt let his eyes close he couldnt give us much west or maybe north of boulder near a lake she moved her shoulders its a little better than we had before well narrow it down colt i feel like im not putting the pieces together were putting the pieces we have together she told him and youre feeling that way because youre tired go home she eased back so that she could look up at him get some sleep well start fresh in the morning id rather go home with you amused exasperated she could only shake her head dont you ever quit i didnt say i expected to only that id rather lifting his hands he framed her face stroking his thumbs over her cheekbones then back to her temples i want time with you althea time when there isnt so much on my mind or on yours time to be with you and time to figure out what it is about you just you that makes me start thinking of longterm permanent basis instantly wary she backed out of his arms dont start that now nightshade instantly relaxed he grinned that sure does make you nervous i never knew anyone so spooked by the thought of marriage unless it was me makes me wonder why and whether i should just sweep you right off your feet and find out the reasons after ive got a ring on your finger or he moved toward her backing her against the desk if i should take things real slow real easy sliding you into the i dos so slick that you wouldnt know you were hitched until it was over and done either way youre being ridiculous there was something lodged in her throat althea recognized it as nerves and bitterly resented it feigning indifference she picked up the tea and sipped now it tasted like cold flowers its late she said you go ahead i can requisition a unit and drive myself home ill take you he caught her chin in his hand and waited until her eyes were level with his and i mean that thea any way i can get you but youre right its late and i owe you you dont her denial ended on a moan when his mouth swooped down to cover hers she tasted frustration in the kiss a jagged need that was barely restrained and most difficult of all to resist she tasted the sweetness of affection like a thin soothing balm over the pulsing heat colt even as she murmured his name against his mouth she knew she was losing her arms had already lifted to wrap around him to bring him closer to accept and to demand her body betrayed her or was it her heart she could no longer tell the two apart as the needs of one so closely matched the needs of the other her fingers dug deep into his shoulders as she struggled to regain her balance then they went lax as she allowed herself one moment of madness it was colt who drew back for himself and for her shed become more important than the satisfactions of the moment i owe you he said again carefully spacing the words as he stared down into her eyes if i didnt i wouldnt let you go tonight i dont think i could ill drive you home he picked up her jacket offered it to her then im probably going to spend the rest of the night wondering what it would have been like if id just locked that door there and let nature take its course shaken she draped her jacket over her shoulders before walking to the door but shed be damned if shed be outdone or outmaneuvered she paused and sent one slow smile over her shoulder ill tell you what it would have been like nightshade it would have been like nothing youve ever experienced and when im ready if im ever ready ill prove it stunned by the punch of that single cool smile he watched her saunter off letting out a long breath he pressed a hand to the knot in his gut sweet god he thought this was the woman for him the only woman for him and damned if he wasnt ready to prove it with four hours sleep two cups of black coffee and a cherry danish under her belt althea was ready to roll by am she was at her desk putting through a call to the telephone company with an official request for a check on the number shed gotten from leo by she had a name and address and the information that the customer had cancelled the service only fortyeight hours before though she didnt expect to find anything she was putting in a request for a search warrant when colt walked in you dont let moss grow under your feet do you althea hung up the phone i dont let anything grow under my feet ive got a line on the number from leo the customer canceled the service i imagine well find the place cleaned out but i can pick up a search warrant within the hour thats what i love about you lieutenant no wasted moves he eased a hip down on her desk and was delighted to discover she smelled as good as she looked howd you sleep she slanted a look up at him direct challenge like a rock you never better i woke up this morning with a whole new perspective can you be ready to roll by noon roll where this idea i had i ran it by boyd and he he scowled down at her shrilling phone how many times a day does that ring often enough she plucked up the receiver grayson yes this is lieutenant althea grayson her head snapped up jade with a nod for colt althea covered the receiver line two she whispered and keep your mouth shut she continued to listen as colt shot from the room to pick up an extension yes we have been looking for you i appreciate you calling in can you tell me where you are id rather not jades voice was thin jumping with nerves i only called because i dont want any trouble im getting a job and everything a straight job if theres trouble with the cops ill lose it youre not in any trouble i contacted your mother because you can be of some help on a case im investigating althea swiveled her chair to the right so that she could see colt through the doorway jade you remember liz dont you the girl whose parents you wrote i i guess maybe it took a lot of courage to write that letter and to get out of the situation youd found yourself in lizs parents are very grateful to you she was a nice kid didnt really know the score you know she wanted out jade paused and althea heard the sound of a scraping match a deep intake of breath listen there was nothing i could do for her we only had a couple of minutes alone once or twice she slipped me the address asked me if id write her folks like i said she was a nice kid in a bad spot then help me find her tell me where theyve got her i dont know man i really dont they took a couple of us up in the mountains a few times really out there you know wilderness stuff they had this really classy cabin though firstrate with a jacuzzi and a big stone fireplace and this bigscreen tv which way did you go out of denver can you remember that well yeah sort of it was like route toward boulder but we just kept going on it forever then we took this other little road for a while not a highway one of those twolane winding jobs do you remember going by any towns anything that sticks out in your mind boulder after that there wasnt much did you go up in the morning afternoon night the first time it was in the morning we got a really early start after boulder was the sun in front of you or behind oh i get it ah i guess it was kind of behind us althea continued to press for details about the location the routine descriptions of the people jade had seen as a witness jade proved vague but cooperative still althea had no problem recognizing scott and kline from jades descriptions there was again a mention of a man who stayed in the background keeping to the shadows watching he was creepy you know jade continued like a spider just hanging there the job paid good so i went back a couple of times three hundred for one day and a fiftydollar bonus if they needed you for two i you know you just cant make that kind of money on the street i know but you stopped going yeah because sometimes they got really rough i had bruises all over me and one of the guys even split my lip while we were doing this scene i got scared because it didnt seem like they were acting it seemed like they wanted to hurt you i told wild bill and he said how i shouldnt go back and that he wasnt going to send any more girls he said he was going to do some checking into it and if it was bad he was going to talk to his cop i knew that was you so thats why i called back when i got the message bill thinks youre okay wearily althea rubbed a hand over her brow she didnt tell jade that she should be using the past tense as far as wild bill was concerned she didnt have the heart jade you said something in your letter about thinking theyd killed one of the girls i guess i did her voice quavered weakened listen im not going to testify or anything im not going back there i cant promise anything only that ill try to keep you out of it tell me why you think they killed one of the girls i told you how they could get rough and it wasnt no playacting either the last time i was up they really hurt me thats when i decided i wasnt going back but lacy thats a girl i hung with some she said how she could handle it and how the money was too good to pass up she went up again but she never came back i never saw her again she paused another match scraped its not like i can prove anything its just she left all her stuff in her room cause i checked lacy was real fond of her things she had this collection of glass animals real pretty crystal like she wouldnt have left them behind shed have come back for them if she could so i thought she was dead or they were keeping her up there like with liz and i figured i better split before they tried something with me can you give me lacys full name jade any other information about her she was just lacy thats all i knew but she was okay all right youve been a lot of help why dont you give me a number where i can contact you i dont want to look ive told you all i know i want out of it i told you im starting over out here althea didnt press it was a simple matter to get the number from the phone company if you think of anything else no matter how insignificant it seems will you call me back i guess look i really hope you get the kid out of there and give those creeps what they deserve we will thanks okay say hi to wild bill before althea could think of a reply jade broke the connection when she looked up colt was standing in her doorway his eyes held that blank dangerous look again you can get her back here material witness yeah i could althea dialed the phone again shed get the number now keep it for backup but i wont she held up a hand for silence before colt could speak and made the official request to the operator a area code colt noted as althea scribbled on her pad you can get the nypd to pick her up no she said simply then slipped the pad into her purse and rose why the hell not colt grabbed her arm as she reached for her coat if you can get that much out of her on the phone youd get that much more facetoface its because i got that much out of her resentful of his interference she jerked away she gave me everything she had just for the asking no threats no promises no maneuvering i asked she answered i dont betray trusts nightshade if i need her to drop the hammer on these bastards then ill use her but not until then and not if theres another way and not she added deliberately without her consent is that clear yeah he scrubbed his hands over his face yeah its clear and youre right so you want to pick up that warrant check that other address yes do you intend to tag along you bet we should have just enough time to finish that before we take off she stopped in the doorway take off thats right lieutenant you and i are taking a little trip ill tell you all about it on the way chapter contents prev next i think weve all lost our minds althea gripped her seat as the nose of the cessna rose into the soft autumn sky comfortable at the controls colt spared her a glance come on tough stuff dont you like planes sure i like planes a tricky patch of crosscurrents sent the cessna rocking but i like them with flight attendants theres stuff in the galley once we level off you can serve yourself that wasnt precisely what shed meant but althea said nothing just watched the land tilt away she enjoyed flying really it was just that she had a routine she would strap in adjust her headset to the music of her choice open a book and zone out for the length of the flight she didnt like to think of all the gauges over which she had no control i still think this is a waste of time boyd didnt argue colt pointed out look thea we know the general location of the cabin i studied that damn tape until my eyes bugged out ill recognize it when i see it and plenty of the surrounding landmarks this is worth a shot maybe was all shed give him think about it colt banked the plane and set his course they know the heats on thats why they pulled out of the penthouse theyre going to be wondering where that tape ended up and if they try to contact leo they wont find him since youve got him stashed in a safe house so theyll stay out of denver she agreed the engines were an irritating roar in her ears they might even pull up stakes and move on thats just what im afraid of colts mouth thinned as they left denver behind what happens to liz if they do none of the options have a happy ending no that and boyds approval had convinced her to go with colt no they dont i have to think theyd stick to the cabin for the time being even if they figure we know it exists they wouldnt think wed know its location they dont know about jade ill give you that nightshade but it seems to me that youre relying on blind luck to guide you there ive been lucky before better he asked when the plane leveled its pretty up here dont you think there was snow on the peaks to the north and there were broad flat valleys between the ridges they were cruising low enough that she could make out cars along the highway communities that were little huddles of houses and the deep thick green of the forest to the west it has its points a thought erupted in her mind making her swivel her head in his direction do you have a pilots license nightshade he glanced over stared then nearly collapsed with laughter lord im crazy about you lieutenant do you want one of those big blowout weddings or the small intimate kind youre crazy period she muttered and shifted deliberately to stare out through the windscreen shed check on his license when they got back to denver and you said you werent going to bring up that kind of thing i lied he said it cheerfully despite the worry that never quite dissipated he didnt think hed ever felt better in his life ive got a problem with that a woman like you could probably cure me of it try a psychiatrist thea were going to make a hell of a pair wait until my family gets a load of you im not meeting your family she attributed the sudden hollowness in her stomach to another spot of turbulence well youre probably right about that at least until were ready to walk down the aisle my mother tends to manage everything but you can handle her my father likes spit and polish which means the two of you would get along like bacon and eggs a regulation type thats the admiral admiral she repeated despite her vow to remain stubbornly silent navy man broke his heart when i joined the air force colt shrugged thats probably why i did it then i have this aunt well better you should meet them for yourself im not meeting your family she said again annoyed that the statement sounded more petulant than firm she unstrapped herself and marched back into the tiny galley rooting about until she found a can of nuts and a bottle of mineral water curiosity had her opening the small refrigerated compartment and studying a tin of caviar and a bottle of beaujolais whose plane is this some friend of boyds a weekend jockey who likes to take women up her answer to that was a grunt as she came back to take her seat must be frank the lecher hes been after me to fly the sexy skies for years she chose a cashew oh yeah not your type hes so obvious but then men tend to be ill have to remind myself to be subtle you going to share those she offered the can is that boulder yep im going to track northwest from here circle around some boyd tells me he has a cabin up here yes lots of people do they like to escape from the city on weekends and tramp through the snow not your speed i dont see any purpose for snow unless youre skiing and the main purpose of skiing as far as im concerned is coming back to a lodge and having hot buttered rum in front of a fire ah youre the adventurous type i live for adventure actually boyds place does have a nice view she admitted and the kids get a big kick out of it so youve been there a few times i like it better in late spring early summer when there isnt much chance of the roads being closed she glanced down at the patchy snow in the foothills i hate the thought of being stuck it might have its advantages not for me she was silent for a time watching hills and trees take over from city and suburbs it is pretty she conceded especially from up here like a segment on public television he grinned at that nature at a distance i thought city girls always yearned for a country retreat not this city girl id rather there was a violent bump that sent nuts flying and had althea grabbing for a handhold what the hell was that narroweyed colt studied his gauges while he fought to bring the nose of the plane back up i dont know you dont know what do you mean you dont know youre supposed to know shh he tilted his head to listen hard to the engines were losing pressure he said with the icy calm that had kept him alive in wartorn jungles in deserts and in skies alive with flak once she understood that the trouble was serious althea responded in kind what do we do im going to have to set her down althea looked down studying the thick trees and rocky hills fatalistically where according to the map theres a valley a few degrees east colt adjusted the course fighting the wheel as he jiggled switches watch for it he ordered then flipped on his radio boulder tower this is baker able john three there althea pointed to what looked to be a very narrow spit of flat land between jagged peaks colt nodded and continued to inform the tower of his situation hang on he told her its going to be a little rough she braced herself refusing to look away as the land rushed up to meet them i heard you were good nightshade youre about to find out he cut speed adjusting for the drag of currents as he finessed the plane toward the narrow valley like threading a needle althea thought then she sucked in her breath at the first vicious thud of wheels on land they bounced teetered shook then rolled to a gentle halt you okay colt asked instantly yeah she let out a breath her stomach was inside out but apart from that she thought she was all in one piece yeah im fine you dandy he reached out grabbed her face in both of his hands and dragged her straining against her seat belt close enough to kiss by damn lieutenant he said and kissed her again hard you never flinched lets elope can it when a woman was used to level emotions it was difficult to know what to do when she had the urge to laugh and scream simultaneously she shoved him away you want to let me out of this thing i could use some solid ground under my feet sure he released the door even helped her alight im going to radio in our position he told her fine althea took a deep gulp of fresh cold air and tried out her legs not too wobbly she discovered pleased all in all shed handled her first and hopefully last forced landing rather well she had to give colt credit she mused as she looked around hed chosen his spot and hed made it work she didnt get down on her knees and kiss the ground but she was grateful to feel it under her as an added bonus the view was magnificent they were cupped between mountain and forest sheltered from the wind low enough to look up at the snow cascading down from the rocky peaks without being inconvenienced by it there was a good clean scent to the air a clear blue sky overhead and a bracing chill that stirred the blood with any luck a rescue could be accomplished within the hour so she could afford to enjoy the scenery without being overwhelmed by the solitude she was feeling in tune with the world when she heard colt clamber out of the cockpit she even smiled at him so when are they coming to get us who them rescue people you know those selfless heroes who get people out of tricky situations such as this oh them theyre not he dropped a tool chest on the ground then went back inside for a short set of wooden steps excuse me althea managed when she found her voice she knew it was an illusion but the mountains suddenly seemed to loom larger did you say no ones coming to get us isnt the radio working works fine colt climbed on the steps and uncovered the engine hed already stuck a rag in the back pocket of his jeans i told them id see if i could do the repairs onsite and keep in contact you told them she moved fast before either of them understood her intention her first swing caught him in the kidneys and had him tumbling off the steps you idiot what do you mean youll do the repairs she swung again but he dodged more baffled than annoyed this isnt a ford broken down on the highway nightshade we havent got a damn flat tire no he said carefully braced and ready for her next move i think its the carburetor you think its her breath whistled out through her teeth and her eyes narrowed thats it im going to kill you with my bare hands she launched herself at him colt made a splitsecond decision pivoted and let her momentum carry them both to the ground it only took him another second to realize the lady was no slouch at handtohand he took one on the chin that snapped his teeth together it looked like it was time to get serious he scissored his legs around her and managed after a short grunting tussle to roll her onto her back hold on will you somebodys going to get hurt youre damn right since reason wouldnt work he used his weight levering himself over her as he cuffed her wrists with his hands she bucked twice then went still they both knew she was only biding her time until she found an opening listen he gave himself another moment to catch his breath then spoke directly into her ear it was the most logical alternative thats bull let me explain if you still disagree afterward well go for two falls out of three okay when she didnt respond colt set his teeth i want your word you wont take another punch at me until i finish it was a pity he couldnt see her expression at that moment fine althea said tightly cautious colt eased back until he could watch her face he was halfway into a sitting position when she brought her knee solidly into his crotch he didnt have the breath to curse her as he rolled into a ball that wasnt a punch she pointed out she took the time to smooth back her hair brush down her parka before she rose okay nightshade lets hear it he only lifted a hand made a couple of woofing noises and waited for the stars to fade from behind his eyes you may have endangered our bloodline thea he got creakily to his knees breathing shallowly you fight dirty its the only way to fight spill it as his strength returned he shot her a killing look i owe you i owe you big were not injured he ground out at least i wasnt until you started on me the planes undamaged if youll take a look around youll see that there isnt room to land another plane safely they could send a copter lift us out but for what odds are if i make a few minor adjustments i can fly us out maybe it made sense althea thought maybe but it didnt alter one simple fact you should have consulted me im here too nightshade you had no right to make that decision on your own my mistake he turned to walk limp back to the steps i figured you were the logical type and being a public servant wouldnt want to see other public servants pulled out for an unnecessary rescue and damn it liz might be over that ridge with a violent clatter he pulled a wrench from the toolbox im not going back without her oh he would have to push that button althea thought as she turned away to stare into the deep green of the neighboring forest he would have to let her hear that terrible worry in his voice see the fire of it in his eyes he would have to be perfectly and completely right pride was the hardest of all pills to swallow making the effort she turned back and walked to stand beside the steps im sorry i shouldnt have lost my temper his response was a grunt does it still hurt he looked back down at her then with a gleam in his eyes that would have made lesser women grovel only when i breathe she smiled and patted his leg try to think about something else do you want me to hand you tools or something his eyes only narrowed farther until they were thin blue slits do you know the difference between a ratchet and a torque wrench no she tossed her hair back why should i i have a perfectly competent mechanic to look after my car and if you break down on the highway she sent him a pitying look what do you think he ground his teeth and went back to the carburetor if i made a comment like that youd call it sexist she grinned behind his back but when she spoke her voice was sober why is calling a tow truck sexist i think theres some instant coffee in the galley she continued ill make some it isnt smart to use the battery he muttered well make do with soft drinks no problem when she returned twenty minutes later colt was cursing the engine this friend of boyds should be shot for taking such haphazard care of his equipment are you going to fix it or not yeah im going to fix it he found several interesting names to call a bolt he was fighting to loosen its just going to take a little longer than i expected prepared for some pithy comment he glanced down she merely stood there patiently the breeze ruffling her hair whats that he asked nodding down at her hands i think its called a sandwich she held up the bread and cheese for his inspection not much of one but i thought you might be hungry yeah i am the gesture mollified him somewhat he lifted his hands and showed her palms and fingers streaked with grease im a little handicapped okay bend over when he obeyed she brought the bread to his mouth they watched each other over it as he took a bite thanks youre welcome i found a beer she pulled the bottle out of her pocket and tipped it back well share then she held it to his lips now i know i love you just eat she fed him more of the sandwich do you have any idea how much longer its going to take you to get us airborne yeah and because he did he made sure he got his full share of the beer and the sandwich before he told her itll be an hour maybe two she blinked two hours well have run out of daylight by then you dont plan to fly this out of here in the dark no i dont though he remained braced for a sneak attack he went back to the engine itll be safer to wait until morning until morning she repeated staring at his back and just what are we supposed to do until morning pitch a tent for starters theres one in the cabin in the overhead i guess old frank likes to take his ladies camping thats great just great youre telling me we have to sleep out here we could sleep in the plane he pointed out but it wouldnt be as comfortable or as warm as stretching out in a tent beside a fire he began to whistle as he worked hed said he owed her one he hadnt realized hed be able to pay her back so soon or so well i dont suppose you know how to start a campfire no i dont know how to start a damn campfire werent you ever a girl scout she made a sound like steam escaping a funnel no were you cant say i was but i was friendly with a few of them well you go on and gather up some twigs darling ill talk you through your first merit badge i am not going to gather twigs okay but its going to get cold once that sun goes down a fire keeps the chill and other things away im not she broke off looked uneasily around what other things oh you know deer elk wildcats wildcats her hand went automatically to her shoulder rig there arent any wildcats around here he lifted his head and glanced around as if considering well it might be too early in the year yet but they do start coming down from the higher elevations near winter of course if you want to wait until ive finished here ill get a fire going may be dark by then though he was doing it on purpose she was sure of it but then again she cast another look around toward the forest where the shadows were lengthening ill get the damn wood she muttered and stomped off toward the trees after she checked her weapon he watched her smiling were going to do just fine together he said to himself just fine following colts instructions althea managed to start a respectable fire within a circle of stones she didnt like it but she did it then because he claimed to be deeply involved in the final repairs to the plane she was forced to rig the tent it was a lightweight bubble that colt declared would nearly erect itself after twenty minutes of struggle and swearing she had it up a narroweyed study showed her that it would shelter the two of them as long as they slept hip to hip she was still staring at it ignoring the chill of the dusk when she heard the engine spring to life good as new colt shouted then shut off the engines i have to clean up he told her he leapt out of the cabin holding a jug of water he used it sparingly along with a can of degreaser from the toolbox nice job he said nodding toward the tent thanks a bunch there are blankets in the plane well do well enough still crouched he drew in a deep breath tasting smoke and pine and good crisp air nothing quite like camping out in the hills she shoved her hands into her pockets ill have to take your word for it he finished scrubbing his hands with a rag before he rose dont tell me youve never done any camping all right i wont tell you what do you do for a vacation she arched a brow i go to a hotel she said precisely where they have room service hot and cold running water and cable tv you dont know what youre missing i suppose im about to find out she shivered once sighed i could use a drink in addition to the beaujolais they feasted on rich sharp cheese caviar and thin crackers spread with a delicate pate all in all althea decided it could have been worse not like any camp meal i ever had colt commented as he scooped more caviar onto a cracker i thought id have to go kill us a rabbit please not while im eating althea sipped more wine and found herself oddly relaxed the fire did indeed keep the chill away and it was soothing to watch it flicker and hiss overhead countless stars wheeled and winked stabbing the cloudless black sky a quartermoon silvered the trees and lent a glow to the snow capping the peaks that circled them shed stopped jerking every time an owl hooted pretty country colt lit an afterdinner cigar i never spent much time here before neither had she althea realized though shed lived in denver for a dozen years i like the city she said more to herself than colt she picked up a stick to stir the fire not because it needed it but because it was fun to watch the sparks fly why i guess because its crowded because you can find anything you want and because i feel useful there and thats important to you feeling useful yeah its important he watched the way the flames cast shadow and light over her face highlighting her eyes sharpening her cheekbones softening her skin it was rough on you growing up its over when he took her hand she neither resisted nor responded i dont talk about it she said flatly ever all right he could wait well talk about something else he brought her hand to his lips and felt a response just a slight flexing then relaxing of her fingers i guess you never told stories around the campfire she smiled i guess not i could probably think of one just to pass the time lie or truth she started to laugh but then she shot to her feet whipping out her weapon colts reaction was lightningfast in an instant he was beside her shoving her back his own gun slapped from his boot into his palm what he demanded his eyes narrowed and searching every shadow did you hear that theres something out there he cocked an ear while she instinctively shifted to guard his back after a moment of throbbing silence he heard a faint rustling then the faroff cry of a coyote the plaintive call had altheas blood drumming colt swore but at least he didnt laugh animals he told her bending to replace his gun what kind her eyes were still scanning the perimeter wary watchful small ones he assured her badgers rabbits he laid a hand over the ones that gripped her weapon nothing you have to put a hole in deadeye she wasnt convinced the coyote called again and an owl hooted in counterpoint what about those wildcats he started to respond thought better of it and tucked his tongue in his cheek well now darling they arent likely to come too close to the fire frowning she replaced her weapon maybe we should have a bigger fire its big enough he turned her toward him running his hands up and down her arms i dont think ive ever seen you so spooked i dont like being this exposed theres too much here out here and the sterling truth was that she would rather face a hoppedup junkie in a dark alley than one small furry creature with fangs dont grin at me damn it was i grinning he ran his tongue around his teeth and struggled to look sober it looks like youre going to have to trust me to get you through this oh am i he tightened his grip when she started to back away the look in his eyes changed so quickly from amusement to desire that it took her breath away theres just you and me althea she let the clogged air slowly out of her lungs it looks like i dont figure i have to tell you again how i feel about you or how much i want you no tension flooded into her when he brushed his lips over her temple and heat a frightening spear of it stabbed up her spine i can make you forget where you are he trailed his lips down to her jawline and nibbled up the other side if youll let me youd have to be damn good for that he laughed because there had been a challenge in the statement even though her breath had caught on the words its a long time until morning im betting i can convince you before sunrise why was she resisting something she wanted so terribly hadnt she told herself long ago never again to let fear cloud her desires and hadnt she learned to sate those desires without penalty she could do so now with him and erase this grinding ache all right nightshade fearlessly she linked her arms around his neck met his eyes straight on ill take that bet his hand fisted in her hair dragged her head back for one long humming moment they stared at each other then he plundered her mouth was hot and honeyed under his as demanding as hunger as wild as the night he plunged into the kiss using tongue and teeth knowing he could gorge himself on her and never be filled so he took more relentlessly savaging her mouth while she met demand with demand and power with power it was like the first time she realized giddily the first time hed dragged her to him and made her taste what he had to offer like some fatal drug the taste had her pulses pounding her blood swimming fast and her mind spinning away from reason she wondered how she had expected to come away whole and then she forgot to care she no longer wanted to be safe to be in control now here with him she wanted only to feel to experience everything that had once seemed impossible or at least unwise and if she sacrificed survival so be it driven by greed she tore at his coat desperate to feel the hard solid body beneath he didnt have to be stronger than she but if he was she would accept the vulnerability that came with being a woman and the power that raced alongside it she was like a volcano ready to erupt and she wanted nothing more than to be joined with him when the tremors came she was stripping him of his sanity layer by layer those wild lips those frantic hands on an oath that was almost a prayer he half carried half dragged her toward the tent feeling like some primeval hunter flinging his chosen mate into his cave they tumbled into the small shelter together a tangle of limbs a tangle of needs he yanked her coat down her shoulders fighting for breath as he raced greedy kisses down her throat he felt the vibration of her groan against his lips as he fought her shoulder rig tearing aside that symbol of control and violence knowing he was losing control overwhelmed by a violence of feelings that he couldnt suppress he wanted her naked and straining and screaming her breath caught in gasps as she tugged pulled ripped at his clothes the firelight glowed orange through the thin material of the tent and she could see his eyes the dark dangerous purpose in them she reveled in it in the panicked excitement that racked her body where he groped and possessed he would ravage her tonight she knew and be ravaged in turn levering himself back he dragged her sweater up and over her head and tossed it aside she wore lace beneath a snowwhite fancy that in a saner place in a saner time would have aroused him by its blatant femininity he might have toyed with the straps skimmed his fingers over her subtle peaks now he only ripped it apart in one jerky move to free her breasts for his greedy mouth the flavor of that warm scented flesh hit his system like a blow and her response the lovely arching of her body against his the long throaty moan the quick helpless quiver drove him toward a summit of pleasure he had never dreamed of he feasted a whimper caught in her throat she dug her nails into the naked flesh of his shoulders needing to drive him on terrified of where he was taking her she clutched at him for balance moved under him in sinuous invitation arching once more as he peeled her slacks away skimming those impossibly clever fingers down her thighs the triangle of lace that shielded her tore jaggedly once again his mouth feasted her cry of stunned release rippled through his blood she shot up like a rocket exploding imploding feeling herself scatter and burn but where the release should have peaked and leveled he gave her no respite she clutched at the blanket while he battered her system with sensations that had no name no form when he rose over her every muscle trembling he found her eyes open and on his he watched her face filled himself with it even as he buried himself inside her in one desperate stroke her eyes glazed closed his own vision grayed before he buried his face in her hair his body took over matching the fast furious rhythm of her hips they rode each other like fury greedy children gorging themselves on forbidden fruit her final cry of dark pleasure echoed through the air seconds before his own strength sapped he collapsed onto her gulping in air as he felt her tremble beneath him from the aftershocks who won he managed after a moment she hadnt thought it possible to laugh at such a time but a chuckle rumbled into her throat lets call it a draw good enough for me he thought about lifting himself off her but was afraid he might shatter if he tried to move plenty good enough im going to kiss you in a minute he murmured but first i have to drum up the strength i can wait althea let her eyes close again and savored the closeness his body continued to radiate heat and his heart was far from steady she stroked her hand down his back for the simple pleasure of the contact frowning a bit when her fingers ran over a raised scar whats this hmm he stirred himself surprised that hed nearly fallen asleep on top of her desert storm she hadnt realized hed been there it occurred to her that there was quite a bit about him that lay in shadows i thought youd retired before that went down i had i agreed to do a little job sort of a side job a favor you could call it that caught a little flak nothing to worry about he tilted his head nuzzling you have the most gorgeous shoulders have i mentioned that no do you still do favors for the government only if they ask nicely he grunted and rolled so that he could shift her on top of him better mmm she rested her cheek on his chest but i think we might freeze to death not if we keep active he grinned when she lifted her head to look down at him survival methods lieutenant of course her lips curved into a smile i have to say nightshade i like your methods that so gently he combed his fingers through her hair tested its weight with his hand thats very so how soon do we have to add wood to that fire oh weve got a little while yet then we shouldnt waste time should we still smiling she lowered her mouth to his nope he felt himself hardening again inside her and prepared to let her take the lead as his lips curved against hers he was struck by a stab of love so sharp it stole his breath he clutched her close held on i know its a tired line thea but its never been like this for me before not with anyone that frightened her and what frightened her more than the words was the flush of warmth they brought to her you talk too much thea but she shook her head and rose up taking him deep inside her tantalizing his body so that the need for words slipped away chapter contents prev next colt awakened quickly an old habit he registered his surroundings the pale light of dawn creeping into the tent the rough blanket and hard ground beneath his back and the soft slender woman curled on top of him it made him smile remembering the way shed rolled over him during the night seeking a place more comfortable than the unyielding floor of the valley at the time theyd both been too exhausted to do more than cuddle up and sleep now the sun had brought a reminder of the outside world and their duties in it still he took a moment to enjoy the lazy intimacy and to imagine other times other places where it would once again be only the two of them gently he tugged the blanket over her bare shoulder and let his fingers trail down over her hair where it lay pooled across her cheek and throat she shifted her eyes opening and locking on his good reflexes lieutenant she ran her tongue over her teeth letting her mind and body adjust to the situation i guess its morning right the first time sleep okay ive slept better every muscle in her body ached but she figured a couple of aspirin and some exercise would handle that you like a baby he said some of us are used to roughing it she only lifted a brow then rolled off him some of us want coffee the moment she left his warmth the chill stung her skin shivering she groped for her sweater hey before she could bundle up in the sweater he grabbed her around the waist and hauled her to him you forgot something his hand slid up her back to cup her head as his mouth met hers her body went fluid sweetly so and her lips parted in invitation she could feel herself melting into him and wondered at it all through the night they had come together again and again each time like lightning with flashes of greed but this was softer steadier stronger like a candle that remained alight long after a raging fire had burned itself out you sure are nice to wake up to althea she wanted to burrow into him to grab hold and hang on as though her life depended on it instead she flicked a finger down the stubble on his chin youre not so bad nightshade she moved away quickly a little too quickly to give herself the time and space to settle because he was beginning to read her very well he smiled you know once were married we should get ourselves one of those kingsize beds so well have plenty of room to roll around and get tangled up she tugged the sweater on when her head emerged her eyes were cool whos making the coffee he nodded thoughtfully that is something well have to decide keeping those little routines straight helps a marriage run smooth she bit back a laugh and reached for her slacks you owe me some underwear he watched her pull the slacks up her long smooth legs buying it for you is going to be pure pleasure he shrugged into his shirt while althea hunted for her socks knowing the value of timing he waited until shed found them both darling ive been thinking she answered with a grunt as she tugged on her shoes how do you feel about getting hitched on new years eve kind of romantic starting out the next year as husband and wife this time she hissed out her breath ill make the damn coffee she muttered and crawled out of the tent colt gave her retreating bottom a friendly pat and chuckled to himself she was coming around he decided she just didnt know it yet by the time althea got the fire started again shed had more than enough of the great outdoors maybe it was beautiful she thought as she rummaged through the small supply of pots theyd found on the plane maybe it was even magnificent with its rugged snowcapped peaks and densely forested slopes but it was also cold and hard and deserted they had a handful of nuts between them and not a restaurant in sight too impatient to wait until it boiled she heated water until it was hot to the touch then dumped in a generous amount of instant coffee the scent was enough to make her drool now thats a pretty sight colt stood just outside the tent watching her a beautiful woman bending over a campfire and you do have a nice way of bending thea stuff it nightshade he strolled to her grinning cranky before your coffee darling she knocked aside the hand hed lifted to toy with her hair he was charming her again and it was just going to have to stop heres breakfast she shoved the can of nuts at him you can pour your own coffee obligingly he crouched down and poured the mixture into two tin mugs nice day he said conversationally low wind good visibility yeah great she accepted the mug he offered god id kill for a toothbrush cant help you there he sampled the coffee grimaced it was mud he decided but at least it packed a punch dont you worry well be back in civilization before much longer you can brush your teeth have yourself a nice hot bubble bath go to the hairdresser she started to smile it was the bubble bath that did it but then she whipped her head up and scowled leave my hair out of this setting the mug down she knelt and began to rummage through her purse once she found her brush she sat crosslegged on the ground her back to colt and began to drag it through her tangled hair here now he sat behind her snuggling her back into the vee of his legs let me do that i can do it myself yeah but youre about to brush yourself bald after a short tussle he snatched the brush away you should take more care with this he murmured gently working out the tangles its the most beautiful head of hair ive ever seen up close like this i can see a hundred different shades of red and gold and russet its just hair but if althea had a point of vanity colt was stroking it now and it felt wonderful she couldnt resist a sigh as he brushed and lifted caressed and smoothed they might be in the middle of nowhere but for that moment althea felt as though she were in the lap of luxury look colt whispered against her ear at three oclock responding instinctively to the direction althea turned her head there just at the verge of the forest stood a deer no not a deer she realized surely no deer could be so huge his shoulders were nearly as high as a man and massive his head was lifted scenting the air with his high crown of antlers spearing upward its ah wapiti colt murmured wrapping his arms companionably around her waist american elk thats one beautiful bull big big is what he is close to seven hundred pounds by the look of him there hes caught our scent althea felt her heart jolt when the elk turned his great head and looked at her he seemed both arrogant and wise as he studied the humans who were trespassing on his territory and suddenly there was an aching in her throat a response to beauty a trembling deep inside a kind of wonder for a moment the three of them remained poised measuring each other a lark called a searingly beautiful cascade of notes the elk turned vanished into the shadowed trees i guess he didnt want coffee and cashews althea said quietly she couldnt say why she was moved she only knew that she was deeply relaxed against colt cradled in his arms she was completely and inexplicably content cant say i blame him colt rubbed his cheek against her hair its a hell of a way to start the day yeah she turned impulsively winding an arm around his neck pressing her lips to his this is better much better he agreed sinking in when she deepened the kiss he nuzzled and was amused when she laughed and shoved his unshaven face away from the tender curve of her throat once were back in denver i want you to remind me where we left off i might do that with some regret she drew away wed better what do you call it break camp and by the way she added shrugging into her shoulder rig you owe me more than new lingerie you owe me breakfast put it on my tab twenty minutes later they were strapped into the cockpit colt checked his gauges while althea applied blusher to her cheekbones we aint going to a party he commented i may not be able to brush my teeth she said and crunched down on a mint shed found in her purse i may not be able to take a shower but by damn i havent lost all sense of propriety i like your cheeks pale he started the engines kind of fragile after one narroweyed stare she deliberately added more blusher just fly nightshade yes sir lieutenant he didnt see the point in telling her it would be a tricky takeoff while she was occupied braiding her hair he maneuvered the plane into the best position for taxüng after touching a finger to the medal that rested under his shirt he let her rip they jolted bounced shuddered and finally lifted degree by degree colt fought the crosscurrents dipping one wing leveling off nosing upward finally they cleared the ridge and shot over the tops of the trees not too shabby nightshade althea flipped her braid behind her back when he glanced over he saw the awareness in her eyes the hands that were currently uncapping a tube of mascara were rocksteady but she knew he should have realized she would know boyd was right thea youre a hell of a partner just try to hold this thing steady for a few minutes will you smiling to herself she angled her purse mirror and began to do her lashes so whats the plan same as before we circle this area look for cabins the one we want has a sloped drive that certainly narrows things down shut up its also a twostory with a covered wraparound deck and a trio of windows on the front facing west the sun was going down in one scene in the video he explained according to the other information we have theres a lake somewhere in the general area i also saw fir and spruce which gives us the elevation the cabin was whitewashed logs it shouldnt be that hard to spot he might be right about that but althea knew there was something else that needed to be said she might not be there colt were going to find out he banked the plane and headed west because she could see the worry come into his eyes althea changed tacks tell me what rank were you in the air force major he drummed up a smile looks like i outrank you youre retired she reminded him i bet you looked swell in uniform i wouldnt mind seeing you in dress blues look following his direction she spotted a cabin below it was a threelevel structure fashioned from redwood she noted two others separated from each other by lines of trees none of them fit no he agreed but well find the one that does they continued to search with althea peering through binoculars hideaways were snuggled here and there most of them seemingly unoccupied a few had smoke puffing out of a chimney and trucks or fourwheeldrive vehicles parked outside once she saw a man in a bright red shirt splitting wood she spotted a herd of elk grazing in a frosty meadow and the flash of whitetail deer theres nothing she said at length unless we want to do a documentary on wait a glint of white caught her attention then was lost circle around four oclock she continued to scan searching the snowdusted ridges and there it was two stories of whitewashed logs a trio of windows facing west the deck at the end of the sloping gravel drive sat a muscularlooking truck as further proof of habitation smoke was spiraling out of the chimney that could be it im betting it is colt circled once then veered off i might take that bet she unhooked the radio mike give me the position ill call it in get a surveillance team up here so we can go back and talk a judge into issuing a warrant colt gave her the coordinates go ahead and call it in but im not waiting for a piece of paper what the hell do you think you can do his eyes flashed to hers then away im setting the plane down and im going in no she said youre not you do what you have to he angled for the meadow where althea had spotted the grazing elk theres a good chance shes in there im not leaving her what are you going to do she demanded too incensed to noticed the perilous descent break in guns blazing thats movie stuff nightshade not only is it illegal but it puts the hostage in jeopardy youve got a better idea he braced himself they were going to slide once the wheels hit he hoped to god they didnt roll well get a team up here with surveillance equipment we figure out who owns the cabin get the paperwork pushed through then we break in no thanks you said youd been skiing right what youre about to do it in a plane hold on she jerked her head around gaped through the windscreen as the glittering meadow hurled toward them she had time for an oath a vicious one but then she lost her breath at the impact they hit and went sliding snow spewed up the side of the plane splattering the windows althea watched almost philosophically as they hurtled toward a wall of trees then the plane spun in two wicked circles before coming to a grinding stop you maniac she took deep breaths fighting back the worst of her temper she would have let it loose but there wasnt enough room to maneuver in the cabin and when she murdered him she wanted to do it right i landed a plane in the aleutians once when the radar was down it was a lot worse than this what does that prove she demanded that im still a hell of a pilot grow up she shouted this isnt fantasyland were closing in on suspected kidnappers suspected murderers and theres very possibly an innocent kid caught in the middle were going to do this right nightshade with one jerk he unstrapped himself then grabbed both her hands at the wrists you listen to me she would have winced at the way his fingers dug into her flesh but the fury in his eyes stopped her i know whats real althea ive seen enough reality in my life the waste of it and the cruelty of it i know that girl i held her when she was a baby and im not leaving her welfare up to paperwork and procedure colt forget it he shoved her hands aside jerked back im not asking for your help because im trying to respect your ideas of rules and regulations but im going after her thea and im going now wait she held up a hand then dragged it through her hair let me think a minute you think too damn much but when he started to rise she shoved a fist into his chest i said wait then she tipped her head back closed her eyes and thought it through how far is it to the cabin she asked after a moment half a mile more like threequarters the roads leading in were all plowed yeah impatience shimmered around him so it would have been handier if i could have been stuck in a snowdrift but a breakdowns good enough what are you talking about im talking about working together she opened her eyes pinned him with them you dont like the way i work i dont like the way you work so were going to have to find a middle ground im calling this in arranging to have the local police back us up and im going to have them get word to boyd see if he can get some paperwork started i told you i dont care what you told me she said calmly this is how its going down we cant go bursting in there number one we might be wrong about the cabin number two she said cutting him off again it puts liz in increased jeopardy if theyre holding her there and number three without probable cause without proper procedure these bastards might wiggle out and i want them put away now you listen he didnt like it it didnt matter how much sense it made or how good a plan shed devised but during the long trek to the cabin she defused whatever arguments he voiced with calm simple logic she was going in what makes you think theyll let you inside just because you ask she tilted her head slanted a look up from under her lashes i havent wasted any on you nightshade but i have a tremendous amount of charm at my disposal she lengthened her stride to match his what do you think most men will do when a helpless woman comes knocking begging for help because shes lost her cars broken down and she gave a delicate shiver and turned her voice into a purr and its so awfully cold outside he swore and watched his breath puff away in smoke what if they offer to drive you back to your car and fix it well ill be terribly grateful and ill stall them long enough to do what needs to be done and if they get rough then you and i will have to kick butt wont we he couldnt help but look forward to that and yet i still think i should go in with you theyre not going to be sympathetic if the little woman has a big strong man with her sarcasm dripped in the chilly air with any luck the local boys will be here before things get nasty she paused judging the distance were close enough one of them might be out for a morning stroll we dont want to be spotted together colt shoved his fists into his pockets then made them relax she was right more she was good he pulled his hands out grabbed her shoulders and hauled her close watch your step lieutenant she kissed him hard same goes she turned walked away with long groundeating strides he wanted to tell her to stop to tell her he loved her instead he headed over the rough ground toward the rear of the cabin this wasnt the time to throw her any emotional curves hed save them for later blocking everything from his mind he sprinted through the hardcrusted snow keeping low althea moved fast she wanted to be out of breath and a little tearyeyed when she reached the cabin once she came into view of the windows she switched to a stumbling run pantomiming relief she all but fell against the door calling and banging she recognized kline when he opened it he wore baggy gray sweats and his bleary eyes were squinting against the smoke from the cigarette tucked into the corner of his mouth he smelled of tobacco and stale whiskey oh thank god althea slumped against the doorjamb thank god i was afraid id never find anyone i feel like ive been walking forever kline sized her up she was one sweetlooking babe he decided but he wasnt big on surprises what do you want my car she pressed a fluttering hand to her heart it broke down it must be a mile from here at least i was coming to visit some friends i dont know maybe i made a wrong turn she shuddered wrapped her parka closer around her is it all right if i come in im so cold there aint nobody up around here no other cabins near here she closed her eyes i knew i must have turned wrong somewhere everything starts to look the same i left englewood before sunup wanted to start my vacation first thing staring up at him wideeyed she managed a weak smile some vacation so far look can i just use the phone call my friends so they can come get me i guess the broad was harmless kline decided and a pleasure to look at oh a fire with a moan of relief althea dashed toward it i didnt know i could be so cold while she rubbed her hands together she beamed over her shoulder at kline i cant thank you enough for helping me out no problem he pulled the dangling cigarette from his mouth we dont get much traffic up here i can see why she shifted her gaze to the windows still it is lovely and this place she circled looking dazzled its just fabulous i guess if you were all cozied up by the fire with a bottle of wine you wouldnt mind sitting out a blizzard or two his lips curled i like to cozy up with something other than a bottle althea fluttered her lashes lowered them modestly it certainly is romantic mr kline you can call me harry all right harry im rose she said giving him her middle name in case hed recognized the name of wild bills cop she offered her hand its a real pleasure i think youve saved my life what the hells going on down there althea glanced up to the loft and saw a tall wiry man with an untended shock of blond hair she tagged him as the second male actor in the video got us an unexpected guest donner kline called up car broke down well hell donner blinked his eyes clear and took a good look youre out early sweetie im on vacation she said and flashed him a smile isnt that nice donner started downstairs preening althea noticed like a rooster in a henhouse why dont you fix the lady a cup of coffee kline tidal waves already in the kitchen its his turn fine donner sent what was meant to be an intimate smile toward althea tell him to pour another cup for the lady why dont you oh i would love a cup of coffee althea said turning her big brown eyes on kline im just frozen sure he shrugged shot donner a look that made althea think of one male dog warning off a competitor then strode off how many more of the organization were in the cabin she wondered or was it just the three of them i was just telling harry how beautiful your house is she wandered the living room dropping her purse onto a table do you live here yearround no we just use it now and again its so much bigger than it looks from outside it does the job he moved closer as althea sat on the arm of a chair maybe youd like to hang out here for your vacation she laughed making no objection when he brushed a finger through her hair oh but my friends are expecting me still i do have two weeks she laughed again low and throaty tell me what do you guys do around here for fun youd be surprised donner laid a hand on her thigh i dont surprise easily back off kline came back in with a mug of black coffee here you are rose thanks she sniffed deeply curling her shoulders in for effect i feel warm and toasty already why dont you take off your coat donner put a hand to her collar but she shifted smiling as soon as my insides defrost a little more shed taken the precaution of removing her shoulder rig but she preferred more camouflage as her weapon was snug at the small of her back are the two of you brothers she asked conversationally kline snorted not hardly you could say were partners oh really what kind of business are you in communications donner stated flashing white teeth thats fascinating you sure have a lot of equipment she glanced toward the bigscreen tv the stateoftheart vcr and stereo i love watching movies on long winter nights maybe we can get together sometime and she let her words trail off alerted by a movement at the back of the loft glancing up she saw the girl her hair was tousled and her eyes were unbearably tired shed lost weight althea thought but she recognized liz from the snapshot colt had shown her why hello there she said and smiled get back in your room kline snapped now liz moistened her lips she was wearing tattered jeans and a bright blue sweater that was tattered at the cuffs i wanted some breakfast her voice was quiet althea noted but not cowed youll get it he glanced back at althea satisfied that she was smiling with friendly disinterest now get on back to your room until i call you liz hesitated long enough to aim one cold glare at him that warmed altheas heart the kid wasnt beaten yet althea noted as liz turned and walked to the door behind her it shut with a slam kids kline muttered and lit another cigarette yeah althea smiled sympathetically is she your sister kline choked on the smoke but then he grinned right yeah shes my sister so you wanted to use the phone oh yes setting the mug of coffee aside althea rose i appreciate it my friendsll be getting worried about me soon there it is he gestured help yourself thanks but when she picked up the receiver there was no dial tone gee i think its dead kline swore and strode over pulling a thin lshaped tool from his pocket forgot i ah lock it up at night so the kid cant use it she was making all these longdistance calls and running up the bill you know how girls are yes althea smiled i do when she heard the dial tone she punched in the number for the local police fran she said merrily addressing the dispatcher as they had arranged you wont believe what happened i got lost my car broke down if it hadnt been for these terrific guys i dont know what id have done she laughed hoping colt was making his move i do not always get lost i hope bobs up to coming for me while althea chatted with the police dispatcher colt shinnied up a pole to the second floor with his binoculars hed seen everything he needed to see through the expansive glass of the cabin althea was holding her own and liz was on the second floor theyd agreed that if the opportunity presented itself he would get her out of the house out of harms way he might have preferred a direct route straight through kline and the other jerk in the living room and on into the big guy doing kitchen duty but lizs safety came first once he got her out hed be coming back with a grunt he swung himself onto the narrow overhang and clutched at the window ledge he saw liz lying on a rumpled bed her body turned away and curled up protectively his first urge was to throw up the window and leap inside afraid he might frighten her into crying out he tapped gently on the glass she shifted when he tapped again she turned wearily over unfocused eyes gazing into the sunlight then she blinked and cautiously pushed herself up from the bed hurriedly colt put a finger to his lips signaling silence but it didnt stop the tears they poured out of her eyes as she rushed to the window colt she shook the window then laid her cheek against the glass and wept i want to go home please please i want to go home he could barely hear her through the glass afraid their voices would carry he tapped again waiting until she turned her head to look at him open the window baby he mouthed it carefully but she only shook her head nailed shut her breath hitched and she rubbed her fists against her eyes they nailed it shut okay okay look at me look he used hand signals to focus her attention a pillow get a pillow a dim spark glowed in her eyes hed seen it before that cautious return of hope she moved fast doing as he instructed hold it against the glass hold it steady and turn your head turn your head away baby he used his elbow to smash the glass satisfied that the pillow muffled most of the noise when hed broken enough to ease his body through he nudged the pillow aside and swung inside she was immediately in his arms clinging sobbing he picked her up cradled her like a baby shh liz its going to be all right now im going to take you home im sorry im so sorry dont worry about it dont worry about anything he drew back to look into her eyes she looked so thin he thought so pale and he had a lot more to ask of her honey youre going to have to be tough for a little while longer were going to get you out and we have to move fast do you have a coat shoes she shook her head they took them they took everything so i couldnt run away i tried colt i swear i did but its all right he pressed her face to his shoulder again recognizing bubbling hysteria youre not going to think about it now youre just going to do exactly what i tell you okay okay can we go now right now right now lets wrap you in this blanket he dragged it off the bed with one hand and did his best to bundle it around her now were going to have to take a little fall but if you hang on to me and stay real loose real relaxed its going to be fine he carried her to the window careful to cover her face against the cold and the jagged teeth of broken glass if you want to scream you scream in your head but not out loud thats important i wont scream with her heart hammering she pressed hard against his chest please just take me home i want mom she wants you too so does your old man he kept talking in the same low soothing tone as he inched toward the edge were going to call them as soon as we get out of here he said a quick prayer and jumped he knew how to fall off a building down stairs out of a plane without the child he would simply have tucked and rolled with her he swiveled his body to take the brunt of the impact so that he would land on his back and cushion her the impact stole his breath wrenched his shoulder but he was up almost as soon as he landed with liz still cradled against his chest he sprinted toward the road and was halfway there when he heard the first shot chapter contents prev next althea drew out her conversation with the police dispatcher pausing in her own chatter to take in the information that her backups eta was ten minutes she sincerely hoped colt had managed to get liz away from the cabin but either way it looked like it was going to go down as smooth as silk thanks fran im looking forward to seeing you and bob too just let me get some idea of where i am from harry i dont have a clue beaming a new smile in harrys direction althea cupped a hand over the phone do you have like an address or something bobs going to come pick me up and take a look at my car no problem he glanced over as tidal wave came in from the kitchen hope you made enough breakfast for our guest harry told him shes had a rough morning yeah theres enough tidal wave turned his hard brown eyes on althea narrowed them hey what the hell is this try for some manners dormer suggested theres a lady present lady hell thats a cop thats wild bills cop he made his lunge but althea was ready shed seen the recognition in his eyes and had already reached for her weapon there wasnt time to think or to worry about the other two men as two hundred and sixty pounds of muscle and bulk rammed her her first shot veered wide as she went flying slamming against an antique table a collection of snuff bottles crashed spewing shards of amethyst and aquamarine she saw stars through them she saw her opponent bearing down on her like a freight train pure instinct had her rolling to the left to avoid a blow tidal wave was big but she was quick althea scrambled to her knees and gripped her weapon in both hands this time her shot was true she had only an instant to note the spread of blood on his white tshirt before she leapt to her feet dormer was heading for the door and kline was swearing as he dragged open a drawer she saw the glint of chrome freeze her order had dormer throwing up his hands and turning into a statue but kline whipped out the gun do it and die she told him stepping back so that she could keep both kline and donner in sight drop it harry or youre going to be staining the carpet like your friend there son of a bitch teeth set he tossed the weapon down good choice now on the floor facedown hands behind your head you too romeo she told donner while they obeyed she picked up klines gun you two should know better than to invite a stranger into the house lord she hurt althea realized now that her adrenaline was leveling off from the top of her head to the soles of her feet she was one huge ache she hoped tidal waves flying tackle hadnt dislodged anything vital she caught the thin wail of a siren in the distance looks like old fran told the troops to come in now in case you dont get the picture im the law and youre under arrest althea was calmly reading her prisoners their rights when colt burst in a gun in one hand a knife in the other by her calculations it had been roughly three minutes since shed fired the first shot the man moved fast she spared him a glance then finished the procedure cover these idiots will you nightshade she asked as she picked up the dangling receiver officer mooney yes this is lieutenant grayson well need an ambulance out here i have a suspect down with a chest wound no the situations under control thank you you were a big help she hung up and looked back at colt liz shes okay i told her to wait by the road for the cops i heard the shots his hands were steady he could be grateful for that but his insides were jelly i figured theyd made you you figured right that one she jerked her head toward tidal wave he must have seen me with wild bill why dont you go find us a towel wed better try to stop that bleeding the hell with that the fury came so suddenly and so violently that the two men on the floor quaked your heads cut yeah she touched her fingers to the throbbing ache at her right temple then studied her bloodsmeared fingers in disgust hell that better not need stitches i really hate stitches which one of them hit you colt scanned the three men with icy eyes which one the one i shot the one whos currently bleeding to death now get me a towel and well see if we can have him live long enough to go to trial when he didnt respond she stepped between him and the wounded man colts intentions were clear as crystal dont pull this crap on me nightshade im not a damsel in distress and white knights annoy the hell out of me got it yeah he sucked in his breath there were too many emotions ripping through him none of them could change the situation yeah i got it lieutenant he turned away to do as shed asked after all he thought she could handle the situation she could handle anything it wasnt until they were in the plane again that he began to calm he had to at least pretend to be calm for lizs sake shed clung to him begging him not to send her back with the police to stay with her so hed agreed to fly back with liz in the copilots seat and althea in the jump seat behind looking lost in his coat liz stared through the windscreen no matter how colt had tried to bundle her up she continued to shiver when they leveled off heading east the tears began to flow they fell fast hot down her cheeks her shoulders shook violently but she made no sound no sound at all come on baby helpless colt reached out to take her hand everythings all right now nobodys going to hurt you now but the silent tears continued saying nothing althea rose she came forward calmly unstrapped liz communicating by touch althea urged liz to shift then took her place in the chair then she gathered the girl on her lap cradled her head on her shoulder enfolded her grief dont hold back she murmured almost at once lizs sobs echoed through the cabin the pain in them cut at altheas heart as she rocked the girl and held her close devastated by the weeping colt lifted a hand to brush it down lizs tangled hair but she only curled closer to althea at the touch he dropped his hand and concentrated on the sky it was altheas gentle insistence that convinced liz it would be wise to go to the hospital first she wanted to go home she said over and over again and over and over again althea patiently reminded liz that her parents were already on their way to denver i know its hard althea kept her arm tight around lizs shoulders and i know its scary but the doctor needs to check you out i dont want him to touch me i know how well she knew but hes a she althea smiled rubbing her hand down lizs arm she wont hurt you itll be over real quick colt assured her he fought to keep his easy smile in place what he wanted to do was scream kick something kill someone okay liz glanced warily toward the examining room again please she pressed her lips together and looked pleadingly at althea would you like me to go in with you stay with you at lizs nod she drew the girl closer sure no problem colt why dont you go find a softdrink machine maybe a candy bar she smiled down at liz i could sure use some chocolate how about you yeah liz drew in a shaky breath i guess well be back in a few minutes althea told colt he could read nothing in her eyes feeling useless he strode down the corridor inside the examining room althea helped liz exchange her tattered clothes for a hospital gown she noted the bruises on the girls flesh but made no comment they would need an official statement from liz but it could wait a little longer this is dr mailer she explained as the young doctor with the soft eyes approached the table hello liz dr mailer didnt offer her hand or touch her patient in any way she specialized in trauma patients and she understood the terrors of rape victims im going to need to ask you some questions and to run some tests if theres anything you want to ask me you go ahead and if you want me to stop to wait a while you just say so okay all right liz lay back and focused on the ceiling but her hand remained tight around altheas althea had requested dr mailer because she knew the womans reputation as the examination progressed she was more than satisfied that it was well deserved the doctor was gentle kind and efficient it seemed she instinctively knew when to stop to give liz a chance to regroup and when to continue were all done dr mailer stripped off her gloves and smiled i just want you to rest in here for a little while and im going to have a prescription for you before you leave i dont have to stay here do i no dr mailer closed a hand over lizs you did fine when your parents get here well talk again why dont i see about getting you something to eat as she left dr mailer sent althea a look that clearly stated that they too would talk later you did do fine althea said helping liz to sit up do you want me to go see if colt found that candy bar i dont imagine thats the sort of food dr mailer had in mind so well have to sneak it while we can i dont want to be alone here okay althea took her brush from her purse and began to untangle lizs hair let me know if im pulling when i saw you downstairs at the cabin i thought you were another of the women they brought up that it was going to happen again liz squeezed her eyes shut tears spilled through her lashes that they were going to make me do those things again im sorry there wasnt any way to let you know i was there to help you and when i saw colt at the window i thought it was a dream i kept dreaming somebody would come but no one did i was afraid mom and dad just didnt care honey your parents have been trying to find you all along she tipped lizs chin upward theyve been so worried thats why they sent colt and i can tell you he loves you too you cant imagine the stuff hes bullied me into doing so he could find you liz tried to smile but it quivered and fell but they dont know about maybe they wont love me after they find out everything no altheas fingers firmed on lizs chin itll upset them and it will hurt them and itll be hard really hard for them thats because they do love you nothing that happened is going to change that i i cant do anything but cry then thats all you have to do for now liz swiped a shaky hand across her cheeks it was my fault i ran away it was your fault you ran away althea agreed thats all that was your fault liz jerked her head away the tears gushed out again as she stared at the tiles on the floor you dont understand how it feels you dont know what its like how awful it is how humiliating youre wrong gently firmly althea cupped lizs face again lifting it until their eyes met i do understand i understand exactly you air shuddered out between lizs lips it happened to you when i was just about your age and i felt as though someone had carved something out of me that id never get back again i thought id never get clean again be whole again be me again and i cried for a long long time because there didnt seem to be anything else i could do liz accepted the tissue althea pressed into her hand i kept telling myself it wasnt me it wasnt really me but i was so scared its over colt keeps saying its over now but it hurts i know althea cradled liz in her arms again it hurts more than anything else can and its going to hurt for a while but youre not alone you have to keep remembering youre not alone you have your family your friends you have colt and you can talk to me whenever you need to liz sniffled rested her cheek against altheas heart what did you do after what did you do i survived althea murmured staring blankly over lizs head and so will you colt stood in the doorway of the examining room his arms piled high with cans of soda and candy bars if hed felt useless before he now felt unbearably helpless there was no place for him here no way for him to intrude on this womans pain his first and only reaction was rage but where to channel it he turned away to dump the cans and candy onto a table in the waiting room if he couldnt comfort either of them couldnt stop what had already happened then what could he do he scrubbed his hands over his face and tried to clear his mind even as he dropped them he saw lizs parents dashing from the elevator this at least he could do he strode to meet them inside the examining room althea finished tidying lizs hair do you want to get dressed liz managed what passed for a smile i dont ever want to put those clothes on again good point well maybe i can scrounge up she turned at a flurry of movement in the doorway she saw a pale woman and a haggard man both with redrimmed eyes oh baby oh liz the woman raced forward first with the man right on her heels mom liz was sobbing again even as she threw open her arms mom althea stepped aside as parents and child were reunited with tears and desperate embraces when she spotted colt in the doorway she moved to him youd better stay with them ill tell dr mailer theyre here before i go where are you going she slid her purse back on her shoulder to file my report she did just that before she went home to indulge in that long steamy bath she soaked until her body was numb giving in to exhaustion both physical and emotional she fell into bed naked and slept dreamlessly until the battering on her door awoke her groggy she fumbled for her robe belting it as she walked to the door she scowled at colt through the peephole then yanked the door open give me one good reason why i shouldnt book you for disturbing the peace my peace he held out a flat square box i brought you pizza she blew out a breath then drew one in as well as the rich scent of cheese and spice that might get you off i guess you want to come in with it that was the idea well come on then with that dubious invitation she walked away to fetch plates and napkins hows liz holding up surprisingly well marleen and frank are as solid as they come theyll have to be she came back to set the plates on the table i hope they understand theyre all going to need counseling theyve already talked to dr mailer about it shes going to help them find a good therapist back home trying to choose his words properly he took his time sliding pizza onto the plates the first thing i want to do is thank you and dont brush me off thea id really like to get this out all right then she sat picked up a slice get it out im not just talking about the official cooperation the way you helped me find her and get her out i owe you big for that but thats professional you got anything to drink with this theres some burgundy in the kitchen ill get it he said as she started to rise althea shrugged and went back to eating suit yourself she was working on her second slice when colt came back with a bottle and two glasses i guess i was too tired to realize i was starving then i dont have to apologize for waking you up he filled both glasses but didnt drink the other thing i have to thank you for is the way you were with liz i figured getting her out was enough playing that white knight you said irritates you so much he looked up met her eyes there was a new understanding in them and a weariness she hadnt seen before it wasnt telling her it was all right that it was over that wasnt enough either she needed you she needed a woman you are that i know its a lot to expect over and above so to speak but she asked about you a couple of times after you left he toyed with the stem of his glass theyre going to be staying in town at least for another day until dr mailer has some of the results in i was hoping you could talk to liz again you dont have to ask me that colt she reached out for his hand i got involved too so did i thea he turned their joined hands over brought them to his lips im in love with you bigtime no dont pull away from me he tightened his grip before she could ive never said that to another woman i used alternate terms he smiled a little im crazy about you youre special to me that kind of thing but i never used love not until you she believed him what was more frightening she wanted to believe him tread carefully she reminded herself one step at a time listen colt the two of us have been on a roller coaster since we met and thats only been a short while things emotions get blown out of proportion on roller coasters why dont we slow this down some he could feel her nerves jittering but he couldnt be amused by them this time i had to accept that i couldnt change what had happened to liz that was hard i cant change what i feel for you accepting thats easy im not sure what you want from me colt and i dont think i can give it to you because of what happened to you before because of what i heard you telling liz in the examining room she withdrew instantly and completely that was between liz and me she said coldly and its none of your business it was exactly the reaction hed expected the one hed prepared for we both know thats not true but well talk about it when youre ready knowing the value of keeping an opponent off balance he picked up his wine you know theyre giving scott a fiftyfifty chance of making it i know she watched him warily i called the hospital before i went to bed boyds handling the interrogation of kline and donner for now cant wait to get at them can you no she smiled again i cant you know i heard those shots and it stopped my heart feeling more relaxed he bit into his pizza i come tearing back ready to kick butt crash through the door like the cavalry and what do i see he shook his head and tapped her glass with his there you are blood running down your face he paused to touch a gentle finger to the bandage at her temple a gun in each hand theres a threehundredpound hulk bleeding at your feet and two others facedown with their hands behind their heads youre just standing there looking like diana after the hunt and reciting miranda i have to say i felt pretty superfluous you did okay nightshade she let out a small defeated breath and i guess you deserve to know that i was awfully glad to see you you looked like jim bowie at the alamo he lost she gave in and leaned forward to kiss him you didnt we didnt he corrected pleased that her mouth had been soft relaxed and friendly i brought you a present oh yeah because the dangerous moment seemed to have passed her lips curved and she kissed him again gimme he reached behind himself for his coat dug into the pocket taking out a small paper bag he tossed it into her lap aw and you wrapped it so nice chuckling she dipped into the bag and pulled out a lacy bra and panties in sheer midnight blue her chuckle turned into a rich appreciative laugh i pay my debts he informed her since i figured you probably had a supply of the white kind i picked out something a little different he reached over to feel the silk and lace maybe youll try them on eventually but she knew what she wanted now what she needed now and she rose to take it she combed her fingers through his hair tugging so that his face lifted and his mouth met hers maybe youll come to bed with me absolutely he skimmed his hands up her hips keeping his mouth joined to hers as he stood to gather her close i thought youd never ask i didnt want the pizza to get cold he slipped a finger down the center of her body to toy with the belt of her robe still hungry she tugged his shirt out of his jeans now that you mention it then she laughed as he swung her up into his arms whats this for i decided to sweep you off your feet for now he started toward the bedroom deciding she was in for another surprise the spread was turned back but the plain white sheets were barely disturbed from her nap colt laid her down following her onto the bed as he skimmed light teasing kisses over her face her fingers were busy undoing his buttons she knew what it would be like and was prepared eager for the storm and the fire and the fast flood of sensations when her hands pushed away cotton and encountered warm firm flesh she gave a low satisfied moan he continued to kiss her nibbling nuzzling as she hastily stripped off his clothes there was a frantic energy burning in her that promised the wild the frenzied each time desire stabbed through him he absorbed the shock and kept his pace easy eager edgy althea turned her mouth to his and arched against him i want you he hadnt realized that three breathy words could make the blood swim in his head but it would be too easy to take what she offered too easy to lose what she held back i know i can taste it he dipped his mouth to hers again drawing out the kiss with such trembling tenderness that she groaned again the hand that had been fisted tight against his bare shoulder went lax and i want you he murmured levering back to stare down at her all of you fascinated he drew his fingers through her hair spreading it out until it lay flaming against the white sheet then he lowered his head again gently so gently to kiss the bandage at her temple emotion curled inside her like a spiked fist colt shh i just want to look and look he did while he traced her face with a fingertip rubbed her lower lip with his thumb then trailed it down to her jawline skimmed over the pulse that fluttered in her throat the suns going down he said quietly the light does incredible things to your face your eyes just now theyre gold with darker brandycolored specks sprinkled through them ive never seen eyes like yours you look like a painting he brushed his thumb over her collarbone but i can touch you feel you tremble know youre real she lifted a hand wanting to drag him back to her to make the ache go away i dont need words sure you do he smiled a little turning his face into her palm maybe i havent found the right ones but you need them he started to press his lips to her wrist and then he noticed the faint smudge of bruises and remembered his brows drew together when he straddled her and took both of her hands he examined her wrists carefully before looking down at her again i did this sweet god she thought there had to be a way to stop this terrible trembling it doesnt matter you were upset make love with me i dont like knowing i hurt you in anger or that im liable to do it again eventually very carefully he touched his lips to each of her wrists and felt her pulse scramble you make it too easy to forget how soft you are althea the sleeves of her robe slithered down her arms as he skimmed his lips to her elbow how small how incredibly perfect you are ill have to show you he cupped a hand under her head lifting her so that her hair tumbled back her face tilted up then his mouth was on hers again savoring a deep dreamy kiss that left her weak he felt her give felt yet another layer dissolve her arms linked around his neck her muscles quivered what was he doing to her she only knew she couldnt think couldnt resist shed been prepared for need and hed given her tenderness what defense could there be against passion wrapped so softly in sweetness his mouth was gentle enchanting her even as it seduced she wanted to tell him that seduction was unnecessary but oh it felt glorious to surrender to the secrets he unearthed with that quietly devastating mouth and those slow easy hands the last rays of the sun slanted across her eyes as he eased her back so that he could trail his lips down her throat she heard the whisper of her robe as he slipped it down to bare her shoulder to free it for lazy openmouthed kisses and the moist trail of his tongue he could feel it the instant she let herself go the warmth of triumph surged through him as her hands as gentle as his began to caress he resisted the urge to quicken his pace and let his hands explore her over the robe under it then over again as her body melted like warm wax all the while he watched her face aroused by each flicker of emotion lured by the way her breath would catch then rush through her lips at his touch he could have sworn he felt her float as he slipped the robe away then her eyes opened dark and heavy he understood that though she had surrendered she would not be passive her hands were as thorough as his seeking touching possessing with that unbearable tenderness until he was as seduced as she soft breathy moans quiet secrets told in murmurs long lingering caresses the sunlight faded to dusk and dusk to that deepening of night there was need but no frantic rush to sate it there was pleasure and the dreamy desire to prolong it indulgence tonight there was only indulgence he touched she trembled she tasted he shuddered when at last he slipped into her she smiled and gathered him close the rhythm they set was patient loving and as true as music they climbed together steadily beautifully until his gasp echoed hers and then they floated back to earth she lay a long time in silence dazed by what had happened he had given her something and she had given freely in return it couldnt be taken back she wondered what steps could be taken to protect herself now that she had fallen in love for the first time for the only time perhaps it would pass a part of her cringed at the thought of losing what shed just found no matter how firmly she reminded herself that her life was precisely the way she wanted it she couldnt bring herself to think too deeply about what it would be like without him and yet she had no choice he would leave and she would survive youre thinking again he rolled onto his back hooking an arm around her to gather her close i can almost hear your brain humming outrageously content he kissed her hair closed his eyes tell me the first thing that pops into your mind what i dont no no dont analyze this is a test the first thing thea now i was wondering when you were going back she heard herself say to wyoming ah he smiled smugly i like knowing im the first thing on your mind dont get cocky nightshade okay i havent made any firm plans i have some loose ends to tie up first such as you for starters we havent set the date colt he grinned again maybe it was wishful thinking but he thought hed heard exasperation in her tone instead of annoyance im still shooting for new years eve i guess ive gotten sentimental but weve got time to hash that out then theres the fact that i havent finished what i came here to do that brought her head up what do you mean you found liz its not enough his eyes glowed in the shadows we dont have the head man its not finished until we do thats for me and the department to worry about personal vendettas have no place here i didnt say it was a vendetta though it was i intend to finish this althea id like to keep working with you on this and if i say no he twirled her hair around his finger ill do my best to change your mind maybe you havent noticed but i can be tenacious ive noticed she muttered but there was a part of her that glowed at the idea that their partnership wasnt at an end i suppose i can give you a few more days good he shifted her so that he could run a hand down her side to her hips does the deal include a few more nights i suppose it could her smile flashed wickedly if you make it worth my while oh i will he lowered his head thats a promise chapter contents prev next with the scream still tearing at her throat althea shot up in bed blind with terror and rage she fought the arms that wound around her struggling wildly against the hold while she sucked in the air to scream again she could feel his hands on her feel them groping at her hot hurtful but this time god please this time althea colt shook her hard forcing his voice to remain calm and firm though his heart was hammering against his ribs in fast hard blows althea wake up youre dreaming pull out of it she clawed her way through the slippery edges of the dream still fighting him still dragging in air reality was a dim light through the murky depths of the nightmare with a final burst of effort she grasped at it and at colt okay okay still shaken by the sound of the scream that had awakened him he rocked her holding her close to warm her body which was chill with clammy sweat okay baby just hold on to me oh god her breath came out in a long shaky sob as she buried her face against his shoulder her hands fisted impotently at his back oh god oh god its okay now he continued to stroke and soothe growing concerned when her hold on him increased im right here you were dreaming thats all you were only dreaming shed fought her way out of the dream but the fear had come back with her and it was too huge to allow for shame so she clung shivering trying to absorb some portion of the strength she felt in him just give me a minute ill be all right in a minute the shaking would stop she told herself the tears would dry the fear would ebb im sorry but it wasnt stopping instinctively she turned her face into his throat for comfort god im sorry just relax she was quivering like a bird he thought and she felt as frail as one do you want me to turn on the light no she pressed her lips together hoping to stop the trembling in her voice she didnt want the light didnt want him to see her until shed managed to compose herself no let me get some water ill be fine ill get it he brushed the hair from her face and was shaken all over again to find it wet with tears ill be right back she brought her knees up close to her chest when he left her control she ordered herself but dropped her head onto her knees while she listened to water striking glass watched the splinter of light spill through the crack around the bathroom door she took long even breaths sorry nightshade she said when he came back with the water i guess i woke you up i guess you did her voice was steadier he noted but her hands werent he cupped his around hers and lifted the glass to her lips must have been a bad one the water eased her dry throat must have been thanks she pushed the glass back into his hands embarrassed that she couldnt hold it herself colt set the glass on the night table before easing down on the bed beside her tell me she moved her shoulders dismissively chalk it up to a rough day and pizza very firmly very gently he took her face in his hands the light hed left on in the bathroom sent out a dim glow in it he could see how pale she was no im not going to brush this off thea youre not going to brush me off you were screaming she tried to turn her head away but he wouldnt permit it youre still shaking i can be every bit as stubborn as you and right now i think i have the advantage i had a nightmare she wanted to snap at him but couldnt find the strength people have nightmares how often do you have this one never she lifted a weary hand and dragged it through her hair not in years i dont know what brought it on he thought he did and unless he was very much mistaken he thought she did as well do you have a shirt a nightgown or something youre cold ill get one just tell me where her quick annoyed sigh did quite a bit toward easing his mind top drawer of the dresser lefthand side he rose and opening the drawer grabbed the first thing that came to hand before he tugged it over her head he examined the oversize mans undershirt nice lingerie you have lieutenant it does the job he smoothed it down over her tucked pillows behind her as fussy as a mother with a colicky infant she scowled at him i dont like being pampered youll live through it when he was satisfied hed made her as comfortable as possible he tugged on his jeans they were going to talk he decided and sat beside her again whether she wanted to or not he took her hand waited until they were eyetoeye the nightmare it was about when you were raped wasnt it her fingers went rigid in his i told you i heard you talking to liz she ordered her fingers to relax willed them to but they remained stiff and cold it was a long time ago it doesnt apply now it does when it wakes you up screaming it brought it all back he continued quietly what happened to liz seeing her through it all right so what trust me althea he said it quietly his eyes on hers let me help it hurts she heard herself say then she shut her eyes it was the first time she had admitted that to anyone not all the time not even most of the time it just sneaks up now and then and slices at you i want to understand he brought her hand to his lips when she didnt pull away he left it there talk talk to me she didnt know where to begin it seemed safest to start at the beginning letting her head rest against the pillows she closed her eyes again my father drank and when he drank he got drunk and when he got drunk he got mean he had big hands she curled hers into fists then relaxed them he used them on my mother on me my earliest memory is of those hands the anger in them that i couldnt understand and couldnt fight i dont remember him very well he tangled with somebody meaner one night and ended up dead i was six she opened her eyes again realizing that keeping them closed was just another way of hiding once he was gone my mother decided to take up where hed left off in the bottle she didnt hit it as hard as he did but she was more consistent he could only wonder how the people shed described could have created anything as beautiful or as true as the woman beside him did you have anyone else i had grandparents on my mothers side i dont know where they lived i never met them they hadnt had anything to do with her since shed run off with my father but did they know about you if they did they didnt care he said nothing trying to comprehend it but he couldnt simply couldnt understand family not caring okay what did you do when youre a child you do nothing she said flatly youre at the mercy of adults and the reality is a great many adults have no mercy she paused a moment to pick up the threads of the story when i was about eight she went out she went out a lot but this time she didnt come home a couple of days later a neighbor called social services they scooped me up into the system she reached for the water again this time her hands didnt shake its a long typical story i want to hear it they placed me in a foster home she sipped her water there wasnt any point in telling him how frightened how lost shed been the facts were enough it was okay decent then they found her slapped her wrists a couple of times told her to clean up her act and gave me back why in the hell did they do that things were different back then the court believed the best place for a kid was with her mother anyway she didnt stay dry for long and the cycle started all over again i ran away a few times they dragged me back more foster homes they dont leave you in any one too long especially when youre recalcitrant and id developed my own mean streak by that time small wonder i bounced around in the system social workers court hearings school counselors all overburdened my mother hooked up with another guy and finally took off for good mexico i think in any case she didnt come back i was twelve thirteen i hated not being able to say where i wanted to go where i wanted to be i took off every chance i got so they labeled me a jd juvenile delinquent and they put me in a girls home which was one step up from reform school her lips twisted into a dry smile that put the fear of god into me it was rough as close to prison as i ever want to be so i straightened up put on my best behavior eventually they placed me in foster care again she drained the glass and set it aside she knew her hands wouldnt be steady for long i was scared that if i didnt make it work this time theyd put me back until i was eighteen so i took a real shot at it they were a nice couple naive maybe but nice good intentions they wanted to do something to right societys ills she was pta president and they went to protest rallies against nuclear power plants they talked about adopting a vietnamese orphan i guess i smirked at them behind their backs sometimes but i really liked them they were kind to me she took a moment and he said nothing waiting for her to build to the next stage they gave me boundaries good ones and they treated me fairly there was one drawback they had a son he was seventeen captain of the football team homecoming king a student the apple of their eye a real company man company man you know the kind whos all slick and polished on the outside hes got a terrific rap lots of charm lots of angles and underneath hes slime you cant get to the slime because you keep slipping on all that polish but its there her eyes glinted at the memory i could see it i hated the way he looked at me when they werent watching her breath was coming quicker now but her voice was still controlled like i was a piece of meat he was sizing up getting ready to grill they couldnt see it all they saw was this perfect child who never gave them a moments grief and one night when they were out he came home from a date god when she covered her face with her hands colt gathered her close its all right thea thats enough no she shook her head violently pushed back shed gone this far shed finish it he was angry i suppose his girl hadnt surrendered to his many charms he came into my room when i told him to get out he just laughed and reminded me it was his house and that i was only there because his parents felt sorry for me of course he was right no no he wasnt he was right about that althea said not about the rest but about that and he unzipped his pants i ran for the door but he threw me back on the bed i hit my head pretty hard on the wall i remember being dizzy for a minute and hearing him telling me that he knew girls like me usually charged for it but that i should be flattered that he was going to give me a thrill he got on the bed i slapped him i swore at him he backhanded me and pinned me and i started to scream i kept screaming and screaming while he raped me when he was finished i wasnt screaming anymore i was just crying he got off the bed and zipped up his pants he warned me that if i told anyone hed deny it and who were they going to believe someone like him or someone like me he was blood so there was no contest and he could always get five of his buddies to say that id been willing with all of them then theyd just put me back in the home so i didnt say anything because there was nothing to say and no one to say it to he raped me twice more over the next month before i got the nerve to run away again of course they caught me maybe id wanted them to that time i stayed in the home until i was eighteen and when i got out i knew no one was ever going to have that kind of control over me again no one was ever going to make me feel like i was nothing ever again unsure what to do colt reached up tentatively to brush a tear from her cheek you made your life into something althea i made it into mine she let out a breath then briskly rubbed the tears from her cheeks i dont like to dwell on before colt but its there its there she agreed trying to make it go away only brings it closer to the surface i learned that too once you accept its simply a part of what makes you what you are it doesnt become as vital it didnt make me hate men it didnt make me hate myself it did make me understand what it is to be a victim he wanted to gather her close but was afraid she might not want to be touched i wish i could make the hurt go away old scars she murmured they only ache at odd moments she sensed his withdrawal and felt the ache spread im the same person i was before i told you the trouble is after people hear a story like that they change i havent changed he started to touch her drew back damn it thea i dont know what to say to you what to do for you rising he paced away from the bed i could make you some tea she nearly laughed nightshades cureall no thanks what do you want he demanded just tell me why dont you tell me what you want what i want he strode to the window whirled back i want to go back to when you were fifteen and kick that bastards face in i want to hurt him a hundred times worse than he hurt you then i want to go back further and break your fathers legs and i want to kick your mothers butt while im at it well you cant she said coolly pick something else i want to hold you he shouted jamming his fists into his pockets and im afraid to touch you i dont want your tea and i dont want your sympathy so if thats all you have to offer you might as well leave is that what you want what i want is to be accepted for who and what i am not to be tiptoed around like an invalid because i survived rape and abuse he started to snap back at her then stopped himself he wasnt thinking of her he realized but of his own rage his own impotence his own pain slowly he walked back to the bed and sat beside her her eyes were still wet he could see them gleaming against the shadows he slipped his arms around her gently drew her close until her head rested on his shoulder im not going anywhere he murmured okay she sighed settled okay althea awakened at sunrise with a dull headache she knew instantly that colt was no longer beside her wearily she rolled onto her back and rubbed her swollen eyes what had she expected she asked herself no man would be comfortable around a woman after hearing a story like the one shed told him and why in gods name had she dumped out her past that way how could she have trusted him with pieces of herself that shed never given anyone before even boyd the person she considered her closest friend knew only about the foster homes as for the rest shed buried it until last night she didnt doubt that her tie to liz had unlocked the door and let the nightmare back in but she should have been able to handle it to hold back to safeguard her privacy the fact that she hadnt could mean only one thing indulging in a sigh althea pushed herself up and rested her brow on her knees she was in love with colt ridiculous as it was she had to face the truth and just as shed always suspected love made you stupid vulnerable and unhappy there ought to be a pill she mused a serum she could take like an antidote for snakebite the sound of footsteps had her whipping her head up her eyes widened when colt came to the doorway carrying a tray he had a split second to read her reaction before she closed it off shed thought hed taken a hike he realized grimly he was going to have to show the lady that he was sticking no matter how hard she tried to shake him off morning lieutenant i figured youd planned on a full day you figured right cautious she watched as he crossed to the bed waited until hed set the tray at her feet whats the occasion she asked gesturing toward the plates of french toast i owe you a breakfast remember yeah her gaze shifted from the plates to his face love still made her feel stupid it still made her feel vulnerable but it no longer made her unhappy youre a regular whiz in the kitchen we all have our talents he sat crosslegged on the other side of the tray and dug in i figure he chewed swallowed after were married i can handle the meals you can handle the laundry she ignored the quick sprint of panic and sampled her first bite you ought to see someone about this obsessive fantasy life of yours nightshade my mothers dying to meet you he grinned when altheas fork clattered against her plate she and dad send their best you words failed her she and my father know liz i called to relieve their minds and i told them about you smiling he brushed her hair back from her shoulders he hadnt known a woman could look so sexy in a mans undershirt shes for a spring wedding you know all that junebride stuff but i told her i wasnt waiting that long youre out of your mind maybe his grin faded but im in yours thea im in there real good and im not getting out he was right about that but it didnt change the bottom line she was not walking down the aisle and saying i do that was that listen colt try reason she thought im very fond of you but youre what his mouth quirked again youre what of me fond she spit out infuriated by the gleam of good humor in his eyes euphemisms affectionately he patted her hand shook his head you disappoint me i had you pegged as a straight shooter forget reason just shut up and let me eat he obliged her because it gave him time to think and to study her she was still a bit pale he mused and her eyes were swollen from the bout of tears during the night but she wouldnt let herself be fragile he had to admire her unceasing supply of strength she didnt want sympathy he remembered she wanted understanding she would just have to learn to accept both from him shed accepted his comfort the night before whether she knew it or not shed already come to rely on him he wasnt about to let her down hows the coffee good and because it was because the meal hed prepared had already conquered her headache she relented thanks my pleasure he leaned forward touched his mouth to hers i dont suppose i could interest you in an afterbreakfast tussle she smiled now fully easily ill have to take a rain check but she spread a hand over his chest and kissed him again her fingers closed over his medal why do you wear this my grandmother gave it to me she said that when a man was determined not to settle down in one place he should have someone looking out for him its worked pretty well so far he set the tray on the floor then scooped althea into his arms nightshade i said i know i know he hitched her up more comfortably but i had this idea that if we had that tussle in the shower we could stay pretty much on schedule she laughed nipped at his shoulder im a firm believer in time management she had more than a full day to fit into twentyfour hours there was a mountain of paperwork waiting for her and she needed to talk to boyd about his interrogation of donner and kline before she met with them herself she wanted for personal as well as professional reasons to interview liz again she sat down and began efficiently chipping away at the mountain cilia knocked on the open door excuse me lieutenant got a minute for the captains wife she said smiling and gesturing cilia inside ive got a minute and a half what are you doing down here boyd filled me in cilia leaned down peered close and as a woman would saw through the meticulously applied cosmetics to the signs of a difficult night are you all right im fine i have decided that anyone who camps out on purpose needs immediate psychiatric help but it was an experience you should try it with three kids no althea said definitely no i shouldnt with a laugh cilia rested a hip against the edge of the desk im so glad you and colt found the girl hows she doing itll be rough for a while but shell come through those creeps should be cilias eyes flashed but she cut herself off i didnt come here to talk cop i came to talk turkey oh as in thanksgiving dont give me that look cilia angled her chin readying for battle every year youve got some excuse for not coming to thanksgiving dinner and this time im not buying it cilia you know i appreciate the offer the hell with that youre family we want you even as althea was shaking her head cilia was plowing on deb and gage are coming you havent seen them in a year althea thought of cilias younger sister deborah and her husband she would like to see deb again theyd gotten close while deborah was in denver finishing up college and gage guthrie althea pursed her lips as she thought of him she genuinely liked deborahs husband and a blind man could have seen that he adored his wife but there was something about him something althea couldnt put her finger on not a bad thing she thought now not a worrying thing but something taking a side trip cilia asked sorry althea snapped back and fiddled with the papers on her desk you know id love to see them again cilia but theyre bringing adrianna cilias secret weapon was her sisters baby girl whom althea had seen only in snapshots and videotapes you and i both know what a sucker you are for babies you want to keep that down althea stated with an uneasy glance toward the bull pen ive got a reputation to uphold around here she sighed and leaned back in her chair you know i want to see them all of them and since im sure theyll be here through the holiday weekend i will well shoot for saturday thanksgiving dinner cilia dusted her hands together as she straightened youre coming this year if i have to tell boyd to make it an order im having my family my whole family cilia thats it cilia folded her arms im taking this to the captain youre in luck boyd said as he came to the door the captain happens to be available and hes brought you a present he stepped aside natalie with a whoop of pleasure cilia threw her arms around her sisterinlaw and squeezed i thought you were in new york i was natalies dark green eyes sparkled with laughter as she drew cilia back to kiss her i had to fly in for a few days and i figured id make this my first stop i didnt know id hit the jackpot you look great you look phenomenal as always it was perfectly true the tall willowslim woman with the sleek blond hair and the conservatively cut suit would always turn heads the kids are going to be thrilled i cant wait to get my hands on them she turned held out both hands thea i cant believe im lucky enough to get all three of you at once its really good to see you with their hands still linked althea pressed her cheek to natalies in the years althea had been boyds partner she and his younger sister had become fast friends how are your parents terrific they send love to everyone in an old habit she glanced around altheas office let out a sigh thea cant you at least get a space with a window i like this one less distractions im calling maria as soon as i get to the station cilia announced shell whip up something special for tonight youre coming thea wouldnt miss it what is this colt demanded as he tried to squeeze into the room a conference thea youre going to have to get a bigger he broke off stared nat her stunned expression mirrored his colt his grin split his face son of a gun he elbowed past boyd to grab natalie in a hug that lifted her feet from the floor ill be damned pretty natalie whats it been six years seven she kissed him full on the mouth we ran into each other in san francisco at the giants game right you look better than ever i am better than ever why dont we have a drink later and catch up now thats he fumbled to a halt when he glanced at althea she was sitting on the edge of her desk watching their reunion with an expression of mild curiosity and polite interest when he realized his arm was still around natalies waist he dropped it quickly to his side actually i ah how was a man supposed to talk to an old female friend when the woman he loved was studying him as if he were something smeared on a glass slide natalie caught the look that passed between althea and colt surprise came first then a chuckle she disguised by clearing her throat well well she thought what an interesting stew shed dropped into she couldnt resist stirring the pot colt and i go way back she said to althea i had a terrible crush on him when i was a teenager she smiled wickedly up at colt ive been waiting for years for him to take advantage of it really althea tapped a finger to her lips he doesnt strike me as being slow off the mark a little dense maybe but not slow youre right about that cute too isnt he she winked at althea in an overt sort of way althea agreed enjoying colts discomfort why dont you and i have that drink later natalie it sounds as though you and i have quite a bit to chat about it certainly does i dont think this is the place to set up social engagements well aware that he was outnumbered and outgunned colt stuck his hands into his pockets althea looks busy oh ive got a minute or two what are you doing in town natalie business always nice when you can mix it with pleasure i have an emergency meeting in an hour with the board of directors on one of boyds and my downtown units owning real estate is a fulltime job without proper management it can be a huge headache she explained you dont happen to own one on second avenue do you althea asked mmm no is one up for sale a gleam came into her eyes and then she laughed its a weakness she explained theres something about owning property even with all the problems that come with it whats the trouble now boyd asked trying to work up some interest the manager decided to up all the rents and keep the difference natalie said her eyes hardening in startling contrast to her soft lovely face i hate being duped pride boyd said and tapped a finger on her nose you hate making a mistake i didnt make a mistake her chin angled upward the mans resume was outstanding when boyd continued to grin she wrinkled her nose at him the problem is you have to give a manager autonomy you cant be everywhere at once i remember one manager we had who was running a floating crap game in an empty apartment he kept it rented under a fake name she continued nearly amused now hed even filled out an application complete with faked references he made enough profit off the games to afford the overhead so the rent came in like clockwork id never have found out if someone hadnt tipped the cops and they raided the place it turned out hed done the same thing twice before good lord althea said looking stunned oh it wasnt that bad natalie went on actually it was pretty exciting stuff i just what is it she demanded when althea sprang to her feet lets move colt was already headed out the door althea grabbed her coat and sprinted after him boyd run a make on nieman he called out i got it you want backup ill let you know when the room emptied natalie threw up her hands and stared at cilia what brought that on cops cilia shrugged that said it all chapter contents prev next i cant believe we let that slip by us colt slammed the door to the jeep and peeled away from the curb this time he didnt bother to remove the parking ticket under the windshield wiper were going on a hunch althea reminded him we could very well get slapped down you dont think so she shut her eyes a moment letting the pieces fall into place it fits she said grimly not one single tenant could swear theyd ever seen this mr davis he was the man who wasnt there maybe because he never was and who would have had access to the penthouse who could have faked references references that didnt have to exist who could have slipped through the building virtually unnoticed because he was always there nieman i told you he was a weasel colt said between his teeth she was forced to agree but cautiously dont get ahead of yourself nightshade were doing some followup questioning thats all im getting answers he shot back thats all dont make me pull rank on you colt she said it quietly calming him were going in there to ask questions we may be able to shake him into slipping up we may very well have to walk out without him but now we have a place to start digging theyd dig all right colt thought deep enough to bury nieman ill follow your lead he said for now he pulled up at a red light drumming his fingers impatiently on the wheel id like to ah explain about nat explain what that we arent werent ever he said savagely got it really shed laugh about this later she was sure once there werent so many other things on her mind still she wasnt so preoccupied that shed blow a chance to bait him why not shes beautiful shes fun shes smart looks like you fell down on that one nightshade it wasnt that i didnt i mean i thought about it started to he swore revved the engine when the light turned she was boyds sister all right before i knew it she was like my sister too so i couldnt think about her that way she sent him a long curious look why are you apologizing im not his voice took on a vicious edge because he realized he was doing just that im explaining though god knows why id bother you think what you want all right i think youre overreacting to a situation in typical and predictable male fashion the look he speared at her should have sliced to the bone she merely smiled i dont hold it against you any more than i would hold it against you if you and natalie had been involved the past is just that i know that better than anyone i guess you do he jammed the gearshift into fourth then reached out to cover her hand with his but we werent involved id have to say that was your loss pal shes terrific so are you she smiled at him yeah i am colt steered to the curb parking carelessly in a loading zone he waited while althea called in their location ready im always ready she stepped out of the car i want to play this light she told colt just followup questions weve got nothing on him nothing if we push too hard well lose our chance if were right about this we are right i can feel it so could she she nodded then i want him for liz for wild bill and for herself she realized to help her close the door this ordeal had opened again they walked in together and approached niemans apartment althea sent colt one last warning look then knocked yes yes niemans voice came through the door what is it lieutenant grayson mr nieman she held her shield up to the peephole denver pd we need a few minutes of your time he pulled open the door to the width of the security chain his eyes darted from altheas face to colts and back again cant this wait im busy im afraid not it shouldnt take long mr nieman just routine oh very well with a definite lack of grace he yanked off the chain come in then when she did althea noted the packing boxes set on the carpet many were filled with shredded paper for althea they were as damning as a smoking gun as you can see youve caught me at a bad time yes i can see that are you moving mr nieman do you think i would stay here work here after this this scandal obviously insulted he tugged on his tightly knotted tie i think not police reporters badgering tenants i havent had a moments peace since this began im sure its been a trial for you colt stated he wanted to get his hands on that tie nieman would hang nicely from it it certainly has well i suppose you must sit nieman waved a hand toward chairs but i really cant spare much time ive a great deal of packing left to do i dont trust the movers to do it he added clumsy always breaking things youve had a lot of experience with moving this from althea as she sat and took out her pad and pencil naturally as ive explained before i travel i enjoy my work he smiled by tightening his lips over his teeth but i find it tedious to remain in one place for too long landlords are always looking for a responsible experienced manager im sure they are she tapped her pencil against the pad the owners of this building she began to flip pages johnston and croy inc yes she nodded when she found the notation they were quite upset when they were told about the activities in the penthouse i should say nieman hitched up the knees of his trousers and sat theyre a respectable company quite successful in the west and southwest of course they blame me thats to be expected because you didnt do a personal interview with the tenant althea prompted the bottom line in real estate lieutenant is regular monthly rentals and low turnover i provided that you also provided the scene of the crime i can hardly be held responsible for the conduct of my tenants it was time althea decided to take a risk a calculated one and you never entered the premises never checked on it why would i i had no reason to bother mr davis or go into the penthouse you never went in while mr davis was in residence althea asked ive just said i didnt she frowned flipped more pages how would you explain your fingerprints something flickered in niemans eyes then was gone i dont know what you mean she was reaching but she pressed a bit further i wondered how you would explain it if i told you that your fingerprints were found inside the penthouse since you claim never to have entered the premises i dont see he was scrambling now oh yes i remember now a few days before before the incident the smoke alarm in the penthouse went off naturally i used my passkey to investigate when no one answered my knock you had a fire colt asked no no simply a defective smoke detector it was so minor an incident i quite forgot it perhaps youve forgotten something else althea said politely perhaps you forgot to tell us about a cabin west of boulder do you manage that property as well i dont know what youre talking about i dont manage any property but this then you just use it for recreation althea continued with mr donner mr kline and mr scott i have no knowledge of a cabin nieman said stiffly but a line of sweat had popped out above his top lip nor do i know any people by those names now youll have to excuse me mr scott isnt quite up to visitors althea told him and remained seated but we can go downtown and see kline and donner that might refresh your memory im not going anywhere with you nieman rose then ive answered all your questions in a reasonable and patient manner if you persist in this harassment ill have to call my attorney feel free althea gestured toward the phone he can meet us at the station in the meantime id like you to think back to where you were on the night of october you could use an alibi whatever for murder thats preposterous he drew a handkerchief out of his breast pocket to wipe his face you cant come in here and accuse me this way im not accusing you mr nieman im asking for your whereabouts on october between the hours of and pm you might also tell your lawyer that well be questioning you about a missing woman known as lacy and about the abduction of elizabeth cook who is currently in protective custody liz is a very bright and observant girl isnt she nightshade yeah she was amazing colt thought absolutely amazing she was cracking nieman into pieces with nothing but innuendo between liz and the sketches the da has plenty to work with i dont believe we mentioned the sketches to mr nieman althea closed her notebook or the fact that both kline and donner were thoroughly interrogated yesterday of course scott is still critical so well have to wait for his corroboration niemans face went pasty theyre lying im a respectable man i have credentials his voice cracked you cant prove anything on the word of some twobit actors i dont believe we mentioned kline and donner were actors did we nightshade no he could have kissed her no we didnt you must be psychic nieman althea stated why dont we go to the station and see what else you can come up with i know my rights niemans eyes glittered with rage as he felt the trap creaking shut im not going anywhere with you ill have to insist althea rose go ahead and call your lawyer nieman but youre coming in for questioning now no womans going to tell me what to do nieman lunged and though althea was braced even eager colt stepped between them and merely used one hand to shove nieman back onto the couch assaulting an officer he said mildly i guess well take him in on that it should give you enough time to get a search warrant more than enough she agreed she took out her cuffs ah lieutenant colt watched as she competently secured niemans skinny wrists they didnt find prints upstairs did they i never said they did she tossed her hair back i simply asked what hed say if i said they were found i was wrong he decided i do like your style thanks satisfied she smiled i wonder what we might find in all these neatly packed boxes they found more than enough tapes snapshots even a detailed journal in niemans own hand it painstakingly recorded all his activities all his thoughts all his hatred for women it described how the woman named lacy had been murdered and how her body had been buried behind the cabin by that afternoon he had been booked on enough charges to keep him away from society for a lifetime a little anticlimactic colt commented as he followed althea into her office where she would type up her report he was so revolting i couldnt even drum up the energy to kill him lucky for you she sat booted up her machine listen if its any consolation i believe he was telling the truth about not touching liz himself im betting the psychiatric profile bears it out impotence accompanied by rage against women and voyeuristic tendencies yeah he just likes to watch his fury came and went althea had been right about not being able to change what had been and to make piles of money from his hobby she added once he rounded up his cameraman and a couple of sleazy actors he went into the business of pandering to others with his peculiar tastes got to give him credit he kept a very precise set of books on his porn business kept him in antiques and silk ties he wont need either one in a cell he rested his hands on her shoulders you did good thea real good i usually do she glanced over her shoulder to study him now all she had to do was figure out what to do about colt listen nightshade i really want to get this paperwork moving and then i need some downtime okay sure i hear theres going to be some spread at the fletchers tonight are you up for it you bet why dont i meet you there all right he leaned down to press his lips to her hair i love you thea she waited until he left shutting her door behind him i know she thought i love you too she went to see liz it helped to be able to give the girl and her family some sort of resolution colt had beaten her to it had already come and gone but althea sensed that liz needed to hear it from her as well well never be able to repay you marleen stood with her arm around liz as if she couldnt bear not to touch her daughter i dont have the words to tell you how grateful we are i shed almost said shed just been doing her job it was the truth but it wasnt all of it just take care of each other she said instead were going to spend a lot more time doing just that marleen pressed her cheek against lizs were going home tomorrow were going into family counseling liz told althea and i im going to join a rape victims support group im a little scared its all right to be scared nodding liz looked at her mother mom can i i just want to talk to lieutenant grayson for a minute sure marleen clung for a final moment ill just go down to the lobby help your father when he gets back with that ice cream thanks liz waited until her mother left the room dad doesnt know how to talk about what happened to me yet its awful hard on him he loves you give him time he cried lizs own eyes filled with tears i never saw him cry before i thought he was too busy with work and stuff to care i was stupid to run away once shed blurted it out she exhaled deeply i didnt think they understood me or what i wanted now i see how bad i hurt them it wont ever be exactly the same again will it no liz it wont but if you help each other through it it can be better i hope so i still feel so empty inside like a part of mes not there anymore youll fill it with something else you cant let this block off your feelings for other people it can make you strong liz but you dont want it to make you hard colt said she sniffled and reached for the box of tissues her mother had left on the coffee table he said whenever i felt like i couldnt make it i should think of you althea stared of me because youd had something horrible happen to you and youd used it to make yourself beautiful inside and out that you hadnt just survived youd triumphed she gave a watery smile and i could too it was funny to hear him talk that way i guess he must like you a lot i like him too and she did althea realized it wasnt a weakness to love someone not when you could admire and respect him at the same time not when he saw exactly what you were and loved you back colts the best liz stated he never lets you down you know no matter what i think i do i was wondering i know the counselings important and everything but i wonder if i could just call you sometimes when i when i dont think i can get through it i hope you will althea rose to go over and sit beside liz she opened her arms you call when youre feeling bad and when youre feeling good we all need somebody who understands us fifteen minutes later althea left the cooks to their ice cream and their privacy she decided she had a lot of thinking to do shed always known where her life was going now that it had taken this sudden and dramatic detour she needed to get her bearings again but colt was waiting for her in the lobby hey lieutenant he tipped her head back and kissed her lightly what are you doing here marleen said youd been by already i went with frank he needed to talk she touched a hand to his cheek youre a good friend nightshade its the only kind of friend there is she smiled because she knew he meant it want a lift ive got my car but when they walked outside together she discovered she didnt want that downtime alone after all look do you want to take a walk or something im wired sure he draped an arm casually over her shoulder you can help me scope out some of the shop windows my mother has a birthday next week resistance surged instantly a kneejerk response im no good at picking out presents for people i dont know youll get to know her he strolled to the corner and turned left heading toward a row of downtown shops he glanced in one window at an elegant display of fine china and crystal hey youre not the type who like registers a pattern and that stuff are you you know for wedding presents get a grip she moved past him so that he had to lengthen his stride to catch up what about a trousseau do women still do that i havent any idea or any interest its not that i mind the tshirt you wore in bed last night i was just thinking that something a little more no a little less would be nice for the honeymoon where do you want to go are you going to cut this out no with an impatient breath she turned and stared at the next window thats a nice sweater she pointed to a rich blue cowlneck on a mannequin maybe shed go for cashmere maybe he nodded fine lets go get it see thats your problem althea whirled around hands on hips you dont give anything enough thought you look at one thing and boom thats it when its the right thing why look around he smiled and tugged on her hair i know what works for me when i see it come on he took her hand and pulled her into the shop the blue sweater in the window he said to the clerk have you got it in a size he measured in the air with his hands ten the clerk guessed certainly sir just one moment you didnt ask how much it cost althea pointed out when somethings right cost is irrelevant he turned to smile at her youre going to keep me in line i appreciate that i tend to let details slip theres news she stepped away to poke through a rack of silk blouses he was careless althea reminded herself he was impulsive and rash and quick on the draw all the things she was not she preferred order routine meticulous calculation she had to be crazy to think they could mesh she turned her head watching him as he waited for the clerk to ring up the sweater and giftwrap it but they did mesh she realized everything about him fitted her like a glove the hair wasnt really blond or brown and was never quite disciplined the eyes caught somewhere between blue and green that could stop her heart with one look his recklessness his dependability his total and unconditional understanding problem he asked when he caught her staring no would you like a pink bow sir or blue pink he said without glancing back do you have any wedding dresses in here not formal ones no sir but the clerks eyes lit up at the prospect of another sale we do have some very elegant tea gowns and cocktail suits that would be perfect for a wedding it should be something festive he decided and the humor was back in his eyes for new years eve althea straightened her shoulders turned on her heel to face him get this nightshade i am not marrying you on new years eve okay okay pick another date thanksgiving she told him and had the pleasure of watching his mouth fall open as he dropped the box the clerk had handed him what i said thanksgiving take it or leave it she tossed her hair back and strode out the door wait damn he started after her kicked the gift box halfway across the room the clerk called after him as he scooped it up on the run sir the dresses later he swung through the door and caught up with althea halfway down the block did you say youd marry me on thanksgiving i hate repeating myself nightshade if you cant keep up thats your problem now if youve finished your shopping im going back to work just one damn minute exasperated he stuffed the box under his arm crushing the bow it freed his hands to snag her by the shoulders what made you change your mind it must have been your smooth subtle approach she said dryly lord she was enjoying this she realized deepdown enjoying it keep manhandling me pal and ill haul you in he shook his head as if to realign his thoughts youre going to marry me she arched a brow aint no flies on you on thanksgiving this thanksgiving the one thats coming up in a few weeks getting cold feet already she began then found her mouth much too occupied for words it was a heady kiss filled with promises and joy do you know the penalty for kissing a police officer on a public street she asked when she could speak again ill risk it good she dragged his mouth back to hers pedestrians wound around them as they clung youre going to get life for this nightshade im counting on it carefully he drew her back so that he could see her face why thanksgiving because id like to have a family to celebrate it with cilias always bugging me to join them but i i couldnt why is this an interrogation or an engagement she demanded both but this is the last one why are you going to marry me because you nagged me until i broke down and i felt sorry for you because you seemed so set on it besides i love you and ive kind of gotten used to you so hold on say that again i said ive kind of gotten used to you grinning he kissed the tip of her nose not that part the part right before that where i felt sorry for you uhuh after that oh the iloveyou part thats the one say it again okay she took a deep breath i love you and let it out its tougher to say it all by itself that way youll get used to it i think youre right he laughed and crushed her against him im betting on it epilogue contents prev next i think i need to consider this again althea stood in front of the fulllength mirror in cilias bedroom staring at her own reflection there was a woman inside the mirror she noted dispassionately a pale woman with a tumble of red hair she looked elegant in a slim ivory suit trimmed with lace and accented with tiny pearl buttons that ran the length of the snugly fitted jacket but her eyes were too big too wide and too fearful i really dont think this is going to work you look fabulous deborah assured her perfect i wasnt talking about the dress she pressed a hand to her queasy stomach i meant the wedding dont start cilia tugged at the line of altheas ivory silk jacket youre fidgeting again of course im fidgeting for lack of anything better to do althea reached up to make sure the pearl drops at her ears were secure colts mother had given them to her she remembered and felt a trickle of warmth at the memory something to be handed down his mother had said as they had been from colts grandmother to her then shed cried a little and kissed altheas cheek and welcomed her to the family family althea thought on a fresh wave of panic what did she know about family im about to commit myself for life to a man ive known a matter of weeks she muttered to the woman in the mirror i should be committed you love him dont you deborah asked what does that have to do with it laughing deborah took altheas restless hand in hers only everything i didnt know gage very long either and had known the depths of his secrets for an even shorter time but i loved him and i knew ive seen the way you look at colt thea you know too lawyers althea complained to cilia they always turn things around on you shes great isnt she pride burst through as cilia gave her sister a hard squeeze the best prosecutor east of the mississippi when youre right youre right deborah returned with a grin now lets take a look at the matron of honor she tilted her head to examine her sister you look wonderful cilia so do you cilia brushed a hand through her sisters dark hair marriage and motherhood agree with you if you two will finish up your admiration hour im having a nervous breakdown over here althea sat down on the bed squeezed her eyes shut i could make a run for it out the back hed catch you cilia decided not if i had a really good head start maybe if i a knock on the door interrupted her if thats nightshade i am not going to talk to him of course not deborah agreed bad luck she opened the door to her husband and daughter that was good luck she thought as she smiled at gage the very best luck of all sorry to break in on the prep work but weve got some restless people downstairs if those kids have touched that wedding cake cilia began boyd saved it gage assured her barely with the baby tucked in one arm he slipped the other around his wife colts wearing a path in the den carpet so hes nervous althea shot back he should be look what hes gotten us into boy would i like to be a fly on the wall down there gage grinned winked at deborah it has its advantages he nuzzled his infant daughter when she began to fuss ill take her gage deborah gathered adrianna into her arms you go help boyd calm down the groom were nearly ready who said althea twisted her hands together cilia brushed gage out of the room closed the door it was time for the big guns coward she said softly now just a minute youre afraid to walk downstairs and make a public commitment to the man you love thats pathetic catching on deborah soothed the baby and played the game now cilia dont be so harsh if shes changed her mind she hasnt she just cant make it up and colts doing everything to make her happy hes selling his ranch buying land out here althea got to her feet thats unfair it certainly is deborah ranged herself beside althea and bit the inside of her lip to keep from grinning id think youd be a little more understanding cilia this is an important decision then she should make it instead of hiding up here like some vestal virgin about to be sacrificed altheas chin jutted out im not hiding deb go out and tell them to start the damn music im coining down all right thea if youre sure deborah patted her arm winked at her sister and hurried out well come on althea stormed to the door lets get going fine cilia sauntered past her then started down the steps althea was nearly to the bottom before she realized shed been conned the two sisters had pulled off the good copbad cop routine like pros now her stomach jumped there were flowers everywhere banks of color and scent there was music soft romantic she saw colts mother leaning heavily against his father and smiling bravely through a mist of tears she saw natalie beaming and dabbing at her eyes deborah her lashes wet cradling adrianna there was boyd reaching out to take cilias hand kissing her damp cheek before looking back at althea to give her an encouraging wink althea came to a dead stop if people cried at weddings she deduced there had to be a good reason then she looked toward the fireplace and saw nothing but colt and he saw nothing but her her legs stopped wobbling she crossed to him carrying a single white rose and her heart good to see you lieutenant he murmured as he took her hand good to see you too nightshade she felt the warmth from the fire that glowed beside them the warmth from him she smiled as he brought her hand to his lips and her fingers were steady happy thanksgiving same goes she brought their joined hands to her lips in turn maybe she didnt know about family but shed learn theyd learn i love you very much same goes ready for this i am now as the fire crackled they faced each other and the life theyd make together night smoke prologue contents prev next fire it cleansed it destroyed with its heat lives could be saved or lives could be taken it was one of the greatest discoveries of man and one of his chief fears and one of his fascinations mothers warned their children not to play with matches not to touch the red glow of the stove for no matter how pretty the flame how seductive the warmth fire against flesh burned in the hearth it was romantic cozy cheerful dancing and crackling wafting scented smoke and flickering soft golden light old men dreamed by it lovers wooed by it in the campfire it shot its sparks toward a starry sky tempting wideeyed children to roast their marshmallows into black goo while shivering over ghost stories there were dark hopeless corners of the city where the homeless cupped their frozen hands over trashcan fires their faces drawn and weary in the shadowy light their minds too numb for dreams in the city of urbana there were many fires a carelessly dropped cigarette smoldering in a mattress faulty wiring overlooked or ignored by a corrupt inspector a kerosene heater set too close to the drapes oily rags tossed in a stuffy closet a flash of lightning an unattended candle all could cause destruction of property loss of life ignorance an accident an act of god but there were other ways more devious ways once inside the building he took several short shallow breaths it was so simple really and so exciting the power was in his hands now he knew exactly what to do and there was a thrill in doing it alone in the dark it wouldnt be dark for long the thought made him giggle as he climbed to the second floor he would soon make the light two cans of gasoline would be enough with the first he splashed the old wooden floor soaking it leaving a trail as he moved from wall to wall from room to room now and again he stopped pulling stock from the racks scattering matchbooks over the stream of flammables adding fuel that would feed the flames and spread them the smell of the accelerant was sweet an exotic perfume that heightened his senses he wasnt panicked he wasnt hurried as he climbed the winding metal stairs to the next floor he was quiet of course for he wasnt a stupid man but he knew the night watchman was bent over his magazines in another part of the building as he worked he glanced up at the spiderlike sprinklers in the ceiling hed already seen to those there would be no hiss of water from the pipes as the flames rose no warning buzz from smoke alarms this fire would burn and burn and burn until the window glass exploded from the angry fists of heat paint would blister metal would melt rafters would fall charred and flaming he wished for a moment he wished he could stay stand in the center of it all and watch the sleeping fire awaken grumbling he wanted to be there to admire and absorb as it stirred snapped then stretched its hot bright body he wanted to hear its triumphant roar as it hungrily devoured everything in its path but he would be far away by then too far to see to hear to smell he would have to imagine it with a sigh he lit the first match held the flame at eye level admiring the infant spark mesmerized by it he was smiling as proud as any expectant father as he tossed the tiny fire into a dark pool of gas he watched for a moment only a moment as the animal erupted into life streaking along the trail hed left for it he left quietly hurrying now into the frigid night soon his feet had picked up the rhythm of his racing heart chapter contents prev next annoyed exhausted natalie stepped into her penthouse apartment the dinner meeting with her marketing executives had run beyond midnight she could have come home then she reminded herself as she stepped out of her shoes but no her office was en route from the restaurant to her apartment she simply hadnt been able to resist stopping in for one more look at the new designs one last check on the ads heralding the grand opening both had needed work and really shed only intended to make a few notes draft one or two memos so why was she stumbling toward the bedroom at am she asked herself the answer was easy she was compulsive obsessive she was natalie thought an idiot particularly since she had an eightoclock breakfast meeting with several of her east coast sales reps no problem she assured herself no problem at all who needed sleep certainly not natalie fletcher the thirtytwoyearold dynamo who was currently expanding fletcher industries into one more avenue of profit and there would be profit shed put all her skill and experience and creativity into building ladys choice from the ground up before profit there would be the excitement of conception birth growth those first pangs and pleasures of an infant company its own way her infant company she thought with tired satisfaction her baby she would tend and teach and nurture and yes when necessary walk the floor at am a glance in the mirror over the bureau told her that even a dynamo needed rest her cheeks had lost both their natural color as well as their cosmetic blush and her face looked entirely too fragile and pale the simple twist that scooped her hair back and had started the evening looking sophisticated and chic now only seemed to emphasize the shadows that smudged her dark green eyes because she was a woman who prided herself on her energy and stamina she turned away from the reflection blowing her honeytoned bangs out of her eyes and rotating her shoulders to ease the stiffness in any case sharks didnt sleep she reminded herself even business sharks but this one was very tempted to fall on the bed fully dressed that wouldnt do she thought and shrugged out of her coat organization and control were every bit as important in business as a good head for figures ingrained habit had her walking to the closet and she was draping the velvet wrap on a padded hanger when the phone rang let the machine get it she ordered herself but by the second ring she was snatching up the receiver hello ms fletcher yes the receiver clanged against the emeralds at her ear she was reaching up to remove the earring when the panic in the voice stopped her its jim banks ms fletcher the night watchman over at the south side warehouse weve got trouble here trouble did someone break in its fire holy god ms fletcher the whole place is going up fire she brought her other hand to the receiver as if it might leap from her ear at the warehouse was anyone in the building is anyone in there no maam there was just me his voice shook cracked i was downstairs in the coffee room when i heard an explosion mustve been a bomb or something i dont know i called the fire department she could hear other sounds now sirens shouts are you hurt no i got out i got out mother of god ms fletcher its terrible its just terrible im on my way it took natalie fifteen minutes to make the trip from her plush westside neighborhood to the dingy south side with its warehouses and factories but she saw the fire heard it before she pulled up behind the string of engines men with their faces smeared with soot manned hoses wielded axes smoke and flame belched from shattered windows and spewed through gaps in the ruined roof the heat was enormous even at this distance it shot out slapping her face while the icy february wind swirled at her back everything she knew everything inside the building was lost ms fletcher struggling against horror and fascination she turned and looked at a round middleaged man in a gray uniform im jim banks oh yes she reached out automatically to take his hand it was freezing and as shaky as his voice youre all right are you sure yes maam its an awful thing they watched the fire and those who fought it for a moment in silence the smoke alarms i didnt hear anything not until the explosion i started to head upstairs and i saw the fire it was everywhere he rubbed a hand over his mouth never in his life had he seen anything like it never in his life did he want to see its like again just everywhere i got out and called the fire department from my truck you did the right thing do you know whos in charge here no ms fletcher i dont these guys work fast and they dont spend a lot of time talking all right why dont you go home now jim ill deal with this if they need to talk to you i have your beeper number and they can call nothing much to do he looked down at the ground and shook his head im mighty sorry ms fletcher so am i i appreciate you calling me thought i should he gave one last glance at the building seemed to shudder then trudged off to his truck natalie stood where she was and waited a crowd had gathered by the time ry got to the scene a fire drew crowds he knew like a good fistfight or a flashy juggler people even took sides and a great many of them rooted for the fire he stepped out of his car a lean broadshouldered man with tired eyes the color of the smoke stinging the winter sky his narrow bony face was set impassive the lights flashing around him shadowed then highlighted the hollows and planes the shallow cleft in his chin that women loved and he found a small nuisance he set his boots on the sodden ground and stepped into them with a grace and economy of motion that came from years of training though flames still licked and sparked his experienced eye told him that the men had contained and nearly suppressed it soon it would be time for him to go to work automatically he put on the black protective jacket covering his flannel shirt and his jeans down past the hips he combed one hand through his unruly hair hair that was a deep dark brown and showed hints of fire in sunlight he set his dented smokestained hat on his head lit a cigarette then tugged on protective gloves and while he performed these habitual acts he scanned the scene a man in his position needed to keep an open mind about fire he would take an overview of the scene the weather note the wind direction talk to the fire fighters there would be all manner of routine and scientific tests to run but first he would trust his eyes and his nose the warehouse was most probably a loss but it was no longer his job to save it his job was to find the whys and the hows he exhaled smoke and studied the crowd he knew the night watchman had called in the alarm the man would have to be interviewed ry looked over the faces one by one excitement was normal he saw it in the eyes of the young man who watched the destruction dazzled and shock in the slackjawed woman who huddled against him horror admiration relief that the fire hadnt touched them or theirs he saw that as well then his gaze fell on the blonde she stood apart from the rest staring straight ahead while the light wind teased her honey blond hair out of its fancy twist expensive shoes ry noted of supple midnight leather as out of place in this part of town as her velvet coat and her fancy face a hell of a face he thought idly lifting the cigarette to his lips again a pale oval that belonged on a cameo eyes he couldnt make out their color but they were dark no excitement there he mused no horror no shock anger maybe just a touch of it she was either a woman of little emotion or one who knew how to control it a hothouse rose he decided and just what was she doing so far out of her milieu at nearly four oclock in the morning hey inspector grimy and wet lieutenant holden trudged over to bum a cigarette chalk up another one for the fighting twentysecond ry knew holden and was already holding the pack out looks like you killed another one this was a bitch cupping his hands against the wind holden lit up fully involved by the time we got here call came in from the night watchman at second and third floors took most of it but the equipment on ones pretty well gone too youll probably find your point of origin on the second yeah though the fire was winding down ry knew holden wasnt just shooting the breeze found some streamers going up the steps at the east end probably started the fire with them but not all the material went up ladies lingerie hmmm ladies lingerie holden said with a grin thats what they were warehousing lots of nighties and undies youve got a nice stream of underwear and matchbooks that didnt go up he slapped ry on the shoulder have fun hey probie he shouted to one of the probationary fire fighters you going to hold that hose or play with it got to watch em every minute ry dont i know it out of the corner of his eye ry watched his hothouse flower pick her way toward a fire engine he and holden separated isnt there anything you can tell me natalie asked an exhausted fire fighter how did it start lady i just put them out he sat on a running board no longer interested in the smoldering wreck of the warehouse you want answers he jerked his thumb in rys direction ask the inspector civilians dont belong at fire scenes ry said from behind her when she turned to look at him he saw that her eyes were green a deep jade green its my fire scene her voice was cool like the wind that eased her hair with a faint drawl that made him think of cowboys and schoolmarms my warehouse she continued my problem is that so ry took another survey she was cold he knew from experience that there was no place colder than a fire scene in winter but her spine was straight and that delicate chin lifted and that would make you natalie fletcher i own the building and everything in it and id like some answers she cocked one elegantly arched brow and that would make you piasecki arson investigator arson shock had her gaping before she snapped back into control you think this was arson its my job to find out he glanced down nearly sneered youre going to ruin those shoes miz fletcher my shoes are the least of my she broke off when he took her arm and started to steer her away what are you doing youre in the way that would be your car wouldnt it he nodded toward a shiny new mercedes convertible yes but get in it i will not get in it she tried to shake him off and discovered she would have needed a crowbar will you let go of me she smelled a hell of a lot better than smoke and sodden debris ry took a deep gulp of her then tried for diplomacy it was something he was proud to admit that had never been his strong suit look youre cold whats the point in standing out in the wind she stiffened against both him and the wind the point is thats my building whats left of it fine theyd do it her way since it suited him but he placed her between the car and his body to shelter her from the worst of the cold its kind of late at night to be checking your inventory isnt it it is she stuck her hands in her pockets trying fruitlessly to warm them i drove out after the night watchman called me and that would have been i dont know around two around two he repeated and let his gaze skim over her again there was a snazzy dinner suit under the velvet he noted the material looked soft expensive and it was the same color as her eyes pretty fancy outfit for a fire i had a late meeting and didnt think to change into more appropriate clothes before i came idiot she thought and looked back grimly at what was left of her property is there a point to this your meeting ran until two no it broke up about midnight how come youre still dressed what how come youre still dressed he took out another cigarette lit it late date no i went by my office to do some paperwork id barely gotten home when jim banks the night watchman called me then you were alone from midnight until two yes i her eyes cut back to his narrowed do you think im responsible for this is that what youre getting at here what the hell was your name piasecki he said and smiled ryan piasecki and i dont think anything yet miz fletcher im just separating the details her eyes were no longer cool controlled they had flared to flash point then ill give you some more the building and its contents are fully insured im with united security what kind of business are you in im fletcher industries inspector piasecki you may have heard of it he had most certainly real estate mining shipping the conglomerate owned considerable property including several holdings in urbana but there were reasons that big companies as well as small ones resorted to arson you run fletcher industries i oversee several of its interests including this one most particularly this one she thought this one was her baby were opening several specialty boutiques countrywide in the spring in addition to a catalog service a large portion of my inventory was in that building what sort of inventory now she smiled lingerie inspector bras panties negligees silks satins lace you might be familiar with the concept enough to appreciate it she was shivering now obviously struggling to keep her teeth from chattering he imagined her feet would be blocks of ice in those thin pricey shoes look youre freezing out here get in the car go home well be in touch i want to know what happened to my building whats left of my stock your building burned down miz fletcher and its unlikely theres anything left of your stock that would raise a mans blood pressure he opened the car door ive got a job to do and id advise you to call your insurance agent youve got a real knack for soothing the victims dont you piasecki no cant say that i do he took a notebook and pencil stub from his shirt pocket give me your address and phone number home and office natalie took a deep breath then let it out slowly before she gave him the information he wanted you know she added ive always had a soft spot for public servants my brothers a cop in denver that so yes thats so she slid into the car youve managed in one short meeting to change my mind she slammed the door sorry she didnt do it quickly enough to catch his fingers with one last glance at the ruined building she drove away ry watched her taillights disappear and added another note to his book great legs not that hed forget he mused as he turned away but a good inspector wrote everything down natalie forced herself to sleep for two hours then rose and took a stingingcold shower wrapped in her robe she called her assistant and arranged to have her morning appointments canceled or shifted with her first cup of coffee she phoned her parents in colorado she was on cup number two by the time she had given them all the details she knew soothed their concern and listened to their advice with cup number three she contacted her insurance agent and arranged to meet him at the site after downing aspirin with the remains of that cup she dressed for what promised to be a very long day she was nearly out of the door when the phone stopped her you have a machine she reminded herself even as she darted back to answer it hello nat its deborah i just heard oh rubbing the back of her neck natalie sat on the arm of a chair deborah oroarke guthrie was a double pleasure both friend and family i guess its hit the news already there was a slight hesitation im sorry natalie really sorry how bad is it im not sure last night it looked about as bad as it gets but im going out now meeting my insurance agent who knows we may salvage something would you like me to come with you i can reschedule my morning natalie smiled deborah would do just that as if she didnt have enough on her plate with her husband her baby her job as assistant district attorney no but thanks for asking ill let you know something when i know something come to dinner tonight you can relax soak up some sympathy id like that if theres anything else i can do just tell me actually you could call denver keep your sister and my brother from riding east to the rescue ill do that oh one more thing natalie rose checked the contents of her briefcase as she spoke what do you know about an inspector piasecki ryan piasecki piasecki there was a slight pause as deborah flipped through her mental files natalie could all but see the process arson squad hes the best in the city he would be natalie muttered is arson suspected deborah said carefully i dont know i just know he was there he was rude and he wouldnt tell me anything it takes time to determine the cause of a fire natalie i can put some pressure on if you want me to it was tempting just for the imagined pleasure of seeing piasecki scramble no thanks not yet anyway ill see you later seven oclock deborah insisted ill be there thanks natalie hung up and grabbed her coat with luck shed beat the insurance agent to the site by a good thirty minutes luck was with her in that area anyway when natalie pulled up behind the firedepartment barricade she discovered she was going to need a great deal more than luck to win this battle it looked worse incredibly worse than it had the night before it was a small building only three floors the cinderblock outer walls had held and now stood blackened and streaked with soot still dripping with water from the hoses the ground was littered with charred and sodden wood broken glass twisted metal the air stank of smoke miserable she ducked under the yellow tape for a closer look what the hell do you think youre doing she jolted then shaded her eyes from the sun to see more clearly she should have known natalie thought when she saw ry making his way toward her through the wreckage didnt you see the sign he demanded of course i saw it this is my property inspector the insurance adjuster is meeting me here shortly i believe im within my rights in inspecting the damage he gave her one disgusted look dont you have any other kind of shoes i beg your pardon stay here muttering to himself he stalked to his car came back with a pair of oversize firemans boots put these on but he took her arm throwing her off balance put those ridiculous shoes into the boots otherwise youre going to hurt yourself fine she stepped into them feeling absurd the tops of the boots covered her legs almost to the knee the navy suit and matching wool coat she wore were runwaymodel smart a trio of gold chains draped around her neck added flash nice look he commented now lets get something straight i need to preserve this scene and that means you dont touch anything he said it even though his authority to keep her out was debatable and hed already found a great deal of what hed been looking for i have no intention of thats what they all say she drew herself up tell me inspector do you work alone because you prefer it or because no one can stand to be around you for longer than five minutes both he smiled then the change of expression was dazzling charming and suspicious she wasnt sure but she thought the faintest of dimples winked beside his mouth what are you doing clunking around a fire scene in a fivehundreddollar suit i wary of the smile she tugged her coat closed i have meetings all afternoon i wont have time to change executives he kept his hand on her arm as he turned come on then be careful where you go the sites not totally safe but you can take a look at what she left you ive still got work to do he led her in through the mangled doorway the ceiling was a yawning pit between floors what had fallen or had been knocked through lay in filthy layers of sodden ash and alligatored wood she shivered once at the sight of the twisted mass of burned mannequins that lay sprawled and broken they didnt suffer ry assured her and her eyes flashed back to his im sure you can view this as a joke but fires never a joke watch your step she saw where hed been working near the base of a broken inner wall there was a small wire screen in a wooden frame a shovel that looked like a childs toy a few mason jars a crowbar a yardstick while she watched ry pried off a scored section of baseboard what are you doing my job she set her teeth are we on the same side here he glanced up maybe with a putty knife he began to scrape at residue he sniffed he grunted and when he was satisfied placed it in a jar do you know what oxidation is ms fletcher she frowned shifted more or less the chemical union of a substance with oxygen it can be slow like paint drying or fast heat and light a fires fast and some things help it move faster he continued to scrape then looked up again held out the knife take a whiff dubious she stepped forward and sniffed what do you smell smoke wet i dont know he placed the residue in the jar gasoline he said watching her face see a liquid seeks its level goes into cracks in the floor into deadair comers flows under baseboard if it gets caught under there it doesnt burn you see the place i cleared out here she moistened her lips studied the floor he had shoveled or swept clear of debris there was a black stain like a shadow burned into the wood yes the charredblob pattern its like a map i keep at this layer by layer and ill be able to tell what happened before during youre telling me someone poured gas in here and lit a match he said nothing only scooted forward a bit to pick up a scrap of burned cloth silk he said with a rub of his fingertips too bad he placed the scrap in what looked like a flour tin sometimes a torch will lay out streamers give the fire more of an appetite they dont always burn he picked up an almost perfectly preserved cup from a lacy bra amused his eyes met natalies over it funny what resists isnt it she was cold again but not from the wind it was from within and it was rage if this fire was deliberately set i want to know interested in the change in her eyes he sat back on his haunches his black firemans coat was unhooked revealing jeans worn white at the knees and a flannel shut he hadnt left the scene since his arrival youll get my report he rose then draw me a picture what did this place look like twentyfour hours ago she closed her eyes for a moment but it didnt help she could still smell the destruction it was three stories about two thousand square feet iron balconies and interior steps seamstresses worked on the third floor all of our merchandise is handmade classy yes thats the idea we have another plant in this district where most of the sewing is done the twelve machines upstairs were just for finish work there was a small coffee room to the left rest rooms on the second the floor was made of linoleum rather than wood we stored the stock there i kept a small office up there as well though i do most of my work uptown the area down here was for inspecting packaging and shipping we were to begin fulfilling our spring orders in three weeks she turned not quite sure where she intended to go and stumbled over debris rys quick grab saved her from a nasty spill hold on he murmured shaken she leaned back against him for a moment there was strength there if not sympathy at the moment she preferred it that way we employed over seventy people in this plant alone people who are out of work until i can sort this out she whirled back he gripped her arms to keep her steady and it was deliberate control he thought well she didnt have it now she was as volatile as a lit match i havent finished my investigation it was deliberate she repeated and youre thinking i could have done it that i came in here in the middle of the night with a can of gasoline her face was close to his funny he thought he hadnt noticed how tall she was in those fancy anklebreaking shoes its a little hard to picture hired someone then she tossed out hired someone to burn down the building even though there was a man in it but whats one security guard against a nice fat insurance check he was silent for a moment his eyes locked on hers you tell me infuriated she wrenched away from him no inspector youre going to have to tell me and whether you like it or not im going be on you like a shadow through every step of the investigation every step she repeated until i have all the answers she strode out of the building dignified despite the awkward boots her temper was barely under control when she saw the car pull up beside hers recognizing it she sighed made her way to the tape barrier and under it donald she held out her hands oh donald what a mess gripping her hands he looked beyond her to the building for a moment he just stood there holding her hands shaking his head how could this have happened the wiring we had the wiring checked two months ago i know im so sorry all your work two years of his life she thought and hers up in smoke everything there was a faint tremor in his voice in his hand as it gripped hers is it all gone im afraid it is we have other inventory donald this isnt going to whip us youre tougher than me nat after a last quick squeeze he released her hands this was my biggest shot youre the ceo but i feel like i was captain and my ship just sank natalies heart went out to him it wasnt simply business with donald hawthorne she thought any more than it was simply business with her this new company was a dream a fresh excitement and a chance for both of them to try something completely different no not just to try she reminded herself to succeed were going to have to work our butts off for the next three weeks he turned back a small smile curving his lips do you really think we can pull it off after this on schedule yes i do determination hardened her lips its a delay thats all so we shuffle things around well certainly have to postpone the audit i cant even think of that now he stopped blinked jesus nat the files the records i dont think were going to salvage any of the paperwork that was in the warehouse she looked back toward her building its going to make things more complicated add some work hours but well put it back together but how can we manage the audit when it goes on the back burner until were up and running well talk about it back at the office as soon as i meet the insurance agent get the ball rolling im heading back in already her mind was working out the details the steps and stages well put on some double shifts order new material pull in some inventory from chicago and atlanta well make it work donald ladys choice is going to open in march come hell or high water his smile flashed into a grin if anybody can make it work you can we can she told him now i need you to get back uptown start making calls pr she knew was his strong suit he was overly impulsive perhaps but she needed the actionoriented with her now you get melvin and deirdre hopping donald bribe or threaten distributors plead with the union soothe the clients thats what you do best im on it you can count on me i know i can ill be in the office soon to crack the whip boyfriend ry wondered as he watched the two embrace the tall polished executive with the pretty face and shiny shoes looked to be her type as a matter of course he noted down the license number of the lincoln beside natalies car then went back to work chapter contents prev next shes going to be here any minute assistant district attorney deborah oroarke guthrie put fisted hands on her hips i want the whole story gage before natalie gets here gage added another log to the fire before he turned to his wife shed changed out of her business suit into soft wool slacks and a cashmere sweater of midnight blue her ebony hair fell loose nearly to her shoulders youre beautiful deborah i dont tell you that often enough she lifted a brow oh he was a smooth operator and charming and clever but so was she no evasions gage youve managed to avoid telling me everything you know so far but you were in court all day he reminded her i was in meetings thats beside the point im here now you certainly are he walked to her slipped his arms through hers and circled her waist his lips curved as they lowered to hers hello more than two years of marriage hadnt diluted her response to him her mouth softened parted but then she remembered herself and stepped back no you dont consider yourself under oath and in the witness chair guthrie spill it i know you were there i was there annoyance flickered in his eyes before he crossed over to pour mineral water for deborah yes hed been there he thought too late he had his own way of combating the dark side of urbana the gift or the curse hed been left with after surviving what should have been a fatal shooting gave him an edge hed been a cop too long to close his eyes to injustice now with the odd twist fate had dealt him he fought crime his own way with his own special talent deborah watched him stare down at his hand flex it it was an old habit one that told her he was thinking of how he could make it make himself fade to nothing and when he did he was nemesis a shadow that haunted the streets of urbana a shadow that had slipped into her life and her heart as real and as dear to her as the man who stood before her i was there he repeated and poured a glass of wine for himself but too late to do anything i didnt beat the first engine company by more than five minutes you cant always be first on the scene gage deborah murmured even nemesis isnt omnipotent no he handed her the glass the point is i didnt see who started the fire if indeed it was arson which you believe it was he smiled again i have a suspicious mind so do i she tapped her glass against his i wish there was something i could do for natalie shes worked so hard to get this new company off the ground youre doing something gage told her youre here and shell fight back thats one thing you can count on she tilted her head i dont suppose anyone saw you around the warehouse last night now he grinned what do you think she blew out a breath i think ill never quite get used to it when the doorbell sounded deborah set her glass aside ill get she hurried to the door then opened her arms to natalie im so glad you could come i wouldnt miss one of franks meals for anything determined to be cheerful natalie kissed deborah then linked arms with her as they walked back into the sitting room she offered her host a brilliant smile hello gorgeous she kissed gage as well accepted the drink he offered and a seat by the fire she sighed once a beautiful house a beautiful couple so incredibly in love natalie told herself if she were inclined toward domesticity she might be envious how are you coping deborah asked her well i love a challenge and this is a big one the bottom line is ladys choice will have its grand opening nationwide in three weeks i was under the impression that you lost quite a bit of merchandise gage commented cloaked by the shadow of his gift hed watched her arrive at the scene the night before as well as the building there are other buildings in fact she had already arranged to purchase another warehouse it would even after the insurance payoff put a dent in the estimated profits for the year but they would make it up natalie thought she would see to that were going to be working overtime for a while to make up some of the losses and i can pull some stock in from other locations urbanas our flagship store i intend for it to go off with a bang she sipped her wine running the stages through her mind ive got donald with a phone glued to his ear with his background in public relations hes the best qualified to beg and borrow melvins already flown out on a fourcity jaunt to swing through the other plants and stores hell work some of his wizardry in figuring who can spare what merchandise and deirdres working on the figures ive talked to the union leaders and some of the laborers i intend to be back in full production within fortyeight hours gage toasted her if anyone can do it he was a businessman himself among other things and knew exactly how much work how much risk and how much sweat natalie would face is there anything new on the fire itself not specifically frowning natalie glanced into the cheerful flames in the hearth so harmless she thought so attractive ive talked with the investigator a couple of times he implies he interrogates and by god he irritates but he doesnt commit ryan piasecki deborah stated and it was her turn to smile i stole a few minutes today to do some checking on him i thought youd be interested bless you natalie leaned forward so whats the story hes been with the department for fifteen years fought fires for ten and worked his way up to lieutenant a couple of smears in his file natalies lips curved smugly oh really apparently he belted a city councilman at a fire scene broke his jaw violent tendencies natalie muttered i knew it it was what they call a class c fire deborah continued in a chemical plant piasecki was with engine company and they were the first to respond there was no backup economic cutbacks she added as natalies brows knit number lost three men in that fire and two more were critically injured the councilman showed up with the press in tow and began to pontificate on our system at work hed spearheaded the cutbacks damn it natalie blew out a breath i guess id have belted him too there was another disciplinary action when he stormed into the mayors office with a bagful of firesite salvage and dumped it on the desk it was from a lowrent apartment building on the east side that had just passed inspection even though the wiring was bad the furnace faulty no smoke alarms broken fire escapes twenty people died i wanted you to tell me that my instincts were on target natalie muttered that i had a good reason for detesting him sorry deborah had developed a soft spot for men who fought crime and corruption in untraditional manners she shot gage a look that warmed them both well natalie sighed what else do you have on him he moved to the arson squad about five years ago he has a reputation for being abrasive aggressive and annoying thats better and for having the nose of a bloodhound the eyes of a hawk and the tenacity of a pit bull he keeps digging and digging until he finds the answers ive never had to use him in court but i asked around you cant shake him on the stand hes smart he writes everything down everything and he remembers it hes thirtysix divorced hes a team player who prefers to work alone i suppose it should make me feel better knowing im in competent hands natalie moved her shoulders restlessly but it doesnt i appreciate the profile no problem deborah began then broke off when the sound of crying came through the baby monitor beside her sounds like the boss is awake no ill go she said when gage got to his feet she just wants company am i going to get a peek natalie asked sure come on ill tell frank to hold dinner until youre done with a frown in his eyes gage watched natalie head upstairs with his wife you know natalie said as they started up to the nursery you look fabulous i dont see how you manage it all a demanding career a dynamic husband and all the social obligations that go with him and the adorable adrianna i could tell you its all a matter of time management and prioritizing with a grin deborah opened the door of the nursery but what it really comes down to is passion for the job for gage for our addy theres nothing you cant have if youre passionate about it the nursery was a symphony of color murals on the ceiling told stories of princesses and magic horses primary tones brightened the walls and bled into rainbows with her hands gripped on the rail of her jenny lind crib legs wobbling tenmonthold addy pouted oblivious of the ambiance oh sweetie deborah reached down picked her up to nuzzle here you are all wet and lonely the pout transformed into a beaming satisfied smile mama natalie watched while deborah laid addy on the changing table shes prettier every time i see her gently she brushed at the dark thatch of hair on the babys head pleased with the attention addy kicked her feet and began to babble were thinking about having another another natalie blinked into deborahs glowing face already well its still in the whatif stage but wed really like to have three she pressed a kiss to the soft curve of addys neck chuckling when she tugged on her hair i just love being a mother it shows can i once the fresh diaper was in place natalie lifted the baby there was envy she discovered for this small miracle who curved so perfectly into her arms two days later natalie was at her desk a headache drumming behind her eyes she didnt mind it the incessant throbbing pushed her forward if the mechanic cant repair the machines get new ones i want every seamstress online no tomorrow afternoon wont do she tapped a pen on the edge of her desk shifted the phone from ear to ear today ill be in myself by one to check on the new stock i know its a madhouse lets keep it that way she hung up and looked at her three associates donald he skimmed a hand over his burnished hair the first ad runs in the times on saturday fullpage threecolor the ad with necessary variations will be running in the other cities simultaneously the changes i wanted implemented catalogs shipped today they look fabulous yes they do pleased natalie glanced down at the glossy catalog on her desk melvin as was his habit melvin glasky slipped off his rimless glasses polishing them as he spoke he was in his midfifties addicted to bow ties and golf he was thin of frame and pink of cheek and sported a saltandpepper toupee that he naively believed was his little secret atlanta looks the best though chicago and la are gearing up he gestured to the report on her desk i worked out deals with each location for inventory transfers not everybody was happy about it his lenses glinted like diamonds when he set them back on his nose the store manager in chicago defended her stock like a mama bear she didnt want to give up one brassiere natalies lips twitched at his drawling pronunciation so so i blamed it on you natalie leaned back in her chair and chuckled of course you did i told her that you wanted twice what youd told me you needed which gave me negotiating room she figured you should filch from catalog i agreed his eyes twinkled then i told her how you considered catalog sacred wouldnt touch one pair of panties because you wanted all catalog orders fulfilled within ten days of order youre inflexible her lips twitched again in the eighteen months theyd worked together on this project shed come to adore melvin i certainly am so i told her how id take the heat and half of what you ordered youd have made a hell of a politician melvin what do you think i am in any case youve got about fifty percent of your inventory back for the flagship store i owe you deirdre ive run the projected increases in payroll and material expenses deirdre marks tossed her flyaway ginger braid behind her shoulder her slightly flattened tones were pure midwest and her mind was as quick and controlled as a hightech computer also the outlay for the new site and equipment with the incentive bonuses you authorized well be in the red ive done graphs ive seen them mulling over her options natalie rubbed the back of her neck the insurance money when it comes through will offset that somewhat im willing to risk my investment and add to it to see that this works from a straight financial standpoint deirdre continued any return looks dim at least in the foreseeable future firstyear sales alone would have to be in excess of she shrugged her narrow shoulders at natalies stubborn expression you have the figures yes and i appreciate the extra work the files at the south side warehouse were destroyed fortunately id had maureen make copies of the bulk of them she rubbed her eyes caught herself and folded her hands im very aware that the majority of new business ventures fold within the first year this isnt going to be one of them im not looking for shortterm profits but for longterm success i intend for ladys choice to be at the top on retail and direct sales within ten years so im certainly not going to take a step back at the first real obstacle she flicked a finger over a button when her buzzer sounded yes maureen inspector piasecki would like to see you ms fletcher he doesnt have an appointment automatically natalie scanned her desk calendar she could spare piasecki fifteen minutes and still make it to the new warehouse well have to finish this later she said with a glance at her associates show him in maureen ry preferred meeting friends or foes on their own turf he hadnt yet decided which category natalie fletcher fell into he had however decided to swing by her office to get a firsthand look at that part of her operation he couldnt say he was disappointed fancy digs for a fancy lady he thought thick carpet lots of glass softcolored cushy chairs in the waiting area original paintings on the walls live thriving plants and her secretary or assistant or whatever title the pretty little thing at the lobby desk carried worked with topgrade equipment the bosss office was no surprise either rys quick scan showed him more thick carpet in slate blue rosy walls decorated with the splashy modern art hed never cared for antique furniture probably the real thing her desk was some old european piece he supposed they went in for all that gingerbread work and curves natalie sat behind it in one of her tidy suits a wide tinted window at her back three other people stood like soldiers ready to snap to attention at her command he recognized the younger man as the one shed embraced at the fire site tailored suit shiny leather shoes ruthlessly knotted tie pretty face blowdried hair soft hands the second man was older and looked to be on the edge of a smile he wore a polkadot bow tie and a mediocre toupee the woman made a fine foil for her boss boxy jacket slightly wrinkled flatheeled shoes messy hair that couldnt decide if it wanted to be red or brown closing in on forty ry judged and not much interested in fighting it inspector natalie waited a full ten seconds before rising and holding out a hand ms fletcher he gave her long narrow fingers a perfunctory squeeze inspector piasecki is investigating the warehouse fire and in his usual uniform of jeans and a flannel shirt she noted didnt the city issue official attire inspector these are three of my toplevel executives donald hawthorne melvin glasky and deirdre marks ry nodded at the introductions then turned his attention to natalie again id have thought a smart woman like you would know better than to put her office on the fortysecond floor i beg your pardon it makes rescue hell not only for you but for the department no way to get a ladder up here that windows for looks not for ventilation or escape youve got fortytwo floors to get down in a stairway thats liable to be filled with smoke natalie sat again without asking him to join her this building is equipped with all necessary safety devices sprinklers smoke detectors extinguishers he only smiled so was your warehouse ms fletcher her headache was coming back doubletime inspector did you come here to update me on your investigation or to criticize my work space i can do both if youll excuse us natalie glanced toward her three associates once the door had closed behind them natalie gestured to a chair lets clear the air here you dont like me i dont like you but we both have a common goal very often i have to work with people i dont care for on a personal level it doesnt stop me from doing my job she tilted her head aimed what he considered a very cool very regal stare at him does it stop you he crossed his scuffed hightops at the ankles nope good now what do you have to tell me ive just filed my report you no longer have a suspicious fire youve got arson despite the fact that shed been expecting it her stomach clutched once theres no question she shook her head before he could speak no there wouldnt be ive been told youre very thorough have you you ought to try aspirin before you rub a hole in your head annoyed natalie dropped the hand shed been using to massage her temple whats the next step ive got cause method point of origin i want motive arent there people who set fires simply because they enjoy it because theyre compelled to sure he started to reach for a cigarette then noticed there wasnt an ashtray in sight maybe youve got a gardenvariety spark or maybe youve got a hired torch you were carrying a lot of insurance ms fletcher thats right i had a reason for it i lost over a million and a half in merchandise and equipment alone you were covered for a hell of a lot more if you know anything at all about real estate inspector youre aware that the building was quite valuable if youre looking for insurance fraud youre wasting your time ive got time he rose im going to need a statement ms fletcher official tomorrow my office two oclock she rose as well i can give you a statement here and now my office ms fletcher he took a card out of his pocket set it on her desk look at it this way if youre in the clear the sooner we get this done the sooner you collect your insurance very well she picked up the card and slipped it into the pocket of her suit the sooner the better is that all for the moment inspector yeah his eyes skimmed down to the cover of the catalog lying on the desk an ivoryskinned model was curled over a velvet settee showing off a backless red gown with a froth of tantalizing lace at the bodice nice his gaze shot back to natalies a classy way to sell sex romance inspector some people still enjoy it do you i dont think that applies i just wondered if you believe in what youre selling or if you just go for the bucks just as hed wondered if she wore her own products under those neatly tailored suits then ill satisfy your curiosity i always believe in what im selling and i enjoy making money im very good at it she picked up the catalog and held it out to him why dont you take this along all our merchandise is unconditionally guaranteed the tollfree number will be in full operation on monday if shed expected him to refuse or fumble she was disappointed ry rolled the catalog into a tube and tucked it into his hip pocket thanks now if youll excuse me i have an outside appointment she stepped out from behind the desk hed been hoping for that whatever he thought about her he enjoyed her legs need a lift surprised she turned away from the small closet at the end of the room no i have a car it more than surprised her when he came up behind her to help her on with her coat his hands lingered lightly briefly on her shoulders youre stressed out ms fletcher im busy inspector she turned off balance and was annoyed when she had to jerk back or bump up against him and jumpy he added with a quick satisfied curve of his lips hed wondered if she was as elementally aware of him as he was of her a suspicious man might say those were signs of guilt it so happens im a suspicious man but you know what i think im fascinated by what you think sarcasm apparently had no effect on him he just continued to smile at her i think youre just made up that way tense and jumpy youve got plenty of control and you know just how to keep the fires banked but now and again it slips its interesting when it does it was slipping now she could feel it sliding greasily out of her hands do you know what i think inspector the dimple that should have been out of place on his strong face winked im fascinated by what you think ms fletcher i think youre an arrogant narrowminded irritating man who thinks entirely too much of himself id say were both right and youre in my way youre right about that too but he didnt move wasnt quite ready to damned if you dont have the fanciest face she blinked i beg your pardon an observation youre one classy number his fingers itched to touch so he dipped them into his pockets hed thrown her off that was obvious from the way she was staring at him half horrified half intrigued ry saw no reason not to take advantage of it a mans hardpressed not to do a little fantasizing once hes had a good look at you ive had a couple of good looks now i dont think only sheer pride prevented her stepping back or forward i dont think this is appropriate if we ever get to know each other better youll find out that propriety isnt at the top of my list tell me do you and hawthorne have a personal thing going his eyes dark intense close dazzled her for a moment donald of course not appalled she caught herself thats none of your business her answer pleased him on professional and personal levels everything about you is my business she tossed up her chin eyes smoldering so this pitiful excuse for a flirtation is just a way to get me to incriminate myself i didnt think it was that pitiful obvious he admitted but not pitiful on a professional level it worked i could have lied you have to think before you lie and you werent thinking he liked the idea of being able to frazzle her and pushed a little further it so happens that on a strictly personal level i like the way you look but dont worry it wont get in the way of the job i dont like you inspector piasecki you said that already for his own pleasure he reached out tugged her coat closed button up its cold out there my office he added as he turned for the door tomorrow two oclock he strolled out thinking of her natalie fletcher he mused punching the elevator button for the lobby highclass brains in a firstclass package maybe shed torched her own building for a quick profit she wouldnt be the first or the last but his instincts told him no she didnt strike him as a woman who looked for shortcuts he stepped into the elevator car which tossed his own image back to him in smoked glass everything about her was topoftheline and her background just didnt equal fraud fletcher industries generated enough profit annually to buy a couple of small third world countries this new arm of it was natalies baby and even if it folded in the first year it wouldnt shake the corporate foundations of course there was emotional attachment to be considered those same instincts told him she had a great deal of emotional attachment to this new endeavor that was enough for some to try to eke out a quick profit to save a shaky investment but it didnt jibe not with her someone else in the company maybe a competitor hoping to sabotage her business before it got off the ground or a classic pyro looking for a thrill whatever it was hed find it and he thought he was going to enjoy rattling natalie fletchers cage while he was going about it one classy lady he mused he imagined shed look good damn good modeling her own merchandise the beeper hooked to his belt sounded as he stepped from the elevator another fire he thought and moved quickly to the nearest phone there was always another fire chapter contents prev next ry kept her cooling her heels for fifteen minutes it was a standard ploy one shed often used herself to psych out an opponent she was determined not to fall for it there wasnt even enough room in the damn closet he called an office to pace he worked in one of the oldest fire stations in the city two floors above the engines and trucks in a small glassedin box that offered an uninspiring view of a cracked parking lot and sagging tenements in the adjoining room natalie could see a woman pecking listlessly at a typewriter that sat on a desk overflowing with files and forms the walls throughout were a dingy yellow that might decades ago have been white they were checkerboard with photos of fire scenes some of which were grim enough to have had her turning away bulletins flyers and a number of polish jokes in dubious taste obviously ry had no problem shrugging off the clichéd humor about his heritage metal shelves were piled with books binders pamphlets and a couple of trophies each topped with a statuette of a basketball player and she noted with a sniff dust his desk slightly larger than a card table and badly scarred was propped up under one shortened leg by a tattered paperback copy of the red pony the man didnt even have respect for steinbeck when her curiosity got the better of her natalie rose from the folding chair with its torn plastic seat and poked around his desk no photographs she noted no personal mementos bent paper clips broken pencils a claw hammer a ridiculous mess of disorganized paperwork she pushed at some of that then jumped back in horror when she revealed the decapitated head of a doll she might have laughed at herself if it wasnt so hideous the remnant of a childs toy the frizzy blond hair nearly burned away the once rosy face melted into mush on one side one bright blue eye remained staring souvenirs ry said from the doorway hed been watching her for a couple of minutes from a class a fire up in the east sixties the kid made it he glanced down at the head on his desk she was in a little better shape than her doll her shudder was quick and uncontrollable thats horrible yeah it was the kids father started it with a can of kerosene in the living room the wife wanted a divorce when he was finished she didnt need one he was so cold about it she thought maybe he had to be you have a miserable job inspector thats why i love it he glanced around as the outer door opened have a seat ill be right with you ry pulled the office door closed before he turned to the uniformed fire fighter whod come in behind him through the glass natalie could hear the mutter of voices she didnt need to hear ry raise his voice as he soon did to know that the young fireman was receiving a firstclass dressingdown who told you to ventilate that wall probie sir i thought probies dont think youre not smart enough to think if you were youd know what fresh air does for a fire youd know what happens when you let it in and theres a damn puddle of fuel oil sloshing under your boots yes sir i know sir i didnt see it the smoke youd better learn to see through smoke youd better learn to see through everything and when the fire goes into the frigging wall you dont take it on yourself to give it a way out while youre standing in accelerant youre lucky to be alive probie and sos the team who were unlucky enough to be with you yes sir i know sir you dont know diddly thats the first thing you remember the next time you go in to eat smoke now get out of here natalie crossed her legs when ry came into the room youre a real diplomat that kid couldnt have been more than twenty be nice if he lived to a ripe old age wouldnt it with a flick of his wrist ry tugged down the blinds closing them in your technique makes me regret i didnt bring a lawyer with me relax he moved to his desk pushed some files out of his way i dont have the authority to arrest just to investigate well ill sleep easy now deliberately she took a long look at her watch how long do you think this is going to take ive already wasted twenty minutes i got held up he sat opened the bag hed brought in with him have you had lunch no her eyes narrowed as he took out a wrapped package that smelled tantalizingly of deli are you telling me that youve kept me waiting in here while you picked up a sandwich it was on my way he offered her half of a corned beef on rye ive got a couple of coffees too ill take the coffee keep the sandwich suit yourself he handed her a small insulated cup mind if we record this id prefer it eating with one hand he opened a desk drawer took out a tape recorder you must have a closet full of those suits this one was the color of crushed raspberries and fastened at the left hip with gold buttons do you ever wear anything else i beg your pardon small talk ms fletcher im not here for small talk she snapped back and stop calling me ms fletcher in that irritating way no problem natalie just call me ry he switched on the recorder and began by reciting the time date and location of the interview despite the tape he took out a notebook and pencil this interview is being conducted by inspector ryan piasecki with natalie fletcher re the fire at the fletcher industries warehouse south harbor avenue on february of this year he took a sip of his coffee ms fletcher you are the owner of the aforesaid building and its contents the building and its contents are were the property of fletcher industries of which i am an executive officer how long has the building belonged to your company for eight years it was previously used to warehouse inventory for fletcher shipping the heater beside him began to whine and gurgle ry kicked it carelessly it went back to a subdued hum and now fletcher shipping moved to a new location she relaxed a little it was going to be routine now business the warehouse was converted nearly two years ago to accommodate a new company we used the building for manufacturing and warehousing merchandise for ladys choice we make ladies lingerie and what were the hours of operation normally eight to six monday through friday in the last six months we expanded that to include saturdays from eight to noon he continued to eat asking standard questions about business practices security vandalism her answers were quick cool and concise you have a number of suppliers yes we use american companies only thats a firm policy ups the overhead in the short term i believe in the long term the company will generate profits to merit it youve put a lot of personal time into this company incurred a lot of expenses invested your own money thats right what happens if the business doesnt live up to your expectations it will he leaned back now enjoying what was left of his cooling coffee if it doesnt then i would lose my time and my money when was the last time you were in the building before the fire the sudden change of topic surprised but didnt throw her i went by for a routine check three days before the fire that would have been the ninth of february he noted it down did you notice any inventory missing no damaged equipment no any holes in security no i would have dealt with any of those things immediately did he think she was an idiot work was progressing on schedule and the inventory i looked over was fine his eyes cut back to hers lingered you didnt look over everything i did a spot check inspector the stare was designed to make her uncomfortable she knew she refused to allow it it isnt a productive use of time for me or my staff to examine every negligee or garter belt the building was inspected in november you were up to code on all fire regulations thats right can you explain how it was that on the night of the fire the sprinkler and smoke alarm systems were inoperative inoperative her heart picked up a beat im not sure what you mean they were tampered with ms fletcher so was your security system she kept her eyes level with his no i cant explain it can you he took out a cigarette flicked a wooden match into flame with his thumbnail do you have any enemies her face went blank enemies anyone whod like to see you fail personally or professionally i no i cant think of anyone personally the idea left her shaken she pulled a hand through her hair from the crown to the tips that swung at chin level naturally i have competitors anyone whos given you trouble no disgruntled employees fire anyone lately no i cant speak for every level of the organization i have managers who have autonomy in their own departments but nothings come back to me he continued to smoke as he asked questions took notes he wound the interview down closing it by logging the time i spoke to your insurance adjuster this morning he told her and your security guard i have interviews set up with the foremen at the warehouse when she didnt respond he crushed out his cigarette want some water no she let out a breath thank you do you think im responsible what i know goes into the report not what i think i want to know she stood then im asking you to tell me what you think she didnt belong here that was the first thought that crossed his mind not here in the cramped little room that smelled of whatever the men were cooking downstairs boardrooms and bedrooms he was certain shed be equally adept in both venues i dont know natalie maybe its your pretty face affecting my judgment but no i dont think youre responsible feel better not much i suppose my only choice now is to depend on you to find out the who and why she let out a little sigh as much as it galls me i have a feeling youre just the man for the job a compliment and so early in our relationship with any luck itll be the first and the last she shifted reached down for her briefcase he moved quickly and quietly before she could lift it his hand closed over hers on the strap take a break she flexed her hand under his once felt the hard callused palm then went still excuse me youre revved natalie but youre running on empty you need to relax it was unlikely she would or could with him holding on to her what i need to do is get back to work so if thats all inspector i thought we were on a firstname basis now come on i want to show you something i dont have time she began as he pulled her out of the room i have an appointment you always seem to arent you ever late no every mans fantasy woman beautiful smart and prompt he led her down a staircase how tall are you without the stilts she lifted a brow at his description of her elegant italian pumps tall enough he stopped one step below her and turned they were lined up eye to eye mouth to mouth yeah id say you are just tall enough he tugged her as he might have a disinterested mule until they reached the ground floor there were scents wafting out from the kitchen chili was on the menu for tonight a couple of men were checking equipment on one of the engines another was rolling a hose on the chilly concrete floor ry was greeted with salutes and quick grins natalie with pursed lips and groans they cant help it ry told her we dont get legs like yours walking through here every day ill give you a boost what ill give you a boost he repeated as he opened the door on an engine not that the guys wouldnt appreciate the way that skirt would ride up if you climbed in on your own but before she could protest ry had gripped her by the waist and lifted her she had a moment to think the strength in his arms was uncannily effortless before he joined her move over he ordered unless youd rather sit on my lap she scooted across the seat why am i sitting in a fire engine everybody wants to at least once very much at home he stretched his arm over the seat so what do you think she scanned the gauges and dials the oversize gearshift the photo of miss january taped to the dash its interesting thats it she caught her bottom lip between her teeth she wondered which control operated the siren which the lights okay its fun she leaned forward for a better view through the windshield were really up here arent we is this the he caught her hand just before she could yank the cord over her head horn he finished the men are used to it but believe me with the acoustics in here and the outside doors shut youd be sorry if you sounded it too bad she skimmed back her hair as she turned her face toward him are you showing me your toy to relax me or just to show off both howm i doing maybe youre not quite the jerk you appear to be you keep being so nice to me im going to fall in love she laughed and realized she was almost relaxed i think were both safe on that count what made you decide to sit in a fire engine for ten years youve been checking up on me idly he lifted his fingers just enough to reach the tips of her hair soft he thought like sunny silk thats right she shot him a look so so i guess were even im a thirdgeneration smoke eater its in the blood mmm that she understood but you gave it up no i shifted gears thats different she supposed it was but it wasnt a real answer why do you keep that souvenir on your desk she watched his eyes closely as she asked the dolls head its from my last fire the last one i fought he could still remember it the heat the smoke the screaming i carried the kid out the bedroom door was locked my guess is hed herded his wife and kid in you know you cant live with me you wont live without me he had a gun it wasnt loaded but she wouldnt have known that thats horrible she wondered if she would have risked the gun and thought she would have better a bullet fast and final than the terrors of smoke and flame his own family some guys dont take kindly to divorce he shrugged his own had been painless enough almost anticlimactic the way it came out he made them sit there while the fire got bigger and the smoke snuck under the door it was a frame house old went up like a matchstick the woman had tried to protect the kid had curled over her in a corner i couldnt get them both at once so i took the kid his eyes changed now darkened focused on something only he could see the woman was gone anyway i knew she was gone but theres always a chance i was headed down the steps with the kid when the floor gave way you saved the child natalie said gently the mother saved the child he could never forget that could never forget that selfless and hopeless devotion the son of a bitch who torched the house jumped out the secondstory window oh he was burned smoke inhalation broken leg but he lived through it he cared she realized she hadnt seen that before or hadnt wanted to it changed him changed her perception of him and you decided to go after the men who start them instead of the fires themselves more or less he snapped his head up like a wolf scenting prey when the alarm shrilled the station sprang to life with running feet shouted orders ry pitched his voice over the din lets get out of the way he pushed open the door caught natalie in one arm and swung out chemical plant someone said as they hurried by pulling on protective gear in seconds it seemed the engines were manned and screaming out the arched double doors its so fast natalie said ears still ringing pulse still jumping they move so fast yeah its exciting she pressed a hand to her speeding heart i didnt realize do you miss it she looked up at him then and her hand went limp he was still holding her against him and his eyes were dark and focused on hers now and again well its i should go yeah you should go but he shifted her until she was wrapped in both his arms maybe it was a kneejerk reaction to the sirens maybe it was the exotic and irresistible scent of her but his blood was pumping and he wanted to see just once if she tasted as good as she looked this is insane she managed to say she knew what he intended to do what she wanted him to do this has got to be wrong his lips curved just a little whats your point then his mouth closed over hers she didnt push back for nearly one heartbeat she didnt respond in that instant she thought shed been paralyzed struck deaf dumb and blind then in a tidal wave every sense flooded back every nerve snapped every pulse jolted his mouth was hard as his hands were as his body was she felt terrifyingly gloriously feminine pressed against him a need she hadnt been aware of exploded into bloom her briefcase hit the floor with a thud as she wrapped herself around him he was no longer thinking just once a man would starve to death after only one taste a man would certainly beg for more she was soft and strong and sinfully sweet with a flavor that both tempted and tormented heat radiated between them as the wind whipped in through the open doors at their back the clatter of street noises horns and tires sounded around them along with her dazed throaty moan he pulled back once to look at her face saw himself in the cloudy green of her eyes and then his mouth crushed hers again no this wasnt going to happen just once she couldnt breathe no longer wanted to his lips were moving against hers forming words she could neither hear nor understand for the first time in her memory she could do nothing but feel and the feelings came so fast so sharp and strong they left her in tatters he pulled back again staggered by what had ripped through him in so short a time he was winded weak and the sensation infuriated as much as it baffled him she only stood there staring at him with a mixture of shock and hunger in her eyes sorry he muttered and hooked his thumbs in his pockets sorry she repeated she sucked in a deep breath wondered if her head would ever stop spinning sorry thats right he couldnt decide whether to curse her or himself damn it his knees were weak that was out of line out of line she brushed her hair back from her face furious to find her skin heated hed torn aside every defense every line of control and now he dared to apologize her chin snapped up her shoulders straightened youve certainly got a way with words tell me inspector do you paw all your suspects his eyes narrowed kindled it was mutual pawing and no youre the first lucky me amazed appalled that she was very near tears natalie snatched up her briefcase i believe this concludes our meeting hold it ryan played fair and cursed them both when she continued striding toward the doors i said hold it he headed after her and with one hand on her arm he spun her around her breath hissed out between clenched teeth i refuse to give in to the typical cliché of slapping you but its costing me i apologized stuff it be reasonable he cautioned himself it was either that or kiss her again look ms fletcher you didnt exactly fight me off a mistake i assure you that will not be repeated she made it to the sidewalk this time before he caught her i dont want you he said definitely insulted provoked beyond her control she jabbed a finger into his chest oh really then perhaps youd care to explain that hamhanded maneuver in there there was nothing hamhanded about it i hardly touched you and you went off like a rocket its not my fault if you were ripe her eyes went huge ballistic ripe ripe why you you overbearing arrogant selfabsorbed idiot tell him honey was the advice of a toothy bag lady who shoved past with her teetering cart dont let him get away with it that was a bad choice of words ry responded goaded into adding more fuel to the fire i should have said repressed i am going to hit you and he continued ignoring her i should have said i dont like wanting you natalie concentrated for one moment on simply breathing she would not absolutely would not lower herself to having a public brawl on the sidewalk that inspector piasecki may be the first and last time we ever have the same sentiment about anything i dont like it either dont like me wanting you or dont like you wanting me either he nodded and they eyed each other like boxers between rounds so well talk it out tonight we will not he would he promised himself be patient if it killed him or her natalie just how complicated do you want to make this i dont want to make it complicated ry i want to make it impossible why she speared him with a look skimming her gaze from the toes of his shoes to the top of his head i should think that would be obvious even to you he rocked back on his heels i dont know what it is about that snotty attitude of yours it just does something for me you want to play this traditional with me asking you out to dinner that routine she closed her eyes and prayed for patience i dont seem to be getting through she opened them again no i dont want you asking me out to dinner or any routine what happened inside there was wild incredible an aberration she said between her teeth it wouldnt be a hardship to prove you wrong but if we started that again out here wed probably be arrested before we were finished ryan was enjoying himself now immersed in the simple challenge of her and he intended to win but i see what it is ive spooked you now youre afraid to be alone with me afraid youll lose control heat stung her cheeks thats very lame he shrugged works for me she studied him he wanted to prove something he was about to be disappointed all right eight oclock chez robert on third ill meet you there fine fine she turned away oh piasecki she called over her shoulder they frown on eating with your fingers ill keep it in mind natalie was sure she had lost her mind she dashed into her apartment at facts figures projections graphs were all running through her head and her phone was ringing she caught the cordless on the fly and dashed into the bedroom to change yes what is that how mom taught you to answer the phone boyd some of the tension of the day drained away at the sound of her brothers voice im sorry ive just come in from the last of several mindnumbing meetings dont look for sympathy here youre the one who opted to carry on the family tradition right you are she stepped out of her shoes so hows the fight against crime and corruption in denver captain fletcher were holding our own cilia and the kids send love kisses and so forth and send mine back at them arent they going to talk to me im at the station im a little concerned about crime out there in urbana she searched through her closet the phone caught in the curve of her shoulder how did you find out the fire was arson already i barely found out myself we have ways actually i just got off the phone with the investigator in charge piasecki natalie tossed a black dinner dress on her bed you talked to him ten minutes ago it sounds like youre in good hands nat not if i can help it she muttered what he appears to know his job she said calmly though his methods lack a certain style arsons a dirty business and a dangerous one im worried about you pal dont be youre the cop remember she struggled out of her jacket promising herself shed hang it up before she left im the ceo in the ivory tower ive never known you to stay there i want you to keep me uptodate on the investigation i can do that she wiggled out of her skirt and guiltily left it pooled on the floor and tell mom and dad if you talk to them before i do that things are under control i wont bore you with all the business data i appreciate that she grinned boyd had no patience with ledgers or bar graphs but im about to put another very colorful feather in the fletcher industries cap with underwear lingerie darling a little breathless she fastened on a strapless black bra you can buy underwear at a drugstore right well i can tell you on a personal level cilia and i have both thoroughly enjoyed the samples you sent out i particularly liked the little red thing with the tiny hearts i thought you would she stepped into the dress tugged it up to her hips with valentines day coming up you should think about ordering her the matching peignoir put it on my tab take care of yourself nat i intend to with any luck ill be seeing you next month im going to scout out locations in denver your rooms ready for you anytime and so are we i love you i love you too bye she hung up by dropping the phone on the bed freeing herself to zip the dress into place not exactly a sedate number she mused turning toward the mirror not with the way it draped off the shoulders and veed down over the curve of the breasts repressed she shook back her hair this ought to show him the phone rang again making her swear in disgust she ignored the first ring and picked up her brush by the third shed given up and pounced on the phone hello just breathing quick and a faint chuckle hello is someone there midnight what distracted she carried the phone to the dresser to select the right jewelry im sorry i didnt catch that midnight witching hour wait and see when the phone clicked she disconnected set it down with a shake of her head cranks use the answering machine natalie she ordered herself thats what its there for a glance at her watch had her swearing again she forgot the call as she went into grooming overdrive she absolutely refused to be late chapter contents prev next natalie arrived at chez robert precisely at eight the fourstar french restaurant with its floral walls and candlelit corners had been a favorite of hers since she relocated to urbana just stepping inside put her at ease she had no more than checked her coat when she was greeted enthusiastically by the maitre d he kissed her hand with a flourish and beamed ah mademoiselle fletcher a pleasure as always i didnt know you were dining with us this evening im meeting a companion andre a mr piasecki pi brows knit andre scanned his reservation book while he mentally sounded out the name ah yes two for eight oclock pizekee close enough natalie murmured your companion has not yet arrived mademoiselle let me escort you to your table with a few quick and ruthless adjustments andre shifted ryans reservation to suit his favorite customer moving the seating from a small central table in the main traffic pattern to natalies favorite quiet corner booth thank you andre already at home natalie settled into the booth with a little sigh beneath the table her feet slipped out of her shoes my pleasure as always would you care for a drink while you wait a glass of champagne thank you my usual of course right away and mademoiselle if i may be so presumptuous the lobster robert tonight it is he kissed his fingers ill keep that in mind while she waited natalie took out her date book and began to make notations on her schedule for the next day she had nearly finished her champagne when ry walked up to the table she didnt bother to glance up its a good thing im not a fire im never late for a fire he took his seat and they spent a moment measuring each other so he owned a suit natalie thought and he looked good in it dark jacket crisp white shirt subtle gray tie even though his hair wasnt quite tamed it was definitely a more classic look than shed expected from him i use it for funerals ry said reading her perfectly she only lifted a brow well that certainly sets the tone for the evening doesnt it you picked the spot he reminded her he glanced around the restaurant quiet class he mused just a tad ornate and stuffy exactly what hed expected so hows the food here its excellent mademoiselle fletcher robert himself small plump and tuxedoed stopped by the table to kiss natalies hand bienvenue he began ry sat back took out a cigarette and watched as they rattled away in french she spoke it like a native that too hed expected du champagne pour mademoiselle robert told the waiter et pour vous monsieur beer ry said american if youve got it bien sur robert strutted back to the kitchen to harass his chef well legs that should have made your point ry commented excuse me just how out of place will he be in a fancy french restaurant where the owner kisses your knuckles and asks after your family i dont know what youre natalie frowned as she picked up her glass how do you know he asked after my family i have a frenchcanadian grandmother i probably speak the lingo nearly as well as you do even if the accent isnt as classy he blew out a stream of smoke and smiled at her through it i didnt peg you as a snob natalie i certainly am not a snob insulted she set her glass down again her shoulders stiffening but when he only continued to smile a little frisson of guilt worked its way through her conscience maybe i wanted to make you a little uncomfortable she sighed gave up a lot uncomfortable you annoyed me i did better than that angling his head he gave her a long slow study she looked like something a man might beg for creamy skin flowing out of a black dress just a few sparkles here and there sleek golden hair curving around her face big sulky green eyes red mouth oh yes he decided a man would surely beg her nerves began to jangle as he continued to stare is there a problem no no problem did you wear that dress to make me uncomfortable yes he picked up his menu its working hows the steak here relax she ordered herself obviously he was trying to make her crazy you wont get better in the city though i generally prefer the seafood she pouted a bit as she studied her menu the evening was not going as shed planned not only had he seen through her but hed already turned the tables so that she looked and felt foolish try again she told herself and make the best of a bad deal after theyd given their orders natalie took a deep breath i suppose since were here we might as well have a truce were we fighting lets just try for a pleasant evening she picked up her champagne flute again sipped she was after all an expert in negotiations and diplomacy lets start with the obvious your name irish first eastern european last irish mother polish father and a frenchcanadian grandmother on my mothers side my other grandmothers a scot which makes you an allamerican boy youve got hightea hands he picked up her hand startling her by running his fingers down hers they go with your name uppercrust classy well after shed tugged her hand free she cleared her throat giving undue attention to buttering a roll you said you were thirdgeneration in the department do i make you nervous when i touch you yes lets try to keep this simple why since she had no ready answer for that she let out a little huff of relief when their appetizers were served you must have always wanted to be a fire fighter all right he decided they could cruise along at her speed for now sure i did i practically grew up at engine company where my pop worked i imagine there was some family pressure no how about you me the fletcher tradition big business corporate towers he lifted a brow family pressure plenty of it she said and smiled ruthless unbending determined and all from my corner her eyes glinted with amusement it had always been assumed that my brother boyd would take over the reins both he and i had different ideas about that so he strapped on a badge and a gun and i harassed my parents into accepting me as heir apparent they objected no not really it didnt take them long to realize i was serious and capable she took a last bite of her coquilles saintjacques and offered ry the rest i love business the wheeling the dealing the paperwork the meetings and this new company its all mine your catalogs a big hit down at the station the amusement settled in and felt comfortable oh really a lot of the men have wives or ladies im just helping you pick up a few orders thats generous of you she studied him over the rim of her glass what about you are you going to make any orders i dont have a wife or a lady those smoky eyes flicked over her face again at the moment but you did have a wife briefly sorry im prying no problem he shrugged and finished off his beer its old news nearly ten years old i guess you could say she fell for the uniform then decided she didnt like the hours i had to be in it children no he regretted that sometimes wondered if he always would we were only together a couple of years she hooked up with a plumber and moved to the suburbs he reached out skimmed a fingertip down the side of her neck along the curve of her shoulder im beginning to think i like your shoulders as much as your legs his eyes locked on hers maybe its the whole package thats a fascinating compliment she didnt give in to the urge to shift away but she did switch from champagne to water suddenly her mouth was dry as dust but dont you think the current circumstances require a certain professional detachment no if i thought you had anything to do with setting that fire maybe he liked the way her eyes lit and narrowed when he pushed the right button but as it stands i can do my job just fine and still wonder what it would be like to make love with you her pulse jolted scrambled she used the time while their entrees were served to steady it id prefer if youd concentrate on the first in fact if you could bring me uptodate seems a waste to talk shop in a joint like this but he shrugged his shoulders the bottom line is arson an incendiary fire the motive could be revenge money straight vandalism or malicious destruction or kicks a pyromaniac she preferred that one only because it was less personal how do you handle that first you dont go in biased a lot of times people and the media start shouting pyro whenever theres a series of fires even if they seem related its not always the case but it often is and its often simple somebody burns a dozen cars because hes ticked he bought a lemon so dont jump to conclusions exactly but if it is someone whos disturbed head doctors are always working on the whys are you going to let me taste that hmmm oh all right she nudged her plate closer to his so that he could sample her lobster do you work with psychiatrists mostly the shrinks dont come into it until youve got the firebug in custody thats good stuff he added nodding toward her plate anyway that could be after any number of fires months of investigation maybe they blame his mother she paid too much attention to him or his father because he didnt pay enough you know how it goes amused interested she cut off a piece of lobster and slipped it onto his plate you dont think much of psychiatry i didnt say that i just dont go in for blaming somebody else when you did the crime now you sound like my brother hes probably a good cop want some of this steak no thanks like a bulldog she kept her teeth in the topic wouldnt you as an investigator have to know something about the psychology of the fire starter ry chewed his steak signaled for another beer you really want to get into this its interesting particularly now okay short lesson you can divide pathological fire starters into four groups the mentally ill the psychotic the neurotic and the sociopath youre going to have some overlap most of the time but that sorts them the neurotic or psychoneurotic is the pyromaniac arent they all no the true pyros a lot rarer than most people think its an uncontrollable compulsion he has to set the fire when the urge hits him he goes with it wherever whenever hes not really thinking about covering up or getting away so hes usually easy to catch i thought pyro was more of a general term she started to tuck her hair behind her ear ry beat her to it letting his fingers linger for a moment i like to see your face when i talk to you he kept his hand on hers bringing them both back to the table i like to touch you when i talk to you silence hung for a full ten seconds youre not talking natalie pointed out sometimes i just like to look come here a minute she recognized the light in his eyes recognized her own helpless response to it and to him deliberately she eased away i dont think so youre a dangerous man inspector thanks why dont you come home with me natalie she let out a long quiet breath youre also a very blunt one a woman like you could get poetry and fancy moves any time she wanted ry neither had them nor believed in them you might want to try something more basic this is certainly basic she agreed i think we could use some coffee he signaled the waiter you didnt answer my question no i didnt and no she waited until the table was cleared the coffee order given despite a certain elemental attraction i think it would be unwise to pursue this any further were both committed to our careers diametrically opposed in personality and lifestyle even though our relationship has been brief and abrasive i think its clear we have nothing in common we are as we might say in my business a bad risk he said nothing for a minute only studied her as if considering that makes sense her stomach muscles relaxed she even smiled at him as she picked up her coffee good then were agreed i didnt say i agreed he pointed out i said it made sense he lit a cigarette his eyes on hers over the flame ive been thinking about you natalie and ive got to tell you i dont much like the way you make me feel its distracting annoying and inconvenient her chin angled im so glad we cleared this up she said coolly god knows it gets me right in the gut when you talk to me like that duchess to serf he shook his head drew in smoke i must be perverse anyway i dont like it im not altogether sure i like you his eyes narrowed the light in them stopping the pithy comment before it could slip through her lips but ive never wanted anyone so damn much in my whole life thats a problem your problem she managed our problem ive got a rep for being tenacious she set her cup down carefully before it could slip from her limp fingers id think a simple no would do ry so would i he shrugged go figure i havent been able to clear you out of my head since i saw you standing there freezing at the fire scene i made a mistake when i kissed you this afternoon i figured once i had that would be it case closed he moved quickly and so smoothly she barely had time to blink before his mouth was hot and hard on hers dazed she lifted a hand to his shoulder but her fingers only dug in held on as she was buffeted with fresh excitement i was wrong he drew back case isnt closed and thats our problem yeah she let out a shaky breath no amount of common sense could outweigh her instant and primitive response to him he touched she wanted it was as simple and as terrifying as that but common sense was her only defense this isnt going to work its ridiculous to think that it could im not prepared to jump into an affair simply because of some basic animal lust see we do have something in common despite the fact that the kiss had stirred him to aching he smiled at her the lust part laughing she dragged her hair back from her face oh i need to get away from you for a while and consider the options this isnt a business deal ms fletcher she looked at him again and wished she could have some distance just a little distance so that she could think clearly i never make a decision without considering the bottom line profit and loss wary she inclined her head in a manner of speaking you could call it risk and reward intimate relationships havent been my strong suit thats been my choice if im going to have one with you however brief that will be my choice as well thats fair do you want me to work up a prospectus dont be snide ry then because it soothed some of the tension to realize shed annoyed him she smiled but id certainly give it my full attention playing it up she cupped her chin on her hands leaning closer skimming her gaze over his face you are very attractive in a roughedged notquitetamed sort of way he shifted drew hard on his cigarette thanks a lot no really so she thought he could be embarrassed the faint cleft in the chin the sharp cheekbones the lean face the dark sexy eyes her lips curved as he narrowed those eyes and all that hair just a little unruly the tough body the tough attitude impatient he crushed out his cigarette what are you pulling here natalie just giving you back a little of your own yes youre a very attractive package wasnt that your word dangerous dynamic like nemesis now he winced give me a break her chuckle was warm and deep no really theres a lot of similarity between you and urbanas mysterious upholder of justice you both appear to have your own agenda and your own roughedged style he fights crime appearing and disappearing like smoke an interesting connection between the two of you i might even wonder if you could be him except that hes a very romantic figure and there inspector you part company she tossed back her hair and laughed i believe youre speechless who would have thought it would be that easy to score a point off you she might have scored one but the game wasnt over he caught her chin in his hand held it steady and close even as her eyes continued to dance i guess i could handle it if you wanted to treat me hike an object just promise to respect me in the morning nope youre a hard woman ms fletcher okay scratch respect how about awe ill consider it if and when it becomes applicable now why dont we get the check its late when the check was served as it always was in such establishments with a faint air of apology natalie reached for it automatically ry pushed her hand aside and picked it up himself ry i didnt mean for you to pay the tab flustered she watched him pull out a credit card she knew exactly what a meal cost at chez robert and had a good idea what salary a city employee pulled down really it was my idea to come here shut up natalie he figured the tip signed the stub now i feel guilty damn it we both know i picked this place to rub your nose in it at least let me split it he pocketed his wallet no he slid out of the booth offered his hand dont worry he said dryly i can still make the rent this month probably youre just being stubborn she muttered wheres the ticket for your coat male ego she thought on a disgusted sigh as she took the ticket from her purse she exchanged goodnights with andre and robert before ry helped her into her coat do you need a lift ry asked her no i have my car good i dont have mine you can give me a ride home she shot a suspicious look over her shoulder as they stepped outside if this is some sort of maneuver ill tell you right now im not falling for it fine i can take a cab he scanned the street if i can find one its a cold night he added feels like snow on the way her breath streamed out my cars in the lot around the corner where am i taking you twentysecond between seventh and eighth terrific it was about as far out of her way as possible i have to make a stop first at the store what store he slipped an arm around her waist as much for pleasure as to protect her from the cold my store we had the carpets laid today and i didnt have time to check it before dinner since its halfway between your place and mine i might as well do it now i didnt think business execs checked on carpet at nearly midnight this one does she smiled sweetly but if its inconvenient for you id be happy to drop you off at the bus stop thanks anyway he waited while she unlocked her car do you have any stock in that place yet about twenty percent of what we want for the grand opening youre welcome to browse he slid into the car i was hoping youd say that she drove well that was no surprise from what ry had observed natalie fletcher did everything with seamless competence the fact that she could be shaken the fact that the right word the right look at the right time could bring a faint bloom to her cheeks made her human and outrageously appealing have you always lived in urbana as she asked she automatically turned down the radio yeah i like it so do i she liked the movement of the city the noise the crowds weve had holdings here for years of course but i never lived in urbana where colorado springs mostly thats where were based home and business i like the east the streets were dark now and the wind was whipping through the canyons formed by the spearing buildings i like eastern cities the way people live on top of each other and rush to get everywhere no western comments about overcrowding and crime rates fletcher industries was founded on real estate remember the more people the more housing required and as to crime she shrugged we have a hardworking police force and nemesis youre interested in him who wouldnt be of course as the sister of a police captain i should add that i dont approve of private citizens doing police work why not he seems to get the job done i wouldnt mind having him on my side he frowned as she stopped at a light the streets were nearly empty here with dark pockets and narrow alleys do you do many runs like this alone when necessary why dont you have a driver because i like to drive myself she shot him a look just as the light turned green youre not going to be typical and give me a lecture about the dangers facing a woman alone in the city its not all museums and french restaurants ry im a big girl ive spent time alone in paris bangkok london and bonn among other cities i think i can handle urbana the cops and your pal nemesis cant be everywhere he pointed out any woman who has a big brother knows just how to drop a man to his knees she said blithely and ive taken a selfdefense course that should make every mugger in the city tremble ignoring the sarcasm she pulled up to the curb and turned off the engine this is it the quick surge of pride rose the moment she was out of the car and facing the building her building so what do you think it was sleek and feminine like its owner all marble and glass and its wide display window was scrolled with the ladys choice logo in gold leaf the entrance door was beveled glass etched with rosettes that glinted in the backwash from the streetlights pretty he thought impractical expensive nice look as our flagship store i wanted it to be impressive classic and she ran her fingertip over the etching subtly erotic she dealt with the locks sturdy ry noted with some approval solid just inside the door she paused to enter her code on the computerized security system natalie turned on the lights relocked the front door perfect she nodded with approval at the mauve carpet the walls were teal freshly painted a curvy love seat and gleaming tea table were set in a corner to invite customers to relax and decide over merchandise racks were recessed natalie could already envision them full dripping with silks and laces in pastels bold vibrant colors and creamy whites most of the stock hasnt been put out yet my manager and her staff will see to that this week and the window treatment we have the most incredible brocade peignoir thatll be the focus ry moved over to a faceless mannequin fingered the lace at the leg of a jade teddy the same color as natalies eyes he thought so what do you charge for something like this mmm she examined the piece herself silk seed pearls at the bodice probably about onefifty one hundred and fifty dollars he shook his head in disgust one good tug and its a rag instantly she bristled our merchandise is topquality it will certainly hold up to normal wear honey a little number like this isnt designed for normal he cocked a brow looks about your size you keep dreaming piasecki she tossed her coat over the love seat the point of good lingerie is style texture the sheen of silk the foam of lace ours is designed to make a woman feel attractive and good about herself pampered i thought the idea was to make a man beg that couldnt hurt she tossed back look around if you like im going to run upstairs and check a couple of invoices while im here it wont take me more than five minutes ill come with you offices upstairs he asked as they started toward a white floating staircase just the managers well have more merchandise up there and changing rooms weve also set up a separate area for brides specialized weddingdress undergarments honeymoon lingerie once were fully operational she broke off when he grabbed her arm quiet what quiet he said again he didnt hear it not yet but he could smell it just the faintest sting in the air do you have extinguishers in here of course in the storeroom up in the office she tugged at his hand what is this are you going to try to cite me for firecode violations get outside with her gaping after him he darted toward the back of the store she was organized he had to admit he found the fire extinguisher up to code in full view in the crowded storeroom what are you doing with that she demanded when he came back i said get outside youve got a fire a he was halfway up the steps before she unfroze and raced after him thats impossible how do you know theres nothing gas he snapped out smoke she started to tell him he was imagining things but she smelled it now ry he cursed and kicked aside a streamer of papers and matches it hadnt caught yet but he saw where they were leading the glossy white door was closed and smoke was creeping sulkily under it he felt the door and the heat pushing against it his head whipped toward hers the eyes cold get out he said again call it in a scream strangled in her throat as he kicked the door open fire leapt out ry walked into it chapter contents prev next it was like a dream a nightmare standing there frozen while flame licked at the door frame and ry stepped in to meet it in the instant he disappeared into smoke and fire her heart seemed to stop its beat simply ceasing then the panic that had halted it whipped it to racing her head buzzed with the echo of a hundred pulses as she dashed to the door after him she could see him smothering the fire that sprinted across the floor and ate merrily at the base of the walls smoke billowed around him seared her eyes burned her lungs like some warrior he challenged it fought it down in horror she saw it strike back and lick slyly at his arm now she did scream leaping in to pound at the smoke that puffed from his back he whirled to face her furious to find her there youre on fire she barely choked the words out for gods sake ry let it go stay back with an arching movement he smothered the flames that had begun to lap at the central desk the paperwork left on its top he knew would feed the fire focused he turned to attack the smoldering baseboard the intricately carved trim that was flaming take this he shoved the extinguisher into her hands the main fire was out and the smaller ones were all but smothered he nearly had it from the terror in her eyes he could see that she didnt realize the beast was nearly beaten use it he ordered and in one stride he had reached the flaming curtains and torn them down there would be pain later he knew that as well but now he fought the fire hand to hand once the smoldering smokestained lace was nothing more than harmless rags he snatched the extinguisher out of her numbed hands and killed what was left it didnt have much of a start but his jacket was still smoking he yanked it off tossed it aside wouldnt have gotten this far this fast if there werent so many flammables in here he set the nearly empty extinguisher aside its out still he checked the room kicking through the ruined drapes searching for any cagey spark that waited to burn clean again its out he repeated and shoved her toward the door get downstairs she stumbled almost falling to her knees a violent fit of coughing nearly paralyzed her her stomach heaved her head spun near fainting she braced a hand against the wall and fought to breathe damn it natalie in one sweep he had her up in his arms he carried her through the blinding smoke down the elegant staircase i told you to get out dont you ever listen she tried to speak and only coughed weakly it felt as though she were floating even when he laid her against the cool cushions of the love seat her head continued to reel he was cursing her but his voice seemed far away and harmless if she could just get one breath she thought one full breath to soothe her burning throat he watched her eyes roll back jerking her ruthlessly he pushed her head between her knees dont you faint on me his voice was curt his hand on the back of her head firm stay here breathe slow you hear me she nodded weakly he left her and when cold fresh air slapped her cheeks she shivered after propping the outside door open ry came back rubbing his hands up and down her spine shed scared him badly so he did what came naturally to combat the fear he yelled at her that was stupid and thoughtless youre lucky to get out of there with a sick stomach and some smoke inhalation i told you to get out you went in she winced as the words tormented her abused throat you went right in im trained youre not he hauled her back into a sitting position to check her over her face was dead white under sooty smears but her eyes were clear again nausea he asked in clipped tones no she pressed the heels of her hands to her stinging eyes not now dizzy no her voice was hoarse strained he imagined her throat felt as though it had been scored with a hot poker is there any water around here ill get you some im all right she dropped her hands let her head fall back against the cushion now that the sickness was passing fear was creeping in it seemed so fast so horribly fast are you sure its out its my job to be sure frowning he caught her chin his eyes narrowing as he studied her face im taking you to the hospital i dont need a damn hospital in a badtempered movement she shoved at him then gasped when she saw his hands ry your hands she grabbed his wrists youre burned he glanced down there were a few welts some reddening nothing major reaction set in with shudders you were on fire i saw your jacket catch fire it was an old jacket stop he ordered when tears swam in her eyes overflowed dont if he hated one thing more than fire it was a womans tears he swore and crushed his mouth to hers hoping that would stop the flood her arms came hard around him surprising him with their strength and urgency but her mouth trembled beneath his moving him to gentle the kiss to soothe better he murmured and stroked her hair im all right she said again willing herself to believe it there should be a firstaid kit in the storeroom you need to put something on your hands its no big deal he began but she shoved away from him and rose i have to do something damn it i have to do something she dashed off baffled by her ry stood and moved to relock the door he needed to go up again and ventilate the office but he wanted her out of the way before he made a preliminary investigation he tugged off his tie loosened his collar theres some salve in here steadier now natalie came back in with a small firstaid kit fine deciding tending to him would do her some good he sat back and let her play nurse he had to admit the cool balm and her gentle fingers didnt do him any harm either youre lucky it isnt worse it was insane just walking into that room he cocked a brow youre welcome she looked up at him then his face was smeared from the smoke his eyes were reddened from it i am grateful she said quietly very grateful but it was just things ry just things she looked away again busying herself replacing the tube of salve i guess i owe you a new suit i hate suits he shifted uncomfortably when he heard her quick unsteady sob dont cry again if you really want to thank me dont cry all right she sniffed inelegantly and rubbed her hands over her face i was so scared its over he gave her hand an awkward pat will you be all right for a minute i want to go up and open the window the smoke needs a way to escape ill come no you wont sit here he rose again put a firm hand on her shoulder please stay here he turned and left her natalie used the time he was gone to compose herself and to think when he came back down she was sitting with her hands folded in her lap it was the same as the warehouse wasnt it she lifted her gaze to his the way it was set we cant pretend it was a coincidence yes he said it was the same and no we cant well talk about this later ill drive you home im the words slid back down her throat when he dragged her roughly to her feet if you tell me one more time that youre all right im going to punch you youre sick youre scared and you sucked in smoke now this is the way were going to work this im driving you home well report this on the phone in that snazzy car of yours youre going to go to bed and tomorrow youre going to see a doctor once you check out well go from there stop yelling at me i wouldnt have to yell if youd listen he grabbed her coat put this on this is my property i have a right to be here well im taking you out he shoved her arm into the sleeve of her coat if you dont like it call your fancy lawyers and sue me theres no reason for you to take this attitude he started to swear stopped himself as a precaution he took one slow breath natalie im tired his voice was quiet now nearly reasonable ive got a job to do here and i cant do it if youre in my way so cooperate please he was right she knew he was right she turned away picked up her purse keep my car ill arrange to have it picked up tomorrow i appreciate it she gave him the car keys and the keys to the shop ill be here tomorrow ry i figured you would he lifted a hand and rubbed his knuckles along her jawline hey try not to worry im the best she nearly smiled so ive been told it was nearly eight the following morning when the cab dropped natalie off in front of ladys choice she noted without surprise that her car was out front a firedepartment sign visible through the windshield instead of bothering with the buzzer she used the spare set of keys shed picked up that morning at the office and let herself in she couldnt smell the smoke that was a relief shed spent a great deal of time during the night worrying and calculating the possible losses if the stock already in place had been damaged by smoke the first floor looked as pristine and elegant as it had the night before if ry gave her the goahead shed contact her manager and reestablish business as usual she took off her coat and gloves and started upstairs for ry it had been a long and productive night hed stopped in at the station after he dropped natalie off to change and to pick up his tools hed worked alone through the night the way he preferred it he was just sealing an evidence jar when she walked in good morning legs crouched on the floor amid the rubble he didnt bother to look past them she scanned the room sighed the carpet was a blackened mess charred pieces of wood trim had been pried from the sooty walls and lay scattered the elegant queen anne desk was blackened and scored and the irishlace drapes were a heap of useless rags despite the open window where the light wind shook in thin snow the air stank with stale smoke why does it always look worse the next day its not so bad a little paint new trim she ran a fingertip over the wallpaper the violetandrosebud pattern shed chosen personally ruined now she thought easy for you to say yeah he agreed labeling the evidence jar i guess it is he glanced up then today shed scooped her hair up the style appealed to him the way it showed off the line of her neck and jaw this mornings suit was royal purple military in style it looked he thought as though the lady were ready for a fight howd you sleep surprisingly well all in all except for one bonechilling nightmare she didnt want to mention you he hadnt been to bed at all and merely shrugged have you called your adjuster i will as soon as his office opens her voice cooled automatically are you going to interview me again inspector annoyance flared briefly in his eyes i dont think thats necessary do you he began to replace his tools in their box ill have a report by tomorrow she closed her eyes a moment im sorry im not angry with you ry im just angry fair enough can you she broke off turning quickly at the sound of footsteps on the stairs gage she forced a smile held out her hands when he walked in i heard with one quick glance he took in the damage i thought id come by and see if there was anything i could do thanks she kissed him lightly on the cheek before she turned back to ry he was still crouched very much she thought intrigued like an animal about to spring gage guthrie inspector ryan piasecki ive heard you do good work after a moment ry straightened and accepted the hand gage offered ive heard the same about you feeling territorial ry measured the man as he spoke to natalie are you two pals thats right and a bit more she watched fascinated as rys eyes kindled if you can follow the connections gage is married to my brothers wifes sister the fire banked rys shoulders relaxed extended family in a manner of speaking judging the situation quickly and accurately gage decided to do a little checking on the inspector himself are you looking at the same fire starter here were not ready to release that information hes got his official hat on natalie said dryly unofficially she continued ignoring rys scowl it looks the same when we came in last night you were here gage interrupted her gripping natalies arm you i had a few things i wanted to check on fortunately blowing out a breath she took another scan of the room it could have been a lot worse i happened to have a veteran fire fighter along gage relaxed fractionally youve got no business going around the city alone at night yeah ry took out a cigarette you try to tell her natalie merely lifted a brow do you go around the city gage alone at night he tucked his tongue in his cheek if she only knew its entirely different and dont give me a lecture on equality he went on before she could speak im all for it in the home in the workplace but on the street it comes down to basic common sense a womans more of a target mmm hmmm natalie smiled pleasantly and does deborah buy that line from you now his lips did curve no shes every bit as hardheaded as you frustrated that hed been on the other side of town when nat needed him gage tucked his hands in his pockets if i cant do anything else i can offer you any of the facilities or staff of guthrie international ill take you up on that if it becomes necessary she sent him a quick hopeful look i dont suppose you could use your influence to keep your wife from calling my brother and cilia and relating all of this he patted her cheek not a chance maybe i should mention that she talked to althea last week and filled her in on what happened at the warehouse giving in to fatigue natalie rubbed her temples althea grayson her brothers former partner on the force was very pregnant im surrounded by cops she muttered theres no reason to get althea upset in her condition she and colt should be concentrating on each other its a problem when you have so many people who care about you stay out of empty buildings gage added and kissed her nice to meet you inspector yeah see you give deborah and addy my love natalie said as she walked gage to the doorway and stop worrying about me ill do the first but not the second whos addy ry asked before he heard the downstairs door close behind gage hmmm oh their baby distracted she circled around a charred hole in the carpet to examine her antique filing cabinets it was some consolation to see that they were undamaged i really need to clear this up ry too many people are losing sleep youve got a lot of close ties he walked to the open window and put out his cigarette i cant make this work any faster to please them just take your friends advice stay off the streets at night and out of empty buildings i dont want advice i want answers someone broke in here last night and tried to burn me out how and why okay ms fletcher i can give you the how ry leaned a hip against the partially burned desk on the night of february twentysixth a fire was discovered by inspector piasecki and natalie fletcher owner of the building ry he held up a hand to stop her after entering the building piasecki and fletcher started up to the second floor when piasecki detected the odor of an accelerant and smoke piasecki then ordered fletcher to flee the building an order i might add that she stupidly ignored finding an extinguisher in the storeroom piasecki proceeded to the fire which had involved an office on the second floor streamers of paper clothing and matchbooks were observed the fire was extinguished without extensive damage im very aware of that particular sequence of events you wanted a report youre getting one an examination of the debris led the investigator to believe that the fire had been started approximately two feet inside the door with the use of gasoline as an accelerant no forced entry into the building could be determined by the inspector or the police department arson is indicated she took a careful breath youre angry with me yeah im angry with you youre pushing me natalie and yourself you want this all tidied up because people are worried about you and youre concerned with selling your pantyhose on time and youre missing one small very important detail no im not she was pale again and rigid im trying not to be frightened by it it isnt difficult to add the elements and come up with the fact that someone is doing this to me deliberately two of my buildings within two weeks im not a fool ry youre a fool if youre not frightened by it youve got an enemy who i dont know she shot back if i did dont you think id tell you youve just told me there was no forced entry that means someone i know someone who works for me could have gotten in here and started the fire its a torch excuse me a pro ry explained not a very good one but a pro somebody hired a torch to set the fires it could be that somebody let him in or he found a way to bypass your security but he didnt finish the job here so its likely hell hit you again she forced back a shudder thats comforting thats very comforting i dont want you to be comforted i want you to be alert how many people work for you at ladys choice frazzled she pushed at her hair around six hundred i think in urbana you got a personnel list i can get one i want it look im going to run the data through the computer see how many known pros we have in the area who use this technique its a start youll keep me uptodate ill be in the office most of the day my assistant will know how to reach me if im out he straightened walked to her and cupped her face why dont you take the day off go shopping go see a movie are you joking he dropped his hands shoved them in his pockets listen natalie youve got one more person worried about you okay i think its okay she said slowly ill stay available ry but i have a lot of work to do she smiled in an attempt to lighten the mood starting with getting a cleaning crew and decorators in here not until i tell you how did i know youd say that resigned she glanced toward the wooden cabinets against the left wall is it all right if i get some files out i only moved them out of the main office a few days ago so i could work on them here she lifted a shoulder or id hoped to work on them here more delays she said under her breath yeah go ahead watch your step he watched it as well and shook his head he didnt see how she could walk so smoothly on those skyscraper heels she seemed addicted to but he had to admit they did fascinating things to her legs how are your hands she asked as she flipped through the files what your hands she glanced back saw where his gaze was focused and laughed god piasecki youre obsessed i bet they go all the way up to your shoulders he skimmed his eyes up to hers the hands arent too bad thanks whens your doctors appointment she turned away to give unmerited attention to the files i dont need a doctor i dont like doctors chicken maybe my throats a little sore thats all i can deal with that without a doctor poking at me and if youre going to lecture me on that ill lecture you on deliberately sucking smoke into your lungs with a wince he tucked away the cigarette hed just pulled out i didnt say anything are you about done i want to get this evidence to the lab yes the fact that the files didnt go up saves me a lot of time and trouble i need deirdre to run an audit after weve dealt with this other mess im hoping things look solid enough for me to scout around and open a branch in denver the little flutter under his heart wasnt easily ignored denver are you going to be moving back to colorado hmmm satisfied she tucked the paperwork in her briefcase it depends im not thinking that far ahead yet first we have to get the stores we have off the ground that isnt going to happen overnight she swung the strap of her briefcase over her shoulder that should do it i want to see you it cost him to say it even more to admit it to himself i need to see you natalie away from all this her suddenly nervous fingers tugged at the strap of her briefcase were both pretty swamped at the moment ry it might be smarter for us to concentrate on what needs to be done and keep a little personal distance it would be smarter well then she took one step toward the door before he blocked her path i want to see you he repeated and i want to touch you and i want to take you to bed heat curled inside her threatening to flash it didnt seem to matter that his words were rough blunt and without finesse poetry and rose petals would have left her much less vulnerable i know what you want i need to be sure what i want what i can handle ive always been a logical person youve got a way of clouding that tonight i have to work late she felt herself weakening yearning a dinner meeting ill wait i dont know when ill be finished probably not much before midnight he backed her toward the wall midnight then she began to wonder why she was resisting her eyes started to cloud and close midnight she repeated waiting for his mouth to cover hers wanting to taste it to surge under it her eyes sprang open she jerked back oh god midnight her cheeks had gone white again ry lifted his hands to support her what is it midnight she repeated pressing a hand to her brow i didnt put it together never thought of it it was just past twelve when we got here last night he nodded watching her so i got a call when i was dressing for dinner i never seem to be able to ignore the ring and let the machine pick up so i answered he said midnight eyes narrowed ry braced her against the wall who i dont know i didnt recognize the voice he said let me think she pushed away to pace out into the hall midnight he said midnight the witching hour watch for it or wait for it something like that she gestured toward the charred and ruined carpet this must be what he meant why the hell didnt you tell me this before because i just remembered every bit as angry as he she whirled on ry i thought it was a crank call so i ignored it forgot it then when this happened i had a little more on my mind than a nuisance call how was i supposed to know it was a warning or a threat he ignored that and took his notebook out of his pocket to write down the words shed related what time did you get the call it must have been around seventhirty i was looking for earrings and rushing because id gotten held up and was running late did you hear any background noises on the line unsure she fought to remember she hadnt been paying attention shed been thinking of ry i didnt notice any his voice was highpitched it was a man im sure of that but it was a girlish kind of voice he giggled she remembered rys gaze shot to her face then back to his book did it sound mechanical or genuine she went blank for a moment oh you mean like a tape no it didnt sound like a tape is your number listed no then she understood the significance of the question no she repeated slowly its not i want a list of everyone who has your home number everyone she straightened forcing herself to keep calm i can give you a list of everyone i know who has it i cant tell you who might have gotten it by other means she cleared her aching throat ry do professionals usually call their victims before a fire he tucked his notebook away and looked into her eyes even pros can be crazy ill drive you to your office its not necessary patience he reminded himself hed worked overtime so that he could be patient with her then he thought the hell with it you listen to this real careful he curled his fingers around the lapel of her jacket im driving you to your office got that i dont see he tugged got it she bit back an oath it would be petty to argue fine im going to need my car later today so youll have to get yourself wherever youre going after you drop me off keep listening he said evenly until i get back to you youre not to go anywhere alone thats ridiculous ive got a business to run nowhere alone he repeated otherwise im going to call some of my pals in urbana pd and have them sit on you when she opened her mouth to protest he overrode her and i can sure as hell keep your little shop here offlimits to everyone but official fire and policedepartment personnel until further notice that sounds like a threat she said stiffly youre a real sharp lady you get one of your minions to drive you today natalie or ill slap a firedepartment restriction on the front door of this place for the next couple of weeks he could she realized reading the determination on his face and he would from experience she knew it was smarter and more practical to give up a small point in a negotiation in order to salvage the bottom line all right ill assign a driver for any outoftheoffice meetings today but id like to point out that this man is burning my buildings ry not threatening me personally he called you personally thats enough she hated the fact that hed frightened her stringent control kept her dealing with office details coolly efficiently by noon she had a cleanup crew on standby waiting for rys okay shed ordered her assistant to contact the decorator about new carpet wallpaper draperies and paint shed dealt with a frantic call from her atlanta branch and an irate one from chicago and managed to play down the problem with her family back in colorado impatient she buzzed her assistant maureen i needed those printouts thirty minutes ago yes ms fletcher the systems down in accounting theyre working on it tell them she bit back the searing words and forced her voice to level tell them its a priority thank you maureen deliberately she leaned back in her chair and closed her eyes having an edge was an advantage in business she reminded herself being edgy was a liability if she was going to handle the meetings set for the rest of the day she had to pull herself together slowly she unfisted her hands and ordered her muscles to relax shed nearly accomplished it when a quick knock came at her door she straightened in her chair as melvin poked his head in safe nearly she told him come in i come bearing gifts he carried a tray into the room if thats coffee i may find the energy to get up and kiss your whole face he flushed brightly and chuckled not only is it coffee but theres chicken salad to go with it even you have to eat natalie tell me about it she pressed a hand to her stomach as she rose to join him at the sofa im empty this is very sweet of you melvin and selfserving youve been burning up the interoffice lines so i had my secretary put this together you take a break he fiddled with his bright red bow tie we take a break i guess i have been playing simon legree today with a little sigh natalie inhaled the scent of coffee as she poured youre entitled he sat beside her have you got time over lunch to tell me how bad things are over at the flagship not as bad as they could have been she indulged herself by slipping out of her shoes and tucking her legs up as she ate minor really from what i could tell it looked like mostly cosmetic damage to the managers office it didnt get to the stock thank god he said heartily i dont know how much my charm would have worked a second time in persuading the branches to part with inventory unnecessary she said between bites we got lucky this time melvin but but theres a pattern here that concerns me someone doesnt want ladys choice to fly frowning he picked up the roll on her plate broke it in half unforgettable womans our top competitor or well be theirs ive thought of that it just doesnt fit that companys been around nearly fifty years its solid respectable she sighed hating what she needed to say but i am worried about corporate espionage melvin within ladys choice one of our people hed lost the taste for the roll it isnt a possibility i like or one i can overlook thoughtful she switched from food to coffee i could call a meeting of department heads get input and opinions about their people and she would she thought she would have to but that doesnt deal with the department heads themselves a lot of your top people have been with fletcher for years natalie im aware of that restless she rose drinking coffee as she paced i cant think of any reason why someone in the organization would want to delay the opening but i have to look for that reason that puts us all under the gun she turned back im sorry melvin it does no need to be sorry its business he waved it aside but his smile was a little strained as he rose whats the next step im going to meet the adjuster at the shop at one she glanced at her watch and swore id better get started let me do it anticipating her melvin held up a hand you have more than you can handle right here delegate natalie remember ill meet the agent give you a full report when i get back all right it would save me a very frenzied hour frowning she stepped back into her shoes if the arson inspector is onsite you might ask him to contact me with any progress will do theres a shipment due in to the shop late this afternoon do you want to put a hold on it no shed already thought it through business as usual ive put a security guard on the building it wont be easy for anyone to get in again well stay on schedule melvin assured her damn right we will chapter contents prev next ry preferred good solid human reasoning to computer analysis but hed learned to use all available tools the arson pattern recognition system was one of the best over the past few years hed become adept enough at the keyboard now with his secretary long gone for the day and the men downstairs settled into sleep he worked alone the aprs used intelligently was an effective tool for identifying and classifying trends in data it was possible with a series of fires suspected to be related to use the tool to predict where and when future arsons in the series were most likely to occur the computer told him what hed already deduced natalies production plant was a prime target hed already assigned a team to patrol and survey the area but he was more concerned about natalie herself the phone call shed received made it personal and it had given him a very specific clue reaching for coffee with one hand ry tapped on keys and linked up with the national fire data system he plugged in his pattern incident information geographical locations and fire data the process would not only help him but serve to aid future investigators then he worked on suspects again he input the fire data the method to these he was able to add the phone call natalies impression of the voice and the wording he sat back and watched the computer reinforce his own conclusions clarence robert jacoby aka jacoby aka clarence roberts last known address south street urbana white male dob it went on to list half a dozen arrests for arson and incendiary fires all urban one conviction had put him away for five years another arrest two years ago was still pending as hed skipped out on bail and the pattern was there jacoby was a parttime pro who liked to burn things he habitually preferred gasoline as an accelerant used streamers of convenient onsite flammables along with matchbooks from his own collection he often called his victims his psychiatric evaluation classified him as a neurotic with sociopathic tendencies you like fire dont you you little bastard ry muttered tapping his finger against the keyboard you dont even mind when it burns you isnt that what you told me its like a kiss ry flipped a switch and had the data printing out wearily he rubbed the heels of his hands over his eyes as the machine clattered hed caught about two hours sleep on the sofa in the outer office that evening fatigue was catching up with him but he had his quarry now he was sure of it and he thought he had a trail more out of habit than desire ry lit a cigarette before punching in numbers on the phone piasecki im swinging by the fletcher plant on my way home you can reach me he trailed off checking his watch midnight he noted on the dot maybe he should take that as a sign you can reach me at this number until i check in again he recited natalies home number from memory then hung up he shut down the computer grabbed the printout and his jacket then hit the lights natalie pulled on a robe one of her favorites from the ladys choice line and debated whether to crawl into bed or sink into a hot bath she decided to soothe her nerves with a glass of wine before she did either shed tried to reach ry three times that afternoon only to be told he was unavailable she was supposed to be available she thought nastily but he could come and go as he pleased not a word all day well he was going to get a surprise first thing in the morning when she walked right into his office and demanded a progress report as if she didnt have enough to worry about with department meetings production meetings meeting meetings and she was tracking the early catalog orders by region at least that looked promising she thought and walked over to enjoy her view of the city she wasnt going to let anything stand in her way not fires and certainly not a fire inspector if there was someone on her staff in any position who was responsible for the arson she would find out who it was and she would deal with it within a year she would have pushed ladys choice over the top within five she would double the number of branches fletcher industries would have a new success one she would have nurtured from inception she could be proud and satisfied so why was she suddenly so lonely his fault she decided sipping her wine for making her restless with her life for making her question her priorities at a time when she needed all her concentration and effort focused physical attraction even with this kind of intensity wasnt enough shouldnt be enough to distract her from her goals shed been attracted before and certainly knew how to play the game safely after all she was thirtytwo hardly a novice in the relationship arena skilled and cautious shed always come through unscathed no man had ever involved her heart quite enough to cause scarring why did that suddenly seem so sad annoyed with the thought she shook it off she was wasting her time brooding about ryan piasecki god knew he wasnt even her type he was rough and rude and undeniably abrasive she preferred a smoother sort a safer sort why did that suddenly seem so shallow she set her halffull glass aside and shook back her hair what she needed was sleep not selfanalysis the phone rang just as she reached out to switch off the lights oh i hate you she muttered and picked up the receiver hello ms fletcher this is mark at the desk downstairs yes mark what is it theres an inspector piasecki here to see you oh really she checked her watch toying with the idea of sending him away mark would you ask him if its official business yes maam is this official business inspector she heard rys voice clearly through the earpiece asking mark whether he would like him to get a team down there in the next twenty minutes to look for code violations when mark sputtered natalie took pity on him just send him up mark yes ms fletcher thank you she disconnected then paced to the door and back she certainly wasnt going to check her appearance in the mirror of course she did by the time ry pounded on her door shed managed to dash into the bedroom brush her hair and dab on some perfume dont you think its unfair to threaten people in order to get your way she demanded when she yanked open the door not when it works he took his time looking at her the floorlength robe was unadorned the color of heavy cream the silk crossed over her breasts nipped in at the belted waist then fell thin and close down her hips dont you think its a waste to wear something like that when youre alone no i dont are we going to talk in the hall i suppose not she closed the door behind him i wont bother to point out that its late he said nothing only wandered around the living area of the apartment soft colors offset by those vibrant abstract paintings she apparently liked lots of trinkets he noted but tidy there were fresh flowers a fireplace piped for gas and a wide window through which the lights of the city gleamed nice place i like it you like heights he moved to the window and looked down she was a good twenty floors above any possible ladder rescue maybe i will have this place checked to see if its up to code he glanced back at her got a beer no then she sighed manners would always rise above annoyance i was having a glass of wine would you like one he shrugged he wasnt much of a wine drinker but his system couldnt handle any more coffee taking that as an indication of assent natalie went into the kitchen to pour another glass got anything to go with it he asked from the doorway like food she started to snap at him about mistaking her apartment for an allnight diner but then she got a good look at his face in the strong kitchen light if shed ever seen exhaustion she was seeing it now i dont do a lot of cooking but i have some brie crackers some fruit nearly amused he rubbed his hands over his face brie he gave a short laugh as he dropped his hands great fine go sit down she handed him the wine ill bring it out thanks a few minutes later she found him on her sofa his legs stretched out his eyes halfclosed why arent you home in bed i had some stuff to do with one hand he reached for the tray shed set on the table with the other he reached for her content with her beside him he piled soft cheese on a cracker its not halfbad he said with his mouth full i missed dinner i suppose i could send out for something this is fine i figured youd want an update i do but i thought id hear from you several hours ago he mumbled something over a new cracker what court he said and swallowed i had to be in court most of the afternoon i see got your messages though the refueling helped and he grinned did you miss me the update she said dryly its the least you can do while youre cleaning out my pantry he helped himself to a handful of glossy green grapes ive ordered surveillance for your plant on winesap her ringers tightened on the stern of her glass do you think its a target fits the pattern have you noticed a man around any of your properties white guy about fivefour a hundred and thirty thinning sandy hair fortysomething but with this round moony face that makes him look like a kid he broke off to wash crackers down with wine pale mousylooking eyes lots of teeth no i cant think of anyone like that why hes a torch nasty little guy about halfcrazy the wine wasnt halfbad either ry was discovering and sipped again alltheway crazy would be easier he likes to make things burn and he doesnt mind getting paid for it you think hes the one natalie said quietly and you know him personally dont you weve met clarence and me last time i saw him was oh about ten years ago hed hung around too long on one of his jobs he was on fire when i got to him we were both smoking by the time i got him out natalie struggled for calm why do you think its him briefly ry gave her a rundown on his work that evening so its his kind of job he added plus the phone call he likes the phone too and the voice you described thats pure clarence you could have told me that this morning couldve he shrugged didnt see the point the point she said between her teeth is that were talking about my building my property he studied her a moment it wasnt such a bad idea he supposed to use anger to cover fear he couldnt blame her for it tell me ms fletcher in your position as ceo or whatever it is you are do you make reports before during or after youve checked your data it irritated as hed meant it to and it deflated as hed meant it to all right she expelled a rush of air tell me the rest ry set his glass aside he moves around city to city im betting hes back in urbana and ill find him is there an ashtray around here in silence natalie rose and took a small mosaic dish from another table she was being unfair she realized and it wasnt like her obviously he was dead tired because hed put in dozens of extra hours for her youve been working on this all night he struck a match thats the job is it she asked quietly yeah his eyes met hers and its you her pulse began to drum she couldnt stop it youre making it very hard for me ry thats the idea lazily he skimmed a finger along the lapel of her robe barely brushing the skin her scent rose up from it subtly tantalizingly you want me to ask you how your day went no with a tired laugh she shook her head no i guess you dont want to talk about the weather politics sports natalie paused before she spoke again she didnt want her voice to sound breathy not particularly he grunted leaned over to crush out his cigarette i should go let you get some sleep her emotions tangled she rose as he did thats probably best sensible it wasnt what she wanted just what was best and it wasnt shed begun to realize what she needed just what was sensible but im not going to his eyes locked on hers unless you tell me her heartbeat thickened she could feel the shudder start all the way down in the soles of her feet and work its way up tell you what he smiled moved closer stopping just before their bodies brushed the first answer whether she wanted him to go or stay was already easily read in her eyes wheres the bedroom natalie a little dazed she looked over his shoulder gesturing vaguely there back there with that quick surprising grace of his he scooped her up i think i can make it that far this is a mistake she was already raining kisses over his face his throat i know its a mistake everybody makes one now and again im smart while her breath hitched her fingers hurried to unbutton his shirt and im levelheaded i have to be because she let out a groan as her fingers found flesh god i love your body yeah he nearly staggered as she tugged his shirt out of his jeans consider it all yours i should have known mmm she was busy biting at his shoulder what that youd have a firstclass bed he tumbled with her onto the satin covers already halfmad for him she dragged at his shirt hurry she demanded ive wanted you to hurry since the first time you touched me let me catch up equally frantic he crushed his mouth to hers sinking in breathless she yanked at the snap of his jeans this is insane she struggled to find him drinking hungrily from his mouth as they rolled across the bed he couldnt catch his breath or even a slippery hold on control its about to be he muttered tugging her robe open he found the thin swatch of matching silk beneath a moan ripped through him as he closed his mouth over her creamcovered breast silk and heat and fragrant flesh everything she was filled him taunted him tormented him woman all woman beauty and grace and passion temptation and torment and triumph all of it all of her obsessed him they thrashed over the slick satin spread groping for more here was fire the bright dangerous flash of it it seared through him burned scarred while her hands and mouth raced over him igniting hundreds of new flames he didnt fight it back for once he wanted to be consumed with an oath he tore at the silk and dined greedily on her flesh his hands were rough and hard and wonderful shed never felt more alive or more desperate she craved him knew that she had on some deep level right from the beginning but now she had him could feel the press of that hard muscled body against her could taste the violent urgency of his need whenever their mouths met could hear his response to her touch to her taste in every hurried breath if it was elemental so be it she felt lusty and wanton and absolutely free her teeth dug into his shoulder as he whipped her ruthlessly over the first crest she cried out his name all but screamed it arching upward taut as a bow he arrowed into her hard deep she was blind and deaf from the pleasure of it oblivious of her own sobbing breaths as they mated in a frenzied rhythm her body plunged against his tireless driven by a need that seemed insatiable then body and need erupted the light was on funny he hadnt even noticed that when normally he was accustomed to picking up every small detail the lamps glow was soft picking up the cool sherbet tones of her bedroom ryan lay still his head on her breast and waited for his system to level beneath his ear her heart continued to thunder her flesh was damp her body limp every few moments a tremor shook her he didnt smile in triumph as he might have done but simply stared in wonder hed wanted to conquer her he couldnt wouldnt deny it hed craved the sensation of having her body buck and shudder under his from the first moment he saw her but he hadnt expected the tornado of need that had swept through them both that had them clawing at each other like animals he knew hed been rough he wasnt a particularly gentle man so that didnt bother him but hed never lost control so completely with any woman nor had he ever wanted one so intensely only moments after hed had her that should have done it he muttered hmmm she felt weak as water achy and sweet it should have gotten it out of my system gotten you out at least started getting you out oh she found the energy to open her eyes the light dim as it was had her wincing slowly her mind began to clear quickly her skin began to heat she remembered the way shed torn at his clothes wrestled him into bed without a single coherent thought except having him she let out a breath drew another in youre right she decided it should have whats wrong with us with a laugh he lifted his head looking at her flushed face her tousled hair damned if i know are you okay now she smiled the hell with logic damned if i know what just happened heres a bit out of the usual realm for me good he lowered his head skimmed his tongue lightly over her breast i want you again natalie she quivered once good when the alarm went off natalie groaned rolled over to shut it off and bumped solidly into ry he grunted slapped at the buzzer with one hand and brought her to rest on top of him with the other whats the noise for he asked and ran an interested hand down her spine to the hip to wake me up he opened one eye yeah he thought he should have known it she looked just as good in the morning as she did every other time of the day why it goes like this still groggy she pushed her hair out of her face the alarm goes off i get up shower dress drink copious cups of coffee and go to work ive had some experience with the process anybody tell you todays saturday i know what day it is she said at least she did now i have work no you dont you just think you do he cradled her head against his shoulder casting one bleary eye at the clock it was am he calculated theyd had three hours sleep at the outside go back to sleep i cant he let out a longsuffering sigh all right all right but you should have warned me you were insatiable more than willing to oblige he rolled her over again and began to nibble on her shoulder i didnt mean that she laughed trying to wiggle free i have paperwork calls to make his hand was sneaking up to stroke her breast fire kindled instantly in the pit of her stomach cut it out uhuh you woke me up now you pay she couldnt help it simply couldnt and she began to stretch under his hands were lucky we didnt kill each other last night are you sure you want to take another chance men like me face danger every day he covered her grinning mouth with his she was more than three hours behind schedule when she stepped out of the shower so shed work late natalie decided and after wrapping a towel around her hair she began to cream her legs a good executive understood the merits of flextime yawning she wiped steam from the bathroom mirror and took a good look at her face she should be exhausted she realized she certainly should look exhausted after the wild night she and ry had shared but she wasnt and she didnt she looked soft she thought satisfied and why not she thought dragging the towel from her hair when a woman took thirtytwo years to experience just what a bout of hot sweaty sex could do for the mind and body she ought to look satisfied nothing absolutely nothing shed ever experienced came close to what shed felt what shed done what shed discovered during the night with ry so if she smiled like a fool while she combed out her wet hair why not if she felt like singing as she wrapped her tingling body in her robe it was understandable and if she had to rearrange her schedule for the day because shed spent most of the night and all of the morning wrestling in bed with a man who made her blood bubble more power to her she stepped back into the bedroom and grinned at the tangled sheets lips pursed she picked up the remains of her chemise the strap was torn and a froth of lace hung limp apparently she decided her merchandise didnt quite live up to ry piaseckis idea of wear and tear and wasnt it fabulous laughing out loud she tossed the chemise aside and followed her nose into the kitchen i smell coffee she began then paused in the doorway he was breaking eggs into a bowl with those big hard hands of his his hair was damp as hers was because hed beaten her to the shower he was barefoot jeans snug at his hips flannel shirt rolled up to the elbows incredibly she wanted him all over again you have next to nothing in this place to eat i eat out a lot with an order to control herself she moved to the coffeepot what are you making omelets you had four eggs some cheddar and some very limp broccoli i was going to steam it she cocked her head as she sampled the coffee so you cook every selfrespecting fire fighter cooks you take shifts at the station he located a whisk then turned to her wet hair glowing face sleepy eyes hello legs you look good thanks she smiled over the rim of her cup if he continued to look at her in just that way she realized she would drag him right down onto the floor it might be wise she decided to tend to some practical matters am i supposed to help can you handle toast barely she set her cup aside and opened the cupboard they worked in silence for a moment he beating eggs she popping bread in the toaster i she wasnt sure how to put it delicately i suppose when you were fighting fires you faced a lot of dangerous situations yeah so the scars on your shoulder your back shed discovered them in her explorations in the night the raised welts and scarred ridges over that taut really beautiful body line of duty thats right he glanced up in truth he didnt think about them but it occurred to him in the harsh light of day that a woman like her might find them offensive do they bother you no i just wondered how you got burned he set the bowl aside and placed a pan on the stove to heat maybe they bothered her he thought maybe they didnt but it seemed best to get the matter out of the way our friend clarence while i was pulling him out of the fire he started the ceiling collapsed ry could remember it still the rain of flame the animal roar of it the staggering nightmare of pain it fell down on us like judgment he was screaming laughing i got him outside i dont remember much after that until i woke up in the burn ward im sorry it could have been a lot worse my gear went a long way toward protecting me i got off lucky deliberately focused he poured the beaten eggs into the pan my father went down like that fire went into the walls when they ventilated the ceiling it went it all went he cursed under his breath where the hell had that come from he wondered he hadnt meant to say it the death of his father certainly wasnt typical morningafter conversation you should butter that toast before it gets cold she said nothing could think of nothing only went to him wrapping her arms around his waist pressing her cheek to his back i didnt know youd lost your father there was so much she thought that she didnt know twelve years ago it was in a high school some kid who wasnt happy with his chemistry grade torched the lab it got away from him pop knew the risks he muttered uncomfortable with the sensation her quiet sympathy was stirring we all know them she held on i didnt mean to open old wounds ry its all right he was a hell of a smoke eater natalie stayed where she was another moment baffled by what she was feeling this need to comfort to share this terrible urge to be part of what he was cautious she stepped back it wouldnt do she reminded herself it wouldnt do at all to look for more between them than what there was and this clarence how will you find him i could get lucky and track him down through contacts with a quick competent touch ry folded the egg mixture or well pick him up when he scouts out his next target my plant probably more relaxed now that there was a little distance between them he shot her a look over his shoulder cheer up natalie youve got the best in the city working to protect your nighties you know very well its not just she broke off when her doorbell rang never mind hold on doesnt your doorman call up when someones coming to see you not if its a neighbor use the judas hole he ordered and reached for plates yes daddy amused by him natalie went to the door one look through the peephole had her stifling a shout and dragging back the locks boyd for heavens sake she threw her arms around her brother cilia the whole crew cilia warned her laughing as they hugged the cop wouldnt let me call ahead and alert you to the invasion im just so glad to see you she bent down to hug her niece and nephews but what are you doing here checking up on you boyd shifted the bag of takeout he carried to his other hip you know the captain cilia said bryant touch nothing under penalty of death she aimed a cautious look at her oldest son at eight he couldnt be trusted the minute deborah called us about the second fire he herded us up and moved us out allison this isnt a basketball court why dont you put that down now territorial allison hugged the basketball to her chest im not going to throw it or anything shes fine natalie assured cilia stroking a distracted hand down allisons golden hair boyd i cant believe youd drag everyone across the country for something like this the kids have monday off at school boyd crouched down to pick up the jacket their youngest had already tossed on the floor so were taking a quick weekend thats all were staying with deborah and gage cilia added so dont panic its not that and we brought supplies boyd held out the bag filled with takeout burgers and fries how about lunch well i she cleared her throat and looked toward the kitchen how she wondered was she going to explain ry keenan with the curiosity of an active fiveyearold had already discovered him from the kitchen doorway he grinned up at ry hi hi yourself curious to see just how natalie handled things ry strolled out of the kitchen want to see what i can do keenan asked him before anyone else could speak sure always ready to show off a new skill keenan shinnied up rys leg scooting up and around until he was riding piggyback not bad ry gave the boy a little boost to settle him in place thats keenan cilia explained running her tongue over her teeth as she considered our youngest monkey im sorry ah natalie dragged a hand through her damp hair she didnt have to look at boyd to know hed have that speculative bigbrother look in his eyes boyd and cilia fletcher ry piasecki she cleared her throat and this is allison and bryant now she sighed youve already met keenan piasecki boyd repeated arson just the man he wanted to see boyd thought but he hadnt expected to find him barefoot in his sisters kitchen thats right brother and sister shared strong good looks ry mused and he thought an innate suspicion of strangers youre the cop from denver bryant piped up hes a police captain he wears a gun to work can i have a drink aunt nat sure i but bryant was already darting into the kitchen well this is awkward she thought maybe i should get some plates before the food gets cold good idea all she has is eggs ry eyed the bag boyd still carried recognizing the package maybe we can work a deal for some of your french fries youre the one investigating the fires right boyd began slick cilia said glaring at her husband no interrogations on an empty stomach you can grill him after we eat weve been on a plane for hours she explained when bryant came back in and tried to wrestle the ball away from allison were a little edgy no problem ah instant before boyd ry snatched the ball that squirted out of flailing hands like to shoot hoop he asked allison uhhuh she gave him a quick winning smile i made the team bryant didnt basketballs stupid sulking bryant slouched in a chair id rather play nintendo ry juggled keenan on his back as he turned the ball in his hands it so happens ive got a game in a couple of hours maybe youd like to come really allisons eyes lit as she turned to cilia mom it sounds like fun intrigued cilia strolled toward the kitchen ill just give natalie a hand and she thought pump her sisterinlaw for details chapter contents prev next the last place natalie expected to spend her saturday afternoon was courtside watching cops and fire fighters play round ball she sulked through most of the first quarter her elbow on her knee her chin on her fist after all ry hadnt mentioned the game to her hadnt directly invited her she was there to witness what was obviously an important annual rivalry only because of her niece not that it mattered to her she assured herself ry was certainly under no obligation to include her in his personal entertainment the pig beside her allison was in basketball heaven cheering on the red jerseys with a rabid fans passionate enthusiasm her brandycolored eyes glinted as she followed the action up and down the court of the old westside gym its not such a bad way to spend the afternoon cilia commented over the shrill sound of the refs whistle watching a bunch of halfnaked guys sweat her eyes the same warm shade as her daughters danced by the way your guys very cute i told you hes not my guy were just yeah you told me chuckling cilia wrapped an arm around natalies shoulders cheer up nat if youd gone along with boyd and the boys to unload at deborahs your big bro would be grilling you right now youve got a point she let out a sigh despite herself she was following the action the cops were doubleteaming ry consistently she noted not a bad strategy as he played like a steamroller and lad already scored seven points in the first quarter not that she was counting he didnt mention this game to me she muttered oh fighting back a grin cilia ran her tongue over her teeth he must have had something else on his mind hey she surged to her feet along with most of the crowd as one of the blue jerseys rammed an elbow sharply in rys ribs foul cilia shouted between her cupped hands he can take it natalie mumbled and tried not to care as ry approached the foul line hes got an iron stomach she struggled between pride and resentment when he sank his shot rys the best allison beamed well into a deep case of hero worship did you see how he moves upcourt and hes got a terrific vertical leap hes already blocked three shots under the hoop so maybe he looked good natalie conceded those long muscled legs pumping those broad shoulders slick with sweat all that wonderful hair flying as he pivoted or leapt then there was that look that came into his eyes wolfish and arrogant so maybe she wanted him to win that didnt mean she was going to stand up and cheer by the third quarter she was on her feet like the rest of the crowd when ry sank a threepointer that put the smoke eaters over the bloodhounds by two nothing but net she shouted jostling cilia did you see that hes got some great moves cilia agreed fast hands yeah natalie felt the foolish grin spread over her face tell me about it heart thumping she dropped back on the bench she was leaning forward now her gaze glued to the ball the sound of running feet echoed as the men pounded upcourt the cops took a shot the smoke eaters blocked it the ensuing scuffle left two men on the ground others snarling in each others faces as the ref blew his whistle now natalie thought grimly they were playing dirty with a grunt she dipped her hand into the bag of salted nuts cilia offered fast break flying elbows a tangle of bodies under the net as the ball shot up careened was pursued going to put out your fire piasecki one of the cops taunted natalie saw ry flick the sweaty hair out of his eyes and grin not with that equipment trash talk natalie sneered at the cop as she chomped a peanut no round ball game was complete without it she hooted down the referee as he stepped between two overenthusiastic competitors barely preventing an informal boxing match boys boys cilia said with a sigh they always take their games so seriously games are serious natalie muttered it was too close to call natalie continued to munch on peanuts as a sensible alternative to her fingernails when a timeout was called she glanced at the clock there was less than six minutes to go and the bloodhounds were up to on the sidelines the smoke eaters coach was surrounded by his team the lanky silverhaired man was punching his fist into his palm to accentuate whatever instructions he was giving his men most were bent at the waist hands on knees as they caught their breath for the final battle as they headed back onto the court ry turned his gaze shot unerringly to natalie and he grinned quick cocky arrogant wow cilia murmured now thats serious very powerful stuff youre telling me natalie blew out a breath when that did nothing to level her system she used the excess energy to cheer on her team it was a fight to the finish the lead tipping back to the smoke eaters then sliding away as time dripped away second by second the crowd stayed on its feet building a wall of sound with seconds to go the smoke eaters a point behind natalie was chewing on her knuckles then she saw ry make his move oh yes she whispered it first almost like a prayer then she began to shout it as he burst through the line of defense controlling the ball as if it were attached to the palm of his hand by an invisible string they blocked he pivoted he had one chance and he was surrounded natalies heart tripped as he feinted faked then sprang off the floor with a turnaround jump shot that found the sweet spot the crowd went wild natalie knew she did spinning around to hug allison then cilia what was left of the peanuts flew through the air like rain the instant the clock ran out the stands emptied in a surge of bodies onto the court she caught a glimpse of ry a moment before he was swallowed up she sank back onto the bench with a hand over her heart im exhausted she laughed and rubbed her damp hands on the knees of her jeans ive got to sit what a game allison was bouncing up and down in her sneakers wasnt he great did you see mom he scored thirtythree points wasnt he great you bet can we tell him can we go down and tell him cilia studied the jostling crowd then looked into her daughters shining eyes sure coming natalie ill stay here if you manage to get to him tell him ill hang around and wait okay youll bring him to dinner at debs tonight cautious natalie drummed her fingers on her knee ill run it by him bring him cilia ordered then leaned over and kissed natalies cheek see you later gradually the gym emptied the fans swarming out to celebrate the players heading off to shower content natalie sat in the quiet it had been her first full day off in six months and shed decided it wasnt such a bad way to spend it after all and since ry hadnt actually asked her to come he was under no real obligation neither of them was sensibly neither of them was looking for restrictions for commitments for romance it was simply a primal urge on both parts fiercely intense now and very likely to fade it was fortunate that they both understood that right from the beginning there was some affection between them naturally and respect but this wasnt a relationship in the true sense of the word neither of them wanted that it was simply an affair enjoyable while it lasted no harm done when it ended then he walked out on court his hair dark and damp from his shower his gaze swept up and locked on hers oh boy was all she could think while her heart turned a long slow somersault she was in trouble good game she managed and forced herself to stand and walk down to him it had its moments he cocked his head you know its the first time ive seen you dressed in anything but one of those highclass suits to cover the sudden rash of nerves natalie reached down and picked up one of the game balls jeans and sweaters arent usually office attire they look good on you legs thanks she turned the ball in her hand studying it rather than him allison had the time of her life it was nice of you to invite her shes a cute kid they all are shes got your mouth you know and the jawline shes going to be a real heartbreaker right now shes more interested in scoring points on court than scoring them with boys more relaxed natalie looked up again smiling at him you scored a few yourself today inspector thirtythree he said but whos counting allison and she had been too carrying the ball she wandered out on the court i take it this was your annual battle against the bloodhounds yeah we take them on once a year the proceeds go to charity and all that but mostly we come to beat the hell out of each other head down she bounced the ball once caught it you never mentioned it i mean not until allison showed up no he was watching her intrigued if he wasnt mistaken there was a touch of annoyance in her voice i guess i didnt she turned her head why didnt you definitely annoyed he decided and scratched his cheek i didnt figure it would be your kind of thing now her chin angled oh really hey its not the opera or the ballet he shrugged and tucked his thumbs in his front pockets or a fancy french restaurant she let out a slow breath drew another in are you calling me a snob again careful piasecki he warned himself there was definitely a trapdoor here somewhere not exactly lets just say i couldnt see someone like you getting worked up over a basketball game someone like me she repeated stung she pivoted planted her feet and sent the ball sailing toward the hoop it swished through bounced on the court when she looked back at ry she had the satisfaction of seeing his mouth hanging open someone like me she said again and went to retrieve the ball just what does that mean piasecki he got his hands out of his pockets just in time to catch the ball she heaved at him before it thudded into his chest he passed it back to her hard lifting a brow when she caught it do that again he demanded all right deliberately she stepped behind the threepoint line gauged her shot and let it rip the whisper of the ball dropping through the hoop made her smile well well well this time ry retrieved the ball himself he was rapidly reassessing his opponent im impressed legs definitely impressed how about a little oneonone fine she crouched circling him as he dribbled you know i cant quick as a snake she darted in snatched the ball she executed a perfect layup tapping the ball on the backboard and into the hoop i believe thats my point she said and passed the ball back to him youre good oh im better than good flicking her hair back she moved in to block him i was allstate in college pal team captain my junior and senior years where do you think allison gets it okay aunt nat lets play ball he pivoted away she was on him like glue good moves he noted smooth aggressive maybe he held back after all he wasnt about to send a woman to the boards no matter how much male ego was on the line she didnt have the same sensitivity and turned into his block hard enough to take his breath away frowning he rubbed the point under his heart where her shoulder had rammed her eyes were glittering now bold as the emerald city thats a foul she stole the ball made the point with an impressive overtheshoulder hook i dont see a ref she had the advantage and they both knew it not only had he played fullout for an entire game but shed had that time to assess his technique study his moves and she was better he had to admit a hell of a lot better than half the cops who had gone up against him that afternoon and worse she knew it he scored off her but it was no easy thing she was sneaky he discovered using speed and grace and oldfashioned guts to make up for the difference in height they juggled the lead shed shoved the sleeves of her sweater up she leapt with him blocking his shot by a fingertip and having no compunctions about using whatever talent she had let her body bump linger then slide against his his blood heated as shed meant it to panting he picked up the ball and stared at her her lips were curved smugly her face was flushed her hair was tumbled he realized he could eat her alive he moved in quickly startling her she let out a squeal when he snatched her around the waist and hauled her over his shoulder she was laughing when he sent the ball home with his free hand now thats definitely a foul i dont see any ref he shifted her letting gravity take her down until they were facetoface her legs clamped at his waist he reached out gathered her hair in one hand and pulled her mouth to his whatever breath she had left clogged opening to him she dived into the greedy kiss and demanded more the blood drained so quickly so completely out of his head he nearly staggered with a sudden voracious appetite he tore his mouth from hers and devoured the flesh of her throat smooth salty with the lingering undertone of that haunting scent she used his mouth watered theres a storeroom in the back that locks her hands were already tugging at his shirt her breathing was ragged then why are we out here good question with her locked around him her teeth doing incredible things to his ear he pushed through the swinging doors and turned into a narrow corridor desperate for her he fumbled at the knob of the storeroom door swore then shoved it open when he slammed it and locked it at their backs they were closed in a tiny room crammed with sports equipment and smelling of sweat impatient natalie tugged at his hair dragging his mouth back to hers he nearly tripped over a medicine ball as he looked around frantically for something anything that could double as a bed he settled on a weight bench with natalie on his lap i feel like a damn teenager he muttered pulling at the snap of her jeans beneath the denim her skin was hot damp trembling me too her heart was beating against her ribs like a hammer oh god i want you hurry frantic hands tore at clothes scattered them there was no time no need for finesse only for heat it was building inside her so fast so hot she felt she might implode and there would be nothing left of her but a shell his hands were at her throat her breasts her hips thrilling her tormenting her nothing and no one mattered but him and this wild incendiary fire they set together she wanted it hotter higher faster with a low feline sound that shuddered through his blood she straddled him his heart seemed to stop in the instant she imprisoned him as her body arched back her eyes closing she filled his vision his mind left him helpless then her eyes opened again and locked on his she began to move fast and agile already it was flash point he let the power take him and her ive never done anything like this before staggered and spent natalie struggled back into her clothes i mean never it wasnt exactly the way id planned it baffled ry dragged a hand through his hair were worse than a couple of kids natalie smoothed down her sweater sighing lavishly it was fabulous his lips twitched yeah then he sobered so are you she smiled and tried fingercombing her hair into place wed better stop pushing our luck and get out of here and ive got to get home and change she discovered that one of her earrings had fallen out and located it on the floor theres dinner at the guthries tonight he watched her fasten the earring foolishly charmed by the simple female act ill give you a lift home id appreciate it feeling awkward she turned to unlock the door youre welcome to come to dinner i know boyd wants a chance to talk with you about the fires he closed a hand over hers on the knob hows the food she smiled again looking back at him fabulous she was right about the food ry discovered rack of lamb fresh asparagus glossy candied yams all accompanied by some golden french wine he knew of course that gage guthrie was dripping with money but nothing had prepared him for the gothic mansion of a house with its towers and turrets and terraces the next thing to a castle ry had thought when he viewed it from the outside inside it was home rich and elaborate certainly but warm deborah had given him a partial tour down winding corridors up curving steps before they all settled into the enormous dining room with its oxroasting stone fireplace and winking crystal chandeliers it might ry thought have had the flavor of a museum if not for the people in it hed clicked with deborah instantly hed heard she was a tough and tenacious prosecutor she had a softer more vulnerable look than her sister but she had a reputation for being formidable in court it was obvious her husband adored her there were little signs the quick shared looks the touch of a hand it was very much the same between boyd and cilia ry calculated that theyd been together for a decade or so but the spark was still very much in evidence and the kids were great hed always had a soft spot for children he recognized and was touched by allisons preadolescent crush and obliged her by going over the highlights of the game since cilia had wisely seen to it that her oldest son was across the table and two chairs down from his sister bryant was free to badger deborah about how many bad guys shed locked up since last hed seen her and dinner was a relatively peaceful affair do you ride in a fire truck keenan wanted to know i used to ry told him how come you stopped i told you bryant said rolling his eyes with the disdain only a sibling knows and understands he goes after bad guys now like dad only just bad guys who burn things down dont you thats right id rather ride in a fire truck in a canny move to avoid the asparagus on his plate keenan slipped out of his chair and into rys lap keenan cilia said rys trying to eat hes okay enjoying himself ry shifted the boy onto his knee did you ever ride in one nuhuh he smiled winningly using his big soft eyes can i if your mom and dad say its okay you could come down to the station tomorrow take a look around cool bryant had immediately picked up on the invitation can we dad i dont see why not aunt nat knows where it is ry added as keenan bounced gleefully on his knee make it around ten and ill give you a tour pretty exciting stuff cilia rose and if were going to pull it off id say you three better get washed up and bedded down the kneejerk protest might have been stronger if not for the long day the children had put in cilia merely shook her head looking at boyd slick okay he rose and tossed bryant up and over his shoulder turning whines into giggles lets move out ill give you a hand natalie plucked keenan from rys lap say goodnight pal good night pal he echoed and nuzzled into her neck you smell as good as thea aunt nat thanks honey am i going to get a story swindler she laughed and carried him out nice family ry commented we like them deborah smiled at him youve certainly given them something to look forward to tomorrow no big deal the guys love to show off for kids great meal franks one in a million she agreed a former pickpocket she closed her hand over gages who now uses those nimble fingers to create gastronomic miracles why dont we have coffee in the small salon ill go help frank with it this is some house ry said as he and gage left the dining room and wound their way toward the salon ever get lost ive got a good sense of direction there was a fire burning in the salon and the lights were low and welcoming again ry got the impression of home settled content you used to be a cop didnt you gage stretched out in a chair thats right my partner and i were working on a sting that went wrong all the way wrong it still hurt but the wounds were scarred over now he ended up dead and i was the next thing to it when i came out of it i didnt want to pick up a badge again rough ry knew it was a great deal more than that if he had the story right in his head gage had lingered in a coma for months before facing life again so you picked up the family business instead so to speak we have something in common there youre running the family business too ry gave gage a level look so to speak i checked you out natalies important to deborah and to me i can tell you in advance boyds going to ask if shes important to you he glanced up as boyd walked in that was fast i saw my chance and went over the wall he dropped into a chair crossed his feet at the ankles so piasecki whats going on between you and my sister ry decided hed been polite long enough and took out a cigarette he lit it flipped the match into a spotless crystal ashtray id say anybody who makes captain on the force should be able to figure that out for himself gage smothered a laugh with a cough as boyds eyes narrowed natalies not a tossaway boyd said carefully i know what she is ry returned and i know what she isnt if you want to grill someone on whats going on between us captain youd better start with her boyd considered nodded fair enough give me a rundown on the arson investigation that he could and would do ry related the sequence the facts his own steps and conclusions answering boyds terse questions with equal brevity im betting on clarence he finished i know his pattern and how his warped mind works and ill get him he said and blew out a last stream of smoke thats a promise in the meantime natalie needs to beef up security boyds mouth thinned ill see to that ry tapped out his cigarette i already have i was talking about personal security not business so was i im not going to let anything happen to her he continued as boyd studied him thats another promise boyd let out a snort do you really think shell listen to you yeah shes not going to get a choice boyd paused reevaluated maybe im going to like you after all inspector okay break it up deborah ordered as she wheeled in a cart laden with a huge silver coffee urn and meissen china i know youre talking shop gage rose to take the cart from her and kiss her youre just mad because you might have missed something exactly jacoby boyd tossed at her clarence robert ring any bells her brow furrowed as she poured coffee jacoby also known as jack jacoby she served boyd took another cup to ry skipped bail a couple of years ago on an arson charge i like your wife ry said to gage theres nothing quite like a sharp mind in a firstclass package thanks gage poured a cup for himself i often think the same jacoby deborah repeated focusing on ry you think hes the one thats right wed have a file on him she glanced at her husband the computers in gages hidden room could access everything about jacoby right down to his shoe size im not sure who had the case but i can find out on monday see that you get whatever we have id appreciate it howd he manage bail boyd wanted to know i cant tell you until i see the file deborah began i can tell you about him ry drank his coffee keeping one ear out for natalies return he wasnt sure shed appreciate having her business discussed while she was out of the room his patterns empty buildings warehouses condemned apartments sometimes the owners hire him for the insurance sometimes he does it for kicks we only tried him twice convicted him once there wasnt any loss of life either time clarence doesnt burn people just things so now hes loose boyd said in disgust for the time being ry returned were ready for him he picked up his cup again when he heard natalie and cilia laughing in the hallway youre a softie nat its my duty and my privilege to spoil them they entered together cilia immediately headed for boyd and dropped into his lap they had her jumping through hoops they did not natalie poured her coffee then laughed again not exactly she smiled at ry before settling beside him so she began have you finished discussing my personal and business life a sharp mind ry commented in a firstclass package later as they drove away from the guthrie mansion natalie studied rys profile should i apologize for boyd he didnt pull out the rubber hoses ry shrugged hes okay ive got a couple of sisters i know how it is oh frowning she looked out the window i didnt realize you had siblings im polish and irish and you figured me for an only child he grinned at her two older sisters one in columbus the other down in baltimore and a brother a year younger than me living in phoenix four of you she murmured until you count the nieces and nephews there were eight of them last time i checked and my brother has another on the way which probably explained why he was so easy around children youre the only one who stayed in urbana yeah they all wanted out i didnt he turned down her street slowed am i staying tonight natalie she looked at him again how could he be so much of a stranger she wondered and so much of a need i want you to she said i want you chapter contents prev next can i slide down the pole mr pisessy please can i slide down it ry grinned at the way keenan massacred his name and flipped the brim of the boys baseball cap to the back of his curly head ry cause keenan said big eyes sober and hopeful i never ever did it before no not why ry you call me ry and sure you can slide down it hold it laughing he caught keenan at the waist before the boy could make the leap from floor to pole no flies on you huh keenan looked around grinned nuhuh lets do it this way with keenan firmly at his hip ry reached out to grip the pole ready lets go in a smooth practiced move ry stepped into air keenan laughed all the way down again keenan squealed lets do it again your brother wants a turn ry looked up saw bryants anxious eager face in the opening come on bryant go for it definitely daddy material cilia murmured watching her son zip down the pole shut up cilia natalie slipped her hands into the pockets of her blazer she was itching to try the ride herself just an observation attagirl allison she added cheering her daughter on when allison dropped lightly to the floor hes giving the kids the time of their lives here i know its very sweet of him she smiled as ry obliged keenan with another trip down the pole i didnt know he could be sweet ah hidden qualities cilia glanced over to where boyd was holding a conversation with two uniformed fire fighters often the most attractive kind in a man especially when hes crazy about you hes not it amazed natalie to feel heat rising to her cheeks were just enjoying each other yeah sure with a mothers honed reflexes cilia crouched and caught her youngest as he flew at her look mom its a real actual firemans hat the helmet ry had given keenan to wear slipped down over the boys face inside it smelled mysteriously fascinatingly of smoke and ry says we can go sit in the fire engine now after wriggling down and dancing in place he shouted at his brother and sister lets go accompanied by two fire fighters the children dashed off to check out the engine with a signal to cilia to wait boyd disappeared up the steps with ry well cilia sniffed and shrugged the womenfolk have been dismissed theyll go upstairs to grunt significantly over official business i wish boyd wouldnt worry so much theres really nothing he can do older siblings are programmed to worry cilia slung an arm around natalies shoulder but if it helps hes feeling a lot less worried since hes met ry thats something i suppose relaxed again she walked with cilia toward the back of the engine so hows althea doing around the front the children were barraging the fire fighters with questions the last time i talked to her she claimed she was as big as two houses and miserably bored with desk duty shes the sexiest expectant mother ive ever seen since colt and boyd ganged up on her shes at home on full maternity leave i dropped over to see her one day a couple of weeks ago and caught her knitting knitting natalie let out a fullthroated laugh althea funny what marriage and family can do to you yeah natalies smile faded a bit i suppose thats true upstairs boyd was frowning over rys reports why upstairs in the office he asked why didnt he start the fire in the showroom it seems to me there would have been more damage more quickly the showroom window could have put him off i figure the storeroom would have made more sense if he was just looking to burn the place down its private full of stock and boxes ry set aside his coffee he really had to start cutting down i figure he was following instructions clarence is real good at following instructions whose thats the ticket ry kicked back in his chair and propped his feet on his desk ive got two incendiary fires that are obviously related the target in both cases is a single business and both i believe were started by a single perpetrator so hes on somebodys payroll boyd set the reports aside a competitor were checking it out but its unlikely a competitor would be able to give your pal clarence access to either building you didnt find any sign of forced entry thats right ry lit a cigarette a man couldnt cut down on two vices at once which leads us to natalies organization boyd got up to pace i cant claim to know her staff certainly not in this new project of hers i dont deal with the business end of fletcher unless im backed into a corner he regretted that now only because he would have been more help if hed been familiar with her procedures and personnel but i can get a lot of information from my parents particularly on her top people it couldnt hurt the fact that there was only cosmetic damage at the last fire leads to the conclusion that therell be another if clarence follows his pattern hell hit her again within the next ten days he tossed papers aside well be waiting for him boyd looked back and measured the man tough smart but as he knew from personal experience the job could get sticky when a man found himself involved with a target and while youre waiting for him youll keep natalie out of it thats the idea and while youre doing that youre going to be able to separate the woman youre involved with from the case youre trying to close ry lifted a brow that was going to be a challenge and the difficulty of meeting that challenge had crossed his mind more than once the trouble was he wasnt willing to give up either the woman or the case i know what needs to be done captain with a nod boyd placed his palms on the desk and leaned forward im trusting you with her piasecki on every level if she gets hurt on any level im coming after you fair enough an hour later natalie stood on the curb outside the station waving goodbye you were a big hit inspector hey a shiny red fire truck a long brass pole how could i miss laughing she turned to link her arms around his neck thanks she kissed him lightly for for being so nice to my family it wasnt a hardship i like kids it shows and she kissed him again thats for putting boyds mind at ease i dont know if id go quite that far hes still thinking about punching me out if i make the wrong move with his baby sister well then her eyes danced up at his youd better be careful because my big brother is plenty tough you dont have to draw me a picture he swung her toward the doors come on back up with me i need to get a couple of things all right theyd barely started up the stairs when the bells sounded oh the sound of clattering feet echoed below them im sorry the kids missed this then she stopped wincing thats terrible acting like a fires a form of entertainment its a natural reaction bells whistles men in funny uniforms its a hell of a show they crossed over to his office she waited while he sorted through papers do you ever get cats out of trees yep and kids heads out of the pickets on railings i got someones pet iguana out of a sewer pipe once youre joking hey we dont joke about rescue he looked up and grinned she looked so tidy he thought in her navy blazer and slacks with the cashmere sweater red as one of his engines softly draped at the neck her hair was loose honey gold when she tucked it behind her ear in that fluid unconscious movement he could see the wink of rich blue stones sapphires he assumed only the genuine article would suit natalie fletcher what is it a little selfconscious under his stare she shifted did keenan leave something edible smeared on my face no you look good legs want to go somewhere go somewhere the idea put her off balance apart from the challenge of that first meal they hadnt actually gone anywhere like a movie or he supposed he could handle it a museum or something i yes thatd be nice it shouldnt be so awkward she thought to plan a simple date with someone youd been sleeping with which either okay he stuffed some papers in a battered briefcase the guys should have a newspaper downstairs well check it out fine when they started out natalie glanced first toward the stairs and then back toward the poles she took a deep breath and gave up ry yeah can i slide down the pole he stopped dead and stared down at her you want to slide down the pole amused at herself natalie shrugged her shoulders ry ive got to slide down the pole its driving me crazy no kidding his grin broke out as he put a hand on her shoulder and turned her around okay aunt nat ill go down first in case you lose your nerve im not going to lose my nerve she said huffily ill have you know ive been rockclimbing dozens of times theres that height thing again you get a good grip he continued demonstrating swing yourself forward you can wrap your legs around it as you go down he flowed down smooth and fast frowning she leaned over peering at him through the opening you didnt wrap your legs around it i dont have to he said dryly im a professional come on and dont worry ill catch you i dont need you to catch me insulted she tossed back her hair she reached out took a good grip on the brass pole then swung agilely into space it took a matter of seconds her heart had barely had time to settle before her feet hit the floor laughing she looked longingly up again see i didnt need her boast ended on a squeal of surprise as he scooped her up into his arms what youre a natural he was grinning as he lowered his mouth to hers and a constant surprise to him he thought she angled her head settling her arms comfortably around his neck i could do it again if youd do it in red suspenders a pair of those really little shorts and let me take a picture the guys would be very grateful she lifted a brow i think ill just make a cash donation to the department its not the same inspector the dispatcher poked his head out of a doorway his smile spread slowly at the sight of the woman bundled in rys arms suspicious fire over at east newberry they want you tell them im on my way he set natalie back on her feet sorry its all right i know how it is her disappointment was completely out of proportion she lectured herself ive got some work i should be catching up on anyway ill grab a cab ill take you home ry told her on my way he steered her toward the bench where shed left her coat are you just going to be hanging around at the apartment yes there are some spreadsheets i should have looked at yesterday so ill call you as ry helped her on with her coat she glanced over her shoulder all right he turned her completely around and indulged himself with one long hard kiss tell you what ill just come by when im done natalie worked on getting her breath back better she managed thats even better by the middle of the week natalie had discovered that for the first time in memory she was behind on her own personal schedule not only had she blown the previous weekend but she hadnt put in a decent nights work all week how could she when she and ry were spending every free moment together every evening they settled into her apartment ordered dinner which more often than not had to be reheated after theyd feasted on each other she didnt think of work from the time he arrived on her doorstep until she rushed into her office the next morning she didnt think of anything but him besotted was what she was natalie admitted as she stared out her office window fascinated by the man and by what happened every time they got within arms reach of each other it was crazy of course she knew it but it was so wonderful at the moment it didnt seem to matter and she could justify it since she hadnt yet missed any meetings or business deadlines now that ry had given her the goahead shed authorized the cleanup and redecorating at the flagship store the stock there was nearly all in place and the windowdressing was complete it was only a matter of days before the grand opening nationwide and thered been no more incidents that was how she liked to think of the fires now as incidents she should of course be making plans to visit all the branches within the next ten days but the thought of traveling just then seemed so annoying so depressing so lonely she could delegate melvin or donald to make the tour it wouldnt even be outside of proper business procedure to do so but it wasnt her style to delegate what should be done by her maybe if things got settled somehow ry could get a few days off go with her it would be wonderful to have company his company on a quick business trip she could put it off until after the grand opening instead of before and then turning away from the window she answered the buzzer on her desk yes maureen ms marks to see you ms fletcher thanks send her in with an effort natalie shifted her personal thoughts to the back of her mind and welcomed her accounting executive deirdre have a seat im sorry im so behind deirdre blew her choppy bangs out of her eyes before she dropped a thick stack of files on natalies desk every time we turn around the systems down natalie frowned as she picked up the first file have you called in the engineer hes practically living in my lap deirdre plopped into a chair and set one practical flatheeled shoe on her knee he fixes it we forge ahead and it goes down again believe me running figures has become a challenge weve still got some time before the end of the quarter ill call the computer people myself this afternoon if their equipments unstable theyll have to replace it immediately good luck deirdre said dryly the good news is i was able to run a chart on the early catalog sales i think youll be pleased with the results mmm hmm natalie was already flipping through the files fortunately the fires didnt destroy records youd have a real accounting nightmare on your hands if it had gotten to the files at the flagship youre telling me deirdre rubbed her fingers over her eyes the way the systems been hiccuping id sweat bullets without those hard copies well relax ive got copies of the copies as well as the backup disks tucked away i was hoping to run a full audit by the middle of march she saw the wince before deirdre could mask it but she added leaning back if we keep running into these glitches well have to put it off until after the taxseason rush my life for you solemnly deirdre thumped a fist on her breast now to the nittygritty your outlay is still within the projected parameters barely with the insurance payments well offset some of that natalie nodded and made herself focus on budgets and percentages a few hours later in a seedy downtown motel clarence jacoby sat on his sagging bed lighting matches his hands were pudgy smooth as a girls each time he would strike the match and watch the magic flare waiting waiting until the heat just kissed the tips of his fingers before blowing it out the ashtray beside him was overflowing with the matches that had already flared and burned clarence could entertain himself for hours with nothing more i he thought nearly every night about burning down the hotel it would be exciting to start the blaze right in his own room watch it grow and spread but he wouldnt be alone and that stopped him clarence didnt care overmuch about people or the risk to their lives he simply preferred to be alone with his fires hed learned not to stay overlong after hed ignited them the rippling scars over his neck and chest were daily reminders of how quickly how fiercely the dragon could turn even on one who loved it so he contented himself with merely conceiving the fire basking for a regrettably short time in its heat before fleeing six months before in detroit hed torched an abandoned warehouse that the owner had no longer needed or wanted it was the kind of favor a profitable one on all sides that clarence enjoyed he had stayed to watch that fire burn oh hed been out of the building and deep in the shadows but theyd nearly caught him those cops and arson people scanned the crowds at the scene just for a face like his a worshipful face a happy face with a giggle clarence struck another match but hed gotten away and hed learned another lesson it wasnt smart to stay and watch he didnt need to stay and watch there were so many fires so many fierce and beautiful blazes living in his mind and heart he didnt need to stay he had only to close his eyes and see them feel them smell them he was humming to himself when the phone rang his round childlike face beamed happily when he heard the sound only one person had his number here and that person would have only one reason to call it was time he knew to free the dragon again at his desk ry pored over lab reports it was nearly seven and already dark outside hed given up on cutting down on coffee and drank it hot and black from a chipped mug he needed to quit for the day he recognized the slow process of shutting down in his mind and body somehow or other in the past couple of weeks hed gotten into a routine he was now beginning to depend on no not somehow or other ry reminded himself scrubbing his hands over his face someone he was getting much too used to knocking off for the day and heading for her apartment he even had a key to her front door in his pocket now something that had been given and taken without ceremony as if neither of them wanted to acknowledge what that simple piece of metal stood for theyd have a meal he thought theyd talk maybe watch one of the old movies on television something theyd discovered by accident they both loved most of what theyd discovered about each other he mused had been by accident or by observation he knew she liked long bubble baths in the evening with the water too hot and a glass of chilled wine sitting on the rim of the tub she stepped out of those anklebreakers she wore the minute she walked in the door and she put everything away in its place she slept in silk and hogged the blankets her alarm went off at seven on the dot every morning and if he wasnt quick enough to delay her she was out of the bed seconds later she had a weakness for strawberry ice cream and bigband music she was loyal and smart and strong and he was in love with her sitting back ry rested his eyes a problem he thought his problem theyd had an unspoken agreement going in and he knew it no ties no tangles he didnt want them god knew he couldnt afford them with her they were opposites on every level but one the physical needs that had brought them together no matter how intense couldnt override everything else not in the long term so there couldnt be a long term he would do what was smart what was right and see her through the arson investigation and that would be that would have to be that and to save them both an unpleasant scene hed start backing away a little starting now he rose and grabbed his jacket he wouldnt go to her place tonight he looked guiltily at the phone thinking of calling her making some excuse with an oath he turned out the lights he wasnt her damn husband he reminded himself he never would be compelled by a nagging sense of unrest like an itch between his shoulder blades ry drove out to natalies plant hed done a great deal of driving around since he left the station it was after ten oclock now moonless windless he sat in his car slumped behind the wheel and tried not to think of her of course he thought of her she was probably wondering where he was he figured shed assume hed gotten a call shed wait up guilt worked at him again it was his least favorite emotion it wasnt right to be inconsiderate to worry her just because hed had a scare and maybe he wasnt in love with her maybe he was just hung up a man could get hung up on a woman without wanting to slit his throat when she walked away couldnt he disgusted ry reached for his car phone the least he could do was call and tell her he was busy it wasnt like checking in he assured himself it was just being polite and since when had he worried about manners cursing he began to dial but the itch came back slowly his eyes scanning the dark he replaced the phone had he heard something a check of his watch told him the patrol hed assigned would make their run by in another ten minutes no harm he decided in taking a look around himself on foot in the meantime he eased his door open and slipped out he could hear nothing now but the faint swish of traffic two blocks away cautious he reached back in the car for his flashlight but he didnt turn it on not yet he thought his eyes were accustomed enough to the dark for him to see where he was going instinct had him heading silently around the back hed already cased the plant himself noting where the exits were located the security the fire doors hed make a circle check each door and window on the main level himself he heard it again the scrape of a foot over gravel ry shifted the flashlight in his hand holding it like a weapon now as he moved closer tensed ready he slipped through the shadows if it was the security guard ry knew he was about to give the man the fright of his life otherwise a giggle faint and delighted the slow moaning whine of a metal door moving on its hinges ry flashed on his light and spotlighted clarence jacoby hows it going clarence ry grinned as the man blinked against the glare ive been waiting for you whos that clarences voice raced up a register whos that hey im hurt ry lowered the light out of clarences eyes and stepped closer dont you recognize your old pal squinting clarence separated the man from the shadows in a moment his baffled face exploded in a wide grin piasecki hey ry piasecki hows it going youre inspector now right i hear youre an inspector now thats right ive been looking for you clarence oh yeah shyly clarence dipped his head how come i put out that little campfire you started the other night you must be losing your touch clarence oh hey still grinning clarence spread his arms out i dont know nothing about that you remember when we got burned piasecki hell of a night wasnt it that dragon was really big almost ate us up i remember clarence moistened his lips scared you bad too i heard the nurses talking in the burn ward about the nightmares i had a few of them and you dont fight fire no more do you dont want to slay the dragon now do you i like squashing little bugs like you better ry swung his light down shone it on the gas cans at clarences feet what do you know clarence you still use premium grade too i didnt do nothing clarence whirled to make a dash into the dark even as ry leapt forward the man jerked back as if on a string staggered ry stared at the darkclad arms that seemed to shoot straight out from the buildings wall and wrap around clarences neck then it was a shadow flowing out of nothing then it was a man flowing out of the shadow i dont believe the inspector was finished talking to you clarence nemesis kept one arm hooked around clarences neck as he faced ry were you inspector no i wasnt ry let out a long breath thanks my pleasure its a ghost a ghosts got me clarences eyes turned up white and he fainted dead away i imagine you could have handled him on your own nemesis passed the limp body to ry waiting until ry had hefted clarence over his shoulder i appreciate it anyway there was a quick flash of teeth as nemesis smiled i like your style inspector same goes you want to explain that little trick when you came out of the wall ry began but he was talking to air before the sentence was finished not bad he muttered and was shaking his head as he carted clarence to the car not bad at all the phone awakened natalie from where shed dozed off on the couch groggy she stumbled toward it trying to read the time on her watch yes hello its ry oh she rubbed the sleep from her eyes its after one i was sorry to wake you no its not that i just weve got him what her irritation that he had yet to let her finish a sentence sharpened the word clarence i picked him up tonight i thought youd want to know now her head was reeling yes of course thats wonderful but when im tied up here natalie ill get back to you when i can all right but she took the receiver away from her ear and glared at the dial tone congratulations inspector she muttered and hung up with her hands on her hips she took several deep breaths to calm herself and to clear her head shed been worried sick her own fault she admitted ry was certainly under no obligation to come to her after work or to call even if he had been doing just that for days and even if she had waited by the phone for hours until simple fatigue spared her the continued humiliation put that aside she ordered herself the important matter here was that clarence jacoby was in custody there would be no more fires no more incidents and in the morning she promised herself as she stomped badtemperedly off to the bedroom shed track ry down and get the whole story in the meantime she thought as she slipped out of her robe all she had to do was teach herself to sleep alone again even as she settled onto the pillow she knew it was going to be a very long night chapter contents prev next since there seemed little point in going home after hed finished at the police station ry dropped down on the sagging sofa in his office and caught three hours sleep before the sirens awakened him following old habit his feet hit the floor before he remembered he didnt have to answer the bell any longer years of training would have allowed him to simply roll over and go back to sleep instead he staggered blearyeyed toward the coffeepot measuring flipping switches his only goal at the moment was to take a giant mug of coffee to the showers with him and to stay there for an hour he lit a cigarette scowling at the pot as it filled drop by stingy drop the brisk knock on his door only made his scowl deepen turning he aimed his bad temper at natalie your secretary isnt in too early he mumbled and rubbed a hand over his face why in hell did she always have to look so perfect go away natalie im not awake yet i wont go away struggling not to be hurt she set her briefcase down put her hands on her hips obviously she told herself hed had little or no sleep shed be patient ry i need to know what happened last night so i can plan what steps need to be taken i told you what happened you werent very generous with details muttering he snatched up a mug and poured the miserly half cup that had brewed we got your torch hes in custody he wont be lighting any fires for a while patience natalie reminded herself and took a seat clarence jacoby yeah he looked at her what choice did he have she was there stunning and polished and perfect why dont you go to work let me pull it together here ill have a report for you nerves jittered up her spine and down again is something wrong im tired he snapped i cant get a decent cup of coffee and i need a shower and i want you to stop breathing down my neck surprise registered first then retreated behind hurt im sorry she said voice cool and stiff as she rose i was concerned about what happened last night and i wanted to make sure you were all right since i can see that you are fine she picked up her briefcase and since you havent had time to put your report together ill get out of your way he swore dragging a hand through his hair natalie sit down please he added when she just stood aloofly in the doorway im sorry im feeling a little raw this morning and you made the mistake of being the first person in the line of fire i was worried about you she said it quietly but didnt step back into the room im fine turning away he topped off his coffee want some of this no i should have waited for you to contact me i realize that it was she thought like suddenly walking on eggshells one night apart shouldnt make them so awkward with each other if you had id have been worried about you he managed a smile it was low he decided real low to lash out at her because all at once he was deathly afraid of where they were heading sit down ill give you the highlights all right while she did he walked around his desk and kicked back in his chair i had an itch a hunch whatever i decided to take a run by your plant take a look around check the security myself he blew out a stream of smoke smiled through it somebody else had the same idea clarence yeah he was there it was a real party hed knocked out the alarm had himself a full set of keys to the rear door keys eyes sharpening natalie leaned forward thats right shiny new copies the cops have them now there wouldnt have been any sign of breakin he also had a couple of gallons of hightest gas a few dozen matchbooks so we started to have a little conversation i guess clarence didnt like the way it was going and he made a break for it ry paused drawing in smoke shaking his head ive never seen anything like it he murmured im still not sure i did see it what impatient natalie rapped a hand on his desk did you chase him didnt have to your pal took care of it my pal baffled she sat back again what pal nemesis her eyes went wide and stunned you saw him he was there yes and no or no and yes im not sure which he came out of the wall ry said half to himself he came out of the damn wall like smoke he wasnt there then he was then he wasnt natalie cocked a brow ry i really think you need some sleep no question about that rubbing the back of his stiff neck he blew out a breath but thats how it went he came out of the wall first his arms i was standing a foot away and i saw arms come out of the wall and grab clarence then he was just there nemesis clarence took one look at him and fainted enjoying the memory ry grinned folded up like a deck chair so nemesis hands him over to me and i haul him over my shoulder then hes gone clarence nemesis keep up she blinked trying to he nemesis just left he just went back into the wall into the air he flicked his fingers to demonstrate i dont know i probably stood there for five minutes with my mouth hanging open before i carried clarence to the truck brow knit natalie spoke slowly carefully youre telling me the man disappeared in front of your eyes just vanished thats exactly what im telling you ry she said still patient thats not possible i was there he reminded her you werent clarence came to and started babbling about ghosts he was so spooked he tried to jump out of the car while i was driving ry sipped at his coffee i had to knock him out you you knocked him out it was another memory he couldnt help but relish one short punch to that moonshaped jaw he was better off anyway hes in custody now hes not talking but im going to interview him in a couple hours and see if we can change that she sat silently for a moment trying to absorb it all and sort it out the business with nemesis was fascinating and not so difficult to explain it had been dark ry was a trained observer but even he could make a mistake in the dark people didnt just vanish rather than argue with him about it she focused on clarence jacoby he hasnt said why then if he was hired or by whom right now hes claiming he was just out for a walk with several gallons of gasoline oh he says i must have brought the gas with me im framing him because i got burned saving his worthless life insulted natalie lunged to her feet no one believes that her instant defense amused and touched him no legs nobodys buying it weve got him cold on this one and it shouldnt take long for the cops to tie him in with the other fires once clarence realizes hes looking at a long stretch hes likely to sing a different tune nobody likes to go down alone natalie nodded she didnt believe in honor among thieves if and when he does name someone ill need to know right away im limited as to the steps i can take in the meantime ry rapped his fingers on the desk he didnt like the possibility that someone in her organization someone who might be close to her could be behind the fires if clarence points the finger at one of your people the cops take the steps and theyre going to be a lot tougher on them than just firing them or taking away their dental plan im aware of that im also aware that even though the man who held the match had been caught and my property is safe its not over but the tension that had knotted her shoulders was smoothing away i appreciate you looking out for whats mine inspector thats what your tax dollars are for he studied her over the rim of his cup i missed being with you last night he said before he could stop himself her lips curved slowly good because i missed being with you we could make up for it tonight celebrate seeing my tax dollars at work yeah if he was sinking ry thought he just didnt have the energy to fight going under for the third time why dont we do that ill let you get that shower she bent down for her briefcase will you let me know what happens when you talk to clarence sure ill be in touch im going to plan on getting home early she said as she headed for the door good plan he murmured when the door shut behind her third time hell he thought hed drowned days ago and hadnt even noticed natalie arrived at work with a spring in her step and called a staff meeting by ten she was seated at the head of the table in the boardroom her department heads lining both sides of the polished mahogany im pleased to announce that the national grand opening of ladys choice will remain as scheduled for this coming saturday as expected there were polite applause and congratulatory murmurs id like to take this opportunity she continued to thank you all for your hard work and dedication launching a new company of this size takes teamwork long hours and constant innovation im grateful to all of you for giving me your best i particularly appreciate all of your help in the past couple of weeks when the company faced such unexpected difficulties she waited until the murmurs about the fires had died down im aware that our budget is stretched but im also aware that we wouldnt be on schedule without the extra effort each one of you and your staff have given therefore ladys choice is pleased to present bonuses to each and every employee on the first of next month this announcement was greeted with a great deal of enthusiasm only deirdre winced and rolled her eyes natalie flashed a grin at her that held more pleasure than apology we still have a great deal of work ahead of us natalie went on im sure deirdre will tell you that ive given her an enormous headache rather than a bonus natalie waited for the laughter to subside i have faith in her and in ladys choice warranting it in addition she paused the smile still in place her gaze sweeping from face to face i want to ease everyones mind last night the arsonist was apprehended hes now in police custody there was applause a barrage of questions natalie sat with her hands folded on the table watching for waiting for some sign that would tell her if one of the people sitting with her had begun to sweat i dont have all the details she said holding up a hand for quiet only that inspector piasecki apprehended the man outside our plant i expect a full report within fortyeight hours in the meantime we can all thank the diligence of the fire and police departments and get on with our jobs was there a fire at the plant donald wanted to know was anything damaged no i do know that the suspect was caught before he entered the building are they sure its the same one who started the fires at the warehouse and the flagship brow furrowed melvin tugged at his bow tie natalie smiled as a sister of a police captain im certain the authorities wont make a statement like that until they have absolute proof but thats the way it looks who is he donald demanded why did he do it again i dont have all the details hes a known arsonist a professional i believe im sure the motive will come to light before too long ry wasnt nearly as certain by noon hed been with jacoby for an hour covering the same ground the interrogation room was typically dull beige walls beige linoleum the wide mirror that everyone knew was twoway glass he sat on a rockhard chair leaning against the single table smoking lazily while clarence grinned and toyed with his own fingers you know theyre going to lock the door on you clarence ry said by the time you get out this round youll be so old you wont be able to light a match by yourself clarence grinned and shrugged his shoulders i didnt hurt nobody i never hurt nobody he looked up then his small pale eyes friendly you know some people like to burn other people you know that dont you ry yeah clarence i know that not me ry i never burned nobody the eyes lit up happily just you but that was an accident you got scars yeah i got scars me too clarence giggled pleased that they shared something wanna see maybe later i remember when we got burned clarence sure sure you do like a dragons kiss right like being in the bowels of hell ry thought the landlord paid you to light the dragon that time remember i remember nobody lived there it was just an old building i like old empty buildings the fire just eats along sniffs up the walls hides in the ceiling it talks to you youve heard it talk havent you yeah ive heard it who paid you this time clarence playfully clarence put the tips of his fingers together making a bridge i never said anybody paid me i never said i did anything you couldve brought the gas ry youre mad at me for burning you suddenly his smile was crafty you had nightmares in the burn ward i heard about them nightmares about the dragon and now you dont slay the dragon anymore the throb behind his eyes had ry reaching for another cigarette clarence was fascinated by the nightmares had probed time and again during the interview for details even if hed wanted to ry couldnt have given many it was all a blur of fire and smoke blessedly misted with time i had nightmares for a while i got over it i got over being mad at you too clarence we were both just doing our job right ry caught the glint in clarences eyes when the match was lit experimentally ry held the small flame between them its powerful isnt it he murmured just a little flame but you and me we know what it can do to wood paper flesh its powerful and when you feed it it gets stronger and stronger he touched the match to the tip of his cigarette still watching clarence ry licked his forefinger and snuffed out the flame douse it with water cut off its air and poof he tossed the broken match into the overburdened ashtray we both like to control it right yeah clarence licked his lips hoping ry would light another match you get paid for starting them i get paid for putting them out who paid you clarence theyre going to send me up anyway yeah so what have you got to lose nothing sly again clarence looked up at ry through thin pale lashes im not saying i started any fire but if we was to suppose maybe i did i couldnt say who asked me to why not because if we was to suppose i did i never saw who asked me to did you talk to him clarence began to play with his fingers again his face so cheerful ry had to grit his teeth to keep himself from reaching out and squeezing the pudgy neck maybe i talked to somebody maybe i didnt but maybe if i did the voice on the phone was all screwed up like a machine man or woman like a machine clarence repeated gesturing toward rys tape recorder maybe it could have been either maybe they just sent me money to a postoffice box before and after howd they find you clarence moved his right shoulder then his left maybe i didnt ask people find me when they want me his grin lit his face somebody always wants me why that warehouse i didnt say nothing about a warehouse clarence said pokering up why that warehouse ry repeated maybe pleased that ry was playing the game clarence scooted forward in his chair maybe for the insurance maybe because somebody didnt like who owned the place maybe for fun theres lots of reasons for fire ry pressed him and the store the same person owned the store there were pretty things in the store pretty girl things forgetting himself clarence smiled in reminiscence it smelled pretty too even prettier after i poured the gas who told you to pour the gas clarence i didnt say i did you just did clarence pouted like a child did not i said maybe the tape would prove different but ry kept his probing steady you liked the girl things in the store clarences eyes twinkled what store biting back an oath ry leaned back maybe i should call my friend back and let him talk to you what friend from last night you remember last night all color drained from clarences face he was a ghost he wasnt really there sure he was there you saw him you felt him a ghost clarence began to gnaw on his fingernails i didnt like him then youd better talk to me or im going to have to go get him panicked clarence darted his eyes around the room hes not here maybe he is ry said enjoying himself maybe he isnt who paid you clarence i dont know his lips began to tremble just a voice thats all take the money and burn i like money i like to burn started on the nice shiny desk in the store with the girl things just like the voice said to coulda done better in the storeroom but the voice said do the desk uneasy he looked around is he in here what about the envelopes where are the envelopes the money came in burned them clarence grinned again i like to burn things natalie very nearly burned the chicken it wasnt that she was incompetent in the kitchen it was simply she told herself that she rarely found the opportunity to use the culinary skills she possessed meager though they might be with a great deal of cursing and trepidation she removed the browned chicken from the skillet and set it aside as per franks meticulous directions by the time she had the sauce simmering she was feeling smug cooking wasnt really such a big deal she decided if you just concentrated and went stepbystep read the recipe as if it were a contract she thought carefully sliding the chicken into the sauce overlook no clause study the small print and humming to herself she set the cover on the skillet then looked around at the wreck of her kitchen and she decided blowing the hair out of her eyes clean up after yourself because no deal should ever look as though youd sweat over it it took her longer to set the kitchen and herself to rights than it had to prepare the meal after one quick glance at the time she dashed to light the candles and create the mood with a long sigh she dropped onto the arm of the sofa and scanned the room soft lights quiet music the scent of flowers and good food the golden glow of sedate flames in the hearth pleased natalie smoothed a hand down her long silk skirt everything was perfect she decided now where was ry he was pacing the hallway outside her door making too big a deal out of it piasecki he warned himself youre just two people enjoying each other no strings no promises now that clarence was in custody they would start to drift apart naturally no sweat no strain so why in the hell was he standing outside her door nervous as a teenager on a first date why was he holding a bunch of stupid daffodils in his hand he should never have brought her flowers in the first place he decided but if hed had the urge he should have gone for roses at least or orchids something with class just because the yellow blooms had caught his eye and the street vendor had been pushing them that was no reason to dump a bunch of backyard flowers on a woman like natalie he thought seriously about dropping them in front of her neighbors door the idea made him feel even more foolish muttering under his breath he pulled out his key and unlocked the door coming home it was a ridiculous sensation walking into an apartment that wasnt his but it was there as bold as a tenfoot sign as subtle as a peck on the cheek she rose from her perch on the couch and smiled at him hi hi he had the flowers behind his back hardly realizing the move was defensive she looked incredible the thinstrapped flowing dress the color of ripe peaches skimming down candle and firelight flickering over her when she moved he swallowed the dress sliced open from the ankle to the trio of gold buttons running down her left hip long day she asked and kissed him lightly on the mouth yeah i guess his tongue had tied itself into knots you not too bad the good news has everybody pumped up i have some wine chilling she tilted her head smiling at him unless youd rather have a beer whatever he murmured as she strolled toward the table by the window which she had set for two it looks nice in here you look nice well i thought since we were celebrating she poured two glasses i had planned on doing this after the grand opening on saturday but it seems appropriate now with the glasses on the table behind her she held out a hand i have a lot to thank you for no you dont i did what i was paid to do he trailed off seeing that her gaze had shifted softened with some discomfort he realized it was riveted on the flowers hed used to gesture her thanks away you brought me flowers the simple shock in her voice didnt help his nerves this guy on the corner was selling them and i just daffodils she said with a sigh i love daffodils yeah miserably awkward he thrust them at her well here you go natalie buried her face in the bright trumpets and for reasons she couldnt fathom wanted to weep theyre so pretty so happy she lifted her head again eyes glowing so perfect thank you its no big but the rest of his words were cut off when her mouth closed over his instant desire like a switch flicked on inside him one touch he thought as his arms came hard around her and he wanted her her body molded to his her arms circled he fought back a desperate need to drag her to the floor and release the helpless passion she stirred up inside him youre tense she murmured stroking a hand over his shoulders did something happen with clarence during the interview that you didnt tell me no clarence jacoby and his moonpie face were the last things on rys mind im just wired i guess and in need of some basic control something smells good he said as he eased back besides you franks fricassee franks taking another step back ry reached for his wine guthries cook made us dinner no its his recipe she tucked her hair behind her ear i made us dinner ry snorted into his wine yeah right whered you get it the italian place torn between amusement and insult natalie took her wine i made it piasecki i know how to turn on a stove you know how to pick up the phone and order more relaxed now ry took her hand and pulled her toward the kitchen he walked directly to the skillet and lifted the lid it certainly looked homemade frowning he sniffed at the thick bubbling sauce covering the golden pieces of chicken you cooked this yourself exasperated natalie tugged her hand away and sipped her wine i dont see why that should be such a shock its just a matter of following directions you cooked this he said again shaking his head how come well because i dont know with a little snap of metal on metal she covered the skillet again i felt like it i just cant picture you puttering around the kitchen there wasnt a lot of puttering then she laughed and it wasnt a very pretty sight so no matter what it tastes like youre required to praise lavishly i need to put the flowers in water he waited while she got a vase and arranged the daffodils on the kitchen counter she looked softer tonight he thought all feminine and cozy and she handled each individual bloom as though hed brought her rubies unable to resist he lifted his hand to stroke it gently down her hair she looked up with surprise her uncertainty at the show of tenderness evident is something wrong no cursing himself he dropped his hand to his side i like to touch you her eyes cleared danced i know she turned into his arms inviting the chicken needs to simmer for a while she nipped lightly teasingly at his lip an hour anyway why dont we sit down he finished to keep from exploding he was not he absolutely was not going to drag her down and take her on the kitchen floor okay left uneasy by his withdrawal she nodded and picked up her wine again we should enjoy the fire in the living room she curled up next to him and rested her head on his shoulder obviously he had something on his mind she could wait for him to share it with her it was lovely just sitting here she thought with a sigh watching the fire together as dinner cooked and an old cole porter tune drifted through the speakers it was as if they sat like this every night comfortable with each other knowing there was time all the time in the world simply to be after a long busy day what better end could there be than to sit beside someone you loved and oh god her thoughts had her jerking straight upright loved she loved him whats wrong nothing she swallowed hard fought to keep her voice even just something i forgot i can deal with it later no shoptalk okay no she took a hasty sip of wine fine she couldnt get a decent nights sleep when he wasnt beside her shed had an irresistible urge to cook him a meal her heart turned over every time he smiled at her shed even been rerouting a business trip with him in mind oh why hadnt she seen it before it had been staring her in the face every time she looked in the mirror what was she going to do closing her eyes she ordered her body to relax her emotions were her problem she reminded herself she was a grown woman who had gone into an affair with the rules plain on both sides she couldnt wouldnt change the terms in midstream what was needed was some clear and careful thought some time she added concentrating on breathing evenly then a plan she was an excellent planner after all his fingertips brushed lightly over her shoulder her pulse scrambled id better check on dinner it hasnt been an hour he liked the way she was curled against him and wanted to keep her there stupid to be worried about where they were heading he decided letting himself get drunk on the smell of her hair where they were now was exactly the right place to be i was going to make a salad she said uncertainly later he slid his fingers under her chin and turned her face toward his odd he thought it seemed as though his nerves had drained out of him and into her experimentally he dipped his head letting his lips cruise over hers she trembled against him intrigued he drew her lower lip into his mouth bathing it with his tongue while his eyes watched emotions come and go in hers she shuddered why are we always in a hurry he murmured addressing the question as much to himself as to her i dont know she had to get away clear her head before she made some foolish mistake we need more wine i dont think so slowly he brushed the hair back from her face so that he could frame it with his hands he held her there his eyes on hers do you know what i think natalie no she moistened her lips struggling to find her balance i think weve missed a step here i dont know what you mean he pressed his lips to her brow drew back and watched her eyes cloud seduction he whispered chapter contents prev next seduction she didnt need to be seduced she wanted him always wanted him before she realized she loved him she had equated her response to him as a kind of volatile chemical reaction but now couldnt he see her thoughts trailed off into smoke as his lips roamed lazily down her temple ry she put her hand to his chest told herself she would keep her voice light joking disentangle herself long enough to clear her mind and regain her balance but his fingers were stroking along her collarbone and his mouth was nipping closer closer to hers she only said ry again were good at moving straight ahead you and me arent we natalie but now there was something smooth and easy gliding through him fascinated by his own reaction he traced his tongue over her lips fast with no detours thats us i think its time we took a little side trip i think but she couldnt think not after his mouth fit itself to hers hed never kissed her like this before never like this so slow so deep with a lazy kind of possession that shot simmering heat straight to the marrow of her bones her body went lax as fluid as the wax pooling the wicks of the candles around them beneath her palm his heart beat hard and not quite steady and the low helpless sound that vibrated in her throat quickened it yet he continued that slow deep exploration of her mouth as if he would be content with that only that for hours her head fell back he cupped it shifting her slightly to change the angle of the kiss toying with her lips her tongue her breath caught and released caught and released shuddering once when his fingers brushed up over her breast now she knew now would come the speed and the power she understood there would be control again in the sheer lack of control as they rushed to take each other but his fingers simply skimmed up her throat and lay with devastating tenderness on her cheek in defense she reached for him pulling him tight against her not this time he drew back just enough to study her face confusion need and arousal made a beautiful combination however much his own blood was pounding he intended to confuse her more intended to see to each and every need and arouse her until her body was limp i want you she tore hurriedly at the buttons of his shirt now ry i want you now he pulled her down on the floor in front of the fire the light from the flames flickered over her skin danced in her hair she was golden like some exotic treasure a man might spend his life in search of and for now for tonight ry thought she was only his he stretched her arms out to the sides linked his fingers with hers youll have to wait he told her until im finished seducing you i dont need to be seduced she arched up to him offering her mouth her body herself lets see he covered her mouth with his softly dipping in when her lips trembled open under his hands hers flexed and gripped hard how often had he loved her it hadnt been long since theyd met but he couldnt count the number of times hed let his body take control go wild with hers this time hed make love to her with his mind i love your shoulders he murmured taking his mouth from hers for a slow exploration of the curve soft strong smooth with his teeth he caught the thin strap of her dress tugged it down until there was nothing between him and flesh warmth her taste her scent were all warmth absorbing them he trailed his tongue over her shoulder along the elegant line of throat down again until the other strap gave way and this spot here he rubbed his lips just above the silk that curved over her breast teasingly devastatingly he dampened the skin under the silk with his tongue until her body moved restlessly beneath his you should relax and enjoy natalie im going to be a while i cant the gentle brush of lips the solid weight of him were tormenting her kiss me again my pleasure there was a flicker of heat this time bright and hot before he banked the fires again she moaned straining against him wanting release craving the torture he made the choice for her kissing her with a focused intensity until her fingers went limp and her rushed breathing slowed and thickened smoke she could all but smell it she was rising up on clouds of it weightless helpless unable to do more than float and sigh when his mouth left hers to trail down again a gentle nip at the jaw and then light slow kisses down her throat her shoulders his body shifted downward his hands still covering hers inch by inch he tasted her nudging the silk down she felt his hair brush her breast then his mouth traveling around the curve nuzzling at the sensitive underside his tongue slid over her nipple shooting an ache down to her center then he caught the peak between his teeth making her moan his name and her body began to throb to a low primitive beat he wanted her to absorb him and all the pleasure he could give her her eyes were closed her lips just parted and much too tempting he needed to taste them again and when he did he let himself sink into the texture the flavor time spun out there was power here in tenderness hed never felt it before not in himself and certainly not for anyone else but for her he had a bottomless well of tenderness of soft sumptuous kisses of endless sighs he took his hands from hers to shrug out of his shirt to feel the thrill of his flesh against her flesh sliding smooth building heat with a murmur of approval he slipped his hand through the slit of her skirt lightly caressing teasing the edge of some frilly something she wore beneath he flicked open a button then two then the third fascinated by the way the material slid and parted under his hands nuzzling along her bared hip he fought back a sudden vicious urge to take when her hands brushed then pressed at his shoulders more he promised himself there was more for his own pleasure he slipped the silk aside and found more beneath she wore a fancy of silk and lace the same color as the dress that pooled beside them strapless it hugged her breasts rode high up her hips letting out a long breath he sat back on his heels and toyed with one lacy garter natalie weak she was so gloriously weak she could barely open her eyes when she did she saw only him the firelight teasing the red out of his dark hair his eyes nearly black she reached out her arm heavy nearly boneless he merely took her hand and kissed it i wanted to tell you how happy i am youre in the lingerie business her lips curved she nearly managed a laugh before with one quick flick he detached the first garter she could only utter a helpless moan and how beautiful you look flick went the second garter modeling your own products with his eyes on hers he rolled the stocking down thigh and knee and calf her vision hazed she could feel him oh god she could feel him every brush of fingertip and mouth surrender had come gliding through her like a shadow and had left her completely vulnerable whatever he wanted anything he wanted she would give as long as he never stopped touching her there was the low steady heat from the fire it was nothing nothing compared to the slow bum he had kindled inside her as if down a long velvetlined tunnel she could hear the music still a quiet backdrop to her own trembling breathing the scent of flowers and candle wax the taste of him and the wine that lingered on her tongue all melded together into one stunning intoxication then he slipped a finger under the laceedged hem sliding it slowly toward and then into the heat she erupted her body quaked and reared his name burst from her lips even as the staggering pleasure careened through her system she was wrapped around him as the power of the climax built in force then echoed away and left her drained she wanted to tell him she was empty had to be empty but he was peeling away the silk and lace exposing her with those clever fingers swallowing whatever words she might have spoken with that relentlessly patient mouth i want to fill you natalie his hands werent as steady as they had been but he laid her gently back on the carpet so that he could tug off his clothes all of you with all of me while the blood pounded in his ears he began a slow journey up her legs stroking the fires again waiting watching for that moment before she would flash again he felt her body tense saw the power of what was to come flicker over her face even as she cried out he was inside her it was almost painful to hold himself back and it was very sweet seeing her heavy eyes open seeing the glaze of pleasure cloud them as he fought to keep from racing for the finish swamped by a swirl of sensations all but suffocating in the layers of them she groped for his hands when their fingers locked again her heart was ready to burst her eyes stayed open and looked on his as each thrust rocked them pushed them closer then she was cartwheeling off the edge reeling tumbling free his mouth came to hers his lips forming her name as he leapt with her twice on the elevator ride to her office the next morning natalie caught herself singing both times she cleared her throat shifted her briefcase from hand to hand and pretended not to notice the speculative looks of her fellow passengers so what she thought as the elevator climbed she felt like singing she felt like dancing so what she was in love and what was wrong with that she asked herself as the elevator stopped to let off passengers on the thirtyfirst floor everyone was entitled to be in love to feel as though their feet would never touch the ground again to know the air had never smelled sweeter the sun had never shone brighter it was wonderful to be in love so wonderful she wondered why shed never tried it before because thered never been ry before she thought and grinned how foolish shed been to panic when she realized what she felt for ry how cowardly and ridiculous to be afraid even for a moment of loving if it made a woman vulnerable comical if it dazed and baffled her what was wrong with that love should make you feel giddy and strong and softheaded shed just never realized it before humming to herself she stepped out of the elevator on her floor and all but waltzed toward her office good morning ms fletcher maureen glanced surreptitiously at her clock it wasnt up to her to point out that the boss was late even three minutes late was a precedent for natalie fletcher good morning maureen she all but sang it and thrust out a clutch of daffodils oh thank you theyre lovely everyone should have daffodils this morning absolutely everyone natalie shook back her hair scattering raindrops its a gorgeous day isnt it drizzling and chilly was what it was but maureen found

due at the flagship at right after your with mr hawthorne no problem you have a lunch with ill be there natalie called out and swung into her office for the first time in recent memory natalie bypassed the coffeepot she didnt need caffeine to pump through her blood it was already swimming she hung up her coat set her briefcase aside then moved to the office safe behind her favorite abstract print taking out a pair of disks she went to her desk to draft a brief memo to deirdre an hour later she was elbowdeep in work making hasty notes as she juggled information and requests from three of her branches on the conference call ill fax authorization for that within the hour she promised atlanta donald see if you can squeeze out the time to go to the flagship with me we can have our meeting on the way ive got an with marketing he told her let me see if i can push it to after lunch id appreciate it id like tear sheets of all the ads and newspaper articles in chicago you can fax copies but id like you to overnight the originals ill be checking in with la and dallas this afternoon and well have a full report for all branches by end of day tomorrow she sat back let out a long breath gentlemen synchronize your watches and alert the troops ten am saturday coast to coast after she closed the conference natalie pressed her buzzer maureen let deirdre know im free for about twenty minutes oh and buzz melvin for me hes in the field ms fletcher oh right annoyed with her lapse natalie glanced at her watch calculated time ill see if i can catch him at the plant later this afternoon leave a memo on his voice mail that i should be by around three yes maam after you buzz deirdre get me the head of shipping at the new warehouse right away by the time deirdre knocked on the door and stepped in natalie was tapping at the keys on her desk computer yes i see that phone tucked at her ear she gestured deirdre to a seat put a trace on that shipment i want it in atlanta no later than am tomorrow she nodded tapped let me know as soon as its located thanks she hung up brushed a stray hair from her cheek theres always a glitch near zero hour deirdres brow wrinkled bad no just a slight delay on a shipment even without it atlantas well stocked for the opening but i dont want them to run low coffee no ive already burned a hole in my stomach lining thanks or you have she aimed a steely look at her boss bonuses bonuses natalie agreed i have the percentages i want you to work with right here salary ratios and so forth she smiled a little i figured you wouldnt be wondering about how best to murder me if i did the preliminaries wrong now natalie laughed deirdre do you know why i value you so highly nope you have a mind like a calculator the bonuses were earned and i also consider them a good investment incentive to keep up the pace during the weeks ahead theres usually a dip after the initial sales in a new business both in profit and in labor i think this will keep that dip from becoming a dive thats all very well in theory deirdre began lets make it reality and since its basically a standard ratio across the board id like you to hand the problem over to your assistant that way you can concentrate on running the audit still smiling she handed over the disks and her memo a great deal of what youll need to run will be parallel with tax preparation take whatever time and however many bodies in accounting you feel youll need with a grimace deirdre accepted the disk you know why i value you so highly natalie nope because theres no budging you and you give impossible orders with such reasonableness its a gift natalie agreed you might want these hard copies deirdre rose hefting the file thanks a lot anytime she glanced up with a smile as donald poked his head in the door im clear until he told her great well head out now take your time natalie repeated to deirdre as she crossed to the closet for her coat as long as i have the first figures on this quarters profit and loss and the totals from each department by the end of next week deirdre rolled her eyes at donald reasonably impossible she set the disks on top of the file youre next she warned him dont let her scare you donald shes just gearing up to pit black ink against red natalie sailed through the door just make sure the black wins quite a mood shes in donald murmured to deirdre shes flying all right deirdre stared down at the files lets hope we can keep it that way perfect isnt it content after their visit to the store natalie stretched out her legs in the back of the car while her driver threaded through the lunchhour traffic youd never know there was a fire a hell of a job donald agreed and the window treatments spectacular the salesclerks are going to be run ragged come saturday im counting on it she touched a hand to his arm a lot of its your doing donald we never would have gotten off the ground like this without you especially after the warehouse damage control he brushed off her thanks with a shrug in six months well barely remember we had damage to control and the profits will bring a smile even to deirdres face he was counting on it that would be a real coup just drop me off at the next corner he told the driver the restaurants only a couple of doors down i appreciate you making time to go with me no problem seeing the flagship back in shape made my day it wasnt pleasant visualizing the office torn up like that that wonderful antique desk ruined the replacements stunning by the way i had it shipped out from colorado natalie said absently as something niggled at her brain i had it in storage well its perfect he patted her hand as the car swung to the curb she waved him off then settled back dissatisfied when the car merged back into traffic then with a shrug she gauged the traffic the distance to her lunch meeting and decided she had time for one quick phone call ry answered himself on the third ring arson piasecki hi the pleasure of hearing his voice wiped out everything else your secretarys out lunch and youre having yours at your desk he glanced down at the sandwich he had yet to touch yeah more or less he shifted making his chair squeak where are you looks like twelfth and hyatt heading east toward the menagerie ah the menagerie he thought highclass no tuna on wheat for lunch there he could see her ordering designer water and a salad with every leaf called a different name look legs about tonight i was thinking about that maybe you could meet me at the goose neck she rolled her shoulders i have a feeling im going to want to unwind he rubbed a hand over his chin i ah come by my place instead okay your place this was new shed stopped wondering why hed never taken her there yeah about seven seventhirty all right do you want me to pick up something for dinner no ill take care of it see you he hung up and sat back in his chair he was going to have to take care of a lot of things he picked up chinese it was nearly seven when ry carried the little white cartons up the two flights to his apartment he took a good look around while he did it wasnt a dump unless of course you compared it with natalies glossy building there was no graffiti on the walls but the walls were thin as he climbed the steps ry could hear the muted sounds of televisions playing children squabbling the steps themselves were worn down in the centers from the passage of countless feet as he turned onto the second floor he heard a door slam beneath him all right all right ill go get the damn beer myself lip curled ry unlocked his door yeah he thought it was a real class joint there was a definite scent of garlic in the hall courtesy of his neighbor he assumed the woman was always cooking up pots of pasta he let himself in flicked on the lights and studied the room it was clean a little dusty maybe he barely spent enough time in it to mess it up it had been nearly three weeks since hed spent a night there the sofa that folded out into a bed needed recovering it wasnt something hed noticed before or would have bothered with but now the faded blue upholstery annoyed him he walked past it taking about half a dozen steps into the alcove that served as his kitchen he got out a beer and popped the top the walls needed painting too he decided chugging the beer as he looked around and the bare floors could have used a carpet but it served him well enough didnt it he thought grimly he didnt need fancy digs just a couple of rooms a short hop from the office hed been content here for nearly a decade that was enough for anyone but it wasnt enough couldnt be enough for natalie she didnt belong here he knew it and hed asked her to come to prove it to both of them the night before had been a revelation to him that she could make him feel the way shed made him feel that she could make him forget as hed forgotten that there was anything or anyone on the planet except the two of them it wasnt fair to either of them to go on this way the longer he let it drift the more he needed her and the more he needed the more difficult it would be to let her walk away his divorce hadnt hurt him oh a couple of twinges he thought now plenty of regrets but no real pain not the deeprooted searing kind of pain he was already feeling at the thought of living without natalie he could keep her there was a good chance he could keep her the physical thing between them was outrageously intense even if it faded by half it would still be stronger than anything hed ever experienced before and he was well aware of his effect on her he could hold her with sex alone it might be enough for her but hed understood when he awakened beside her this morning that it wasnt enough for him no it wasnt enough not when hed started to imagine white picket fences kids in the yard the kind of things that went with marriage permanence a lifetime that hadnt been the deal he reminded himself and he had no right to change the rules to expect her to settle hed already proven he wasnt any good at marriage and that had been with someone from his own neighborhood his own lifestyle no way was he going to fit in with natalie and the fact that he wanted to needed to scared the hell out of him worse than that even worse was the idea that she would turn him down cold if he asked her to try he wanted all of her or nothing so it made sense didnt it to push her out before he got in any deeper and he would do it here right here where the differences between them would slap her between the eyes at the knock of his door he carried his beer over to answer it it was just as hed thought she stood in the hallway slim golden an exotic fish completely out of water she smiled at him leaning up to kiss him hi hi come on in no trouble finding the place no she skimmed her sweep of hair back looking around i took a cab good thinking if you left that fancy car on the street around here thered be nothing left but the door handles when you went back out want a beer no interested she wandered over to the window not much of a view he said knowing she was looking out at the face of the next building not much she agreed its still raining she added and slipped out of her coat she smiled when she spotted another of his basketball trophies mvp she murmured reading the plaque impressive i say i can outscore you nine times out of ten i wasnt fresh he turned into the kitchen i dont have any wine thats okay mmm chinese she opened one of the cartons hed set on the counter and sniffed im starved all i had was a stingy salad for lunch ive been all over the city today nailing down details for saturday where are the plates very much at home she opened a cabinet herself im really going to have to make a sweep of the branches next week i was thinking she broke off when she turned back and found him staring at her what nothing he muttered and took the plates out of her hands she wasnt supposed to stride right in and start chattering he thought and dumped food on a plate she was supposed to see how wrong it was right from the start she was supposed to make it easy on him damn it do you see where you are he whirled on her taking her back a step she blinked ah in the kitchen look around you incensed he took her by the arm and dragged her into the next room look around this is it this is the way i live this is the way i am all right she pushed his hand away because his fingers hurt trying to oblige she took another survey of the room it was spartan masculine in its very simplicity small she noted but not crowded a table across the room held framed snapshots of a family she hoped to get a closer look at it could use some color she decided after a moment im not asking for decorating advice he snapped out there was something under the anger in his tone something final that had her heart stuttering very slowly she turned back to him what are you asking for cursing he spun into the kitchen for his beer if she was going to look at him with that confused wounded look in her eyes he was a dead man so he would have to be cruel and he would have to be quick he sat on the arm of the couch and tipped back his beer lets get real here natalie you and i started this thing because we were hot for each other she could feel the warmth drain out of her cheeks leaving them cold and stiff but she kept her eyes level and her voice steady yes thats right things happened fast the sex the investigation things got tangled up did they his mouth was dry and the beer wasnt helping youre a beautiful woman i wanted you you had a problem it was my job to fix it for you which you did she said carefully for the most part the copsll track down whoever was paying clarence until they do youve got to be careful but things are pretty much under control on that level and on the personal level he frowned down into the bottle i figure its time to step back take a clearer look natalies legs were trembling she locked her knees to stop it are you dumping me ry im saying weve got to look behind the way things are in bed the way you are he lifted his gaze the way im not weve got plenty of heat natalie the problem with that is you get blinded by the smoke time to clear the air thats all i see she wouldnt beg nor would she cry not in front of him not when he was looking at her so coolly his voice so casual as he cut out her heart she wondered if hed been so gentle so loving and sweet the night before because hed already decided to break things off well i suppose youve cleared it despite her resolve her vision blurred the lamplight refracting in the tears that trembled much too close to the surface the minute her eyes filled he was on his feet dont i wont believe me i wont but the first tear spilled over as she turned toward the door i appreciate you not doing this in a public place she clamped a hand over the doorknob her fingers were numb she realized she couldnt even feel them natalie im all right to prove it to both of them she turned to face him her head up im not a child and this isnt the first relationship ive had that hasnt worked it is the first time for something though and youre entitled to know it you jerk she sniffed and wiped a tear away ive never been in love with anyone before but i fell in love with you i hate you for it she yanked open the door and dashed out without her coat chapter contents prev next for ten minutes ry paced the room convincing himself hed done the right thing for both of them sure shed be a little hurt her pride was bruised he hadnt exactly been a diplomat for the next ten he worked on convincing himself that she hadnt meant what shed said that parting shot had been just that a weapon hurled to hurt as shed been hurt she wasnt in love with him she couldnt be because if she was then he was the worlds biggest idiot oh god he was the worlds biggest idiot he snatched up her coat forgot his own and raced downstairs and out into the rain hed left his car at the station and cursed himself for it praying for a cab he loped to the corner then to the next working his way across town his impatience cost him more time than a simple wait would have by the time he hailed an empty cab he was twelve blocks from his home and soaking wet the cab fought its way through rain and traffic creeping along then sprinting creeping then sprinting until ry tossed a fistful of money at the driver and leapt out hed have made better time on foot nearly an hour had passed by the time he arrived at natalies door maureen gave serious thought to calling security its company policy he gave a oneword assessment of company policy and pulled out his id do you see this im in charge of the arson investigation ive got information ms fletcher requires immediately now if you dont let me know where to reach her ill have to go to my superiors he let that hang and hoped torn maureen bit her lip it was true ms fletcher had ordered her specifically not to divulge her itinerary it was also true that during the harried phone call the night before nothing had been mentioned specifically about information from inspector piasecki and if it was something to do with the fires shes staying at the ritzcarlton atlanta before shed finished the sentence ry was out the door it was best he decided if a man was going to whimper to do it in private fifteen minutes later he burst into his office startling his secretary and slammed the door behind him ritzcarlton atlanta get them on the phone yes sir he paced his office muttering to himself until she signaled him natalie fletcher he barked into the phone connect me yes sir one moment please one endless moment while the line whispered then began to ring ry let out a long relieved breath when he heard natalies voice at the other end natalie what the hell are you doing in atlanta i need to then he could only swear as the phone clicked loudly in his ear damn it all to hell and back get that number for me again wideeyed his secretary hurriedly placed the call calm ry ordered himself he knew how to be calm in the face of fire and death and misery surely he could be calm now but when the phone continued to ring and he pictured her coolly looking out the window of her hotel room and ignoring it he nearly ripped the receiver out of the wall he didnt bother to knock but used the key she hadnt thought to demand back from him there was no welcome this time no cozy sense of coming home he knew the minute he stepped inside that she wasnt there denying it he called out for her and began a dripping search through the apartment so hed wait he told himself shed come home sooner or later and hed be there make things right again somehow hed grovel if he had to he decided pacing from the living room to the bedroom shed probably gone to her office maybe he should go there he could call he could send a telegram he could do something good god the woman was in love with him and hed used both hands to shove her out the door he dropped to the side of the bed and snatched up the phone it was then that he saw the note hastily scrawled on the nightstand atlanta national national he thought national airlines the airport ry was out of the apartment and harassing the doorman for a cab in three minutes flat he missed her plane by less than five no inspector piasecki i dont know precisely when ms fletcher expects to return cautiously maureen smiled the man looked wild as though hed spent a very rough night in his clothes things were upended enough with the bosss sudden trip without her having to face down a madman at am where is she ry demanded hed very nearly caught the next flight out to atlanta the night before but then it had occurred to him that he didnt have a clue where to find her im sorry inspector im not allowed to give you that information i will be happy to relay any message you might have when ms fletcher calls in i want to know where she is ry said between his teeth call the airport ry ordered while his secretary goggled at him book me on the next available flight to atlanta she was gone when he got there he couldnt believe it more than ten hours after his rushed departure ry was back in urbana alone he hadnt even managed to see her hed spent hours on planes more time chasing her around atlanta from her hotel to the downtown branch of ladys choice back to her hotel to the airport each time hed missed her by inches it was he thought as he trudged up the stairs to his apartment as if shed known he was behind her he dropped down on the couch rubbing his hands over his face he had no choice but to wait im so glad to see you althea grayson nightshade smiled as she rubbed a hand over her mountain of a belly that goes double natalie laughed literally how are you feeling oh like a cross between the goodyear blimp and moby dick neither of them ever looked so good it was true natalie mused pregnancy had only enhanced altheas considerable beauty her eyes were gold her skin was dewy her hair was a fiery cascade to her shoulders im fat but im healthy altheas lips twitched colts been a demon about seeing that i eat right sleep enough exercise rest he even typed up a daily schedule mr playitbyear went into a tailspin when he found out we were expecting the nurserys wonderful natalie wandered the sunny mintandwhite room running her fingers over the antique crib the fussy dottedswiss curtains ill be glad when its filled any time now althea said with a sigh i feel great really but i swear this has been the longest pregnancy in recorded history i want to see my baby damn it she stopped and laughed at herself listen to me i never thought id want children much less be itching to change the first diaper intrigued natalie looked over her shoulder althea sat in a rocking chair a small poorly knit blanket in her hands no you never wanted to be a mom not with the job and my background she shrugged didnt figure i was cut out for it then along comes nightshade and then this she patted her belly maybe gestating isnt my natural milieu but ive loved every minute of it now im antsy to get on to the nurturing can you see me she said with a laugh sitting here rocking a baby yes i can natalie came back crouched and took altheas hands i envy you thea so much to have someone who loves you to make a baby between you nothing else is as important defenses crumbled her eyes filled oh honey what is it what else disgusted with herself natalie straightened a man a jerk she fought back the tears and stuffed her hands in her pockets would this jerk be an arson investigator althea smiled a little when natalie scowled at her news travels even to denver the fact is your family and colt and i have been biting our tongues trying not to ask what youre doing out here i explained im siting i want to open another branch here i was traveling anyway instead of being in urbana for your opening she resented that laid the blame for it right at rys doorstep i was in dallas for the opening there each of my branches is of equal importance to me yeah and word is it was a smash the tallies for the first weeks sales look promising so why arent you back home basking in it althea inclined her head the jerk im entitled to a little time before i well yes she admitted the jerk he dumped me oh come on cilia said the guy was crazy about you we were good in bed natalie said flatly then pressed her lips together i made the mistake of falling in love with him a real first for me and he broke my heart im sorry concerned althea pushed herself out of the chair ill get over it natalie squeezed altheas offered hands its just that ive never felt this way about anyone i didnt know i could ive managed to get through my whole life without being hurt like this then pow its like being cut into very small pieces she murmured i just havent been able to put them all back together yet well hes not worth it althea said loyally i wish that were true itd be easier hes a wonderful man tough sweet dedicated she moved her shoulders restlessly he didnt mean to hurt me hes called several times while ive been on the road he must want to apologize to make things up with you do you think id give him the chance natalies chin angled im not taking his calls im not taking anything from him he can send me flowers all over the country for all the difference it would make he sends you flowers a smile was beginning to lurk around the corners of altheas mouth daffodils every time i turn around im getting a bunch of idiotic daffodils she set her teeth does he think im going to fall for that again probably well im not one broken hearts enough for me more than enough maybe you should go back let him beg then kick him in the teeth althea winced at the twinge the third one she noted with a glance at her watch in the past half hour im thinking about it but until im ready im not natalie broke off what is it are you all right yeah althea let out a long breath this twinge was lasting longer you know i think i could be going into labor what the blood drained out of natalies face now sit sit down for gods sake ill get colt maybe i will gingerly althea lowered herself back into the chair maybe youd better deirdre was glad shed decided to take the work home with her the miserable cold shed picked up from somewhere was hanging on like a leech at least she could take her mind off her stuffy head and scratchy throat with work she sniffed disinterestedly at the cup of instant chicken soup shed zapped in the microwave and indulged herself with the hot toddy instead nothing like a good shot of whiskey to make a cup of tea sit up and sing if she was lucky very lucky shed have the cold on the run and the preliminary figures in before natalie got back from denver she took another hefty slug of the spiked tea and tapped keys she stopped frowned and adjusted her glasses that couldnt be right she thought and tapped more keys no way in hell could that be right her mouth became drier and a thin line of sweat rolled down her back that had nothing to do with the slight fever she was fighting she sat back and took a couple of easy breaths it was simply a mistake she assured herself shed find the discrepancy and fix it that was all but it didnt take much longer for her to realize it wasnt a mistake or an accident it was a quarter of a million dollars and it was gone she snatched up the phone and rapidly dialed maureen deirdre marks ms marks you sound dreadful i know listen i need to talk to natalie right away who doesnt its urgent maureen shes with her brother right let me have the number i cant do that ms marks its urgent i tell you i understand but shes not there her plane left denver an hour ago shes on her way home a son althea and colt had a son a tiny and beautiful boy it had taken althea twelve hard hours to push him into the world and hed come out howling natalie remembered it now as her plane traveled east it had been a thrill to be allowed in the birthing room to support colt when he was ready to climb the walls to watch him and althea work together to welcome that new life she hadnt wept until it was over until shed left colt and althea nuzzling their new son boyd had left the hospital with her hed either been too deep in the memories of his own childrens births or had sensed her mood either way he hadnt badgered her now she was going home because there was work to do and because it was cowardly to keep jumping from city to city because she was hurt it had been a good trip professionally successful personally soothing she was going to give some thought to moving back to colorado shed found an excellent site and a new branch in denver would benefit from her personal touch if the move would have the added benefit of escape whose business was it but hers she would have to wait of course until they had unearthed whoever had paid clarence jacoby if it was indeed one of her people in urbana that person had to be weeded out once that was done donald could take over that office it would be a simple matter donald had the talent from a business standpoint the change would be little more than having him move from his office to hers his desk to hers desk she thought frowning there was something odd about the desk not her desk she realized all at once the desk that had been damaged at the flagship hed known about that her heart began to thud uncomfortably how had donald known the desk in the managers office was an antique how had he known specifically that it had been damaged cautiously she began to think over the details recalling her movements from the time of the second fire to the day she and donald had visited the flagship he hadnt been in the office there since it had been decorated at least not to her knowledge so how could he have known the desks had been switched because hed been there that was all she tried to assure herself hed swung by at some point and hadnt mentioned it it made sense more sense than believing he had had something to do with the fires yet hed been at the warehouse the morning after it had burned early she remembered had she called him she couldnt be sure didnt recall he could have heard about it on the news had there been reports that early detailed reports she wasnt sure about that either and it worried her why should he do something so drastic to harm a business he was an integral part of she wondered what possible motive could there be for him to want to see stock and equipment destroyed stock equipment and she thought on a jolt of alarm records thered been records at the warehouse and at the flagship at the point of the fires origin determined to keep calm she thought of the files shed given deirdre of the copies still in the safe at her office shed check them herself the minute she landed just to ease her mind she was wrong about donald of course she had to be wrong she was late it was a hell of a thing ry thought as he paced the gate area at the airport for a woman who was so fixated on being on time now when he was all but jumping out of his skin she had to be late it didnt matter that the plane was late and she just happened to be on it he took it as a personal affront if maureen hadnt taken pity on him he wouldnt have known she was coming back tonight it grated a bit to know that natalies secretary felt sorry for him that she must have seen that he looked like a lovesick mongrel even the men at the station were starting to talk about him behind his back oh he knew it all right the mutters the snickers the pitying looks anybody with eyes in his head could see that the past ten days had been torment for him hed made a mistake damn it one little mistake and shed paid him back bigtime they were just going to have to put that behind them he clutched the daffodils paced and felt like a fool his heart took one frantic leap when her flight was announced he saw her and his palms began to sweat she saw him turned sharply left and kept walking natalie he caught up with her in two strides welcome home go to hell ive been there for the past ten days i dont like it it wasnt hard to keep up with her since she was wearing heels here she glanced down at the daffodils cutting a scathing look up to his face you dont want me to tell you what you can do with those stupid flowers do you you could have talked to me when i called i didnt want to talk to you deliberately she swung into the closest ladies room ry gritted his teeth and waited she told herself she wasnt pleased that he was still there when she came out saying nothing she quickened her pace toward the baggageclaim area how was your trip she snarled at him look im trying to apologize here is that what youre doing with a toss of her head she stepped onto the escalator heading down save it i screwed up im sorry ive been trying to tell you for days but you wont take my calls that should indicate something piasecki even to someone of your limited intelligence so he continued biting back hot words im here to pick you up so we can talk ive ordered a car we canceled it that is he had to choose his words carefully with that icy look in her eyes freezing him i canceled it when i found out you were coming in no need to make maureen fry with him he decided so ill give you a lift ill take a cab dont be so damn stubborn ill get tough if i have to he muttered as they joined the throng at baggage claim i can have you up in a firemans carry in two seconds embarrass the hell out of you either way im driving you home she debated he would embarrass her there was no point in giving him the satisfaction nor was she going to tell him of her suspicions not until she had something solid not until she had no choice but to deal with him on a professional level im not going home i need to go to the office the office is closed its almost nine oclock im going to the office she said flatly and turned away from him fine well talk at the office that one she pointed to a gray tweed pullman and that one a matching garment bag and that another pullman you didnt have time to pack all this before i got to your apartment that night interested despite herself she watched him heft cases i picked up luggage and clothes along the way enough for a damn modeling troupe he muttered i beg your pardon her tone lowered the temperature in the terminal by ten degrees nothing your opening made a real splash he continued as they walked out of the terminal it met our expectations youre getting writeups in newsday and business week he shrugged when she looked at him i heard and womens wear daily she added but whos counting ive been its great natalie really im happy for you proud of you he set her luggage beside his car and his limbs went weak god ive missed you she stepped back evading him when he reached for her he was not going to hurt her again she promised herself she would not allow it okay slowly stunned by the ache that one quick rejection caused he lifted his hands palms out i had that coming ive got plenty coming ill give you the chance to take all the shots you want im not interested in fighting with you she said wearily ive had a long trip im too tired to fight with you let me take you home natalie im going to the office she stepped back and waited for him to unlock the car once inside she sat back and shut her eyes she just sighed when ry laid the bright yellow flowers in her lap they ah havent gotten any more out of clarence he said hoping to chip at the wall shed erected between them i know she couldnt think about her suspicions yet ive kept in touch you moved around fast i had a lot of ground to cover yeah he dug out money for the parking attendant i got the picture after i chased you around atlanta she opened her eyes then excuse me i couldnt get a damn cab he muttered you must have hooked one the minute you walked out of my apartment yes i did figures im running the marathon to your apartment then youre gone when i get there i see the note figure the airport and get there in time to see your plane take off she felt herself softening and stiffened is that supposed to be my fault piasecki no its not your fault damn it its my fault but if you could have sat still in atlanta for five minutes wed have settled this we have settled it not by a long shot turning his head he aimed a deadly look at her i hate it when people hang up on me it was she said with relish my pleasure i might have strangled you for it when i got down there if i could have caught you no ms fletchers at her shop then i get to the shop and its sorry ms fletchers gone back to her hotel i get back to the hotel and youve checked out i get to the airport and youre in the sky i spent hours chasing my tail trying to catch up with you she shrugged she didnt want to be pleased but she couldnt prevent a little frisson of pleasure at the frustration in his voice dont expect an apology still she gathered up the flowers to keep them from sliding from her lap when he braked im trying to give you one theres no need ive had time to think about it and ive decided you were absolutely right i dont like the style you used but the bottom line rings true we had some interesting chemistry thats all we had a lot more than that weve got more than that natalie this is my stop forgetting her luggage she bolted out of the car by the time ry had parked illegally she was waiting for the security guard to open the front door of her building damn it natalie would you hold still i have work good evening ben ms fletcher working late thats right she breezed past the guard with ry at her heels theres no need for you to come up with me ry you said you loved me ignoring the guards speculative look natalie pressed the elevator button i got over it panic spurted through him freezing him in place he barely made it into the elevator before the doors shut in his face you did not i know what i did i know what i didnt she jabbed the button for her floor its all ego with you youre causing a scene because i didnt come back when you called she tossed her hair back her eyes were bright not with tears he saw with some relief but with anger because i dont need you it has nothing to do with ego i was he couldnt admit hed been scared downtothebone scared i was wrong he said that was hard enough but at least it wasnt humiliating it was you there in my place i asked you to come because it was so obvious what was obvious that it couldnt be real i didnt see how it could be real who you are the way you are and me her eyes sharpened narrowed am i following you here inspector you dumped me because i didnt fit in with your apartment it didnt have to sound that stupid his voice rose in defense with everything with me i cant give you the things the first time i remembered i should give you flowers once in a while you looked at me like id clipped you on the jaw i never take you anywhere i dont think of it youve got friends who live in mansions and look damn it youve got diamonds in your ears right now he tossed up his hands as if that should explain everything diamonds for gods sake her cheeks were hot now she was all but radiating heat as she stepped toward him is this about money is that it you broke my heart over money no its about things how could he explain what made no sense at all anymore natalie let me touch you the hell with you she shoved him back bounding through the elevator the minute the doors open you tossed me aside because you thought i wanted you to get me diamonds or a mansion or flowers furious she tossed the daffodils on the floor i can get my own diamonds or anything else i want what i wanted was you dont walk away dont swearing he rushed after her somewhere down the long corridor a phone rang natalie he grabbed her by the shoulders spun her around i didnt think that exactly she rammed her briefcase hard into his gut and you had the nerve to call me a snob out of patience he rammed her back against the wall it was wrong it was stupid i was stupid what more do you want me to say i wasnt thinking i was just feeling you hurt me i know he rested his brow on hers tried to get his bearings he could smell her feel her and the thought of losing her made him weak in the knees im sorry i didnt know i could hurt you i thought it was just me i thought youd walk so you walked first he drew back a little something like that coward she jerked away go away ry leave me alone i have to think about this youre still in love with me im not going anywhere until you tell me then youll have to wait because im not ready to tell you anything phones were ringing wearily rubbing her temple natalie wondered who would be calling so long after hours im raw dont you understand i realized i loved you and had you break it off almost simultaneously im not going to serve you my emotions on a platter then ill give you mine he said quietly i love you natalie her heart swam into her eyes damn you damn you thats not fair i cant be worried about fair he stepped closer and reached out to touch her hair his hand froze when he saw the flicker of light at the end of the hall it danced through the glass in a pattern he recognized too well take the fire stairs down now call dispatch what what are you talking about go he repeated and dashed down the hall he could smell smoke now and cursed it cursed himself for being so intent on his own needs that hed missed it he saw it the crafty plume under the door that flowed out sucked in oh god ry she was right behind him he had time to see the flames writhing behind the glass time to judge then he turned leapt and knocked natalie to the ground as the window exploded lethal shards of glass rained over them chapter contents prev she felt pain sharp and shocking as her head thudded against the floor and pinpricks of heat from the glass and flame for a terrifying moment she thought ry was unconscious or dead his body was fully spread over hers a shield protecting her from the worst of the blast before she could even sob in the breath to scream his name he was up and dragging her to her feet are you burned she shook her head aware only of the throbbing and the smoke that was beginning to sting her eyes her throat she could barely see his face through it but she saw the blood your face your arm youre bleeding but he wasnt listening he had her hand vised in his and was dragging her away from the flame even as they dashed down the hall another window exploded fire roared out it surrounded them golden and greedy unbelievably hot she screamed once as she saw it race along the floor eating its way toward them spitting like a hundred hungry snakes panic gripped her icy fingers clutching at her stomach squeezing her throat in taunting contrast to the heat pulsing around them they were trapped fire writhing on either side of them terrified she fought him when he pushed her to the floor stay low however grim his thoughts his voice was calm he gripped her hair in one hand to keep her face turned to his he needed her to hold on to control i cant breathe the smoke was choking her making her gasp for air and expel what little she had in gritty coughs theres more air down here we dont have much time he was aware too well aware of how quickly the fire would reach them how well it blocked their exit to the stairs he had nothing with which to fight it if the fire didnt kill them the smoke would long before rescue could reach them get out of your coat what her movements were already sluggish he fought back panic and yanked her coat from her shoulders were going through it we cant she couldnt even scream at the next explosion of glass could only huddle racked by coughing her mind was dull stunned by smoke she wanted only to lie down and draw in the precious air that still hovered just above the floor well burn i dont want to die that way youre not going to die tossing the coat over her head he dragged her to her feet when she staggered he lifted her over his shoulder he stood fire lapping on both sides a flaming sea around him in seconds the tidal wave would reach them and theyd drown in it he gauged the distance and sprinted into the wave for an instant they were in hell fire heat the roaring of its anger the quick ravenous licking of its tongues for no more than two heartbeats an eternity flames engulfed them he felt the hair on his hands singe knew from the intense heat on his back and arms that his jacket would catch he knew exactly what fire did to human flesh he wouldnt allow it to have natalie then they were through it and into a wall of smoke blinded lungs straining he groped for the fire door instinctively he checked it for heat thanked god then shoved it open smoke was billowing up the stairwell rising as if in a chimney that meant fire below as well but they didnt have a choice moving fast he ripped the smoldering coat away from her and leaned her against the wall while he stripped off his own jacket the leather was burning sluggishly dazed by the smoke and teetering into shock natalie slid bonelessly to the floor youre not giving up he snapped at her as he hauled her back over his shoulder hang on damn it just hang on he streaked down the steps one flight then two then a third she was dead weight now her head lolling her arms limp his eyes were watering from the smoke the tears joining the river of sweat rolling down his face the coughing that seized him felt as if it would shatter his ribs all he knew was that he had to get her to safety he counted each level keeping his mind focused the smoke began to thin and he began to hope she never stirred not even when he tested the door at the lobby level found it cool and staggered through he heard the shouts the sirens his vision grayed as two fire fighters rushed toward him god almighty inspector she needs oxygen still holding her ry shoved the offer of assistance aside and carried her outside into clean air lights were swirling all the familiar sounds and scents and sights of a fire scene like a drunk he weaved toward the closest engine oxygen he ordered now another coughing fit battered him as he laid her down her face was black with soot and her eyes were closed he couldnt see if she was breathing couldnt hear someone was shouting raging but he had no idea it was him hands pushed his own fumbling ones aside and fit an oxygen mask over natalies face you need attention inspector keep away from me he bent over her searching for a pulse blood dripped down his arm and onto her throat natalie please is she all right with tears streaming down her face deirdre dropped down beside him is she going to be all right shes breathing was all ry could say shes breathing he repeated stroking her hair mercifully most of the next hour was a blur he remembered climbing into the ambulance with her holding her hand someone pressed oxygen on him bound up his arm they took her away the minute they hit the er his panicked raging came out in hacking coughs then the world turned upside down he found himself flat on his back on an examining table when he tried to push himself upright he was restrained just lie still a small grayhaired woman was scowling at him i like my stitches neat and tidy you lost a fair amount of blood inspector piasecki natalie ms fletchers being tended to now let me do my job will you she stopped what she was doing and eyed him again if you keep shoving at me mister im going to sedate you my job was a lot easier when you were out cold how long he managed to croak not long enough she knotted the suture and snipped we picked the glass out of your shoulder not much damage there but this arms nasty fifteen stitches she granted him a smile some of my best work i want to see natalie his voice was raspy but there was no mistaking the threat underneath now well you cant youre going to stay where i put you until im done then if youre a very good boy ill have someone check on ms fletcher for you ry used his good arm and grabbed the doctor by the coat now she only sighed in his condition she was well aware she could knock him back with a shrug but agitation wasnt going to help him stay she ordered and went to the curtain pushing it aside she called for a nurse after a few brisk instructions she turned back to ry your updates on the way im dr milano and ill be saving your life this evening she was breathing he said as if daring milano to disagree yes she moved back to take his hand you took in a lot of smoke inspector im going to treat you and youre going to cooperate after weve cleaned you out ill arrange for you to see ms fletcher the nurse came back to the curtained opening and milano moved off again to hold a murmured consultation with her smoke inhalation she announced and shes in shock a few minor burns and lacerations i imagine well keep her in our fine establishment for a day or two her face softened when she saw rys eyes close in relief come on big guy lets work together here he might be weak as a baby but he wasnt going to let them shove him into a hospital room over milanos disgusted protests he walked out into the waiting area deirdre sprang up from a chair the moment she saw him natalie theyre working on her they told me shes going to be all right thank god with a muffled sob deirdre covered her face now ms marks why dont you tell me what the hell you were doing outside the office tonight taking a deep breath deirdre levered herself into a chair id be glad to i called natalies brother she added i suppose hes already on his way out i told him she was hurt but i tried to play it down ry merely nodded though he hated the weakness he had to sit nausea was threatening again that was probably wise i also gave him the bare bones of what i found out earlier today she took a long breath i havent been in the office the last couple of days ive been nursing a cold but i took work home including files and a couple of computer disks natalie gave me before she went on the road i was running figures and i found some discrepancies some very large discrepancies the kind that equals embezzlement money ry thought it almost always came around to money who i cant say for sure he interrupted her in a tone that made her shiver who im telling you i cant be sure i can only narrow it down considering how and where the money was siphoned off and im not giving you a name so you can go off and beat somebody to a pulp which was exactly what he had in mind she was certain despite the fact that he looked like a survivor of a quick trip to hell there was murder in his eyes i could be wrong i need to talk to natalie she said half to herself as soon as i was sure of what id found i tried to contact her in colorado but shed already left i knew shed go by the office before heading home its the way she works so i decided id meet her there tell her what id found out she tapped the briefcase at her feet show her when i parked outside i glanced up i saw she shut her eyes knew she would relive it over and over again i saw these crazy lights in some of the windows at first i didnt know then i realized what it was i called on the car phone unnerved by the memory she pressed a hand to her mouth i ran inside told the security guard and we heard like an explosion she was crying now quietly i knew she was up there i just knew it but i didnt know what to do yes you did and you did it ry patted her awkwardly on the shoulder inspector milano strode out the usual scowl on her face i got you a pass to see your lady not that youll bother to thank me for it he was on his feet shes okay shes stabilized and sedated but you can look at her since that seems to be your goal in life he glanced back at deirdre are you going to wait yes if youd just let me know how she is ill be back he headed off after the quickstepping doctor natalies room was private and dimly lit she lay very still very pale but her hand when he took it in his was warm are you planning on spending the night here milano asked from the doorway are you going to give me a hard time about it ry returned without looking around who me i aim to serve its not likely shell wake up but thats not going to stop you neither is trying to sleep in that hideously uncomfortable chair im a fireman doc i can sleep anywhere well fireman make yourself at home ill go tell your friend in the waiting room that alls well yeah he never took his eyes from natalies face thatd be good oh youre more than welcome milano said sourly and closed the door behind her ry pulled the chair up to the side of the bed and sat with natalies hand in his he dozed once or twice occasionally a nurse came into the room and scooted him out it was during one of those short restless breaks that he saw boyd rushing down the corridor piasecki captain shes sleeping ry gestured toward the door there without another word boyd moved past him and inside ry walked into the waiting lounge poured a cup of muddy coffee and stared out the window he couldnt think it seemed better that way just to let the night drift if he focused he would see it again the terror on her face the fire around her and he would remember how hed felt carrying her down flight after flight not knowing if she was alive or dead the burning on his hand made him look down he saw hed crushed the paper cup into a ball and spilled the hot coffee over his bandaged hands want another boyd said from behind him no ry tossed the cup away and wiped his hand on his jeans you want to go outside and pound on me awhile with a short laugh boyd poured coffee for himself have you taken a look in a mirror why you look like hell experimentally boyd sipped it was even more pathetic than precinct coffee worse than hell it wouldnt look good for me to start swinging at a guy in your condition i heal quick when boyd said nothing ry shoved his hands in his pockets i told you i wouldnt let her get hurt i damn near killed her you did i lost it i knew it wasnt just clarence i knew there was somebody behind it but i was so wrapped up in her i never thought about him getting another torch or trying something himself the phones damn it i heard the phones ringing intrigued boyd sat back which means a delaying device ry shot back whirling around its a classic matchsticks soaked in accelerant tape them to the phone call the number the phone rings the ringer sparks the match clever but you know you cant think of everything all the time its my job to think of everything and to have a crystal ball his voice was raw from the abuse his throat had taken tight with the emotion he couldnt afford to let loose i was supposed to take care of her yeah acknowledging that boyd sipped again i made a lot of calls on the flight from denver one of the perks of fletcher industries is having a private plane at your disposal i talked to the fire marshal to the doctor who treated natalie to deirdre marks you got her out carried her down every damn step in that building how many stitches have you got in that arm thats hardly the point the point is the fire marshal gave me some idea of what you were facing up there on the fortysecond floor and what kind of shape you were in when you got her outside her doctor told me that if shed been in there another ten minutes it isnt likely shed be sleeping right now so do i want to punch you i dont think so i owe you my sisters life ry remembered how she had looked when he laid her on the ground next to the engine how she looked now pale and still in a hospital bed you dont owe me anything natalies as important to me as she is to you boyd set his coffee aside and rose what did you do to tick her off ry grimaced were working it out well good luck boyd held out a hand after a moment ry clasped it with his thanks i figure youre going to be here awhile ive got a little job to do ry tightened his grip and narrowed his eyes deirdre told you whos responsible thats right i also spoke with my counterpart here in urbana while i was in the air its being taken care of he saw the look in rys eyes understood it this parts up to my team ry you and yours just make damn sure you hang him for the arson who ry said between his teeth donald hawthorne i got it down to four likely suspects two days ago he smiled a little some background checks bank and phone records sometimes it pays to be a cop and you didnt pass the information along to me i intended to when i narrowed it down a bit further now i have and i am boyd knew what it was to love to need to protect and to live with the terror of seeing your woman fight for her life listen he said briskly if you kill him however much it might appeal to both of us right now id have to arrest you id hate to throw my brotherinlaw in a cell ry unfisted his hands long enough to stick them in his pockets im not your brotherinlaw not yet go on in with her get some sleep youd better put hawthorne somewhere where i cant find him i intend to boyd said as he walked away natalie stirred at dawn ry was watching the way the slats of light through the blinds bloomed over her when her lashes fluttered he bent over her talking softly quickly so that her first clear thoughts wouldnt be fearful ones natalie youre okay we got out okay you just swallowed some smoke everythings all right now youve been sleeping im right here i dont want you to talk your throats going to be miserable for a while youre talking she whispered her eyes still closed yeah and it felt as though hed swallowed a flaming sword thats why i dont recommend it she swallowed and winced we didnt die doesnt look like it gently he cupped her head and held a cup of water so that she could sip through the straw just take it easy there was a fear lurking deep inside her but she had to know are we burned badly were not burned a couple of singes maybe relief made her shiver i cant feel anything except she reached up to touch the bruise on her forehead sorry he pressed his lips to the lump felt himself begin to tremble and drew back again you got that when i tackled you she opened her eyes then they felt weighted her whole body felt weighted hospital she asked then her breath caught as she focused on him scratches on his face a bandage at his temple and a larger one that started just below his shoulder and nearly reached the elbow his hands his beautiful hands were wrapped in gauze oh god ry youre hurt cuts and bruises he smiled at her singed my hair a little you need a doctor ive had one thanks i dont think she likes me now shut up and rest what happened youre going to have to move your office when she started to speak again he held up a hand ill tell you what i know if you keep quiet otherwise ill just leave you to stew deal satisfied he sat on the edge of the bed deirdre tried to call you in colorado he began when he finished her head was throbbing impotent fury ate away at the remnant of the sedative until she was wide awake and aching anticipating her ry laid his hand over her mouth theres nothing you can do until youre on your feet not much you can do then its up to the departments fire and police and its being handled now im going to ring for the nurse so they can take a look at you i dont her protest turned into a spasm of coughing by the time shed regained control a nurse was gesturing ry out of the room she didnt see him again for more than twentyfour hours you could use another day here nat boyd crossed his feet at the ankles as he watched natalie pack the small overnight case hed brought her i hate hospitals youve made that clear i need your word youre taking a full week off at home or im calling in the troops and not just cilia but mom and dad theres no need for them to fly all the way out here thats up to you pal she pouted three days off a full week anything less is a dealbreaker i can be just as tough a negotiator as you he said with a grin its in the blood fine fine a week what difference does it make she snatched up the water glass and drank it seemed she could never get enough to drink these days everythings in shambles half my buildings destroyed one of my most trusted executives is responsible i dont even have an office to go to youll take care of that next week hawthorne has a lot to answer for the fact that he didnt know you and ry were in the building isnt going to save him all for greed too angry to pack the few things boyd had brought her she paced her body still felt weak but there was too much energy boiling within to allow her to keep still draining a little here a little there losing it on speculative stocks then draining more and more until he was so desperate he risked burning down entire buildings just to destroy records and delay the audit records she whirled back how frustrated he must have been when i told him i had duplicates of everything that was lost in the warehouse fire and he wasnt sure where you kept them fire destroys everything boyd pointed out so hed take one of the buildings and hope if he didnt hit the confusion in the aftermath would keep everyone so busy you wouldnt get around to the audit until he hoped hed managed to replace the siphoned funds so he thought he doesnt know you like i do you always get things done on time the office was his last shot and the most desperate since he had to do it himself when we picked him up and he found out you and ry had been in there and that he was facing attempted murder charges he gave us everything i trusted him natalie murmured i cant stand knowing i could be so wrong about anyone i thought i knew she glanced up as the door opened good to see you ry boyd said and rose this looked like his cue to make a quick and discreet exit ry nodded at boyd then focused on natalie why arent you in bed ive been discharged youre not ready to leave the hospital excuse me boyd slipped toward the door i have a sudden urge for a cup of bad coffee neither natalie nor ry bothered to say goodbye they only continued to argue in raspy croaks do you have a medical degree now inspector i know what shape you were in when you got here well if youd bothered to check in since youd have seen that im recovered i had a lot of details to tie up he told her and you needed to rest id rather have had you he held out the flowers im here now she sighed should she let him off the hook so easily when shed been pining for him for so long and why shouldnt she make him pay a bit for dumping her for the most ridiculous reason why dont you go take those daffodils to someone who needs them he tossed them on the bed im going to go talk to the doctor you certainly will not talk to my doctor i dont need your permission to leave the hospital you didnt ask me for mine and i did not need rest i needed to see you i was worried about you were you encouraged he lifted a hand to her face i wanted you here ry dozens of other people came but obviously you didnt see the need i had work he shot back i wanted to get the evidence on that sonofabitch as soon as possible its all i can do id kill him if i could get to him she started to snap back then felt an icy chill at the look on his face stop that unnerved she turned her back on him away from the murder in his eyes and tossed a robe in her case i dont want to hear you talk that way i didnt know if you were alive he spun her around his fingers digging into her shoulders i didnt know you werent moving i didnt know if you were breathing suddenly he dragged her against him and buried his face in her hair god natalie ive never been so scared all right she brought her arms around him to soothe dont think about it i didnt let myself until you woke up yesterday since then i havent been able to think about anything else struggling for composure he eased away im sorry sorry for saving my life for risking your own to keep me from being hurt you shielded me from the explosion you carried me through fire she shook her head quickly before he could speak dont tell me you were doing your job i dont give a damn whether you want to be a hero or not youre mine i love you natalie her heart softened and swelled carefully she turned and picked up the daffodils it was foolish to waste their emotions on anger they were alive you mentioned that before we were interrupted theres something else i should have mentioned why i pushed you away staring down she flicked a finger over a bright yellow trumpet you listed the reasons i listed the excuses not the reason maybe you could look at me while i grovel she turned back trying to smile its not necessary ry yeah it is you havent decided whether youre going to give me another chance yet he reached out tucked her hair behind her ear i could wear you down eventually because youre crazy about me but you deserve to know what was going on in my head she stiffened automatically i dont think arrogance is very appropriate so why dont you i was scared he said quietly and watched the heat fade from her eyes of you of me of us he let out a long breath when she said nothing i didnt think i could say it admit it not until i realized what it was to be really scared downtothebone scared it makes being afraid of being in love pretty stupid then it looks like we were both stupid because i was scared too her mouth curved a little you were more stupid of course my whole life he said quietly ive never felt anything like what i feel for you not for anyone i know her breath trembled out i know its the same with me and it just keeps getting bigger and scarier are you going to give me another chance she looked at him the bony face the dark eyes the unruly hair i probably owe you that much seeing as youve saved my life and come clean groveled and apologized her smile spread i suppose i could give us both another chance want to marry me the flowers drifted to the floor as her fingers went numb excuse me with you feeling generous it seemed like a good time to push my luck feeling foolish he bent down and gathered up the daffodils but it can wait she cleared her aching throat accepting the flowers again would you mind repeating the question his eyes shot back to hers it took him a moment to find his voice again it was a risk he realized one of the biggest risks hed ever faced and he had to leave his fate in her hands will you marry me i could do that she said and let out the breath shed been holding even as ry let out his own yes i could do that laughing she launched herself into his arms ive got you dazzled ry buried his face in her hair ive got you legs from now on and kissed her i want babies she told him the minute her mouth was free no kidding with a grin he pushed her hair back so that he could read her face what he saw made his heart leap me too that makes it handy he scooped his arms under her legs and lifted her what do you say we get out of here and get started she managed to snag her overnight case before he headed to the door thatll make it nine months from today she kissed his cheek as he carried her from the room and im always on time in this case she managed to be eight days early
