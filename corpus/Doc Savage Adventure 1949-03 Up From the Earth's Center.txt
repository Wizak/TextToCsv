 i the hours became days and the days grew into weeks and the weeks followed one another into a dull and terrible haze of time in which nothing really changed gilmore had scooped a shallow pit in the eroding chalk at the edge of a cliff roofed it with a crude thatched trapdoor which he could close against the black things of night and he spent the majority of his time there for a time during indian summer one day was like another it was then that gilmore lost his shirt he took off the shirt and arranged it carefully and he thought safely on the sandy beach while he waded into the sea to stand motionless in hopes of clubbing an unwary fish for food a huge and dour gray seagull a typically thievish knave of a seagull carried the shirt away it was a sports shirt and its gaudy plastic buttons fascinated the gull it was a small thing the thin shirt was practically worthless as a protective garment but gilmore took it hard he ran wildly after the seagull and the bird flapped out to sea packing the shirt in its beak with gulllike greed gilmore unable to swim ran screaming up and down the beach and when he was exhausted he fell on his face and sobbed during the ensuing few days of indian summer gilmore tried to teach himself to swim he was unsuccessful probably because he had no real heart left to put into it it was pointless anyway a man could not swim the atlantic the warm days ended winter came the pools of rainwater in the potholes in the island stone began to have thin crusts of ice and the rocks became bonecolored with coatings of frost gilmore made hardly a move to thwart the certainty of freezing to death it was too much of a certainty for him to compete against it was inevitable his pants now were frayed into shorts and he stuffed them with dry seaweed and tied seaweed about himself with other seaweed for binding until he resembled an ambulatory pile of the smelly stuff actually it did no good and it soon became definitely established in his mind that he would freeze to death he began to wait for death almost as one would await a friend but rescue got there before death although at first it was dull and undramatic gilmore was sitting on a stone contemplating eternity when a pleasant voice hailed him hello there the voice said are you the proprietor of this heavenly spot a glaze settled over gilmores sore eyes and for a long time he did not turn around in fact he did not turn until he had conducted quite an odd conversation in a small choking voice so you finally got to me gilmore said his voice had the hopelessness of a soul lost in interstellar space yeah it took a little time to climb the cliff the voice contained some pleasant surprise i didnt think you had seen us you didnt give any sign we were rather puzzled gilmore shuddered and said i dont always see you do i huh us gilmore continued selecting carefully from the words the pleasant voice had said us we is there more than one of you now there are eighteen of us the voice said say whats the matter with you fellow so you went back for more experienced help gilmore went on eighteen of you croaked gilmore good god they must have depleted the staff what staff the executive personnel in hell said gilmore bitterly who are you kidding the amiably friendly voice inquired now gilmore swung around to stare at the stranger and to lose his composure until he was a shaking gibbering man gilmore saw standing before him a tall middleaged man with a fat ruddy face and a sheepskin greatcoat and a faint odor of good hair pomade that oddly fitted the icy island wind gilmore saw beyond the man on the chopping sea a sailing yacht of about eighty feet waterline schoonerrigged and on the beach a dory with shipped oars and a couple of waiting sailors in thick blue peacoats strangers all man yacht dory sailors all strangers and inconceivable unacceptable an illusion a figment concocted out of ghastly chicanery a work of satan as far as gilmore could understand so gilmore darted off the rock and fled screaming and whimpering going as fast as a starvationridden string of bones could travel dr karl linningen caught him easily although the doctor was a portly languid individual who secretly believed that exercise was poisonous the schooner yacht by name the mary too sailed southward and westward over the heaving cold green seas eventually rounding to the south of the canadianowned island of campobello and beating up through the narrowing tidal channel of lubec a small fishing village which is the most easternmost settlement in the united states as far east in maine as one can travel on dry land dr karl linningen who was a psychiatrist by profession and quite deserving of the title eminent had by that time spent a goodly interval probing at gilmores body and fishing in gilmores mind and dr karl was a puzzled man the tide in the rip that squirts past lubecs stony chin was running a hellish stream when the mary too careened in passed the stone jetty wallowed about and labored into smoother water just off the docks where the sardine boats unloaded and dropped anchor dr karl immediately prepared to go ashore of the several guests aboard none were doctors because dr karl felt that a man should get away from the familiar in order to relax you turn a racehorse into a pasture with other racehorses and hes going to continue acting like a racehorse was the way he phrased it when im on vacation i want plowhorses in my pasture one of the plowhorses was bill williams a sports announcer on the radio and the others were a broker a shoeshop owner and three insurance men you seem hellbent to get ashore remarked bill williams noting the doctors preparations thats right going to be gone long dont know what about our wild boy off the island bill williams asked want to prescribe any medicine to give him in case youre gone a while hes the reason im in a hurry to get ashore dr karl muttered you can have him dr karl grinned wryly but keep him around until i get back will you you mean if he wants to go ashore tell him he cant in a gentlemanly way and in case the gentlemanly way doesnt work then what shall we do dr karl examined bill williams considerable length noting there were still a few signs of the old football framework under the lazy lard and said i imagine you could manage suitable restraint bill what is the legal leg i stand on while restraining bill williams asked after hesitating dr karl said wryly i could fix that up i suppose mind you dont cripple him or anything gad we sound like pirates consorting williams chuckled i get the picture you think it wouldnt be any trouble to prove he was nuts and needed restraining righto ill keep your wild boy here for you dr karl gripped the rail preparatory to swinging over into the dinghy but turned to remark why call him my wild boy huh isnt he williams inquired a wry smile touched dr karls lips no more than yours not as much it was your donkeylike work as a steersman that brought us close enough to the witchs cake of a rock that we happened to see the poor looney he dropped down into the dinghy it rocked only a little under his expertly balanced weight and he untied the painter after pulling the little craft along the rail with his strong hands back in an hour or two bill he said and took up the oars he used the oars in a powerful feathering stroke that sent the blades deep then brought them back clear and flashing on returns dr linningen liked the sea and he was not happy that he saw less and less of it as the years passed nor was he pleased that this gilmore had intruded into one of his rare vacation voyages and gilmore had intruded all right from the very first he had been an article dr karl couldnt ignore no psychiatrist could have ignored him there was too much that was puzzling the customs was in a gray wooden building beside the ferry slip and dr karl stopped there to check in and explain about gilmore and to answer the resulting questions is he an american citizen the official wished to know born in kansas i would say and when the officials eyes widened doubtfully dr karl added quickly a matter of accents i have studied them the fellow has really told us almost nothing about himself except to call him by the name of gilmore you mean hes too crazy to tell you anything about himself doc crazy thats too conclusive a word his mental state hasnt permitted confidences or explanations be ok if i went out and talked to this gilmore go ahead if you wish it will do no harm and probably no good then i will the customs officer said dr karl nodded amiably then changed the subject by asking how is the survey on the quoddy project coming that engineer from new york renwick is still around here the official explained but they arent puffing out any information that ive heard he eyed the doctor curiously you read about it in the newspapers dr karl shook his head said radio then he went to the window one facing north toward the area that had been the scene some fifteen years before of the quoddy project for harnessing the resources of the terrific fundy tides a thin fog veiled the area but he could see the stony islands that had been intended as an anchor for one of the dams that had never been built because congress had concluded quoddy was just so much dream stuff i happen to know this engineer renwick and his associate doc savage dr karl said suddenly that was the reason i asked the customs man straightened interest splashed over him like a stinging bath doc savage the man repeated youre a friend of doc savage dr karl turned lowered a shoulder deprecatingly explaining in a professional sense only he prepared to leave but hesitated when be noticed how the official was staring at him something wrong im sorry the officer said he grinned this doc savage a man with a reputation like that you sort of wonder if hes real kind of a shock when you run across someone who really knows him savage is real enough dr karl moved to the door i sort of wondered if he would be around visiting his associate renwick that would be something the officer said he followed the doctor to the door that would be something well doctor ill look at this zany you picked off a rock and well probably let him in on your sayso be a shame to keep a guy out of this country just because hes a little nuts considering some weve already got the man was chuckling over his joke as dr karl walked away the rooming house stood on the rocky brow of a hill that formed the backbone of the town of lubec an ancient and large house it had woodwork of teak fetched in sailing ships from the orient and could have been bought during the depression for five hundred dollars the old lady who opened the door peered blankly and asked who savage said dr karl doc savage clark savage jr the man of bronze all one and the same individual i dont know what youre talking about said the old lady who is the landlady thats me dr karl looked unsmilingly at the old face that was as crinkled and expressionless as a deflated toy balloon and in a moment he asked is colonel john renwick here renny renwick the old lady took her time him he over on the work what time will renwick be back maybe about six maybe not dr karl grinned wryly thank you madam would you tell him old doc linningen called tell him also that if he wishes a decent cup of coffee to drop aboard my schooner this evening sometime the old lady stiffened angrily whats the matter with my coffee she snapped dr karl looked surprised then said why its nectar im sure he had turned away and was halfway to the gate when the old woman suddenly yelled i make the best damn coffee in the state of maine and slammed the door grinning wondering just what the old lady thought the word nectar meant dr karl walked back toward the waterfront all routes from the top of lubecs hill led downward and presently dr karl began a descent he found himself walking rapidly jarringly as one does down a hill then he began running not running fast just taking a series of crowhops that must have looked rather ridiculous and really were ridiculous because he couldnt stop himself finally he had to throw out his hands and grasp a picket in a fence and stopped himself with a jerk he rested there a moment to recover sea legs he muttered putting in words the answer that seemed to explain his descent of the hill but in a moment when he began to descend again he fell to running and was helpless against it and brought himself up only by steering against the side of a building this happened once more and he was perspiring and upset in his mind when he reached the foot of the street kroeger one of the crew had watched him and he saw kroeger conceal a grin dr karl irritated snapped dammit man i didnt have a drop im sure you didnt sir kroeger said hastily then added i came ashore in the other dink for supplies shall i give you a tow back to the vessel sir no thanks kroeger i learned to row a boat several years ago dr karl said with a vehemence which he saw at once was excessively childish but he did row back to the schooner in excellent style and would have carried off a triumphant return if gilmore hadnt started screaming and throwing things at him there was little sense to gilmores squalling less to the things he threw he just hurled what he could get his hands on an oar a boathook a cushion two life preservers a lead squid used for mackerel trolling the brass cover off the compass binnacle then bill williams bouncing up from below decks pinned poor gilmores arms and stopped the fusillade by the time dr karl climbed thoughtfully aboard bill williams had wrestled gilmore below and kroeger had retrieved the thrown articles except for the squid and the binnacle cover which sank dr karl heard the unmistakable sound of a blow from the cabin then bill williams reappeared holding his right hand with his left you shouldnt have struck him dr karl said thats right i darn near knocked down a knuckle but that binnacle cover cost good money didnt it no more than ten dollars and he obviously wasnt responsible ten bucks is ten bucks and he threw it in the drink bill williams said he shrugged ok maybe i shouldnt have hung one on him come to think of it that was kind of silly of me wasnt it why did you dr karl asked why because well i fancied the idea at the time i dont know i hit him and now i dont know why bill williams looked confused funny thing for me to do i kind of like the guy did gilmore say anything while you were struggling with him nothing very coherent cussing no wait i think i did catch something about keeping mr wail from getting aboard who wail or wales or whale something like that it was confused bill williams grinned wryly i wonder who mr wail is to our guest gilmore dr karl did not answer and bill williams who had not really looked squarely at linningen since coming on deck did so now a considerable surprise wrenched at williams and he said you look pale arent you feeling well did that loon hit you with something he didnt hit me with anything he threw dr karl replied grimly well you look as if there was a rattlesnake in your pocket linningen glanced oddly at the man then away and they were below in the main cabin having a bracer before linningen muttered i would buy he rattler in preference he did not say anything further to remove williams resulting puzzled stare later dr karl stretched out on his bunk and endeavored to do what he frequently advised his patients to do relax take it easy and grin away the worries he was quite good at that he frequently said that all a really good psychiatrist needs is the ability to show a patient how to kick his problems in the nose and he could do this successfully with his patients he didnt have much luck with himself now however when he realized he was becoming wet with perspiration he got up and took a shower over the splashing water he heard kroeger shouting on deck lunging topside with a towel for clothing he saw that bill williams who could hardly row a boat in calm water was trying to scull with one oar in the direction of campobello island which lay half a mile distant across the tidal channel the tide was now in full rip and no place for a greenhorn in a dinghy shouting angrily kroeger was in pursuit of williams in the other dinghy and he caught williams who apparently had thrown the other oar away kroeger towed williams and the dinghy back not without difficulty making angry comments to which williams gave a dazed stupefied silence williams what in thunderation were you trying to do dr karl demanded williams went below without a word of answer he was pale kroeger asked what made mr williams do a fool thing like that he knows hes no hand with a boat hed have drowned sure out in that rip tense an edge riding his voice dr karl asked did you see him start out how did he act kroeger had a queer look my god yes he just got in the dinghy like a man sleepwalking he untied the painter then he threw the oar away he began to scull only he cant scull he cant even row a boat decent i yelled at him he didnt pay no attention so i overtook him and when i did i asked him what the hell he thought he was doing and you know what he said to me he said i was going after mr wail thats what he said just that then he looked more dazed than before and he hasnt said a word since what was that name wail a mr wail he said dr karl swung about and dropped down into the cabin williams was pouring himself a drink a strong one he looked up and his face was strained and his deepthroated radioannouncers voice was a thin harpish thing as he said dont ask me what the devil made me do that i dont know but you did know it was dangerous to get out in the tide rip with just one oar i should have williams muttered what did you mean when you told kroeger you were going after a mr wail williams stared at his glass for a long time as if he were afraid of the glass and as if he were afraid of the things in his mind i didnt say anything like that to kroeger he muttered thickly dr karl wheeled and now he felt terror where he had been only puzzled or perhaps it had been terror all along and he had refused to recognize it as such it was more heroic to be puzzled than afraid it always is he thought with horror he jerked open the door of the cabin where gilmore was and saw the man inside lying on a bunk gilmore dr karl yelled but gilmore was not dead he rolled his head enough so that dr karl saw his blank wasted face and the pools of terror and desperation that the mans eyes had been from the time they found him on the island closing and locking the door of the cabin dr karl told kroeger keep that man in there im going ashore keep him there until i get back and nobody else goes ashore nobody understand he went ashore wrenching the little dinghy madly through the water with great oar strokes ii two small nearaccidents happened to dr karl linningen during the next ten minutes he did not at the time he realized later pay them the attention they deserved first he almost fell out of the dinghy which was a ridiculous thing to do because he had been rowing small boats since he began breathing practically he swore briefly and bitterly about it feeling it was a mishap due to overanxiety still if he had taken a dive into the icy water and ripping tide he might have had a difficult go he was not much of a swimmer and the gulls were screaming and crying the sounds that a drowning man might have used to appeal for help secondly he was nearly run down by a car that too seemed a mishap fitting his mood the steepness and narrowness of the lubec street and the general confusion of things it was a small car quite ancient after it was past dr karl noted that its rattle was a great thing like a whirlwind crossing a city dump and he wondered how he could have missed such a clatter the driver of the car dr karl tried to remember later he thought it was a round little amiable man with large shining eyes a little man who radiated a lovely temperament the way a stove dispenses heat a little guy you just naturally would like anyway the old car missed dr karl and so it did not seem too important eventually he got where he was going in such a hurry the old lady said you and blew out her cheeks with sudden rage causing all her wrinkles to disappear from the lower part of her face who told you my coffee was no good she demanded dr karl linningen breathed heavily id like to see doc savage its very urgent if i can find mr renwick he could help me locate savage im sure my coffee i complimented your coffee madam you what i said it was nectar probably very good no doubt i presumed it would be good madam without having sampled it dr karl was not very patient now is that so there was no friendliness in the old womans eye who you talk about doc savage renny renwick not know either one dr karl glared at her madam no doubt youre a character in your own opinion and another time i might pretend to be amused just now however ive got damned important business with doc savage and to find him ive got to get hold of his aid renwick when will renwick be home the old lady shrugged and started to close the door dr karl hastily inserted his toe in the crack and shouted i want an answer where is renwick the woman glowered asked you want to pull back a stub pointing at the foot in the door then she tried abruptly to kick dr karls shin he was too quick and shoved the door back while she was distracted he entered the room the old lady backed away yelling mr savage doc savage a rather striking mans voice from the room to the left said easy does it marie i was listening the man appeared in the connecting door and dr karl recognized him immediately as doc savage dr linningen had exaggerated somewhat when he said he knew doc savage he had met the bronze man and that was the extent of it so he was astonished when savage looked at him steadily and asked what is it dr linningen you seem excited i was here earlier dr karl snapped i was told you werent about not known here as a matteroffact you had better come upstairs doctor this is a funny kind of welcome im not sure i like it doc savage shrugged you came without an invitation doctor he lifted a hand adding i am going upstairs if you care to follow he turned and mounted the stairs and suddenly when he was halfway up he turned to say sharply if you do come up it had better be for something worthwhile we do not like pointless interruptions dr karl snorted but this hesitation lasted only a moment and he followed the bronze man thinking of some of the things he knew about doc savage and of other things he had heard he knew that savage was an extremely fine surgeon rather a wizard for the man had devised some procedures in brain surgery that were exceptional and his measurements of cerebrifugal voltages were outstanding contributions to tabular analysis the mans physical build dr karl reflected was more of a clue to his adventurous nature linningen was not small but doc savage dwarfed him and there was a metallic efficiency about the man a dynamic force a quality of power under close control that was disturbing savage was not a man whose stature shrank on lengthening acquaintance they went into a rear secondfloor room which had a spread of windows and much neat comfort linningen faced savage and demanded why be so hard to get to doc savage appeared not to hear the question but went to one of the windows and pulled back the curtains so that more of the afternoon sunlight could get in linningen scowling because his question had been ignored was about to speak when savage forestalled him with a demand that was like a slap in the face what has driven you so far into fear doctor savage asked linningen winced whats that youre a scared man doctor oh i am am i linningen growled sounding like a small boy beginning a behindtheschoolhouse brawl what gives you that idea and did you notice that youre being a little insulting you feel that youre being insulted doc asked dryly i certainly do doc savage looked him over thoughtfully youre lucky linningen that you werent kicked out of here you forced your way in you know by bulldozing an old lady what do you think of that for bad manners linningen had taken a chair he jumped up im leaving he snapped sit down doc savage directed and get it off your chest the devil with you linningen shouted he was halfway to the door when doc savage laid a firm grip on his arm halting him there followed a brief interval when linningen debated taking a swing at the big bronze man and also imagined what would probably happen to him he grimaced all right savage the rough stuff wins but i must say that i came up here for your cooperation not your persecution sit down linningen oh all right take your hands off me linningen resumed his chair now doctor whats on your mind doc savage asked bluntly i must say linningen retorted that this wasnt the way i hoped to start off lets not worry about the way it started since its already started doc savage told him lets be bothered about the ending go ahead with your troubles doctor linningen shrugged scowled got out a cigar and noticed that the tobacco wrapper was broken and the cigar partly crushed without lifting his eyes he remarked you seemed to know me by sight why shouldnt i know you doc savage countered youre a psychiatrist of some reputation you have been in audiences to which i lectured yes i heard you twice and each time i was one in an audience of about three hundred specialists linningen said grudgingly you mean you noticed me you werent in the audience either time by accident doctor what do you mean just this every man in those lecture audiences was carefully selected whether or not he knew it they were checked over the quacks weeded out and invitations given only to those who would be intelligent enough to understand what they were hearing thats an egotistical statement linningen muttered not at all if you will recall i had but a small part in the lecture programs the hell you did linningen snorted you were the man they came to hear doc savage shrugged suppose you get around to the story linningen nodded ive got a boat a sailboat a schooner i like to spend my free time aboard her because im a nut on sailing the name of the boat is the mary too i named her after my wife who is dead for the past three weeks ive been sailing the mary too with some acquaintances we visited the northern shore of nova scotia and on our way back we found a possessed man who was alone starving and freezing on a rocky island we picked him up and some things i dont understand have started happening i want your help lets build up that part of the story doc savage interrupted lets put more parts in it the island where we found the fellow doesnt have a name that i know of linningen explained its about twenty miles offshore and two hundred miles from here a grim place your schooner is about seventy feet on the waterline isnt it doctor doc savage asked yes thats right im surprised you knew it and you were on a coastwise cruise yes do you customarily do your cruising twenty miles offshore thats how far away from the mainland you say the island was dr linningen moved his hand impatiently the ship is perfectly seaworthy id rather risk her than an ocean liner in a blow seaworthiness has no bearing on it yachtsmen cruising the coast usually keep close inshore so that they can anchor in a calm harbor at night its more comfortable that way isnt that right not always but generally well yes generally and your boat was twenty miles offshore and passed this barren island how did that happen i dont see how that is important doc savage said maybe it isnt but if youre going to tell a story lets have a complete one how did you happen to pass that island linningen thought it over for a moment i guess it was because bill williams couldnt box a compass bill was steering and he was told to hold north by east for a course and he held northeast this resulted in your passing the island i guess it did you could hardly call it an island though it was more of a rock were you looking for a man on the island of course not linningen snapped who would expect a man on such a place we were looking the place over through the binoculars and saw him exactly who saw him i did and it was an accident dr linningen nodded grimly it sure was it was a piece of bad luck too how do you mean bad luck ill get to that this fellow had evidently been marooned on the island for three weeks or months he was in bad shape he had almost no clothes and had tied seaweed around himself for warmth he was in ghastly shape starving and freezing he must have welcomed rescue doc savage suggested on the contrary linningen shook his head he resented it here is exactly the way the rescue took place this fellow he says his name is gilmore but thats about all he has told us concerning himself apparently didnt notice our arrival two of the crew rowed me ashore and i approached gilmore who was sitting on a rock i spoke to him without turning around he said so you got to me finally his voice sounded utterly hopeless then he explained his not noticing us by saying i dont always see you do i then he made a remark that indicated he thought we had all come from tophet from where tophet hades hell the place down under that doesnt sound as if gilmore was rational doc savage said thats right he didnt act rational either he jumped up and fled screaming we had to chase him to catch him and take him aboard the schooner he fought us like a wildcat he wanted to stay on the island thats the way he acted linningen agreed grimly the poor devil would have frozen or starved within a few days so the humane thing seemed to be to remove him against his wishes we did that im damned sorry for it now sorry you saved the mans life doc savage asked what makes you say that linningen bit his lips the things that have happened since have started me wishing wed never seen the fellow at all what things linningen hesitated this stuff isnt going to sound very reasonable its stuff you have to see to believe for example queer things incidents hard to explain doc savage said impatiently youll have to be more explicit that that doctor doctor linningen was tense and uncomfortable on the chair its hard to be specific about the intangible youre a psychiatrist doctor the intangible is your business you should deal with it very capably yes i know linningen muttered if i wasnt a psychiatrist i wouldnt be scared probably if i didnt have enough training along such lines to know better id just think gilmore was balmy and let it go at that doc savage showed a sharper flicker of interest you dont feel gilmore is crazy hes no more crazy than i am not as much so as im going to be if this keeps up linningen said what do you mean by this linningen compressed his lips scowling at his clenched hands then he blurted there have been at least half a dozen unwitting attempts at suicide by the people on the mary too since that fellow gilmore came aboard doc savage frowned unwitting did you mean to use that word yes ill explain it youd better doc savage said dryly this isnt adding up to a very lucid or believable account let me tell you one thing that bill williams did it will serve as an example you know how the tide rips through the inlet here at lubec well bill williams got in a dinghy and threw away one oar and started sculling or trying to scull he cant row a dinghy passably much less scull one out into the tide he would have drowned if one of the sailors hadnt noticed and overtaken him in time did williams have an explanation not a reasonable one he said it just seemed like a thing he wanted to do at the time he would have drowned the chances are nine hundred and ninetynine out of a thousand that he would have did he know that he should have doc savage nodded this is interesting doctor you had better give me the other incidents i will doctor linningen said and proceeded to relate a full account of events he finished with the two narrow escapes which hed had while enroute to the house a few minutes ago i dont know whether i should include those because they might have been coincidences he said who is this mr wail doctor doc savage asked thoughtfully linningen shrugged youve got me just a name gilmore has mouthed is all i know and gilmore has explained nothing absolutely nothing he hasnt said how he got on the island or why he wished to remain he hasnt explained a thing doc savage asked sharply have you passed over any cumulative impressions doctor linningen hesitated i dont believe i understand what you mean by cumulative impression your story indicated that someone might have returned to the schooner with you at the conclusion of your first trip ashore doc savage said linningen winced i was alone i was absolutely alone in that dinghy when i rowed back what about the crew member who was also ashore kroeger he came back alone too you re sure positive and it was at you that gilmore started throwing things he threw things at my dinghy yes at you or at the dinghy or shall we say at some presence in the dinghy of which you were not aware linningen shuddered lets not be fantastic i was alone in the dinghy i would know if i was alone wouldnt i but gilmore threw things at the dinghy as if trying to drive someone away yes and williams after he started off into the deadly tide rip with one oar said that he was going after mr wail yes or kroeger said thats what he said does williams know a mr wail he says he doesnt williams cant explain what he did i see i hope to god you do see linningen blurted i hope youve got some explanation doc savage went to the window opened it an inch and the curtains immediately fattened under a little gust of inrushing wind the air was chilled freighted with the smoky odor from the herring sheds along the waterfront it was a smell that hung over lubec perpetually the way crude oil odor pervades refinery towns turning abruptly doc savage said linningen youve omitted to explain why you came to lubec dont tell me it was a planned port of call because its off the usual route and doesnt have a very good yacht anchorage linningen nodded thats easy i came in hope of finding you the psychiatrist looked up saw that doc savage was waiting for a further explanation and added thats right i knew renny renwick your friend and associate was here i heard that on the radio there was a newscast about a congressional discussion of the subject of going ahead with the dormant quoddy project and renwick the noted engineer being employed to make a survey and recommendations to the committee because renny renwick was here you thought i would be doc savage asked dryly not necessarily but through renwick seemed the best way of getting hold of you and why were you so anxious to find me doc inquired linningen jumped up nervously dammit isnt that obvious by now i want you to investigate this odd thing your sideline is dealing with the unusual and i thought you would be interested and the most capable man i could think of god knows its unusual enough you want me to talk to gilmore linningen nodded eagerly thats it better still take him off my hands you want to get rid of gilmore youre darned tooting i want to get rid of gilmore hes giving me the compound willies linningen took a careful grip on himself and added you understand im not passing the buck gilmore is just something i dont understand im sure you can fathom him i cant ill bet you will be fascinated by gilmore im not all i want is to see the last of him and mr wail i dont know who or what mr wail is linningen said vehemently you can have mr wail too with my blessings you seem extremely anxious to shed your responsibilities linningen responsibilities linningen yelled what responsibility have i got toward gilmore i saved the mans life by taking him off an island where he would have starved isnt that enough is it why dont you talk to gilmore and see for yourself linningen asked i will linningens sigh of relief was a gulp when in about an hour linningens face fell i was hoping you would go back to the boat with me now no in an hour ill be there you go back to the schooner and wait doctor linningen nodded reluctantly all right but you will be sure and come wont you ill be there iii after he had closed the front door behind linningen doc savage wheeled raced back up the stairs to the pleasant parlor jerked open a connecting door and confronted the two men there did you hear all that he demanded practically all said one of the two men he was a short fellow nearly as wide as he was tall with a face that would frighten his own mother he was monk mayfair lieutenant colonel andrew blodgett mayfair and he had a worldwide reputation as a chemist but was better known as an assistant of doc savage it impressed me as a screwball setup which has a hidden gimmick in it somewhere monk added never mind the analysis doc savage told him i want you to check the story visit the waterfront see if the things happened that linningen says happened find out if anyone saw williams start sculling out into the tide rip right now monk asked reluctantly immediately im going aboard that schooner in an hour and i want the information before then ok monk said seizing a mackinaw coat of a hideous greenandyellow check design but i just caught ham brooks swindling me in a card game and i was about to deal with him ham brooks snapped your own stupidity and greed is the only thing that swindled you you oaf monk rushed out growling well take it up later you shyster doc savage eyed ham brooks narrowly have you two started gambling against each other ham laughed monk that missing link is too tight to bet a penny against a sure thing if he had a penny to bet which he hasnt you two promised to tone down your fussing we have ham said virtuously there hasnt been a blow struck in three days although heaven knows he has provoked me doc savage who had put up with this interminable quarreling far years sighed wearily your job is to get the lowdown on linningen he told ham the recent lowdown does the man need money is he mixed up in anything use the telephone and contact people who would know his banker his friends and any other leads you can dig up in half an hour ham grinned what about his sanity do i check on that the man is sane enough his story didnt sound it ham said a story doesnt have to sound reasonable to be true doc reminded him we just want to check on this one and make sure it is forty minutes later doc savage strode into a smokehouse on the north shore of the bay a window of which gave a view of the mary too lying at anchor well he demanded did linningens story check it did as far as i went monk said i found two loafers who saw the whole thing williams starting out into the tide rip sculling the dinghy and gilmore throwing things at linningen it checks ham brooks said linningen has thirtyodd thousand dollars in the bank about his normal bank account he isnt in any trouble as far as i can learn none of his friends have noticed him acting nutty then the story seems true doc said ham grimaced not to me not a balmy yarn like that you two keep an eye on the schooner doc directed i dont think anything will happen but keep a watch anyway monk mayfair had something on his mind and when doc was halfway to the door he got it out doc what was the description of the driver of the car that almost ran linningen down a little round man who looked so utterly pleasant that linningen noticed how pleasant he looked even when he was about to have an accident doc told him thats him monk said you saw the chap yeah i think he gave me the onceover monk replied for the love of mike monk began to look uncomfortably at the floor he sort of gave me the runaround i got kind of a surprise when i noticed him because i hadnt seen him around he was sure a pleasant looking little codger kind of made you think of a pintsized edition of santa claus i hope doc said that his pleasant looks didnt keep you from finding out why he was interested in you monk ducked his head slightly that wasnt what kept me from questioning him what did he went monk replied and i mean went first he turned around and strolled into one of these fishermans supply stores and i go in after him and puff he wasnt there couldnt anyone tell you where he went no one admitted seeing him monk replied looking oddly at doc that was darn funny too because the clerks were standing around with nothing to do but watch for customers they certainly saw me quick enough when i came in did the incident seem queer to you monk doc asked monk made a face the guy just walked into the store and ducked out without anyone noticing him thats all i dont believe in this wild stuff linningen was spilling im going aboard the schooner doc said keep an eye on the vessel doc savage strode to the ferry slip sent a powerful hail in the direction of the schooner mary too and a dinghy came bobbing toward shore rowed by a sullen middleaged man with a leathery face the latter held the dinghy near the slip with one hand and growled jump aboard if youre doc savage youre kroeger arent you doc asked kroeger stiffened scowling upward and demanded did somebody tell you that or is this more goondust doctor linningen described you kroeger doc told him oh the man picked up the oars you sit in the stern he began to row everything all right aboard the vessel doc asked kroeger did not answer immediately he maintained a sullen silence all the way to the schooner then he said bitterly everythings fine fine fine it had an explosive quality doc noted that the mary too was a wellconstructed vessel that was a compromise between the yacht type of luxury which appealed to landlubbers and occasional sailors and the sturdy deepsea traditional construction which went to the heart of a real saltwater man shes a neat ship he told linningen when the latter popped up from below decks yes yes of course linningen agreed nervously i im afraid that poor gilmore is going to be difficult in what way doc asked well gilmore wont leave his stateroom linningen explained but come below well try again to get him out linningen with the quick movements of a man on the ragged edge of nerves hurried below and jerked at the knob of a stateroom door still has it locked on the inside he said with exasperation gilmore open that door stop this foolishness from inside the stateroom there came silence isnt he speaking doc asked linningen shrugged gilmore has maintained a sullen silence most of the time i cant understand why hes in a huff though did you tell him i was coming aboard doc asked curiously yes i did how did he react to that linningen suddenly pounded on the door with his fist this is his reaction i suppose anyway he went into his stateroom and hasnt come out and wont answer doc asked impatiently arent there portholes through which you can get a look at him are you sure he isnt ill there are portholes all right and a skylight too but he drew the curtains over them linningen replied dammit im going to break the door down that will cost you the price of a repair doc reminded him i dont care if it does linningen snapped and threw his weight against the door his first attempt was not successful in a burst of rage linningen leaped back then plunged at the panel which burst out around the lock linningen stumbled inside immediately blurted good god who are you doc savage stepping to the door saw an amiablelooking plump little man seated casually on the edge of a bunk he was familiar but not because doc savage had seen him before he answered the description of the friendlyfaced man who had almost run down linningen in a car and who had given monk the onceover doc pointed at the amiable man is this gilmore he demanded no linningen said he seemed completely dumfounded who is he doc asked the chubby man answered that himself im mr wail he said iv fifteen minutes later doc savage strode angrily on deck and stood there drumming his fingertips on the boomcrutch which supported the mainsail and its boom docs bronze face was composed but his mind wasnt presently he stopped drumming rubbed his jaw and walked quickly to the forecastle hatch the hatch was open and peering down it he saw kroeger and two other sailors sitting at a table playing cribbage kroeger doc said sharply kroeger was smoking a pipe and removed it to say yes sir did you know gilmore had left this boat doc asked blankly kroeger said huh he has kroeger thought it over for a moment then exclaimed hey he couldnt have nobody came or went but you mr savage nevertheless gilmore isnt aboard now doc told him i dont believe it this boat aint so large but that we ear everybody who comes aboard or leaves you didnt see gilmore leave i sure didnt who brought mr wail aboard kroegers jaw dropped mr wail whos he there aint nobody come aboard but you mr savage youre positive are you youre darn tootin im sure id bet my right arm on it you would lose that arm fellow doc told him because gilmore is gone and mr wail is aboard the sailor grinned foolishly gilmore must have told you his name was wail that guys nutty if gilmore is the guy who just talked to us or rather didnt talk to us doc said dryly he has shortened his height about a foot and put on seventy pounds of weight wheeling doc went back to the cockpit and encountered linningen who looked excited and relieved mr savage i think this wail is ready to talk linningen exclaimed its about time doc said he dropped down into the cabin and confronted the chubby mr wail who gave him an amiable grin have you decided to give an accounting of yourself doc demanded wails grin widened giving him an appearance so completely friendly that it was almost unnatural wails voice was soft and had the qualities of a rich sticky syrup it distresses me to see you unhappy wail said so i suppose i should relieve your curiosity doc eyed the man narrowly lets have it he had not been able to figure wail and there were qualities about the man that bothered him he didnt like the completely happy and friendly manner the man had there was something unnatural about it you dont seem to like me wail remarked cheerfully lets not waste time on who likes who doc told him briefly the point is there was supposed to be a fellow named gilmore in that stateroom we broke in and we didnt find gilmore we found you now lets hear you account for that the fat mr wail chuckled its quite simple i was there gilmore wasnt doc said grimly its not that simple wail if anything unpleasant has happened to gilmore it will be a lot less simple than that i can assure you wail gave a hearty laugh are you threatening me draw your own conclusions doc retorted shrugging wail said well i was in the stateroom and gilmore wasnt as to why i wouldnt open the door i notice it seems to bother you it was simply because i didnt wish to open the door why because i was irked irked by what doc demanded by being struck over the head wail examined docs face for disbelief saw plenty of it and laughed heartily really im not spoofing you i came aboard and went into that stateroom and someone sapped me over the head i didnt see my assailant but i could hazard a guess as to who it was are you intimating gilmore assaulted you doc asked bluntly wail smirked in a delicate way i might be intimating exactly that someone did and gilmore is missing you say doc threw an intent look at wail the man wore an expensive suit a clean blue shirt of good cloth a rather loud regimental cravat and his shoes shone there were doc noted no signs of salt water having splattered his shoes look here fellow youre putting on quite an act doc said coldly if gilmore hit you come out and say so then you can go right ahead and say why i didnt see gilmore hit me would you know if it was gilmore had you seen him meaning do i know gilmore by sight i certainly do and i would have known if he struck me had i seen him wail smiled doc nodded now youre getting started on a story you know gilmore now who is gilmore lets have that im not sure i like your prying at me wail murmured i dont expect you to like it doc said who is this gilmore wail shrugged his grin hadnt diminished maybe ill not tell you a thing at this point the sailor kroeger who had come to the companionway to listen struck a match to light his pipe it was not getting dark outside and the igniting match made a little splash of light mr wail showed an emotion besides friendly glee for the first time he started violently paled and turned his face away from the companionway doc asked curtly how did you get out here wail the chubby man shuddered then regained control in a small boat how does one travel over the water walk on it he snapped where did you get the small boat i rented it naturally no one saw you come aboard doc told him didnt they they should have had their eyes open no one heard you either they might try opening their ears as well wail said slyly i assure you i came aboard as evidence i offer myself as being among the present the little man smirked once more added i believe i wasnt going to give you information i shall adhere to that course i think he went over and sat primly on a bunk linningen caught docs eye blurting i dont see how he got aboard i really dont its uncanny doc shoved past linningen pushed open the door into a forward cabin and said youre bill williams arent you to the bulky young man sprawled on a berth there yeah im bill the young man said he lifted his head got a good look at doc and hastily swung out of the berth say youre doc savage he exclaimed ive got a headache and i had dozed off in a nap linningen told me you were coming aboard and im sure sorry i wasnt awake to greet you but i slept through that you slept through several things williams doc said dryly will you come in here a minute i want you to meet a fellow a moment later williams stared at mr wail blankly and asked am i supposed to know this chap dont you doc asked no williams peered at wail again no i dont know him better think over that answer williams doc said this is mr wail the fellow you said you were going hunting for when you started off into the tide rip with one oar the jerk of astonishment that williams gave seemed genuine his next reaction was harder to define he stepped back his face grew strained and he narrowed his eyes then he growled i dont remember a damned thing about starting off in a dinghy with one oar somebodys ribbing me and ive stopped thinking it is funny linningen exclaimed bill nobodys kidding you the hell they arent williams snarled and wheeled back into his cabin and slammed the door mr wail laughed outright another silent man on your hands he said ignoring wail doc crossed the cabin bounded out on deck and stood facing the sore he used his arms to signal semaphore fashion instructions to monk and ham who should be watching through the dusk they were watching because presently he saw them leave the shack where they were stationed both at a run in a few minutes they were back and monk wigwagged some information with his arms doc dropped back into the cabin strode to wail and seized the mans arm nobody on shore rented you a small boat to row out here wail doc said emphatically and no one saw gilmore row ashore now youre getting the choice of talking to me or telling it to the police either way you want to have it the police will have the same questions ive got have you been hiding on the boat and did you chuck gilmore overboard to drown when you got the chance wail was not surprised at least his grin did not waver i believe you might find a friend of yours who can say i was ashore not more than an hour ago he said you have a friend named monk mayfair havent you a flicker of respect crossed docs face youre a sharp one wail then he added but youre an odd one too and i think youre going to give us a lot of words in about one minute wail snorted in one minute i shall be just as silent as far as information is concerned as i am now i dont like your way and ive decided not to say a thing his eyes widened in terror and he jumped back here damn you dont do that wails back slammed against a bulkhead stopping his retreat doc savage had done nothing more menacing than strike a match on his thumbnail the red flame sizzled around the tip of the match doc waved the fragment of fire casually in front of wails face wail screamed in terror he lunged sidewise in an effort to escape doc tripped him and he fell flat doc immediately planted a knee on his stomach holding him down and passed the lighted match in front of wails eyes wail screeched his whole body convulsed in an agony of horror and then suddenly he relaxed into a limp mound of soft flesh wail had fainted linningen gave an astonished exclamation an extreme case of pyrophobia the psychiatrist ejaculated how in thunder did you catch on savage doc indicated the companionway where the sailor kroeger had dropped his pipe in amazement kroeger lit his pipe a minute ago he said i caught it then you mean that guys scared of a little thing like the flame of a match kroeger demanded heaving wails limp figure onto a bunk doc said get some cold water to dash in his face i think mr wail is going to talk his head off when he wakes up kroeger you be handy with a few matches if he doesnt wail moaned turned over and presently managed to focus his eyes on doc savage whereupon beads of perspiration appeared on his forehead were all ears doc told him when wail seemed to show signs of thinking it over doc told kroeger have you got a newspaper that would make a nice blaze wail emitted a choking sound cut it out he croaked god i cant stand being around fire ill tell you all i can gilmore is only his first name hes really gilmore sullivan gilmore james sullivan in full wail fell silent swallowing youve got a fine start so go right ahead doc told him gilmore sullivan is twentynine years old he studied geology in harvard and has worked at it some since but not much he is unmarried he has money which he inherited from his father as he spoke wail was looking at his fingers as if checking off the items by the digital system gilmore has a sister he continued she is his only immediate family gilmore lived at a lodge about a hundred miles inland from here the sister lives there too i can take you there the sisters name is leona she is in her early twenties and pretty she has some money also the father divided his estate between the brother and sister when wail hesitated doc said sharply that was just background stuff go ahead with the part that counts wail said about four months ago gilmore disappeared and i was hired to find him wail stood up adding thats all now i think ill get out of here wait a minute doc told him youre just starting what were the circumstances connected with gilmores disappearance wail was getting the eternal grin back on his face he just got to acting nutty and went away the sister leona figured he had blown his top i guess she was touchy about maybe there being insanity in the family and didnt want any publicity because she hired me to hunt for gilmore instead of notifying the authorities are you a professional finder of lost people doc asked thats right thats exactly what i am wail nodded vehemently several times im a private investigator a sleuth is that all its all youre making it a little too simple youve neglected to explain how you found gilmore was aboard and how you got out here to the boat without anyone seeing you wail grinned its just as simple as im making it i was in lubec by accident and i heard talk ashore about gilmore having been found on an island i rented a boat and rowed out if nobody saw me i cant help that they just didnt look because i sure wasnt invisible you werent heard boarding the schooner doc reminded him i cant help that either nobody was on deck and i went below to see who i could find i didnt see anyone and started opening stateroom doors the first one i opened i got bopped over the head when i woke up i was lying on the floor mr wail put on his smirk im a little sensitive about being knocked out i was scared too and i locked the cabin door i kept it locked because i was afraid and for no other reason now thats all ive got to say and its the truth you think gilmore went ashore in your rented dinghy why not where do you think gilmore would go next doc asked who knows what a crazy man will do maybe he took out for home home you mean where his sister lives thats exactly what i mean can you take us there i can if you want me to wail told him v as the automobile rushed around a curve in the road doc savage told monk mayfair turn on the gadget lets see what linningen and williams have to say to each other this radio you mean monk hauled a small portable out of the rear seat turned the switch and asked what frequency are they on try eight hundred and sixty megacycles doc said monk tuned in the receiver and got a rush of background noise along with the kind of sounds that would come from a microphone concealed in a car theyre kinda quiet monk said the maine woods a thick green mass all around them in spite of the early winter rushed past almost brushing the car the second car carrying linningen and williams was about half a mile behind them do you suppose they suspect we have a radio transmitter concealed in their car ham brooks asked theres a small chance doc replied but i dont think so wail was riding with doc monk and ham they noted that he was staring at the radio in perplexity finally his puzzlement got the best of him and he asked what is that thing monk and ham both laughed then monk said its a high frequency radio receiver buddy the sending set is hidden in the car in which williams and linningen are riding i dont understand said wail i dont know how id make it any clearer monk told him but if the thing works we can hear anything williams and linningen say to each other mr wail looked vaguely alarmed indeed i dont believe it aw dont be a sap its a very ordinary radio setup you should see some of the complicated stuff we use you mean you can hear them in that other vehicle without being there wail demanded nervously thats right wails eyes popped slightly and you dont consider such a miracle unusual nope monk said its nothing compared to even such a commonplace thing as television wail examined them in apprehension you uh havent been where i have been by chance he asked uneasily what monk asked do you mean by that i nothing wail seemed sorry he had brought up the subject monk flung put a large hand and gripped mr wails loud necktie before the latter could dodge just what did you mean by that crack hub he demanded nothing nothing at all wail insisted you aint pretending you dont know what radio is are you monk asked i i shouldnt have said a thing wail mumbled because if youre pretending that monk said ill bat you one on the ear ive listened to all the preposterous stuff i want to hear wail only ducked his head and furthermore monk went on if youre talking us off into the maine woods on a wild goose chase ill shake you loose from your feathers wed better find poor gilmore has a sister living back here in the woods and that she hired you to locate gilmore or youre in trouble mr wail looked uncomfortable i think hes lying to us ham brooks put in if he is monk said he probably isnt the only one just between you and me nobody connected with this crazy affair has said two consecutive words i can believe the road became rough and crooked and it climbed into rugged hills in the car behind linningen and williams hardly spoke although linningen growled once this is a hell of a road i wonder if they know where theyre going who cares bill williams asked bitterly everybody is crazy anyway i must say you certainly acted demented williams added linningen snorted you should talk lets not argue about it bill williams muttered but were free of that gilmore and i dont see the sense of trying to find him again that guy is trouble hes trouble all right agreed linningen a kind of trouble i dont understand said williams youre sure right about that linningen told him emphatically but i dont think we should drop it now i think we should satisfy our curiosity satisfy your curiosity williams asked bitterly or keep straight with doc savage a little of both linningen replied doc savage smiled slightly monk mayfair complained that doesnt give us much except the reason they tagged along so readily when you asked them to i wish theyd talk more they must be scared doc locked the brakes skidded to a stop at a fork in the road and asked which road do we take here wail wail seemed confused let me step out a moment and have a look he said ham brooks burst out impatiently dammit my man there are the road signs as clear as the nose on your face route f or g which one the road signs dont mean much to me wail mumbled why not ham barked the roads werent here when i passed this way last wail retorted with his first show of temper things have changed youve no idea what a handicap that is when i try to find my way around hams jaw dropped wail jumped out of the car and ham looked at doc and monk and made a twirling motion with a forefinger beside his forehead our happyfaced guide is as full of nuts as a squirrels dream ham said doc how long ago would you say these highways were built some time hack doc said he was thoughtful we might ask at the next service station wail sprang atop a large boulder and peered in the direction of some distant mountain peaks he seemed to be making a sincere effort to get his bearings in a moment he returned pointed to the righthand turn and said that one two miles farther on an elderly farmer riding a cart came into view and doc brought the car to a stop hello there he called to the farmer have you lived in this neighborhood long all my life the farmer replied doc nodded fine youre just the man to give us the answer to something we were wondering about how long ago was this road and the one back a couple of miles at the fork built could you give us an idea the farmer asked you mean how long ago were they paved the roads were here before they were paved oh sure in the same spot thats right the state just graded em and put on the blacktopping when was that right close to thirty years ago said the farmer but the roads were here prior to that time oh sure how much before that would you say well moren a hundred years i could say fur sure the farmer replied about half a mile down the road theres a stone bridge with the date cut in it the road was probably here before that doc thanked the farmer and put the car in motion monk and ham exchanged puzzled glances and monk gave wail a poke in the ribs the road wasnt here when you passed last but it was here more than a hundred years ago he said wail winced i could have told you that my god youre not sticking to that story monk demanded i certainly am wail snapped you think ill swallow that i wish said wail violently that you would swallow your own head as for believing me i am accustomed to not being believed i can sure see where you would be monk told him youre full of nice believable stories doc savage whipped the car over a hilltop pointed and demanded is that the place wail wail smirked it is didnt think i would find it did you well i can find anything give me time in a moment the car carrying linningen and williams came to a stop alongside doc got out and walked to their car wail says the place yonder is where gilmores sister lives he told them it looks like a fancy joint williams said mountain lodge or something it seems impressive linningen appended do we all descend at once the whole army of us doc looked at the psychiatrist sharply is there a reason why we shouldnt arrive as a party it occurs to me that such a large number of us might make the young lady nervous linningen said do you have a reason for not wanting gilmores sister to see you doc inquired of course not linningen replied hurriedly the young lady might be attractive and worth meeting doc suggested dryly i dont know she is young linningen snapped you said she was just now well it was just a thoughtless remark linningen barked look here savage what do you mean by this line of questioning i believe i resent it doc said lets pay the lady a visit and see how near you came to the truth without thinking the two cars climbed a hill the lodge an attractive structure made of logs stood against a backdrop of low mountains which bore a covering of snow there was frost on the gravel that crunched under the tires as they came to a stop i wonder if gilmore is here monk murmured we should know before long doc strode to the door glanced at two pairs of skis which were propped against the lodge wall then knocked the skis were well waxed and the snow caught in the harness looked fresh the lodge door was opened by an elderly man in a checked wool shirt and corduroy trousers plainly the servant wed like to see mr gilmore sullivan doc said gilmore hasnt been here for weeks the servant replied promptly in that case wed like to see miss leona sullivan gilmores sister doc told him who shall i say is calling tell her clark savage jr and party the servant withdrew closing the door in docs face hearing a commotion behind him doc wheeled he saw monk in the act of making a flying tackle at mr wail who had started a hasty departure he brought wail down and said oh no you dont try to skip out will you youll regret this wail declared bitterly now the door was opened by a redheaded girl wearing skiing trousers and a wool sweater her friendly face was also wearing doc thought an expression that came from making a great effort to repress fear im leona sullivan she said doc savage made the introductions this is dr linningen whose yacht rescued your brother from the desolate rock where he was marooned and my two associates monk mayfair and ham brooks he paused trying to decide what was causing miss sullivan to become pale and these gentlemen doc added are mr williams a guest on the yacht and mr wail whom i believe you are supposed to know she didnt speak and doc noted that neither wail nor williams had faced the young woman they were turned in another direction mr wail and mr williams doc said deliberately this is miss sullivan wail and williams turned reluctantly miss sullivans breath in her throat made a low sound like paper tearing and she swayed and would have fallen had not ham moving with alacrity caught her she had fainted throwing the door open doc gestured for ham to carry miss sullivans limp figure inside monk had jumped around to a spot where he could head off any contemplated retreat by bill williams and wail scowling at wail monk said i would say she knew you all right williams glared at wail i dont blame her much for her reaction he told wail you give me the creeps too wail smiled she was looking at you when she fainted williams lunged forward his fist flew out there was a smacking report as the fist landed not against wails cherubic face but in the palm of doc savages outflung hand doc jerked and williams spun into the lodge stumbled and landed in a chair he started to get up hands fisted but thought better of it he shouted by god you cant manhandle me and get away with it linningen gazing at williams in puzzled alarm said take it easy bill what has got into you i dont come up here to be pushed around williams snapped why did you come monk asked pointedly damned if i know because i didnt have any better sense i guess growled williams the old manservant in the checkered shirt came in gazed at them with disapproval and did not seem reassured by the information that miss sullivan had merely fainted he ran away shouting for his wife mary mary come quick somethings happened to miss leona his wife was a bustling plump lady several years his junior and she didnt seem alarmed miss leona hasnt been feeling well lately she said ill get some brandy doc asked has miss sullivan been ill just nervous the woman explained just nervous and jumpy will you carry her into one of the bedrooms ill take care of her when they were alone linningen took out a handkerchief and mopped his forehead what do you make of this savage somehow i have a feeling there is something intensely wrong here if you ask me the girl had a reason for fainting monk said he scowled at ham brooks depend on old johnnycomelegal to be ready to catch her though it was nice work ham told him too bad you didnt think of it first that being exactly the thought in monks mind he merely scowled i think they all seem frightened linningen observed the two servants as well you dont look as if you were at a picnic yourself ham brooks observed nevertheless i think im still competent to recognize fear when i see it linningen snapped fifteen minutes later the woman appeared and announced miss sullivan will see you mr savage leona sullivan was resting in a comfortable chair but the hands in which she held a cup of coffee probably laced with brandy were not too steady she arose extended her hand saying im afraid i got off to a shocking start as a hostess im sorry im particularly sorry to extend such a distressing reception to mr linningen and mr williams the men who rescued my brother you knew gilmore had been found doc asked without looking directly at doc she said i remember your saying so that was what you did say wasnt it perhaps we should have broken the news more gradually doc said no it was very good news one doesnt mind how good news comes you didnt seem surprised didnt i no you appeared frightened why shouldnt i she said quickly she resumed her chair and picked up the cup and saucer when her shaking hand caused the cup to tinkle on the saucer she put them down again ive been frightened for weeks she added of what she shuddered of something terrible that might have happened to gilmore you have no idea how disturbing it is just waiting after something strange has happened to your brother strange doc inquired pointedly she did not answer immediately but took a sip of the coffee i wouldnt say im frightened as much as worried miss sullivan doc savage said i have some questions id like to ask you about your brother leona sullivan frowned why are you interested she inquired im afraid that i have a weakness for the odd and the unusual miss sullivan she nodded i know you could have said you were interested because you are doc savage ive heard of you mr savage thats fine then you wont consider my interest so odd doc told her pleasantly id like to know a little more about gilmore miss sullivan i have heard enough to outline picture of him in my mind that of a welleducated young man on the scholarly side interested in geology what else do you want to know she countered i want you to fill in the picture of gilmore put color in she thought for a moment gilmore was a geologist he was a specialist dealing with the subterranean materials composing the earth and how they were formed she hesitated then added quickly he wasnt very practical i am afraid he was interested in caves natural caverns he would spend weeks exploring a new cave and often did was caveexploring gilmores profession doc asked you might call it that yes it doesnt sound profitable it wasnt leona sullivan told him but gilmore inherited a little money from father and he didnt spend much and he got along you do not sound as if you had a high opinion of your brothers specialty doc savage suggested she smiled faintly i cant say i did i dont like caves theyre clammy places and i quit going into them with gilmore when i was a little girl gilmore certainly didnt share my dislike gilmore spent a lot of time in cavern exploration i take it doc said yes more than was good for him she agreed after hesitating a moment why did you hesitate before saying that doc asked did i i didnt intend to it meant nothing she replied quickly i dont think you intended to hesitate either doc told her but i think it meant something she grimaced yes it did ill admit that and ill tell you why she fell silent biting her lips clenching her hands tightly then she blurted it isnt easy to discuss mental aberration in ones family its hard to do in fact you mean doc suggested quietly that gilmores mind became unstable yes thats exactly what i mean she murmured miserably as a result of spending too much time in cavern exploration she nodded quickly i cant think of anything else that would bring it on what doc asked was the exact nature of gilmores trouble hallucinations she replied of what sort leona sullivan started to speak jerked the words back and doc saw her compress her lips firmly i cant discuss such a personal matter with a stranger doc in a serious tone said not even if it might be vitally important to gilmores wellbeing no it couldnt be important anyway no i cant discuss his hallucinations in that case doc said i feel you should know that gilmore has disappeared again under very puzzling circumstances leona sullivan glanced at him sharply she leaned back in the chair and took a sip of coffee her hand was a bit steadier im afraid i dont know a thing that will help you was all she said doc savage jumped to his feet saying im sorry to have bothered you when you werent feeling well miss sullivan i dont mind she smiled wanly im glad youre trying to help poor gilmore thank you for that swinging to the door doc appeared to recall something and wheeled to ask did you get a good look at the man i introduced as mr wail yes i did he couldnt read much from her expression had you ever seen him before no she shook her head promptly no never then why did you faint when you saw wail doc threw at her or was it bill williams who brought that on the girl gave doc a cold look youre being utterly preposterous if i fainted it was only because i didnt feel well i see doc savage replied well if that is your story stick to it he rejoined the others to monks questioning look he answered miss sullivan says she never saw wail before in her life monk spun and collared wail who didnt look very surprised nor apprehensive all right wipe that smirk off your face and explain why you lied to us monk yelled in wails face youre certainly gullible wail told him you believe everything youre told dont you and that was all they got out of wail the manservant appeared bearing coffee and a tray of sandwiches explaining we dine rather late as a rule my wife thought you might get hungry before dinnertime are we invited to stay doc asked why i suppose so miss sullivan told my wife to prepare the guest rooms the servant explained its a long tiresome drive to the nearest hotel the tourist camps are all closed at this season of the year the sandwiches were good in the west a snowcovered mountaintop speared the sun and the long gray winter twilight set in they sat about all of them uncomfortable except mr wail who went after the sandwiches with the celerity of a glutton dropping crumbs off his chin now and then miss sullivan joined them wearing a long hostess gown of a shade of green which did a lot for her red hair and figure she was carrying a bulky scrapbook and she handed this to doc savage this is a scrapbook which i kept of articles mostly scientific ones which gilmore wrote and had published she explained i thought you might want to look them over doc savage examined the book for some time reading a number of the items some of them from beginning to end here was convincing evidence that gilmore sullivan knew his geology and his caves and he was evidently a pretty fair photographer as well judging from the color photographs of mineral samples and rock strata which accompanied a number of the pieces doc returned the book this indicates your brother knew his business miss sullivan he watched her intently saw she was not satisfied with his comment and with a trace of satisfaction he added but answering the question you had in mind when you handed me the book the writings dont sound like the work of a man who had anything basically wrong with his mind tears suddenly filled her eyes she murmured thank you and quickly left the room bill williams scowled at doc savage and growled why kid her she looks like a nice babe brother gilmore is as screwy as a pet coon and you know it linningen doesnt think so doc told him leona sullivan didnt rejoin them until dinnertime the manservant his name was clancy showed them over the lodge which proved to be a homy place that had cost a considerable sum clancy pointed out several spare sets of skis indicating they were welcome to use the boards if they cared for that winter sport doc gathered that it wouldnt grieve clancy too much if they went skiing and broke their necks clancys wife turned out an excellent dinner which was served at eight oclock in a large beamed dining room with candlelight and a blaze in the fireplace doc noted that leona sullivan hardly touched her food and he thought that several times her eyes were on him appealingly after dinner doc sought the girl out in the privacy of a glassedin veranda which gave a wide view of an impressive amount of bluecold moonlight and toobright stars miss sullivan doc told her quietly were here to help you you know ill admit that curiosity brought us but thats a motive that gets us into quite a few things he thought she wasnt going to reply and when she did the terror in her voice shocked him curiosity she gasped would you tell me curiosity about what sit down leona doc said gently ill tell you the whole story as much as we know of it the narrative took several minutes and doc included the finding of gilmore and the latters unwillingness to be rescued and his odd statements to linningen at the time he left out nothing in the way of incident but drew no conclusions and did not complete the recital because leona sullivan suddenly shuddered gripped her hands together she drew up pale and tense mr savage she gasped is there a hell what if there is a hell is it where theyve always said it is good lord doc said is hades down below she blurted underfoot yes doc took a moment to control his surprise im sure i couldnt say for certain he replied thats one place i havent visited as yet leona sullivan made a whimpering sound dont treat it facetiously she wailed im not and dont be so upset gilmore found hell she gasped he was exploring in a cave near here a tremendous cavern which he has been exploring on and off for several months gilmore was in the cave nearly two weeks and when he came out hehe had undergone a terrible change he said he had found hell was exactly where they have always said it was in the center of the earth and hed had a look at it doc reached for her hand oh come now miss sullivan no its true gilmore said take it easy doc broke in sympathetically you must understand that gilmore could have suffered a fall and an injury that would disarrange his mental processes you shouldnt really believe she jerked her hand away i hoped you wouldnt take a patronizing attitude she said bitterly really you dont expect me to believe mr savage she whimpered that mr wail he isnt human hes a an assistant devil sent up to dispose of gilmore because of what gilmore learned doc swallowed miss sullivan what you need is rest perhaps a bromide to make you sleep she twisted her hand flew up and cracked against his cheek then she turned and fled doc stood there his face blank a hand motionless against the cheek she had struck for quite a while vi monk mayfair doubled a hand into a great fist smashed it down on a knee and exploded of all the cockandbull stories this one is the winner it lays me out flat doc savage assumed a look of disapproval ham brooks said its a dilly all right its a honey monk added dont you believe in hell ham asked monk dont you feel there might be a tophet and a devil a little spot down below with brimstone heating and a host with a spike tail and horns monk sneered at him what are you trying to start i should think ham told him dryly that you would have given a little more thought to your future residence doc savage gestured impatiently dont start one of your rows now we have a job cut out for us here if we can only get our teeth into it id like to see you fellows concentrate on that instead of a private fuss the pair looked at doc in surprise you dont put stock in this hell stuff do you doc doc jumped to his feet lets deal with proven facts the ones in front of our nose first this one miss sullivan knows where her brother is monk and ham stared at him with open mouths and round eyes doc added gilmore isnt far away either i have a hunch how do you know monk demanded swallowing his surprise miss sullivan is a perfectly normal young woman who would show a normal anxiety about the welfare of a brother who had vanished several weeks ago and who had been found starving and freezing on an island isnt that right monk nodded yeah shes normal enough except about six times prettier than that but i dont see the tipoff doc told him was that she wasnt the least bit anxious about gilmore she didnt ask how he was not convincingly and she didnt show genuine surprise when told he had disappeared again gosh monk said exactly the logical explanation for her unconcern is that she already knew about it knew where gilmore was and that he was ok ham brooks frowned shes a mighty goodlooking liar and thats just what she is what do we do about this monk wanted to know you doc said dont do anything about it except this monk you shadow mr wail latch onto him dont let him make a move without your surveillance do i let him know im watching him monk demanded i dont care what wail knows doc exclaimed his feelings about it do not enter the picture i want him watched watch wail every minute keep your eyes on him got it right monk said ill clamp an eye on him right now he wheeled for the door wait if anything odd begins happening make plenty of uproar about it dont just stand there and let it happen monks expression became queer ok and monk dont take too lightly miss sullivans statement that wail isnt what he seems monk started then swallowed oh for cripes sake he said when youre kidding me why dont you use the tone of voice that goes with it because i might not be kidding doc replied grimly get on the job doc swung to ham brooks linningen and bill williams are your babies ham glue yourself to their backs watch everything count how many breaths they take if you have to ham said id rather count miss sullivans respiration never mind somebody should sort of watch her shouldnt they ham suggested hopefully shell be watched oh you thought of that already ham said in a crestfallen voice how do you want me to report in if i notice anything unusual report it doc told him the quickest and loudest way dont bother being subtle i have a feeling that if something breaks haste will be the watchword so dont blow any gentle bubbles about it ham grinned youre expecting action plenty of it doc said i think the stage is set the screech when it came had teeth like monstrous fangs and it bit into the calm cold night and punished it and shook it as a dog shakes a rat the quiet of the night died violently doc savage rolling out of the chair in which he had been sitting hit the floor uncertainly on all fours he remained there briefly not quite positive what had occurred not even positive of the shriek and most of all unwilling to credit the apparent fact that he had been asleep the shriek broke off and fell away like a great fragment broken from a cliff and falling into space there was silence and absolutely nothing in the silence there was the silence for long enough to show that it had been a very effective shriek one that had paralyzed the night and then an old hen began cackling in alarm in a nearby henhouse and in a moment at least fifty other hens joined her doc savage came to his feet now he did it by seizing a chair and thrusting himself upright and this the fact that he needed a chair seemed to confuse and puzzle him but not for long and he swung around and crossed the room and hit the door the door was locked he did not remember locking it but it was not a strong door and he hit it once with a shoulder and got through the hail was quiet enough no one had stirred in the house as far as he could tell there was a strange cavitylike silence with the hens cackling he saw the stuff on the floor the tiny patches of it that he had sprinkled in front of the doors of the bedrooms it was powder the grains of which would become very sticky when they absorbed a bit of moisture from the air the powder had the same basic ingredients with just a little variance in each type so that the fluorescence would have a different color the powder was stuff he had used often before and it should not have seemed as important to him as it did now he stared at it and could not think why it was so prominent in his mind there didnt seem to be a good reason it was just stuff that would stick to your shoes and a little would rub off as you walked during the next day or two the particles that rubbed off would be microscopic but with a good black light projector and preferably in darkness a trail would be left that could be followed also the trail could be photographed with the proper equipment if evidence was needed in court but it didnt seem vital now what counted was the scream now he got it clear the screech had been in monks voice doc wheeled and lunged toward monks room the room supposed to be occupied by monk and mr wail as a matteroffact and reaching the door he found it locked he struck the door four or five times with his fist hard blows and it was like hitting the head of a drum that had gone soft back of him a door opened and he wheeled at the sound and saw linningen the psychiatrist standing there in the open door linningen seemed to weave slightly in a dazed fashion and he kept blinking what is the difficulty linningen asked in a voice that somehow did not seem his own you hear that yell linningen i something awakened me where did it come from linningen stared blankly i havent the least idea where has everyone gone whats up doc stared at linningen ham brooks and bill williams were supposed to be sharing linningens large room isnt ham brooks in there doc demanded no he and williams are gone i dont know where they went or how they did it without arousing me im a light sleeper doc lunging past him into the room said look for signs of a struggle struggle linningen repeated in a foolish tone why there couldnt have been the least sort of commotion or it would have awakened me they could have taken the house apart around you doc told him grimly youve been doped man it shows all over you doped i was fed something at dinner linningen asked blankly i dont know when you were fed it doc snapped but it was a pretty slick job because they got me and i was looking for it the room clearly bore no sign of a struggle however and doc savage with monks howl again on his mind raced back into the hall he was about to strike monks door when it opened and the chemist shuffled out you yelled doc demanded monk batted his eyes owlishly held the palm of his hand up in front of his nose and examined it suddenly rubbed the palm violently over his face a yell he said you call that a mere yell why that was the most noise ive made in years i tried to shake the house down why id uhrather not say monk mumbled doc lunged past monk saw that mr wail was sitting upright in bed staring in alarm and asked what made monk shout shout said wail bitterly you can refer to such a noise as a shout i can assure you that no man ever uttered a worse squawk on finding he had been assigned to hell and i have listened to some excellent efforts in my time you dont know what upset monk i have no idea although he might have chanced to get a look at his own face in a mirror that might do it wail said he awakened you wail nodded awakened me and made me a paralytic and a nervous wreck at the same time doc savage swung on monk all right monk out with it you didnt sound off like that without a good reason monk was rubbing his face and pinching his cheek ive been doped he said ive been fed something to make me sleep along with the rest of us doc said why did you let loose the howl monk wouldnt meet docs eyes do i hafta tell you doc yes hurry it up too monk took a deep breath then spoke rapidly in a tone of knowing he wouldnt be believed he said i saw a devil floating around the room i couldnt describe him exactly except that he didnt have the customary forked tail and horns but he was a devil there wasnt a bit of doubt in my mind that he was a devil doc asked dryly how in gods name do you recognize a devil as such if you didnt see enough of him for a description when you see a devil monk said sheepishly you just know hes the devil you dont need a description take it from an old boy who just saw one doc gestured impatiently all right now youve described your sensations what actually happened where did this demon go when i yell like that i close my eyes monk said somewhat guiltily after i got the whoop out my visitor was gone thats all i know doc savage noted that mr wail was pale and pasty and the mans chubby hands were twitching wail what is the matter with you doc demanded theyve sent one of the boys to check on me mr wail said gloomily one of the boys wail jerked a thumb downward from down below they probably think i havent been doing my best to tell the truth i havent monk emitted a howl of anger you and your talk about devils monk bellowed damn you thats what caused me to have a nightmare like i had dreaming i saw old nick walking around in here its your fault you didnt see the head boy wail told him with an air of certainty you wouldnt be standing there unscorched jumping up and down like an ape if the head rascal had paid you a visit oh shut up before i flatten your nose monk bellowed at him monk get control of yourself doc said you think it was a nightmare sure it was somebody did dope me though because i can tell ham is gone doc broke in tell from the way i feel it was a barbiturate or some monks mouth remained open a moment ham isnt here whats that neither is williams doc said mr wail showed considerable excitement williams is gone too he shouted if that fool amateur knew what he was monkeying with he wouldnt be so persistent the silly loon i thought id taught him a lesson what lesson doc demanded when i caused him to start to paddle out into the tide rip said mr wail leering and a few other little things that i caused him to do that he didnt tell you about deviltry you mean doc asked dryly thats right what doc inquired do you think williams is doing and where is he right now mr wail snorted find that out for yourself monk debated between belaboring wail with a fist and investigating to see whether ham brooks and williams were really gone the latter won and he rushed into the hall a moment later he was bellowing miss sullivan shes gone too this proved true leona sullivans room was empty now the manservant clancy came from the rear of the lodge bearing a doublebarreled shotgun and a flashlight he was trailed by his wife who had a rifle their faces were anything but peaceful master gilmore is gone clancy croaked doc took a step forward whats that gilmore is we hurried out to see if gilmore was being molested we heard a shriek clancy explained excitedly gilmore is gone im afraid there was violence his voice had risen to near incoherence gilmore has been here iyes how long since this morning he came in haste and we hid him because he did not want anyone to know he was here clancy his wife snapped youre talking too much youre not supposed to tell about gilmore oh hell clancy snapped im tired of these goingson that nobody can understand ill talk if i want to doc demanded didnt gilmore tell a story to explain his long absence clancy shook his head he didnt tell any story and i wasnt a bit surprised gilmore is a nice boy but hes as nutty as a fruitcake clancy his wife exclaimed i dont care clancy told her hes crazy and hes not the only crazy one around here and if all this doesnt stop you and i are going to hunt a new job doc asked quickly will you show us where gilmore was hiding no he wont clancys wife snapped yes i will clancy said i dont care what happens im sick of mystery talk about devils and goingson i want to stop it and i figure mr savage is the man who can stop it ive heard about you mr savage doc told monk get your blacklight scanner ill get mine clancy paying no attention to further objections by his wife led them about two hundred yards up the mountainside to a stoneandlog structure that at first seemed to be a guest cabin but which clancy said was rented out every summer gilmore was holed up here clancy explained from the window you can see the trail to the lodge and theres practically no other way to get up here you can come down from the other side down the mountain trail of course but its a roundabout way and you can see that route from the window too theres a back door so what do you find doc demanded of monk the latter had been casting the beam of his ultraviolet light projector about experimentally you sprinkled that tracer stuff where everyone would walk in it monk exclaimed wheeling to turn the beam on his own footprints which glowed a rather evil shade of green mixed with a reddish cast poke around with that scanner and see what colors you get doc told him thatll tell us who was here lets not waste time they cast the beam of light about calling out colors as they distinguished them monk found another shade of green doc located a yellowpurple and a blue williams brought ham brooks and miss sullivan here doc said interpreting the findings they picked up gilmore sullivan presumably williams did that by force probably with the threat of a gun and they departed on the trail that climbs the mountain clancy had been a skeptical onlooker that sounds like tall guesswork to me no its probably close to what happened doc told him ham brooks and miss sullivan walked close together in approaching the cabin they stopped in one place while williams moved over to a window then came back after this they all entered ham and leona then stood in one spot while williams did the moving about that indicates he probably had a gun and was making them stand still and from the places williams walked it is pretty clear he aroused gilmore sullivan from sleep on that bunk yonder and forced him to accompany them we have of course no record of gilmores footprints aw nuts clancy said unbelievingly how come theyre leaving footprints substances in the bedrooms they occupied and they walked in it and now they leave prints which become conspicuous under black light doc explained i dont believe it clancy said youre a hard guy to convince monk told him if you had been around here the last six months clancy said you would be a hard guy to convince too what do you mean by that monk asked clancy warned clancys wife clancy said for six months or almost that gilmores been sure a devil was chasing him not a fullfledged devil but a juniorgrade one of some sort who didnt have full devil powers lately miss leona has started believing it was a fact now i ask you we have heard all that clancy doc told him why are you repeating it i was just going to ask you how a man could believe anything around here clancy said with such goingson my god everybody has jumped the trolley doc shrugged a little skepticism keeps a man on solid ground clancy too much of it keeps him from realizing when hes undermined come on everybody lets see where the trail leads the moon had dropped out of sight but there was some bluish cold light from stars they managed the steep narrow trail with difficulty the footprints were quite obvious except at times when there was some fluorescence by minerals in the earth or stones underfoot to confuse them the tracks turn off here monk exclaimed suddenly he thrust into the bushes using the white beam of his regular flashlight hey heres a side trail they took it ye gods theyre going to gilmores cavern clancy exploded leona told me about this cavern of gilmores doc said so its up this way is it pretty close not moren a quarter of a mile said clancy i understand gilmore spent a lot of time the last few years exploring this cave so it must be a large one i guess its a big one all right youve been in it not me well about ten feet clancy admitted hurriedly me im no caveman i keep wondering what if the roof fell in on me they continued the climb and came eventually to a heavy wooden door that closed an aperture in the stone that the cavern entrance thats it clancy replied and they went in didnt they mr wail burst out in a shrill voice im getting out of here grab him monk doc ordered vii a few red fingers of dawn were thrusting upward in the eastern sky the cave entrance was high affording a view of the valley which was now floored with cottonlike fog presently monk mayfair returned panting from the lodge heres the stuff you wanted doc he said you brought the rope the gadget case the generating flashlights and sandwiches and water doc demanded yep all of it why you wanted grub enough for a week i cant imagine i dont plan to stay in nobody s cave a week me neither declared clancy vehemently clancy youre not even going in there his wife told him clancy nodded my idea exactly if i can make it stick he looked up at doc savage anxiously you seem to suspect everybody around here mr savage and i cant say i blame you we did hide out poor gilmore pretending we didnt know he was here but what about it do i have to go cave crawling i sure dont hanker after the idea youd like to stay outside is that it doc savage asked didnt i make myself clear doc eyed him intently you have some plans i take it not any you would object to if youre on the upand up clancy said indeed clancy said grimly im going to call the state police thats my plan good for you clancy you do that doc said whew you mean i dont have to go in there not if you call the police ill see that he does mr savage clancys wife said emphatically doc approached the wooden door listened heard nothing suspicious and wrenched the door open nothing happened he tossed a rock inside it clicked against stone magnified echoes returned and there was silence monk are you ready to go in doc asked no monk replied but im as ready as ill probably ever be you want me to go first tie one end of the rope to mr wail and well let him lead the way like a bloodhound doc said dryly does that meet your approval wail wail sneered youll wish you hadnt done this youll wish it more than you ever wished anything in your life lead on wail doc ordered curtly leona sullivan and my friend ham brooks are in there somewhere if you think were not going to help them youre crazy to enter the cavern mouth was a nervewracking thing the entrance was narrow even the pallid icy moonlight must have been a background that silhouetted them and it was a perfect spot for an ambush but they passed inside and traversed about forty feet without contact with any physical danger when doc was inclined to halt mr wail gave the rope an impatient jerk saying come on come on nothing is going to bother you yet doc gave the rope a wrench of his own hauling wail back on his heels i take it youve been this way before doc said did i say differently no i chased gilmore sullivan all over this place mr wail said and believe me it was some job not a very successful one either or i wouldnt be here now doc said dryly were to understand that you didnt catch gilmore i caught him all right several times but it didnt do me much good i couldnt handle him all in one batch and he got to the exit and escaped before i got him worn down to my size youre frank anyway doc told him an unusual sort of frankness too the kind that can get you into trouble wail snorted you havent any trouble that will compare with the doses of it ive already had in fact speaking as a lad who has had quite a sojourn in hades i can say that when you threaten me with trouble youre being pretty damn childish monk put in grimly tell me this wail how are your physical senses do you feel pain unfortunately my body for the time being is as human as yours then monk said if i gave you a good kick on the fantail deck you would feel it now if you dont shut up about this tophet stuff thats what youre going to get worry you do i wail asked you irritate me anyway thats right you probably havent brains enough to be worried worry is the exclusive burden of the intelligent mind monk said oh dry up and lets listen the footprints show miss sullivan ham williams and probably gilmore sullivan entered here this place cant be so big and we may be able to hear them itll surprise you how big this place is wail said their straining ears caught no sound not even the dripping of water doc noted and he reflected that it was evidently a dry cave at this level there was a pronounced flow of air against their faces and it was freighted with a faint and not distasteful odor odd odor linningen commented it was practically the first word the psychiatrist had spoken what asked wail curiously would you say the odor was linningen pondered in the darkness it has a flowery quality he remarked i would say if i were outside that there were flowers some distance away but in here i presume it means the presence of some sort of subterranean plant life or possibly a reaction of chemical nature between the content of rock strata and moisture wail seemed to consider this funny he burst into a cackling roar of hilarity the sound of his laughter rose and tumbled away hit the walls and interstices the cavern and came gobbling back with a tremulous labyrinthine overtone that gave it a demoniacal glee the laughter kept up and doc savage suddenly unnerved by the satanical reverberations of the mirth gave wail a hard poke in the ribs with his thumb that stopped the unholy yakking lead on doc said monk you fall back about fifty feet with linningen better just keep us in sight in case there is an ambush that way we will not all be trapped and use your flashlights sparingly flowers wail exclaimed giggling can you beat that the boys in the outer room would think that very funny the way led downward doc savage played his flashlight beam on the walls took note that the strata was not unusual being typical of the caves which were a tourist attraction in new york state and parts of new england like practically all such subterranean labyrinths from mammoth cave to carlsbad caverns the two bestpublicized natural caves it was the work of time and seepage water against rock strata that was either soluble or softer than the surrounding stone one fact became evident at least one person in the party they were following knew where he was going there being no trail progress was vastly a different matter from strolling along a prepared route inspecting the wonders of such a cavern as carlsbad this one was far from being as large as carlsbad and for the time being there were no stalagmites or stalactites jagged patterns in the stone however often bore a resemblance to the stone icicles the rate of descent was astonishing more and more frequently there were declines where they had to slide for yards where the return trip would not be easy monk called nervously from some distance back doc is there much danger of this fluorescein stuff fading so we cant find our way back out by following the trail it makes not much doc said but pick up loose stones whenever you find them and make cairns ok but there arent many loose stones several times they halted to rest now the silence came to their attention the utter and complete silence of a tomb and coupled with the darkness which was absolutely complete when their flashlights were extinguished it was an unnerving experience monk began clicking two small rocks together during the rest periods working out a signal code based on morse and doc savage after his initial feeling that the act was childish welcomed the little sounds that broke the silence after that he replied to monk consulting his watch doc was astonished to find they had been engaged in the descent into the entrails of the earth for nearly six hours time had passed rapidly and he called a halt for lunch you better go easy on your stock of food wail said contemptuously youve got farther to go than you think weve come quite a distance already doc remarked a couple of miles wail said no more than that we must be making at least two miles an hour and weve been at it six hours i meant straight down wail said oh doc was impressed in spite of himself wail was probably right at that how much farther would you say well have to go before overtaking williams and his prisoners doc inquired this drew no answer although wail had been quite willing to talk up until now turning the light of his flash on wails cherubic but somehow evil face doc saw with astonishment that wail looked greatly worried well doc said sharply havent you a guess as to how much farther youve been mighty positive about everything until now if i knew for sure how much brass this guy williams packs i would have a better idea of what to expect wail replied by brass do you mean rank thats it wail said if hes a junior grade imp like myself we havent much to fear i mean you can cope with these fellows who rate as about ninetyninth assistant devil but if the chap has more rank your goose is cooked and in a moment wail added gloomily and so is mine if you and williams are fraternal brothers theres probably no cause for you to be alarmed doc said dryly wail groaned what kind of place do you think hell is its full of devils and they keep in practice with their work by deviling each other doc chuckled in spite of himself practice makes perfect eh wail became resentful its not amusing i can tell you it isnt a pleasant place you dont sound as if you liked it down there i sure didnt wail declared vehemently id have liked it less only i arrived with a pretty good record then wail added thoughtfully i got in about a hundred and seventy years ago when the entrance requirements were stiffer oh you died a hundred and seventy years ago thats right to be exact wail sighed a bunch of colonials were chasing me with the notion of hanging me and my horse stumbled and i fell off and broke my neck i wish theyd hanged me because it would have looked better on my record maybe i could have made better rank than junior grade devil by now but you say you arrived pretty well equipped with entrance credentials doc prompted well right fairish wail admitted i was quite a scoundrel if i do say so myself i looted a bank married seven wives financed some piracy expeditions and sailed on one myself although pirating was a rougher business than i liked he sighed we had rugged times back in those days but nothing compared to chaps like genghis khan and a couple of the caesars and napoleon oh you met them down there wail sniffed no of course not do you think a fellow could circulate and meet all the guests in hell in a mere hundred and seventy years but ive heard they were there and hold pretty good ratings but you didnt like it youre darn tooting i didnt wail said gloomily thats why i sort of laid down on the job of catching up with gilmore sullivan and fetching him back the object hasnt been to kill gilmore no of course not that would be worse than his staying alive on earth although that wouldnt be good either he would be sure to pass around information about our place down there and people would find out about conditions in the future and it would make the deviling business tougher a lot of people dont believe theres a hell that makes our job easier and if gilmore died oh hed go packing his information off in the other direction that would he bad for our side you see gilmore sullivan got a good look at our layout and hed have firsthand information to pass along how doc asked did gilmore happen to get this look at your place you remember a slight earthquake shock about six or eight months ago wail asked there was something in the newspapers about one yes well it opened a crack wail said gilmore sullivan was down about fifteen miles exploring and he came across the crack and peeked through you can imagine how he felt and how quick he got out of there i was despatched to bring him back not because i was a qualified devil being only juniorgrade but because i was the handiest man at the time only fifteen miles down doc inquired yeah they been enlarging down there and i guess they carelessly pushed out too close to the surface how about the crack it still open doc asked why do you want to have a look i dont believe i would care too much about that doc replied solemnly youre wise well about the crack theyve got a bunch of apprentices busy closing it up but i understand its going slow working like the devil eh well theyre in there trying wail said monk mayfair in a mixture of plaintive rage and terror called cut out that line of kidding will you you may think its an amusing pastime but i dont not in a place like this so he thinks its kidding no less mr wail murmured and sniffed viii the nature of the cavern underwent a change as they descended growing somewhat in proportions becoming more precipitous not unpleasant the air taking on a different and more pungent quality the strange blossomlike odor they had noted earlier becoming more pronounced at length alarmed by the growing pungency of the aroma doc savage stopped and used some materials from the equipment case he had been carrying a few chemicals capable of making a fairly accurate analysis of almost any substance to examine the air for dangerous gas monks party joined him for this and stood watching tense and poised as if momentarily expecting that the intense silence which had become a ponderous force against their peace of mind would explode or in some other way become a danger the analysis having shown nothing dangerous not even what the odor was they resumed the descent in the same manner as before doc savage and wail leading monk and linningen trailing a precautionary distance to the rear doc still kept the rope end fastened to wail giving the man twenty feet or so of play which seemed ample wail had not objected and in fact it was a good safety measure because the way was becoming increasingly trying suddenly things began happening the rope which doc had been keeping snug did not respond with the proper feel when doc tugged it lunging forward doc found that wail had adroitly slipped the rope and secured it to a rocky stalactite numbers of which were to be found around them wail doc rapped and dashed the beam of his flashlight about monk yelled anxiously what is it doc an ambush you need help at that moment doc caught a flicker of expensive gray coattails vanishing in a thin forest of stone pillars he sprang forward wails escaping doc shouted over his shoulder to monk you and linningen stay where you are dont leave the trail weve been following you might never find it again monk howled that he understood and added an imprecation directed at mr wail doc himself had an opinion of wail at the moment more respectful the man was fleet faster than doc believed such chubbiness would have permitted however they were on good firm footing as his flashlight disclosed then it came to him how incredible it was that wail could make such speed in blackest darkness wail had no flashlight yet the man was making respectable time and doing it almost without sound angered by wails performance disgusted by his own gullibility in being duped by the rope tied to the stone even though that had been for only a few moments doc made better speed himself than he would have conceded he could make the chase went on and on wail managed to keep tantalizingly out of reach although he seemed to be losing his lead doc fell twice finally when wail began to change course doc gained confidence he used the blacklight generator continually now pumping the generator handle with his fingers it like their flashlights was generatordriven so the problem of batteries that would exhaust themselves was not a plague they must have covered doc reflected at least two miles of labyrinthine caverns before he got close enough to chance a lunge at wail to his disgust his fingertips merely gave wails expensive suit a futile rake the nearcapture stimulated wail to greater speed and he drew slightly ahead and now doc began to believe and condemned himself for being fool enough to think so that wail in some fashion could make his own illumination that incredibly there was a kind of luminous aura about the fat little scoundrel wail in a voice more of anger than terror shouted youd better go back savage that doc retorted putting on a burst of speed would be a fine break for you now that youre about to be caught wail responded by spinning around a stalagmite so that doc momentarily lost trace of him a scraping sound a small noise with frenzy in it drew doc ahead and he came to a narrow fissure which slashed into the stone about fortyfive degrees from the vertical and which seemed to extend endlessly wail was squirming along the fissure standing upright moving sidewise doc followed for the next several minutes each man put everything into effort and as the fissure narrowed he fastened his hands into wails coat a stifled shriek came from wail the man exerted himself tremendously there must have been a crevice because he pushed ahead literally dragging doc savage and then suddenly wail was out of the crevice into a larger chamber beyond and out of his coat too carrying wails garment doc sprinted after the man there seemed to be light here a phosphorescentlike illumination of greenishpurple nature at least doc was able to see wail and presently he hurled wails coat the garment entangled the chubby mans feet and the latter fell headlong doc landed astride him wail was limp and very still for a long time and when finally he spoke it was to say damn you this was in the bitterest of tones i didnt think you had it in you to give me a chase like that doc told him tiredly damn you wail repeated acidly if it hadnt been for your nagging i would never have come back here i dont think i would have had to i could have coped with that williams he didnt have full powers either i dont think he ranks any higher than i do doc said so youre still keeping up that pretense pretense look around you wail blurted warily suspecting a trick doc glanced about he had been conscious of the strangely unholy purplish illumination now its abnormality and downright impossibility hit him a full blow not impossibility exactly because there was indeed luminance what makes the light he demanded of wail sneeringly the fat man retorted nuts to you from now on youre going to have too many questions for me to bother answering you remember that crevice we just squeezed through well thats the one the earthquake opened the one gilmore sullivan found then doc caught himself cut it out wail ive had enough of this hades stuff oh you have have you asked wail just where do you think you are anyway doc more at a loss for a reply than he would have liked to admit countered with a question what goes on here some kind of secret mining operation are they mining atomic fission materials wail refused to answer doc rolled him over lashed the mans hands securely took turns of the rope around the chubby body and retained the rope end as before this time he said you wont slip out of it so easily its too late wail said just look around i intend to do so this alarmed wail and he gasped no no you can still escape maybe one thing sure you can head off williams and the girl and her brother you seem sure williams and his prisoners havent reached here yet doc remarked of course they havent we circled around them on the way down well see doc jerked wail to his feet returned to the mouth of the fissure and used his blacklight projector he didnt find traces of the williams party there was no sign of fluorescing footprints no no please wail croaked when doc turned away from the fissure go back ill even show you the way shut up doc said were going to learn what goes on here he advanced a step at a time patting his pockets to make sure that a halfdozen small highexplosive grenades he had placed there earlier were safe wail was almost a dead weight and he had to push and drag the man along he kept the flashlight ready but there was no real need of it the grim and inexplicable glow that seemed to pervade everywhere furnished at least adequate light for walking although it was impossible to see a distance of more than a few yards harsh premonition of impending evil wrapped a clammy sensation about him but doc savage went steadily ahead for he was a man who while taking every precaution against any logical danger was not inclined to permit mere forebodings to stay him he was familiar with danger he had walked its path many times before and he believed that care and a reasonable amount of discretion plus the right kind of action at the right time was ample armor however he was not prepared for the whispering sound he presently heard he stopped arrested by the note for it was not vocal nor even human but it had a multitudinous quality and seemed to come from many directions at once then his eye caught movement over to his right and he tensed faced that direction making out a dim shapeless object or substance that seemed to have nothing in the way of reality except motion doc was a brave man but his skin broke into gooseflesh and revulsion jerked at his stomach as he perceived that a grim uncanny shape was taking form so great was the horror created in him that he stood rooted paralyzed the instinct to flee beating in futile weakness against the frozen coldness terror if it were that which held him motionless the shape became a mass formless and gibbous and evil it had movement and body but little else that seemed natural it had no arms no legs it was headless and leathery with a sour gray color that shed the ugly purplishgreen light with a skulllike sheen it came toward him lurching rolling so that he could not actually tell how it progressed there was some odor not the flowery one but a dead scent of lifelessness and emptiness why i saw the thing earlier and mistook it for a large boulder he thought and it isnt alone electrified by the last thought and struck by premonition he whirled to see a towering mass flying at him too close upon him to be avoided so violent was the impact with which the thing struck doc savage that he was driven reeling knocked breathless stunned the flashlight flew from his grasp it seemed utterly unimportant that he carried a spare he was down and the forms were lunging for him wail shrieked now terror choked the outcry down to a small thing such as a mouse would make and wail wheeled and went flying away ignored by the creatures which were assaulting doc savage but in no way reassured by that the weird assailant proceeded to attack by falling forward upon doc savage as soon as he understood that doc moved with frenzied speed and was partially successful in evading the attack only his right foot being caught but the weight of the thing was terrific the pain in his foot a splintering agony forcing him to cry out doc gave the attacker a savage kick with his free foot which was the wrong thing to do because it was like kicking solid stone he wrenched wildly sure his foot would never come free of that great weight then it did and he stumbled backward gaining his feet hardly able to use the foot he ran though as he had never run before and he kept presence of mind enough to combine flight with pursuit of wail sooner than he expected he saw wail and realized that utter terror had rendered the man incapable of doing his best but wail was still traveling a respectable pace turning his head doc saw there was pursuit there seemed to be dozens of the shapeless objects all bobbing along an occasional one losing balance and tumbling headlong but seeming to keep coming even while falling doc whipped a hand to a pocket located one of the explosive grenades and plucked out the firing mechanism then hurled it excitement caused him to throw the grenade much too hard it traveled well over the pursuers and landed and exploded at least ten yards behind them the explosion split his eardrums filled the cavern with bluewhite blast flame and cataclysmic noise it had a surprising effect on the pursuers as well setting them into utter confusion so that they moved this way and that bumping together with hard stony sounds and milling senselessly doc overtook wail the fat man was lying prone where he had been sent either by a tumble or by the blast force jerking wail to his feet doc demanded what are those things why did they attack me wail his words a gabble of hysteria said it wouldnt help if i told you youre believing nothing i say dont quibble doc said angrily come on lets have an explanation wail drew in a sobbing breath theyre inmates theyre sinners cut it out doc snapped theyre some kind of mechanisms disguised as boulders isnt that it wail said thats childish and you know it theyre stones all right theyre stones and they can move but they cant ever escape being stones and you dont call that childish not when youre in the outskirts of hades wail replied grimly and brother thats where you are this is only a mild sample of what its like down in the main area driven beyond patience doc lifted a fist to strike the man but the pointlessness of that stayed him wail was as terrified as man or minor devil could get it occurred to doc if wail wouldnt talk sensibly now he never would get moving doc gave him a shove the crevice is over yonder oh now youre willing to leave wail snapped yes we can come back later with better equipment once you get out of here wail said youll never come back not that youll get out doc shoved him violently they began to walk carefully and warily through the evil semiglow there were now an incredible number of boulders around them and docs apprehension ran high until they came abruptly to an end of the stones and doc released his breath in relief pleasure was shortlived however because they were confronted by a forest of what he took to be some kind of freak trees capable of growth in the cavern they pushed forward squeezing between the trunks of the trees which were either purplish in color or so tinted by the lighting the tree trunks were spongy to the touch like toadstools and doc soon found that he could force them apart by main strength whenever they became too thick to permit ready passage let me set the course he told wail when the latter seemed inclined to veer to the right we could get lost in here whats the difference youll never get out wail muttered seizing wail doc flung him forward jamming him through openings between the weird trunks when the way became tight doc flung a shoulder against the tree nearest at hand forcing it to bend and instantly there was a vicious hissing sound from the tree the thing moved he felt a clutching slimy tentaclelike thing around his ankle docs first thought was that they had disturbed a serpent of some kind the idea that followed swiftly was that no snake even a boa could have such spongy softness then another tentacle fell upon him and another he struck out wildly in the midst of his struggle he heard wail howling and turned his head to discover the man was also being enveloped doc swung back to strike out again at the clammy attackers but his arm was seized a tentacle slid around this throat ropelike soft and yet strong he endeavored to kick out sought to use his arms im caught helpless he thought my god what are these things can this really be hell a moment later he was dragged down the spongy arms covered his face his mouth and then he could no longer breathe ix monk mayfair and dr linningen after doc savage had left them to go in pursuit of mr wail did not remain where they were for long it was monks idea that they push ahead on the main purpose of the expedition which was freeing the sullivans from bill williams docll catch that wail guy in no time at all monk stated he can retrace his way to this spot by the footprints wail is making so i cant see that were needed here lets get along im game linningen said in a tone which denied that he was very enthusiastic youve got quite a bit of nerve monk told him approvingly dont get the idea im not scared linningen said i dont care for this cavecrawling myself monk said lets whip it up the sooner we overtake williams the sooner gooses are going to be cooked they traveled rapidly running whenever they could monk was inclined to be more reckless than doc savage so that he took more chances with the precipitous going linningen a spry man managed to keep up although his nerves began to fray take it easier linningen blurted finally i dont like the idea of getting killed in a fall not this close to tophet anyway eh monk chuckled hollowly linningen breathed heavily traveled in silence and presently asked you still take no stock in the hades story now dont start that on me monk growled hastily it was bad enough listening to that guy wail but you dont believe a word of it is that right thats right monk said how linningen asked do you account for the several strange things that happened wails presence on the yacht in the cabin where gilmore sullivan should have been williams paddling out into the tide rip the accidents that nearly befell me and the other incidents monk spoke rapidly hed clearly prepared the answers earlier for his own reassurance wail told how he got out to the yacht in a rented boat gilmore left the same way it just happened nobody saw either of them as for williams and the tide rip we know now that williams is not on the upandup and he was trying to build up this devil story thats why he paddled out into the tide he and wail are probably in cahoots in this thing oh you think theres a plot underway dont you i confess i cant figure it out linningen admitted do you feel theyre after something something in this cave perhaps i wouldnt be surprised what for instance an ore deposit down here maybe you know yourself that there could be maybe gold maybe something more practical like tin or a pitchblende deposit i hope youre right linningen said fervently i better be right monk said because if it should turn out that this wail put it straight im going to be a little upset linningen chuckled bitterly think of the problem we would have when we got outside and tried to make ourselves believed i was thinking of that monk said lets stop do you hear anything they stood there listening until their ears began the strange ringing that seems to be the human ears response to silence that is too utter then they caught from ahead and far below in the blackness a clatter presently it was repeated thats either williams and his prisoners or doc monk said lets not stand here they proceeded on with all the speed they could make and still maintain caution monk wrapped a handkerchief about the lens of his flashlight to cut down the display of light to that barely necessary there came a moment when linningen seized monks shoulder thereby startling monk nearly out of his skin and blurted look its williams far below outlined clearly by a splash of light they could see williams moving driving two figures ahead of him gilmore and the girl are still ok monk breathed see williams is keeping a gun on them the way doc had it figured come on said linningen grimly lets overtake them end it or get ended ourselves and backtrack out of here ive had my caverning for today monk hurried forward drawing his pistol he did not share doc savages feeling that a firearm was a source of trouble and a crutch which a man should not come to depend upon and whereas doc never carried a gun monk went armed with a type of machine pistol which he and renny renwick the engineer of their organization had developed for their own use the gun could get rid of an astonishing number of cartridges in a few moments and handle a variety of missiles explosives armorpiercing socalled mercy bullets gas pellets thermite slugs for melting metal and incendiary purposes as it developed monk would have done better to keep his hands unimpeded because suddenly and at exactly the wrong moment his feet slipped on a slimy chute of stone the underpinning shot from under him and down he went he slid several yards with all the stealth of an unloaded truckful of brick worse in the pawing for security he didnt know what kind of an abyss he might slide off into in the darkness he lost the machine pistol smashing against a solid bottom finally he lay gasping then there was an earsmacking crash the noise of a gun exploding the bullet hit very close the lead splashed and went into monks cheek skin like needles he howled and rolled frantically in the wrong direction too because suddenly he saw williams standing a few feet away and drawing a deliberate aim on him then williams barked in pain and the rifle was smashed from his clutch linningen from above had hurled a large stone with wonderful aim wondering where williams had got the rifle monk dived at the man williams gave up an attempt to retrieve the gun swung a shoulder and met monks charge with a straightarm that was very good football driven aside monk managed to kick the rifle which no doubt williams must have found around the ledge or perhaps in gilmores possession damn you williams monk said and reversed the rifle as a club williams instantly wheeled fled the darkness swallowed him monk yelled stop ill shoot you williams damned if i wont williams kept going monk taking no time to aim fired the rifle and was presented with one of the lucky escapes of his lifetime because the rifle barrel had been bent or more likely cave slime jammed into the bore so that the whole breech went out and violently williams went on faster if anything monk be careful for gods sake be careful a male voice evidently belonging to gilmore sullivan shrieked from nearby already lunging after williams monk shouted is leona ok the voice said she was it added careful of williams hes a devil which statement considering the circumstances meant more to monk than it would normally have conveyed gilmore sullivans voice had the thin weary desperate quality of a loose fiddle string monk imagined him as a collection of bones held together by a few threads of hopelessness that was come to think of it about the way he had been described by linningen the man who had found him on the rock in the sea the chase lacked nothing in feverish effort monk had much the same experience as doc savage earlier his quarry began showing signs of speed and endurance beyond the human in monks case however astonishment was not as intense because he recalled hearing williams had been a former football notable williams a noted football man who says so monk thought wildly monk himself was a sports fan one of the breed who read all the records and can quote from them for twenty years back i dont remember any guy of his description williams had held forth to be a radio commentator in the sports field as wellon what station i never heard of him monk got no further with his mental inspection of williams two things made a sudden appearance to black his mind of anything but action and terror first there was the sudden feeling that williams didnt need any light that the fellow could move full speed through the blackest of stygian murk without illumination before that could fully develop in monks head williams popped into a narrow crevice that slanted somewhat from the vertical and disappeared plunging into the crack after williams monk found himself in an unnerving position he was a sitting duck in case williams had another gun and chose to use it williams would certainly choose the fact he didnt cut loose now seemed proof he didnt have another and there was monks claustrophobia monks revulsion against tight places applied particularly to stone now squirming sidewise through a crevice which seemed to be narrowing monk began to have the ghastly conviction that the stone several billions of tons of it was slowly sliding together to close the crack the fact that the inroad of terror immediately made his apish body swell was no help finally he wedged helplessly and had to sink his teeth in his tongue to keep from bawling in an agony of frustrated terror this happened about twentyfive feet from the far end of the crevice and williams completing the passage immediately pounded on a loose stone and hurled it into the slit in an effort to brain monk the hardthrown rock was a blessing monk badly needed it hit his head laid open his scalp kayoed him for a moment the brief unconsciousness forced his body to relax thus loosened he became free in the crevice and sagged also dazed rage replaced terror so he did not tighten his muscles until he had scrambled out of the thin passage williams ran howling incoherently the roaring was characteristic of monk when violently aroused monk pursued him the cavern gave a weirdly different impression now there was a feeling of vast space without there really being space there were columns passages weirdly meandering tunnels a vile pale glowyellow it seemed to monk although there was later argument about that gave some illumination the tangle of stone increased became labyrinthine unreal it was exactly like a forest it was a forest monk suddenly concluded the stuff around him was not stone but felt spongy and nasty to his touch it was moving swaying writhing the things about him seemed to be clutching at him now monk did what he had been planning to do as a last resort hauled out one of docs explosive grenades and pulled the pin and got rid of it he threw the metal pellet carefully sending it through an opening in the impossible thicket of slimy clutching objects the grenade exploded about thirty feet distant sheeting flame noise then an odor sickening and weird a smell that monk knew instinctively to be the scent of fear and then silence utter stillness and motionlessness and monk who had been knocked off his feet by the blast chanced to touch one of the treelike forms that had been slimy and spongy and now it was as hard as stone there was a voice doc savages voice shouting monk where are you damned if i know where i am monk croaked it beats me did you come in through that crevice yeah get back to it fast monk said williams is in here somewhere theres some kind of treesized weeds or something that grab at you and i threw a grenade and and youll never get out of here unless you move fast run you idiot doc interrupted monk got into motion wheeled and ran in the direction of docs voice he saw the bronze man presently doc was running also and they sprinted in silence to the crevice doc said that crack is a tight fit but try not to kill any time getting through i dont plan to monk told him and he stretched his arms above his head and began to sidle through the crevice with more speed than he had imagined possible doc savage following close behind monk said it was a good thing you used that grenade it saved things for me it didnt do me any harm either monk assured him something was closing in on me in there and the explosion i think it was really the flash of flame put a stop to it a scrambling and whimpering came from behind them doc turning his head decided that mr wail was following through the crevice wail made good speed he was on docs heels when they finished negotiating the narrow passage i dont like this place wail gasped lets get out of here which could well be doc reflected the understatement of the day x theyre following us monk said and pointed at the crevice gold sweat stood on docs face as he stared back into the split of a passage he saw that the far end of the crevice was filling with dark masses they either had no real shape or there was not the light to give them form get back doc shouted into the crevice get back or well use another grenade the warning had no effect the passage continued to fill with dragging inexorable figures and now they were making a sound a clicking and hissing a sound that was rage and hunger and bestiality run doc told monk linningen and the sullivans are back there somewhere keep shouting so they can identify you and keep a hold on wail if you can wail shrieked throw fire at them flame will stop them theyre afraid of flame throw monk seized him by the collar and hauled him away doc savage searching in his pockets found only two more of the explosive grenades he unpinned one smothered a frenzied impulse to throw it directly among the horde of pursuers that now packed the crevice far half its depth and dropped it at a point where he hoped it would loosen a slide of rock that would fill the crevice when the explosion came he was yards away and running hard the solid stone seemed to jerk away under his feet from the blast force making him stumble somewhere overhead and to the left a great shaft of stone broke free of the ceiling and fell with a jumbled roar that mixed with and accented the avalanche of stone that was closing the crevice he could hear loose boulders hopping down inclines sounding far away he heard linningen begin bellowing anxiously demands about their safety go on he shouted after monk keep running he waited until he saw the white ghost of monks flashlight beam felt absurdly grateful that monk had retained the little flash and wheeled to watch the mass of stone now jagged and jumbled where the crevice had been he put his own flashlight beam on the spot several minutes passed he could hear the excited shouts as monk and wail joined linningen and the sullivans he heard them continue onward their sounds nearly died away then he heard weak horrible sounds coming from the mass of fallen stone that had filled the crevice he heard the sounds grow stronger until at last they became movement and a hideous figure began to drag itself from an aperture between the blocks of broken stone the creature a hideous caricature of humanity spread itself over the broken stone clawing whimpering it began crawling toward doc savage moving on all fours stiffly and on dead limbs help help it wailed we must go back help us to go back clawing its way to docs feet the creature clamped its paws about his ankles help it gasped suddenly doc screamed probably the first shriek of unadulterated terror he had given in his lifetime he kicked wildly at the creature which had buried its bony claws in his legs he fought madly the thing began to climb up his body sinking clawlike fingers into his flesh reaching upward for another handhold doc slugged pitched about with ghastly persistence the thing clung to him getting nearer and nearer his face then the creature was at his throat trying to drive small blunt teeth through the skin doc stumbled and fell conscious of the thing gnawing gnawing like a vile rat seeking his jugular and his blood the tentacles of the creature that embraced him indeed the things whole body felt spongy and slimy and about it was the odor that monk had noted the sickening odor of fear it seemed to have except for its ability to remain fastened upon him no real strength he felt its teeth gnawing madly at his throat with a futile desire to eat he remembered then about their fear of flame his hands were free the creature seemed to have no desire to pin his hands he fumbled insanely in his pockets found his cigarette lighter and thumbed it into flame instantly the repulsive thing flew away from him covering many feet in one leap and flattened itself against the broken stone wailing with maniacal terror doc savage sprang to his feet more filled with fear than he had ever been and began running he did not look back he had no desire to look back he climbed until he was spent shaking and then continued climbing until the pounding exhaustion brought some return of clear thinking after that he kept his eyes open and at last chose a place where his final grenade judiciously placed would bring down a great section of cavern roof choking any channel below he timefused the grenade and he was four or five hundred feet higher when it exploded bringing down a thundering mass of stone and sending upward a cloud of rock dust from which he fled in unreasoning terror and which pursued him for a long time seemingly xi the sergeant of state police was named griswold and he was a slender softspoken middleaged fellow whose practical outlook seemed unshakeable i think linningens explanation is the most practical one he said it was midafternoon bright sunlight beating against the pleasant log walls of the lodge and melting the slight skift of snow that had fallen doc savage stood at a window frowning thoughtfully at the icicles which were forming at the eaves we were down in that cavern four days ham brooks said grimly i dont get that there was no impression of being there that long sergeant griswold ignored that and told linningen lets have your theory again sir it sounds solid to me i feel its the only possible explanation linningen said in fact its quite reasonable it amounts to simply this gas gas of one sort or another is often found in natural caverns there was gas in this one gas that was a bit unusual in that it opened the way to hallucinations in the minds of the victims there are as you know certain anaesthetics that are conducive to hallucinations on the part of the person being subjected to the effects of the stuff mr savage im sure can cite you a number personally i recall having some ghastly dreams while having my appendix removed thats what sold me said the police sergeant emphatically they gave me a shot of gas a few months ago to set a broken arm and the dream i had would scare you stiff right linningen said we had all been pumped full of this helldownbelow stuff before we went into that cavern so when the gas got to us we naturally had nightmarish dreams involving our own ideas of hell monk mayfair snorted violently do two people have identical dreams its possible well doc and i sure saw the same version of the outskirts of hades monk told him nothing unusual about that you mr mayfair and you mr savage have been closely associated for a long time and the best of friends naturally your mental processes would have a similarity that would account for your identical versions of tophet monk shuddered im glad something accounts for it i tell you i was a believer there for a while ham brooks said im sure linningens right about this devil stuff how would you know monk snapped you didnt pay the place a visit i know that ham touched a bandage which swathed his head i slept it out that williams guy gave me a whack over the head and left me for dead well back in the cavern but ive explained that ham nodded at the police officer i was still out when the sergeant found me sergeant griswold nodded importantly i found or rather one of my troopers found mr brooks lying unconscious near the trail i can assure you that mr brooks had no delusions of having visited hell how could he he wasnt there monk snapped he wasnt deep enough in the cavern to come under the influence of the gas you mean oh have it your own way monk grinned sheepishly adding god knows im glad somebody thought of a peg i can hang my peace of mind on i dont guess ill even ask you if you can explain gilmore sullivans conviction over a period of months that he had taken a peek at hell and theyd sent a juniorgrade demon up to shut his mouth linningen looked impatient longer exposure to the gas and remember gilmore sullivan spent literally weeks on end in the cavernproduced a more permanent breakdown in the mind the delusions stayed with the victim they werent quickly tossed off as you gentlemen and miss sullivan have been able to toss them off ok monk said i wont argue sergeant griswold whose buttons and leather belt shone brightly smiled at them i have gathered a pretty good idea of why williams kidnapped miss sullivan and her brother and took them into the cavern williams thought there was a vein of valuable ore to be found there ham brooks asked whered you get that idea the sergeant looked confused well its logical how would you account for it any other way doc savage spoke quietly we might question gilmore sullivan about it sergeant griswold said that was a good idea a darned good idea and they went to the sunny bedroom where gilmore sullivan was lying gilmore listened in some embarrassment to their questions im a geologist and always looking for valuable minerals naturally gilmore explained i dont recall finding any gold or anything like that but after i fell victim of the gas i might have and i might have given williams the idea there was something like that in the cavern doc eyed gilmore sharply when could you have given williams an idea like that oh after i was rescued from the island williams was on the schooner you know doc asked do you remember telling williams such a story gilmore hesitated well no but theres quite a lot i dont exactly recall remember how you got on the island doc inquired gilmore nodded in a small sailboat i landed then shoved the boat off and let the wind drift it away i was quite insane youre going to be all right now linningen comforted him sergeant griswold told doc savage since you seem skeptical about that bill williams ive asked our head office to check on the fellow hes supposed to be an exfootball man a radio commentator and fairly well known right doc glanced quizzically at linningen who nodded thats right linningen said leaving the bedroom doc savage sauntered along a hall down a flight of steps and stopped before a windowless storeroom before the door of which a policeman stood your prisoner behaving himself doc inquired sure replied the cop mind if i talk to him i guess itll be all right the policeman said he unlocked the door permitting doc to enter then closed and locked the door mr wail was lying on a bunk on his back he turned his head and smiled benignly good evening or good afternoon rather how is the inquisition coming not too good for you wail doc told him dryly the police have about concluded you and williams were in cahoots and after the secret of a vein of valuable ore you thought gilmore sullivan had found in the cavern theyre nuts wail said pleasantly i was a devil juniorgrade sent up to silence sullivan williams was a slightly highergrade devil sent up to ascertain why i was dallying with my job the police dont believe that of course doc told him naturally theyre happier with the other story and im happy that they are happy youre going to stick around doc asked i am you bet as a deserting demon arent you likely to be picked up and pressed back into service not if i can help it said wail fervently i think i can outfox the boys remember i had over a hundred years experience knocking around down there you like it up here i sure didnt like it down there doc nodded youre likely to spend a few years in jail if the police have their way no i wont no ill just walk out said mr wail blandly stone walls and iron bars do not a prison make not as long as ive got a few of my devil powers left over i see wail snorted one of his best efforts no you dont see you dont believe a damned word of it doc turned to the door well ill be seeing you since youre going to stick around no you wont said mr wail i meant stick around this good old earth topside i didnt mean stick around in jail youre leaving im leaving wail declared i wont be seeing you again keep your nose clean doc stepped out the policeman eyed him carefully then the cop locked the door after peering inside to make sure mr wail was still there that little fat guy kinda gives me the willies the officer confided state police sergeant griswold wore a rather odd expression when doc savage rejoined him he had apparently been shouting at linningen and the psychiatrist was manifestly uncomfortable perhaps i didnt investigate the fellow fully enough linningen mumbled you see he was introduced to me by a friend expressed an interest in yachting and i invited him along as a guest he was an amiable and pleasant guest i assure you but you think he coulda managed so the schooner went past that island and found gilmore sullivan officer griswold snapped well possibly linningen admitted whats this doc inquired officer griswold said emphatically williams was no football player or radio commentator theres no record of him no record at all of williams doc asked oddly officer griswold frowned now dont get on that devil stuff again williams is just somebody that wail guy picked up to help him get the ore deposit they imagined existed i hope you can prove that doc said fervently you watch me griswold barked im going to pump it all out of wail im going down there right now and do that the officer stepped through the door of the storeroom with a completely blank and unbelieving expression on his face where the devil did he go he gasped the storeroom walls were intact so were ceiling and floor and there were no windows and no mr wail sergeant griswold said when did you let him out i didnt let him out the policeman declared emphatically nobody let him out hes gone nobody went in there but doc savage and he came out alone after talking to this wail guy for a while isnt that right mr savage doc savage was wearing a thoughtful expression right to some extent you didnt hear me talking to anyone did you huh the policeman stared wasnt he in there when you went in did you really think he was doc countered the officer swallowed my god why didnt you say the room was empty no no it couldnt have been empty i looked in after you left and saw this wail oh nuts i was imagining why didnt you tell me the room was empty savage i thought it might be some sort of joke doc said sergeant griswold swore i dont know how that wail got away but well catch him the sergeant fisted his hands well make him wish he was back in the brimstone country where be claims he came from want to bet on either statement doc asked dryly the end
