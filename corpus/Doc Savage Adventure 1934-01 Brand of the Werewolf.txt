brand of the werewolf a doc savage adventure by kenneth robeson back cover seeking to avenge his brothers murder doc savage and his daring crew become involved in a desperate hunt for the lost treasure of the pirate henry morgan stalking them every inch of the way is the archfiend el rabanos and his strange ally the werewolfs paw chapter the strange message it was a little way station on the transcontinental railroad in western canada only one man worked there he had what railroaders call an os job about all he had to do was os trains telegraph the dispatcher that they were passing his point usually nothing much ever happened around there just now however the telegrapher looked as if things were happening big things his manner was as excited as that of a small boy about to see the circus the thing which had flustered him was a telegram that he had just copied it was addressed to a passenger on the fast express train which was due to arrive soon the operator interrupted his routine work frequently to stare at the name of the individual to whom the message was going he scratched his head if that man is the fellow i think he is he finished his remark with a low whistle of amazement some minutes later the brass pounder gave a start as if he had just thought of something he got up hastily and went to a row of shelves in the rear of the room these held magazines due to the loneliness of his post the operator was a heavy reader he picked out and thumbed through several magazines which made a practice of publishing stories of famous men the cover design of one of these consisted of a large bronzecolored question mark printed across this were the words the man of mystery the telegrapher opened the magazine to page nine the story was what writers call a fact article every word was supposed to be the truth more large black type asked who is probably the most amazing of living men the telegraph operator had read this story before but now he started to peruse it again he was interrupted a train whistled in the distance and soon its approaching roar was soon audible it was the fast passenger smoke and steam rolling air brakes shrieking the engine and string of coaches came to a halt a regular stop for water was made here wilkie came in wilkie was the conductor he had a large head and an extraordinarily prominent stomach he looked like a pleasant little goblin in a uniform hyah brass mauler he greeted cheerfully with a dramatic gesture the operator passed over the telegram message for one of the passengers eh said wilkie and started to stuff the missive in a pocket wait a minute ejaculated the telegrapher look who thats for wilkie eyed the name on the telegram for the love of mike he exclaimed i knew youd heard of him the operator said triumphantly wilkie absently removed the uniform cap from his enormous head do you reckon this is the same man im betting it is said the telegrapher hes taking a vacation him and the five men who help him he has a relative up in the woods along the coast hes paying a visit there how do you know that wilkie demanded the operator grinned its kinda lonesome here and i km time by listening to the messages that go back and forth over the wires i heard the message he sent saying he was coming with his five friends wilkie hesitated then read the message as an employee of the company he probably had a right to do this whew he exclaimed if that chap was a relative of mine i wouldnt send him a telegram like this me either the operator replied he secured the magazine which he had started to read say did you see the article in here about that fellow wilkie glanced at the magazine nope id like to read it too take it the operator passed the magazine over its sure worth reading it tells some of the things he and his five men have done i tell you wilkie a lot of the things are hard to believe this fellow must be a superman them writers sometimes exaggerate wilkie said not in this magazine the telegrapher assured him its got a reputation of sticking close to the truth the engine whistle moaned out echoes came slamming back from the timbered hills thats the ol highballl wilkie wheeled thanks for the magazine be seeing you brass pounder the train was moving with a smoothness that came of long practice wilkie swung aboard he headed for the cars which held drawingrooms he walked the swaying aisles with the proficiency of a sailor on a rolling deck of a stormtossed ship opening the magazine at page nine he stared at the article the first paragraph gripped him absorbed in his reading he nearly fell over a suitcase which some traveler had left protruding into the aisle what a man wilkie ejaculated the traveler who owned the suitcase mistakenly thinking the remark was directed at himself looked indignant wilkie reached the drawingroom and found the porter im hunting for this man he said and showed the name on the telegram yassah gulped the porter golly me dats de stranges lookin man ah evah saw whats strange about him man he am de bigges fella yo evah laid yo eyes on the porter gazed ecstatically ceilingward when he looks at yo yo jus kinda turns inside out ah seed him with his shirt off takin some kinda exercises ah nevah seed such muscles befo dey was like big ropes tied around him wilkie nodded he had come on duty at the last division point and had not seen all the passengers in the observation car eh and ill know him when i see him yo caint miss him hes a great big bronze man wilkie headed for the observation car back in the tiny way station the telegraph sounder was clicking noisily the operator sat down at his typewriter to receive he copied the incoming message number the office of origin and the address the missive was destined for a passenger on another train the telegrapher reached over to his key and broke wrong number he transmitted telegrams were numbered in consecutive order this was to prevent a telegrapher sending one into the air trans mitting a message which was not received at the other end its the right number the man at the distant key tapped youre shy a number explained the station wireman you sent me a message half an hour ago the last message we sent you was four hours ago rattled the sounder the telegrapher shook his head in bewilderment getting out his carbon copy of the message which he had given to wilkie he traced it to the distant man outlining its contents we sent no such message he was informed i received it the station operator clicked back theres something strange about this do you think the wires were tapped search me the telegrapher sat and pondered he reached a decision grasping the key he transmitted im going to wire ahead to the next station and let wilkie know what happened why go to all that trouble the distant operator demanded because both wilkie and i thought the contents of that message were strange we both remarked that it was an unusual communication for this man to receive what do you know about the business of the man the message was going to ive read of the fellow tapped the station operator ill tell you about him later hes worth hearing about but im going to wire wilkie now he began to maul out the call letters of a station at which wilkies train would soon arrive the station door opened furtively behind him it made no noise two men crept in they were clad in greasespattered coveralls both had handkerchiefs tied over their faces and both carried revolvers the telegrapher absorbed in calling did not hear them it was doubtful if he ever knew of their presence one of the marauders jammed his revolver to the operators temple and pulled the trigger the report of the shot was deafening the operator tumbled from his chair he had died instantly reaching over the murderer grasped the telegraph key never mind that stuff about another message he transmitted i was mistaken that lonesome place must be driving you nuts chided the distant telegrapher thinking he was still talking to the station man the killer gave an ugly laugh he grabbed the key again nuts nuts ha ha ha he transmitted erratically king george couldnt be crazy ha ha im king george for several minutes he sent crazily in the manner of a demented man then he carefully wiped the finger prints off the murder revolver and placed it in the fingers of the lifeless station telegrapher that fixes it up he told his companion theyll think he went mad and committed suicide nobody can trace my gun the numbers are filed off i dont like this gulped the fellows companion we hadda keep em from findin out we tapped the wire and sent that message didnt we cmon lets blowl the pair departed some time later a somber black monoplane lifted them from a level bit of grassland which lay about three miles from the tiny station the plane moaned off in the eye of the evening sun it was following the railroad westward as if in pursuit of the passenger train wilkie the conductor stood stockstill in the observation car and stared the colored porters words and what he had read of the article in the magazine had prepared him to a degree for what he was seeing yet the personage before him was even more remarkable than he had expected had wilkie not known better he would have sworn the individual was a statue sculptured from solid bronze the effect of the metallic figure was amazing the mans unusually high forehead the muscular and strong mouth the lean and corded cheeks denoted a rare power of character the bronze hair was a shade darker than the bronze skin it lay straight and smooth only by comparing the bronze mans size to that of the observation car chair in which he sat were his gigantic proportions evident the bulk of his great frame was lost in its perfect symmetry no part of the man seemed overdeveloped wilkie snapped himself out of his trance and advanced doc savage he asked the bronze man glanced up wilkie suddenly realized the most striking thing about the fellow was his eyes they were like pools of flake gold glistening in the afternoon sunlight that reflected through the train windows their gaze possessed an almost hypnotic quality a strange ability to literally convey the owners desires with their glance undeniably here was an amazing man doc savage he said that is right the mans voice impressed wilkie as being very much in keeping with his appearance it was vibrant with controlled power a wire came for you at the last station said wilkie and handed over the message it was the first time in years that wilkie had been awed in the presence of anybody thank you said doc savage wilkie found himself retreating although he had intended to hang around and strike up a conversation with this remarkable man the tone of those two words had impelled him to depart at the same time he found himself feeling very friendly toward the metallic giant it was eerie the things the bronze mans voice could do wilkie was almost out of the observation car when another weird thing happened an uncanny sound reached his ears he came to an abrupt stop his face was blank absently he felt of his ears the sound was so curious that he half suspected it might be a product of his imagination the note seemed to be coming from no particular spot but from every where it was low mellow and trilling that soundlike the song of some strange feathered denizen of the jungle or the sound of a wind crawling through a leafless wilderness it ran up and down the musical scale having no tune yet melodious then it ended wilkie did not feel awed by the sound rather there was something inspiring about it as he went on wilkie felt as if he had just taken a drink of fine old liquor the trilling sound had that kind of an effect chapter the train werewolf the sound wilkie had heard was part of doc savage it was a small unconscious thing which he did in moments of intense concentration or when he was surprised often when doc made the sound he was unaware of doing so reading the text of the telegram had caused the tiny weird note to come into being leaving his chair doc strode for the observation platform on the rear of the coach there were other passengers these were amazed by the bronze mans appearance so much so that they forgot their manners and frankly stared a stout elderly man with a slightly swarthy face gazed at the bronze giants hands enormous supple tendons showed those hands contained incredible strength the hands seemed to mesmerize the swarthy man a ravishingly pretty darkhaired girl sat beside the elderly man her eyes were large and limpid and her lips a most inviting rosebud she looked very fresh and crisp so impeccable in fact that it was obvious she had not been on the train long even the neatest of individuals soon show the effects of traveling these two were clearly father and daughter the attractive young woman seemed intrigued not by the bronze mans undeniable physical strength but by the fact that he was one of the handsomest fellows she had ever seen doc savage went on seeming not to notice the pair frowning the elderly man dropped a hand on his daughters arm quila aim he ejaculated severely in spanish for shame you were smiling at that man cere the enchanting cere colored in confusion she had smiled although she had not meant to eso es espantoso she laughed it is dreadful thank goodness he did not see me he would have thought me very forward si si her parent agreed disapprovingly father and daughter were staring after the receding bronze man when a low voice sounded at their side a man had joined them silently this individual was tall and slenderly athletic his face was more than handsome it was pretty it was almost a girls face his age was somewhere around thirtyfive he had hard eyes i trust you are retaining your courage senorita he said fawningly he bowed to her father you also senor corto oveja you need have no fear of our nerve el rabanos said cere in excellent english instead of discussing our troubles we were remarking on the striking qualities of the bronze man who just passed do you happen to know his name the girlfaced el rabanos leaned close to breathe not so loud senorita a close observer could have noted that the pretty senorita had suddenly begun turning pale you mean the bronze man is doc savage said el rabanos senor corto oveja came up rigid in his chair so that is the man the fiend who is to kill us dios mio si si muttered el rabanos we must watch this doc savage from him our very lives are in danger and his appearance made such a good impression cere murmured forlornly doc savage unaware of the bombshell his passage had exploded stepped out on the observation platform one man rode there the outstanding thing about this fellow was his gigantic hands each of these was composed of more than a quart of bone and gristle sheathed in hide that resembled rusted sheet iron the man was very big over six feet and weighing fully two hundred and fifty pounds but the size of his hands made the rest of him seem dwarfed he had a long puritanical face which bore an expression of great gloom he looked like a man on his way to a funeral have a look renny said doc savage and extended the telegram the bigfisted man was colonel john renwick known in many parts of the globe for his accomplishments as an engineer also he was noted for a playful habit of knocking panels out of doors with his incredible fists with either fist he boasted he could vanquish the stoutest wooden door rennys funeralgoing expression was the one he habitually wore when at peace with the world renny was one of a group of five singular men who were doc savages helpers the telegram was addressed to doc savage care of the train and read just received your wire advising you are paying me a visit stop wish to in form you i have no use for rest of savage family stop do not wish your company stop would be delighted to have you stay away alex savage renny had a pet expression which be used on all occasions calling for vehemence he employed it now holy cow he exploded those are something near my own sentiments doc savage agreed dang it rennys voice was something like the roaring of an angry animal in a cave what if he dont want our company the crowd of us werent going to drop in and sponge off him we were going to do some fishing and hunting and merely pay him a visit as a courtesy if he dont want us we wont bother him but ill be blasted if that will keep us from our vacation alex savage owns a large stretch of land along the coast doc pointed out it has the reputation of being the best spot in canada for hunting and fishing renny groaned thunderously a fine gesture of welcome say doc dont this alex savage know you not personally doc replied he is an uncle i have never met either him or his daughter daughter an only child i understand her name is patricia age about eighteen renny tapped his huge fists together this made a sound remindful of two flint boulders colliding with each other if your uncle and cousin dont want us doc i reckon well go somewhere else he said gloomily wheres the map ill try to find another place where theres good fishing better postpone that renny doc said dryly huh theres something very suspicious about this message doc savage informed him puzzled and wondering bigfisted renny followed his giant bronze chief back through the observation car rennys relation to doc savage was unusual he willingly carried out docs smallest order yet renny received not one penny of salary renny in fact was considerably more than a millionaire in his own right his skill as an engineer had made into a fortune he had in a sense retired retired to follow the trail of what he liked above all else adventure peril and excitement were the spice of his life peril excitement and adventure were the bonds which cemented him to doc savage doc seemed always to walk amid these things each minute of his life was one of danger for doc savage had a strange purpose in life a creed to which his existence was dedicated that creed was to go here and there to the far corners of the earth helping those in need of help punishing those who needed punishment doc had been trained for this purpose from the cradle the other four aides of the bronze man like renny were bound to him by a love of adventure and like renny they were masters of some profession one was an electrical wizard one a worldrenowned chemist another a great geologist and archaeologist and the fourth one of the most astute lawyers harvard had ever turned out troublebusting was the life purpose of doc and his five aides their exploits had pushed their fame to the ends of the earth doc mighty man of bronze was by way of becoming a legend a specter of terror where evildoers were concerned doc savage entered his drawingroom renny at his heels the room was stacked with bags and many metal boxes equipped with carrying straps doc opened one of the boxes a compact radio transmitter and receiver came to light corded fingers moving with deftness doc manipulated the controls the set was fitted with a bug a mechanical key for rapid transmission what station are you callin doc renny queried there is a royal canadian mounted police stttion in the railroad town nearest alex savages home doc ex plalned im trying to raise them renny heard this without batting an eye that doc should know there was a mounted station at the town and have the call letters at his finger tips did not impress renny as anything out of the ordinary doc savage had a fabulous fund of information of all kinds doc contacted the mounted station and made known his identity at your service mr savage was the reply to this renny heard this come from the ear phones he was not surprised this was not the only great police system which cooperated fully with doc savage i received a telegram which pretends to have been sent from your town by alex savage doc transmitted will you check up and see if it was sent please there followed fully five minutes of silence while the distant mounted operator made inquiries no such message was sent from here came back the report doc wirelessed his thanks then replaced the radio set in its case youve got one guess about that telegram he told renny it was a fake renny thumped but doc what in blazes made you suspicious the message was addressed care of this train doc explained our earlier message to alex savage said nothing about what train we would be on doc savage renny lumbering at his side now sought out wilkie the conductor wilkie was absorbed in the magazine which held the feature story about doc savage how soon will we reach a point from which i can send a telegram doc inquired wilkie swallowed twice before he could answer what he had been reading had tended to increase his awe of this bronze man we pass a little station in a few minutes he replied we dont stop but i can clip it to an order hoop and get it to the telegrapher as we go past good doc proceeded to write out a message it was addressed to alex savage something strange going on stop did you get my telegram advising that my self and five friends planning spend fishing and hunting vacation your vic nity stop did you wire us not to come stop please advise immediately doc savage folding this doc gave it to the conductor i dont know what it will cost wilkie said this should more than cover it doc passed over a large canadian five dollar bill keep the change for your trouble i couldnt do that wilkie said hastily ill deadhead the message for you mr savage it wont cost a thing wilkie was outdoing himself to please the bronze man doc seemed faintly puzzled for a moment then he caught sight of the magazine article which wilkie had been reading his inscrutable metallic features did not change but after a moment he indicated the periodical the chap who wrote that had a lot of imagination he said dryly doc and renny turned away from the admiring conductor they almost bumped into two swarthy men and a beautiful darkhaired girl these were senor corto oveja his daughter cere and the girlfaced el rabanos the three looked steadily away from doc and renny they had been standing there eavesdropping as doc gave wilkie his message but they did not want the bronze giant to know that doc and renny went on up the car a peach renny breathed when they were in the next car what said doc the girl with those two swarthy men renny murmured holy cow was she a looker you mean the three who were spying on us as we gave the conductor that message doc queried softly renny gulped they were spying on us they were senor corto oveja cere and el rabanos would have been surprised had they overheard this statement they had not imagined they had been discovered they did not know that few things happening around doc escaped his attention renny scowled and banged his knuckles together what do you make of this doc somebody wants to keep us away from alex savages place and the beautiful senorita and her two dark com plexioned companions are very interested in us doc summarized but whats at the bottom of it trouble youre tellin me renny grimaced but whats at the bottom of it i neglected to bring my crystal ball doc said dryly renny grinned somebody incredulous at the eerie precision with which doc could read the meaning of mysterious events and deduct what was to come had once declared the bronze man was a mystic able to see the future in a crystal ball the truth was that docs foresight came from a brain that operated with crystal clarity the rest of the gang will want to know about this renny suggested renny was referring to the other four members of docs little group these gentlemen were playing a game of chess in another drawingroom a good idea doc agreed well tell them doc and renny went to a drawingroom door docs hand drifting toward the knob came to a rigid stop look he pointed at the door the panel bore a weirdly shaped smudge faintly imprinted discernible only after a close glance the thing was more than a foot high and about half as wide renny stepped around so that he got a better view with the light on it holy cowl he gasped the thing is shaped like a wolf head doc a wolf with hideous humanlike features doc nodded slowly his bronze lineaments his strange golden eyes had not changed expression werewolf he said what renny was puzzled there aint no such critter its just a legend of these canadian trappers and natives a legend of human beings who thirsting for the blood of their fellow men turn into wolves that they may satisfy their vampire lustdoc said quietly most unsavory creatures even for ghost stories renny hesitated then stroked a finger through the design on the door his enormous digit left a clean path in its wake just dust he muttered but its strange itd settle there in that kind of a shape doc tried the door it resisted he showed no surprise locked he said blazes somethings wrong without hesitating renny blocked one huge hand into a fist he swung it the door panel was of metal but it gave as if it were a kicked tin can with a loud crack the lock broke the panel jumped open doc and renny shouldered in four men lay sprawled about a table their positions were grotesque they lay exactly as they had fallen from their chairs the men were doc savages four aides theyre dead renny walled at that instant a small depot flashed by the speeding train it was the station at which wilkie planned to drop doc savages telegram wilkie got rid of the message successfully and before the train was out of sight he saw the station telegrapher carrying the missive enter his office chapter warning of the werewolf the window of the drawingroom in which the four rigid forms lay was closed tightly lunging to it doc wrenched up the sliding sash the noise of the train wheels came in through the window like the moaning of a mechanical monster bigfisted renny after his one wailing cry that the four men were dead went into action he sank beside one of the prone forms the individual over whom renny stooped was a startling figure he hardly exceeded five feet in height yet outweighed rennys own tremendous bulk fully ten pounds nearly as wide as he was tall he had arms inches longer than his legs his face was incredibly homely the fellow who would pass as first cousin to a gorilla this was monk as lieutenant colonel andrew blodgett mayfair his accomplishments in the field of experimental chemistry were known to both hemispheres holy cow renny yelled theyre not dead doc savage replied nothing he made a round of the drawingroom sensitive nostrils testing the air his weird flakepool golden eyes roved about he examined the doorlock the key the latter was in place from the inside obviously the drawingroom had been locked from the interior doc picked up the nearest of his four inert friends this man was extremely tall and as thin as a skeleton his coat draped on his shoulders as on a coat hanger spectacles were still in place on his nose these were peculiar in that the left lens was extraordinarily thick this man was johnny william harper littlejohn the proudest possession of a famous eastern museum was an archaeological exhibit of the ancient mayan civilization which johnny had contributed mining engineers consulted textbooks which he had written on geology johnny had lost use of his left eye in the war needing a magnifying glass in his business he carried one in the left side of his spectacles for convenience doc savage hurried into the corridor within a few minutes he was back carrying a medical case he began administering restoratives pulse very slow in all four of them he announced to renny respiration only perceptible when you hold a mirror in front of their lips theyre about all in aint a mark on em renny rumbled so i notice doc agreed but what happened to them something very mysterious doc said grimly lets snap them out of it and see if they can shed light on what has occurred strangely enough it was the most unhealthylooklng fellow in the group who was first to revive to all appearances this man was easily the weakling of the crowd he was undersized slender only fairly set up with a none too healthy complexion he had pale hair and pale eyes he looked as if he might have lived most of his life in a dark and mouldy cellar this was long tom roberts long tom he was occasionally known as major thomas j roberts was an electrical expert a wizard of the juice men of his own profession declared long tom frowned blankly at the table on which a chessboard stood then be peered at his three motionless fellows what kind of a game are those guys playing he demanded weakly game bell renny boomed listen long tom we busted in here and found you four birds all spread out what happened long tom considered i dont know you dont renny waved his huge hand come on snap out of it we went to sleep long tom groaned we just felt drowsy all of a sudden then went to sleep you have no idea what caused it doc questioned nope doc continued his resuscitation efforts on the other men ham was the second individual to awaken ham was famed for two things he was one of the cleverest lawyers harvard had ever turned out and he was a snappy dresser tailors often followed brigadier general theodore marley brooks down the street to see clothes being worn as they should be worn he was a slender man quick moving and a fast thinker it chanced that as hams eyes opened the first figure he saw was homely gorillalike monk i cant be in heaven he grinned feebly renny snorted ham was always making some wisecrack at monks expense to listen to the sharptongued lawyer one would think nothing would have given him more delight than to see monk burned at the stake this peeve of hams dated back to the great war to an event which had earned him his nickname thinking to have fun ham had taught monk some french words which were highly insulting telling him they were the proper expressions with which to flatter a frenchman monk had addressed the words to a french general and landed in the guardhouse but very shortly after monks release ham was hailed up on a charge of stealing hams he was convicted somebody had planted the evidence ham was mortally certain monk had framed him but to this day be had not been able to prove it what happened to you guys renny asked ham acquired a bewildered expression he moved about weakly until his hands found a black cane this cane appeared innocentlooking actually housed in its slender length was a razorsharp sword the tip of this blade was daubed with a chemical a touch of which in a wound would produce instant unconsciousness ham was rarely seen without his sword cane he dont know what happened to him renny boomed interpreting hams befuddled expression johnny the archaeologist and geologist and the homely monk now opened their eyes johnny promptly felt for his glasses which had the magnifying lens just as ham had groped for his sword cane both men admitted they had not the slightest idea of what had happened while playing chess they had simply gone to sleep monk had a small childlike voice that was surprisingly mild for one of his apish build well what about the head of the werewolf on the door outside doc asked them fuzzled wonderment stamped the faces of the four men doc knew they had no knowledge of the weird design on the door a werewolf monk muttered i just called it that doc told him it is the head of a wolf with a grotesquely human face bracing himself on his sword cane ham sought to sit erect he gave it up and fell back dizzily golly i feel washed up he groaned aint that too bad monk jeered faintly ham ignored the insult i cant imagine what is behind it doc we were just sitting here his eyes protruded his hands grasped his sword cane wrathfully under the bed an unearthly squealing and grunting suddenly arose habeas corpus monk yelled weakly but joyfully a pig staggered from under the bed the porker family probably never produced a more grotesque specimen than this one the pig had legs as long as those of a dog and ears that rivaled airplane wings owww ham groaned habeas corpus was the present great misery of hams existence monk had bought the pig on a recent expedition to arabia paying the equivalent of four cents in american money as purchase price for him monks story was that habeas corpuss former owner an arab had sold the pig because he had been making a nuisance of himself by catching hyenas and dragging their carcasses up to the house it was possible that either monk or the arab had exaggerated the homely monk was greatly attached to habeas corpus probably because the presence of the pig enraged ham the door was locked on the inside and you had the windows closed doc inquired thats right ham replied the pig seemed to have been laid out the same as you fellows doc said dryly its all very mystifying this isnt the first queer thing thats happened either ham blinked what do you mean doc told them about the telegram incident do you think the fake telegram and what happened to us has a connection ham demanded cant say doc replied doc went to a hand bag and opened it the piece of baggage held several weapons which resembled overgrown automatic pistols they were fitted with curled magazines these were machine guns of docs own invention the weapons were tiny compared to the destruction they could wreak they fired so rapidly that their roar was like the note of a gigantic bullfiddle magazines were charged with what biggame hunters call mercy bullets slugs which produce unconsciousness instead of death doc distributed the rapidfirers to the four weakened victims of the mystery attack keep a sharp lookout be warned renny demanded what are you gonna do doc you and i are going to talk to the three persons who were eavesdropping when i gave the conductor the telegram doc told him trailed by renny doc glided out into the corridor the two men had not progressed far when they encountered wilkie id like to get some information about two darkcomplexioned men on the train doc told the conductor wilkie scratched his large head there are a number of dark men aboard i notice at this renny shot a sharp glance at doc the bronze mans features told nothing the two i am interested in were in the company of a very pretty girl doc explained oh them grinned wilkie they got on at the division point where i went on duty that was two stops back know their names no passengers dont usually give a conductor their names have you noticed anything queer about their actions doc persisted wilkie scratched his large head again nothing except that they seem to be moving around a lot these swarthy men did they get on at the same time wilkie nodded yes at the division point doc and renny left the goblinlike little conductor this thing is beginning to shape up like a mess of firstclass trouble renny said thoughtfully doc said nothing he sought and found a porter the porter directed him to a drawingroom which had been reserved by the three individuals whom doc wished to see doc found the door and knocked silence answered he rippled his knuckles on the panel again then he tried the knob the door was locked doc called the porter youre sure theyre in here yas suh said the porter dey went in about five minutes ago two of em did anyhow at pretty gal and her pap dont know if dat man with de gal face is in dere or not renny held up a huge fist and gave doc an inquiring look i guess well go in doc told him renny drew back to slam his fist against the panel then he lurched the train had slackened speed abruptly renny had to grasp the doorknob to maintain his balance guess were pulling into a station he rumbled bang went his big fist against the door the sheet metal bulged but held renny swung again terrifically it seemed a miracle that his fist was not smashed to a pulp the train had slowed rapidly it was now crawling rennys next punch exploded the door open he plunged across the threshold then brought up quickly his jaw asag holy cow he gulped senor corto oveja and his attractive daughter were draped across the drawingroom bed they lay perfectly still black leather straps were drawn so tightly around their necks as to be almost buried in the flesh chapter dead man the window ejaculated rockfisted renny its open take a look doc rapped whoever did this may have jumped out as the train slowed down doc was already bending over the two forms on the bed the garroting straps were strong yet they broke under docs sinewy fingers like cardboard strips the girls wrist in one hand the mans in the other doc explored for pulse both were still alive pulse was strong respiration firm this didnt happen more than a few moments ago doc told renny the wouldbe killers must have escaped through the window renny his head thrust outside boomed i dont see anybody they had time to duck yeah renny agreed he lifted his gaze skyward holy cow that thing is almost an omen what is an airplane flying overhead renny rumbled the thing is black looks kinda like a buzzard doc stepped to the window and studied the plane his sharp eye noted something renny had missed that plane has no identification numeral he said sharply renny made a silent whistle in view of whats happening on this train thats more than passing strange eh police on lawful business usually have identification numbers like a somber vulture the black monoplane dipped off to the westward and was soon lost to sight doc twisted a faucet at the washbowl caught cold water in a palm carried it over and dashed it on the faces of senor corto oveja and his daughter he waited expectantly but they did not stir they should be coming out of it doc said in a vaguely puzzled tone he tested pulse and respiration then for the briefest moment the bronze mans weird trilling note was audible it trailed softly up and down the musical scale and abruptly was gone turning to renny doc said it looks as if in addition to being choked they got a dose of the same thing our four friends got that weird unconsciousness renny was staring fixedly at the door there was an expression of bewilderment on his long puritanical face yeah he mumbled look doc his huge hand indicated the inner side of the door panel which he had damaged the sheet metal bore an eerie smudge it had the likeness of a wolf head a wolf with horribly human features i saw it earlier doc explained you did renny gulped he had not seen doc show any surprise whenever it was that he had made the discovery that same mark was on the other door doc savage said he stepped close to the hideous smear his eyes measured it its exactly the same size too renny nodded he could not tell himself that this mark was the same size as the other he knew doc savage could judge the relative sizes within fractions of an inch two men have been accompanying this girl about renny rumbled i wonder where the other one is with a rather unpleasant jerk the train got into motion well revive this man and the girl doc declared then well hunt the other one yeah renny boomed well get that gink outside in the passage a man yelled shrilly help help theyre going to kill me renny and doc bounded to the door they expected to see a murder scene or at least a fight they got a shock the swarthy girlfaced man stood in the corridor he leveled an arm at doc and renny you heard them he bellowed they said they would gel me sabe that means they plan to kill me wilkie the conductor stood just behind the girlfaced man wilkie looked flabbergasted now now mister wilkie said soothingly theres some mistake here it is no mistake wailed the dark man look quickly they must have killed my friends senor and senorita oveja wilkie advanced he mumbled apologetically to doc sure dont know what this is all about the swarthy man yelled i know what its all about senor this bronze man is trying to kill my friends and myself he came to the door and looked in eo es terrible it is terrible what did i tell you they are murderers renny made big square blocks of his fists youd better dry up girlface at this point senor corto oveja and his daughter showed signs of reviving doc splashed more water on them they stirred about and finally opened their eyes senor oveja pointed weakly at doc seize that caballero he cried feebly it was he who attacked us renny was perfectly familiar with docs ability to control his emotions yet watching the bronze man now he had to marvel doc showed by not the remotest sign that anything out of the ordinary had occurred you doc said are mistaken it is true senor oveja shrieked weakly si si echoed his pretty daughter this man savage is the one who assaulted us we became strangely drowsy as we sat here in our room before complete unconsciousness overcame us men entered and began tying straps around our necks one of them addressed the other as senor savage did he say senor savage doc asked pointedly the girl shut her eyes apparently she was thinking yes he used the word senor doc glanced at renny the bigfisted engineer was staring at the leather straps which had been around the necks of senor oveja and the girl choking them to death from the expression on his somber face he might have been looking at a pair of poisonous serpents i thought youd notice those straps doc told him quietly theyre carryingstraps from a piece of my luggage the man with the womanish face bellowed triumphantly bueno this proves it beyond a shadow of a doubt savage tried to do murder conductor arrest him wilkie shifted from one foot to the other little bubbles of perspiration stood on his large forehead he made a bewildered gesture what is your name he asked the girlfaced man el rabanos the fellow replied what is the motive wilkie demanded why should doc savage try to kill you el rabanos hesitated a strange expression flickered about his eyes i dont know he said finally wilkie scowled did you think previously that you were in danger from doc savage yes el rabanos admitted reluctantly for what reason wilkie cracked back el rabanos said angrily you arrest this man turn him over to the mounted police ill give them my full story wilkie eyed doc i dont want to arrest you mr savage but i may have to something strange and horrible is going on around here i wouldnt be surprised if the death of that poor telegraph operator hasnt got something to do with it what telegraph operator doc queried sharply the fellow who copied the message that i gave you wilkie explained once more doc savage received surprising information without an appreciable show of emotion doc was not callous he simply had his nerves under such control that they behaved as he wished was the telegrapher murdered he queried not according to a report i got at our last stop wilkie replied a section worker found the body he claimed it looked like suicide but i knew that operator he wasnt the kind to take his own life docs hand described a gesture which took in senor oveja his daughter and el rabanos i should like very much to hear these three explain why they fear me he said all doc received was a hateful stare from each of the trio the girls look was the least malicious in fact her expression portrayed rather plainly that she regretted that this handsome bronze man was an enemy it dont seem like theyre gonna talk wilkie muttered doc savage swung over to the door he closed it so that the rear of the panel was visible and indicated the smear which resembled a grisly humanfaced wolf maybe you can explain this his powerful voice crashed the girls eyes flew wide as she saw the smudge she screamed with a sort of exhausted horror then she clamped palms over her eyes senor oveja and el rabanos reacted almost as sharply their eyes protruded their jaws fell the werewolf choked senor oveja what does it mean doc questioned pretty senorita oveja laughed hysterically why should you be asking w you know very well what it means you three are under some misapprehension doc told them this is all a mystery to me que el rabanos ejaculated sarcastically what did not your uncle alex savage take you into his confidence so alex savage is mixed up in this doc said dryly mixed is a very mild word for it senor savage el rabanos sneered ignoring the girlfaced man doc savage turned to wilkie one of the gang who assaulted senor oveja and his daughter called the other by the name of senor savage obviously they were trying to frame me but use of the spanish word senor was a slip i believe you said there were other swarthyskinned men on this train right exclaimed wilkie im going to check up on them right now the goblinlike little conductor hurried off doc paid a visit to his four friends who had been victims of the weird sleep there was no danger of any one escaping from the speeding train when he entered the drawingroom monk and ham were scowling blackly at each other this was a good sign it indicated monk and ham were back to their normal quarreling state johnny and long tom also seemed fairly chipper the effects of the stuff wear off quickly said gaunt johnny polishing his spectacles which had the magnifying left lens whats new doc were in the thick of a mess doc announced instead of looking gloomy or apprehensive at this all four men grinned they were a strange bunch peril and excitement were the things for which they lived speaking rapidly doc told them what had happened when he went to investigate senor oveja the daughter and el rabanos they seem to think im some kind of a bogy man he finished do they really think that or are they pretending questioned apish monk scratching the airplanewing ears of his pig habeas corpus im not sure yet doc replied the train whistle moaned its sound was a banshee wail over the noisy progress of the coaches doc glanced through the window it was only a road crossing for which the train had whistled a porter ran past the drawingroom door crying in a horrorstricken voice lawsy mel lawsy mel doc collared him what is it he demanded of the porter it am de conductor mistah wilkie the colored man moaned what about him he done been stuck show me where he is doc commanded wilkie lay in the washroom of a pullman car lay in a wet lake of crimson which had leaked from his own body he had been knifed numerous times in the chest doc savage was skilled in many things but in surgery and medicine above all others a glance convinced him that wilkie was dead anybody see anything doc asked the porter no sah said the porter not that ah knows of doc savage stood like an image graven in the metal he resembled on the washroom door he had discovered another of the hideous smears a humanfaced wolf the mark of death standing there the bronze man was so quiet as to seem without life an unseen monster of horror and death was slowly wreathing its tentacles about him why he did not know but it must be something that concerned his uncle alex savage or his uncles daughter patricia absently docs golden eyes roved to the north and west in that direction lay the estate of alex savage and there it was possible lay also the explanation of the mystery chapter the werewolf cries doc savage was a man of profound accomplishments but he was no clairvoyant with a gift of transporting his vision so he was unaware that mystery and horror also stalked the domain of alex savage there too the werewolf was spreading its uncanny violence the estate of alex savage was no mere backwoods homestead it was true that forty years ago alex savage had homesteaded it but now it had grown until the estate spanned up and down the coast for miles and reached no little distance inland scattered over other parts of canada alex savage had wheat ranches mines and an industrial plant or two he was considered a business success the estate at the edge of the sea was in the nature of a hunting preserve within its bounds was some of the roughest land in canada the shore was a ragged stone wall which shot up out of the water the coast was fanged with reefs and tiny islands the estate itself was a collection of pinnacle and canyons boulders and brush alex savage boasted freely that there were parts of his estate upon which he had never set eyes moreover he claimed there were spots which no one had ever explored this was possible since there were places to which none could climb in this labyrinth of stone and brush alex savage had erected a log cabin in it he spent part of each summer and all of the hunting seasons the cabin had several rooms it was filled with electric lights electric refrigeration radio and even airconditioning apparatus although there was seldom need for the latter the rugs were rich any one who sat in one of the luxurious chairs was in danger of sinking from sight the place was no backwoodsmans hut from the wide veranda of the cabin an excellent view could be had of the sea monster boulders and tall trees towered around the place thick underbrush made these surroundings almost a jungle twilight came to the brush almost an hour before the sun actually set the birds usually made a good deal of noise settling for the night it was twilight now but the birds were making no noise the feathered songsters had been chilled into silence by an eerie sound this noise pealed out erratically at times there was five minutes of dead silence then weird unearthly cries would shiver out a babbling volley of them they had a human quality those cries they were tremulous with an incoherent horror the bird life could not have been more silent had death been astalk the latest outburst of the banshee cries was somewhat more human than before they sounded very like some one in frightful agony inside the alex savage cabin a feminine voice called sharply boat face havent you got that rifle fixed yet there was no answer boat face the girl called again angrily there was a moment of silence then a squaw shuffled out of the kitchen region she was very fat very brown and wore enough clothes to garb several of her whiteskinned sisters she looked as competent as the rock of gibraltar boat face him in kitchen miss patricia she said calmly him scared out of skin boat face wont go out and investigate those cries the girl asked him heap big coward said the squaw the girl stepped back from a window she had a wealth of bronze hair hair very closely akin in hue to that of doc savage she had been watching the brush that circled like a wall she was tall her form was molded along lines that left nothing to be desired her features were as perfect as though a magazinecover artist had designed them she wore highlaced boots breeches and a serviceable gray shirt a cartridge belt was draped about her waist from it dangled a heavy frontier single action sixshooter freely admitted by those who know to be one of the most reliable guns ever made in the crook of her right arm lay a very modern automatic biggame rifle ill talk to him tiny said the girl k miss patricia said tiny it do no good that damn halfbreed husband of mine plenty afraid tiny was the cook boat face was manofallwork around the place these two were the only servants patricias heels tapped angrily into the kitchen boat face was a squarish coppercolored man who sat in a corner holding a rifle his squaw tiny had called him a breed but he looked pure indian just what had given him the name of boat face was a mystery only an indian could fathom his beady black eyes refused sullenly to meet patricias gaze patricia started to speak then held back her words the eerie banshee cries once more babbled from the gloomy brush outside the cabin they were unmistakably human now appealing for succor boat faces inkblack eyes wavered he took a firmer grasp on a rifle which lay across his knees i no go out he muttered rifle broke patricia savage suddenly seized boat faces rifle she examined the mechanism threw it to her shoulder and snapped it youre lying she cried theres nothing wrong with this gun he heap big piker grunted tiny boat faces eyes rolled nervously that noise him werewolf he mumbled nonsense patricia said sharply there is no such animal boat face did not seem convinced your pa if him alive him no ask me go and see what make that noise the words seemed to wash patricias rage away she paled visibly even the fingers which held the rifle tensed to whiteness these sounds have something to do with the murder of my father she said shrilly me no go outdoors boat face mumbled you tie can on me if you like me no go anyway i wont discharge you patricia told him in a weary voice after all i wont ask you to do anything i wouldnt do myself you can stay here ill go out and investigate tiny waddled over to a corner she came back with a doublebarrel shotgun and said stoically me go too thanks tiny patricia said gratefully but you and boat face stay here on guard tiny nodded reluctantly boat face looked much relieved patricia moved into the cabins large living room and drew the shades carefully then she indicated one of the uprights which formed a rustic support for the ceiling this was a log over a foot thick still covered with natural bark guard that especially she said meaningly tiny and boat face showed no surprise they seemed to comprehend fully what she meant patricia pocketed several extra ammunition clips for her automatic rifle then she opened the door and stepped swiftly outside tiny watched her go with evident concern boat faces aboriginal features were inscrutable sunlight still penetrated to the clearing immediately adjacent to the cabin gloom lurked in the tangle of rocks and brush beyond walking away from the cabin was like leaving a lantern and going into the night patricia walked warily rifle alert she kept fingers on safety and trigger her ears strained to catch the next outburst of the unearthly cries off to her right the noise arose it was low sinister a horrible bleating it persisted only a moment then whimpered itself into nothingness patricia shivered she tripped the rifle safety this time the cry had not sounded so human indeed it seemed to have taken on a repulsive animallike quality the sound had come from inland from perhaps a hundred yards away maybe more the girl could not tell she went toward the noise her pretty face so set it was almost a mask when she was near the spot from which the sound had seemed to come she searched for tracks the terrain was not the sort to show a trail it was too rocky patricia heard the cries again they now wailed from a little farther on she advanced again she found nothing a bit later the sounds came once more they had moved on ahead patricia shuddered it seemed the eerie crying thing was trying to decoy her away patricia suddenly gave it up as a bad job she went back toward the cabin steps hurried eyes roving uneasily she was baffled and more than a little terrified and drew a sigh of relief when the cabin came in sight tiny boat face she called its me she did not want the sullen boat face or the competent tiny taking a shot at her by mistake patricia reached the cabin and shoved the door open she went in and jerked to a stop her pretty features became blankly startled the cabin interior looked as if the proverbial cyclone had hit it patricias eyes wandered then she saw something which caused her to cry out shrilly in horror tiny and boat face were brown unmoving forms on the floor stuffing was ripped from rich chairs rugs had been plucked up and flung aside drawers had been emptied on the floor everywhere signs showed the cabin had been searched wildly patricia ran to the voluminous copperhued tiny and felt anxiously for pulse theyre dead she wailed miserably within a moment however she realized this was a mistake there was a heartbeat very faint getting ice cubes from the electric refrigerator patricia savage rubbed them over the faces of boat face and tiny pulse strengthened slowly under the copper skins confident both servants would recover patricia ran through the cabin everywhere there was wild upheaval and destruction from attic down the search had missed little the covered motor of the electric refrigerator was even torn open there was no trace of the men certainly it seemed the work of more than one who had ransacked the place they must have come in through the rear door or an unlocked window something like twenty minutes elapsed before tiny and boat face were revived enough to speak coherently what on earth occurred patricia demanded the two servants exchanged blank looks dunno boat face mumbled me and squaw just go to sleep patricia snapped thats ridiculous boat face tell truth said the ample tiny with a roll of jet eyes we get heap much sleepy and fall over patricia stared fixedly at the floor near where the two servants had been lying she had discovered something she had not observed before the sight of the thing had a striking effect she stood erect tense gripping her rifle it was a weird blackish smudge more than a foot high and half as wide the thing had the contour of a wolfs head the features were grotesquely human its the werewolfs head again patricia said shrilly its the same mark which we began seeing shortly before my fathers death and which we have seen since boat face mumbled werewolf indian know them they devilman with body of wolf they prowl in woods and eat plenty hunter and trapper campfire ghost tales patricia snapped there are no such creatures this particular werewolf is very human boat face you and tiny both know what he is after patricia went to the large barkcovered timber which supported the livingroom ceiling it was this timber which she had asked tiny and boat face to guard it had not been disturbed although the search had missed little else patricia pressed certain projections on the bark a concealed door flew open she withdrew from within what looked like a solid block of ivory the white cube was perhaps two inches square theyre after this patricia said grimly chapter square white death for once tinys aboriginal face lost its stoic indifference she stared at the ivory cube as if it were a charm which guaranteed the coming of evil events him bad medicine she muttered indicating the snowwhite block i cannot understand what significance it has patricia turned the cube slowly in her slender fingers it seems solid there is no hollow sound when it is tapped you know where your dad get him tiny asked father found it under a ledge about two miles from here years ago patricia replied it lay amid a cluster of human skeletons the skeletons looked as if they had been there for centuries no one knew anything about them sure said tiny that how he find it that alone enough make it bring bad luck patricia eyed the white cube thoughtfully dad never dreamed the thing was of any value she said three weeks ago he found a prowler searching this cabin the fellow escaped a little later dad received a mysterious demand for the cube he refused to turn it over better if him give it up muttered boat face patricia nodded miserably maybe we began finding those mysterious werewolf marks around the place we got other demands for the cube then we found dad dead the doctors called it heart failure they make blood bubble said tiny she nodded elaborately your pa him murdered i think so too tiny patricia said jerkily you bet the squaw nodded again him die from same thing that almost get me and boat face a minute ago you mean the thing that made you unconscious again tiny nodded you bet but what was it patricia pondered we go to sleep said tiny as if that explained everything nor did patricia come any nearer a solution of the mystery although she asked many questions and finally went outside and searched the immediate neighborhood the rocky earth bore no footprints that meant nothing however the marauders could easily have avoided leaving tracks the weird banshee crying had not come from the gloomy brush since patricia had returned to the cabin the blush of dusk still spread over the sea unexpectedly a long doleful sound moaned out causing echoes to bang against the cliffs the noise was greatly different from the earliest banshee cries yet patricia started violently the sound repeated itself a moment later she knew then what it was the traders launch she exclaimed theyre letting us know that they have some mail so rugged was this region in which the savage cabin lay that no automobile could penetrate a stout wagon could get through but only with difficulty to come and go either a speed boat or a seaplane was the most feasible conveyance a rustic boathouse on the beach held a fast launch mail was delivered to the savage hunting lodge in an ingenious fashion a trader who lived up the coast made regular daily trips to the settlement his route was past the savage place a few hundred feet from shore there was a floating buoy box in this the trader was accustomed to leave the savage mail the estate had no other communication with the outside world during his sojourns there alex savage had always made it a point not to be disturbed the place was his refuge from business worries patricia secured binoculars and focused them on the traders boat there was light enough for her to make it out distinctly she saw the trader place at least one piece of mail in the box then his boat went on get the launch patricia commanded boat face m going to keep my eyes on the mail box until we get out to it thats another mysterious thing that has happened our mail has been disappearing boat face was slow about complying with the order he seemed reluctant to leave the cabin only when tiny shouted angrily you big bum you do what miss pat say did he shuffle off toward the boat it was fully five minutes before the breed got the launch out of the boathouse and alongside the little wharf in front of the cabin during this time patricia had not removed her binoculars from the inspection of the buoy im betting nobody got that mail this time she declared she kept her glasses fixed on the box as boat face guided the launch out at no time had she seen anything suspicious the floating mail box was an ordinary buoy with a container countersunk in the top it turned and bobbed with the waves being anchored by a light chain to a heavy concrete weight capturing the box with the aid of a boat hook patricia opened it the container was empty but this is impossible patricia exclaimed incredulously i saw mail put in it ive watched it since every instant werewolf mumbled boat face and shrugged beefy shoulders patricia examined the buoy box the mail container had no lock since thieves were scarce in this region however a wave could not possibly have tossed the mail out patricia had boat face run the launch in a big circle she could not find a thing to shed light on the mystery her face was somewhat white as the launch swerved shoreward i cant understand it patricia said grimly werewolf muttered boat face him heap bad customer the girl ignored the redskins prognostications she leveled her binoculars inquiringly at the shore line the cliffs were cracked here and there by canyons scratched by watercourses huge boulders were piled at the foot of the cliffs some of these were fully as large as city apartment houses i dont see a thing she said werewolf him can disappear said boat face you say werewolf to me again and im going to have tiny work out on you snapped patricia boat face subsided uneasily boat face was something rare in the brotherhood of red men a henpecked husband most bucks make their squaws walk a chalk line but not boat face on occasion the lethargic tiny would shed her stoical air long enough to give boat face what metropolitan cops call a good shellacking the implement which tiny used was the same as that employed by her paleface sisters a rolling pin did you ever hear of doc savage patricia asked suddenly me no hear of him said boat face flinching as if he had felt his squaws rolling pin hes a cousin of mine said patricia he lives in the united states i understand he does remarkable things what kind of things asked boat face he gets people out of trouble unh boat face grunted expressively how him make money out of business like that he doesnt do it for money if what ive heard is true patricia announced he goes all over the world and helps others and doesnt charge them anything he just does it for the excitement sound like him crazy boat face offered patricia frowned at the servant youre getting a bit insolent lately boat face she said pointedly you tink so eh boat face asked indifferently i dont think i know the girl snapped me not care what damn gal tinks said boat face plainly sneering bronzehaired patricia sprang suddenly to her feet she shot forward like a metallic tigress her small right fist swung with the timing and precision of a trained boxers boat face saw it coming he tried to dodge was a fraction too late pop patricias knuckles caught him in the right eye the blow had snap and power boat faces arm flailed he wavered off balance then toppled overboard patricia ran to the rudder as the launch left the floundering brave behind she turned the craft back came alongside and with her boat hook hauled boat face over the gunwale you apologize for swearing at me she gritted or ill knock you overboard again boat face squirmed he was a greatly embarrassed redskin if this ever got out the other indians would laugh him out of canada he had not dreamed miss patricia was such a hellcat me sorry he muttered starting right now you are going to jump quick when i give you an order patricia informed him yesm said boat face meekly the first thing you are going to do in the morning is to take the launch down the coast to the nearest telegraph office and send a telegram patricia advised who telegram go to to doc savage patricia said grimly i need his help in preparing for the night the cabin windows and doors were locked this done it seemed impossible that any one could enter without creating an alarm patricia did not think it necessary for the two servants and herself to stand guard night came a tidal wave of gloom that poured in from the eastward darkness crawled down the canyons like predatory black monsters stalking the sun boat face had quarters in a small room at the rear of the cabin his ample mate occupied the same cubicle tiny was a substantial squaw k was doubtful if anything would ever excite her enough to spoil her sleep she began to snore with astonishing promptness soon after she had retired boat face had been careful to remain awake he knew how soundly his squaw slept after tiny had snored a half dozen times boat face eased silently out of his small room and crept to the door of the chamber occupied by patricia savage he listened intently an ear mashed to the wooden panel regular breathing assured him patricia was asleep careful to make no noise boat face sidled to the barkcovered pillar in the living room fumbling until he located the secret catch he pressed it the concealed door in the timber flew soundlessly open heap good boat face breathed still here me use him for bait to croak urn damn werewolf yah boat face not as dumb as everbody seem tink around here patricia had replaced the ivory cube boat face withdrew the white block he fingered it hefted it an evil grin warped his swarthy face he swiped a greedy tongue over his lips he seemed to indulge in deep thought for a time then he returned the cube to its hiding place and closed the cleverly constructed door after this he let himself out into the night his first stop was at the boathouse there he carefully unscrewed the plug in the gasoline storage barrel and let the fluid gurgle out then he emptied the launch tank nobody go from here to send telegram for doc savage he chuckled not right away soon anyhow now me go fix trap quitting the boathouse he faded into the brush the night swallowed him boat face was gone nearly an hour when he appeared again in the vicinity of the cabin his manner was equally furtive as before he felt of his clothing and made a disgusted face he was soaked with water to the armpits trap him all k he chuckled then he stood in the murk near the cabin pondering damn squaw will want to know how me get wet he muttered once me no tell she use rolling pin as if to banish that possibility boat face started to remove his wet clothing the process was hardly under way however when a low hissing came out of the gloom it was faint and had apparently originated some distance away boat faces manner showed that he had heard this hiss before and that it had a definite meaning he fastened the buttons he had loosened then crept off in the gloom toward the source of the hiss his objective proved to be a clump of spruce two hundred yards distant these trees narrowly missed growing as thick as hair boat face came to a stop near the dense covert cough up then ive got the five hundred you were to get for delivering it five hundred not enough pronounced boat face the man in the thicket cursed softly so youre a welsher eh welsher what him asked boat face its a guy who makes an agreement and dont go through with it the other gritted me want ten thousand dollars boat face announced a choking sound came out of the spruce so jesse james has put on feathers me no like funny guys boat face said sullenly ten thousand dollars put up or shut up now listen indian the other argued angrily we played square with you we even took you into our confidence and told you what the ivory block is and why we wanted it and now youre welshing put up or shut up boat face insisted the unseen man was briefly silent shut up it is he said abruptly there was a sharp swishing sound a note that was half a whistle it was followed by a dull thud which resembled a rock falling into mud boat face pitched soundlessly backward the hilt of a knife protruded from his chest over the heart and he gave only a few weak squirmings while he died the killer crawled from the spruce thicket at once he kept on hands and knees making him seem sinister more spiderlike than human he had a handkerchief bound over his face mask fashion shut up it was he snarled at the lifeless boat face a shutup for you with eager fingers he searched for the ivory cube searched again he fell to cursing in a low guttural voice which had suddenly betrayed a trace of foreign accent then he cursed aloud the ivory cube was not in boat faces clothing some minutes later a curious conclave took place in a deep canyon far up on the mountain side the meeting was held on the waterworn stone bottom of the canyon stygian realms never produced a more intense darkness than that which gorged the scene of the conference several men were present not one of them could see his fellows in the ebony void i made a hell of a bad move announced the man who had thrown the knife that brought death to boat face i should have searched him before i croaked him you are telling us snarled another voice how was i to know he didnt have the ivory cube the killer defended the milk is spilled hombre why cry said a man with a marked spanish accent thats an idea agreed the slayer the redskin probably didnt have the cube at all my guess is that the girl still has it well soon get it from her si si but what if the senorita savage does not know where it is she knows her old man would tell her possibly and it is possible too that we made a mistake in disposing of the senor alex savage in such haste he caught me talkin to that redskin didnt he snarled boat faces slayer it looked like my best move to put him out of the way and let the redskin get the cube si si agreed the other amiably you are not being criticized my friend our chief may not like this however but we will consider other matters you got the letter from the buoy box the query was addressed to another member of the sinister gathering sure replied the man who had been spoken to it wasnt a letter though it was a telegram the man now thumbed on a flashlight the brilliant beam splattering at his feet disclosed a contrivance which vaguely resembled a gas mask this was a selfcontained diving lung the diving lung held the explanation of how the man had gotten the letter from the buoy box without being seen by patricia savage he had merely weighted himself marched to the float underwater climbed the mooring line and reached into the box in the poor light of dusk patricia had not seen his hand enter the container the man extracted a telegram from a pocket this is it a gnarled brown hand whipped out and snatched both the telegram and the mans flashlight the telegram was exposed under the beam que icistima exploded the man who had seized the message what a pity this is from doc savage to his uncle whom he evidently does not know is dead but it asks if the esteemed uncle got the telegram in which the senor doc savage said he was coming for a visit they did not chuckled a man we secured that message as we did this one it is evident that senor doc savage suspects something is wrong said the one who had read the telegram that is bad someone laughed fiercely the boss will take care of that si si agreed the man with the telegram he is very ingenious that maestro of ours he will thoroughly dispose of this doc savage a few minutes later the sinister gathering dispersed chapter strange attackers the train was still driving its way westward excitement and tragedy hovering over it girlfaced el rabanos waved his arms and screamed this man savage is the murderer renny shook fists that were larger than brickbats rumbling say that again sissyfaced squirt and ill hit you so hard youll turn into a grease spot monks pig habeas corpus squealed violently senor corto oveja glared and shrilled i too think senor savage is the murderer pretty senorita oveja put hands over her mouth to crowd back sobs she made no accusations either way the train was in a general uproar it had been thus for more than two hours the dead form of wilkie the conductor was still sprawled in its crimson puddle on the pullman washroom floor his murderer was as yet uncaught with the noisy violence of latin temperaments senor oveja and el rabanos had shouted the length of the train that doc savage was the killer they were still shouting insistently the very noisiness of their assertion was producing an effect this man savage suggested the mission on which the conductor was killed el rabanos repeated for probably the dozenth time that mission was ridiculous in the first place snapped senor oveja it was to summon and question all spanish people on this train i notice theres a lot of them renny said pointedly you have heard their story el rabanos snapped they are going to a convention of a spanish society being held on the pacific coast this was true on the train were about a dozen individuals of spanish ancestry without exception they declared they were going to the meeting of the society the news butcher on the train had found a story in one of his papers which proved there actually was such a meeting scheduled doc was not under arrest but that was simply because there happened to be no officers on the train the most unpleasant of recent developments from docs standpoint was the work of senor oveja the senor had dispatched a telegram to the mounted police at the trains next stop asking that officers be on hand to arrest doc this was a through train it had not paused since the discovery of wilkies body senor oveja had dropped his message at a small depot as the train had flashed past it renny sidled close to doc it is is beginning to look bad he said in a low voice there is not the slightest clue to show who murdered wilkie girlfaced el rabanos sprang forward shouting these men should not be allowed to talk together they may plot an escape doc savage shrugged wearily and sat down would you mind bringing a glass of water renny he asked glad to said renny there was a long glass cylinder mounted in a corner of the coach this held paper cups which dropped out when one inserted a penny renny ignored these he wandered off to the regions of the diner after a bit renny was back carrying a plain glass beaker brimful of cold water doc drank the water holding the empty glass in both hands he toyed with it as he addressed entrancingly pretty senorita oveja i wonder if you would do me a favor he asked what the young woman inquired shortly tell me why you think i am your enemy el rabanos put in wrathfully that is information which we shall give to the mounted police would i like to smear that face of yours renny thundered at el rabanos here doc said and handed renny the glass renny took the beaker there was a strange expression on his long puritanical face renny departed as if he were returning the water glass to where he had gotten it seemingly with no particular purpose in mind gaunt johnny and pale long tom sauntered off together twirling his sword cane ham was next to leave the group the pig habeas corpus under an arm monk trailed after the dapper lawyer ham was inviting monk to quit following him around as they passed out of hearing we should keep an eye on those men el rabanos declared fat chance theyve got of getting off the train somebody told him were hitting all of sixty miles an hour doc savage went to a writing desk and selected a book of telegram blanks he addressed a message to the mounted police at the metropolis where the train next stopped advise you have station and vicinity brilliantly lighted when our train arrives stop also have enough troopers on hand to see that no one escapes stop confident something criminal underfoot doc savage doc tied the telegram in his handkerchief first weighting it with two silver dollars then he opened the window he did this in plain view not wishing to have somebody get excited and take a shot at him he consulted his watch then waited he had studied the timetable earlier and knew they were due to pass through a small town in a few moments the train whistle moaned a pinpoint eye of light opened in the distance this approached with a rush it was the illuminated window of a railway station the little depot looked like a match box in the headlight glare standing in front of the station was a man who wore a green eyeshade and had black dust protectors over his shirt sleeves the accouterments stamped him as the telegraph operator doc threw his message as the train hooted past considering the terrific speed his aim was uncanny the handkerchief the telegram inside all but bounced into the operators hands in the act of closing the window doc noted something from the corner of an eye senor oveja was bending over the desk where the telegram had been written he hastily sauntered away from the desk when he saw doc observing him doc gave no sign of having noticed he knew what senor oveja was doing at the desk there had been a sheet of carbon paper in the pad upon which doc had written his message senor oveja had read this carbon copy of docs wire it was possible the senor imagined he had done a neat bit of detecting as a matter of fact doc had left the carbon copy deliberately uncovered and had been careful that the senor saw it doc wanted to see what senor ovejas reaction would be he learned little the senor kept his thoughts well concealed through the next half hour doc savage remained within sight of the writing desk he wanted to observe any others who might seek to get a look at the carbon copy no one else went near the desk the train charged recklessly through the night swooping across bridges with a thunderous moan and panting noisily over grades some sage once wrote that the presence of death makes people silent he should have been on that train he would have heard more conversation than at a chamberofcommerce luncheon in smokers diners pullmans day coaches discussion waged a number of uninformed persons had never heard of doc savage these were speedily enlightened by their neighbors one man spoke steadily for five minutes reciting the remarkable ability of doc savage and the things he had accomplished he finished with this man savage is a person of mystery not much is known about him oh yeah snorted his listener a mystery eh and you just told me more about him than you can tell me about the prince of wales what i mean is savage dont parade his feats around in public the other explained he dont brag for instance take his five helpers theres an engineer a chemist a lawyer a geologist and an electrical expert what do you know about them i have heard this in their respective lines they are among the most learned men in the world was the reply thats right declared the first man yet doc savage is a greater expert in these lines engineering chemistry law archaeology and electricity than his aides and hes just as proficient in many other lines they say be is beyond a doubt in the least the greatest living surgeon sounds like a fairy tale sure it does agreed the other just the same i dont think this bronze man murdered the conductor and id hate to be the fellow who did savage will get him sure heedless of this discussion and many others along similar lines doc savage returned to his drawingroom hardly had he entered when his sharp eyes noted something amis a folded newspaper reposed in the wastebasket he had not placed it there his movements unhurried the bronze man locked the drawingroom door then he went to the basket and investigated the newspaper was one published in the large town they had passed through some hours before the division point where unfortunate wilkie had gone on duty it was at this town that senor and senorita oveja and el rabanos had boarded the train the newspaper was folded so as to enwrap a knife the long blade of this was still smeared with gore docs practiced eye measured the width of the blade he decided it would exactly fit the wound which had caused wilkies death opening one of his many hand bags stacked in the compartment doc drew out a powerful magnifying glass he used it on the knife hilt finger prints had been wiped off doc opened the window and threw the knife out into the night far from the plunging train glancing at his watch doc saw they would soon reach the next stop within thirteen minutes to be exact precisely nine minutes later the holocaust broke from beneath the train came a sudden scream of steel on steel it was like the wail of a demented monster the cars rocked in sickening fashion doc savage plunged the length of the drawingroom but brought up lightly against the bulkhead in the coaches passengers were hurled against seats parcels and suitcases fell off the overhead racks in the diners dishes hit the floors as if tossed by invisible scoop shovels in the mail cars clerks brought up in tangles with their sacks doc savage unlocked the drawingroom door wrenched it open and whipped out the steely screeching underfoot died slowly the train was coming to an unbelievably quick stop doc leaned from a window with a final squeal of brakes the train became entirely stationary it was no mean feat of agility which doc performed now he managed to stand erect outside on the narrow ledge of the train window one of his hands stretched up groped and found a projection on the roof the practiced swing of a gymnast put him atop the coach from this vantage point he could see as far as darkness permitted what was occurring somewhat more than a quarter of a mile ahead of the rest of the train the locomotive was just coming to a standstill in some manner the engine had become detached no doubt the air brakes were adjusted to stop the coaches instantly in such an emergency doc savage ran forward along coach tops it was his guess that some one possibly traveling over the tops of the coaches as he was doing had severed the connection between the engine and cars doc hoped to glimpse the malefactor at the forward end of the train doc dropped to the side of the tracks and conducted a brief examination there was a film of grease and dust on the connecting mechanism this was smudged where a hand had grasped it from his pocket doc produced a small flashlight it gave an intense white beam no thicker than a pencil whoever had caused the locomotive to separate from the train had worn gloves there were no finger prints the engine was backing slowly to rejoin its lost string of coaches with an ease that would have amazed an onlooker doc regained the top of the train he ran rearward he was taking no chances it seemed he had violent enemies on the train they might chance a shot at him swinging down he reentered his drawingroom no one was there plucking a hand bag out of his luggage heap doc opened it he lifted out a metal contraption which resembled a pocketsize magic lantern the lens of this was almost black doc turned a switch on the side of the contraption apparently nothing happened then doc went to a shelf over the washbowl and picked up a large water glass the glass had not been on the shelf when he departed it was the same beaker in which renny had brought doc the drink of water doc held the glass in front of the lens of the thing that looked like a magic lantern what happened was startling to the naked eye there was nothing unusual about the glass certainly no writing was visible but the instant doc held the beaker before the magic lantern written letters sprang out in a dazzling electric blue the writing at the top was in a script so perfect that it might have been done by an engraver it was docs own handwriting it read all five of you shadow senor oveja his daughter and el rabanos below this was another communication done in a more scrawling hand this one read the three of them prepared to leave the train just before it stopped doc it looks suspicious although they might have intended to get off at the next station senor oveja is wearing a big white panama hat that you cant mistake were trailing them there was no more doc dropped the glass and crushed it to fragments under a heel then he switched off the lantern contrivance pocketed it and stepped out in the corridor moving swiftly he began a search of the train doc savage did many things which to the layman were puzzling and sometimes inexplicable always he had a reason for what he did his method of communicating with his friends by leaving writing on glass writing quite invisible to the naked eye was something to amaze one unfamiliar with the bronze giant when doc had asked for water the bigfisted renny had understood that what his bronze chief wanted was a tablet on which to write some orders the writing was done with a bit of strange chalk its markings were almost undetectable until exposed to ultraviolet light then it would fluoresce showing in blue the lantern contrivance doc had used was an ultraviolet projector passengers stood in aisles in the coaches feeling tenderly of spots which had been bruised when the train stopped so suddenly a few had clambered out and stood beside the track not many had done this there is something which makes the average man reluctant to leave his train when it stops a subtle fear that he will get left behind when the train starts again doc savage walked all the way to the baggage cars and back again to the observation coach his giant stature the remarkable bronze hue of his skin drew much attention passengers stared without exception they had heard the gossip concerning this giant man with the golden eyes everyone knew the bronze man had been accused of stabbing wilkie to death but no one showed an inclination to stop doc the metallic giant did not look like a safe fellow to meddle with doc reflected that events must have occurred swiftly while be was forward making his unsuccessful hunt for whoever had separated the engine from the train nowhere on the train could be seen senor corto oveja his attractive daughter or the girlfaced el rabanos they had vanished from the group of swarthy passengers who claimed they were en route to the meeting of a spanish society four were missing docs five men were also not to be found even the pig habeas corpus was gone doc came out on the observation platform at the conclusion of his search he noted a man with a red lantern standing some distance down the track that would be a flagman sent hack to guard against a rearend collision from forward came a low crash this traveled the length of the train like a rock bouncing downstairs the locomotive had hooked on the whistle blared the man with the lantern came running back the train was preparing to go on doc savage vaulted over the observation platform rail landing lightly on cinders and gravel the brakeman running with his head down did not see doc savage the passengers who had stepped off the train were too busy climbing back on to notice the departure of the bronze man the locomotive whistled again then began to chug mightily and spew steam the train moved slowly at first but gathering speed the tail lights went past they looked like little eyes on a monster snake which was crawling backwards the serpent monster lost itself and its roaring in the distance the blacker gloom in the lee of a large rock seemed to detach itself and scud along the track doc savage had become a soundless phantom from a coat pocket he drew the rather bulky black metal box which was his ultraviolet lantern he switched this on and played its invisible beam before him shortly a tiny arrowshaped mark sprang out in dazzling electric blue it was drawn on top of a rock with the chalk which doc and his men employed to exchange secret communications doc glided in the direction which the arrow indicated two rods and he found a second pointer from a pocket doc extracted his small flashlight his men trailing their enemies no doubt had left these arrows to indicate the direction they had taken doc intended to inspect the track and find just how many individuals his friends were following he thumbed the flash on to his left a machine gun opened up its deadly cackle was like thesound of a gigantic cricket doc savage seemed to melt down before the hideous gabble of noise and the moaning stream of jacketed lead chapter the man in the white hat the stuttering of the rapidfirer ended as abruptly as it had started the last few empty cartridges to jump from the ejector mechanism tinkled brassily on the rocks there was no sound after that but the mad flight of a rabbit which had been frightened out of its wits by the sudden uproar eventually that noise also died away bueno hissed a voice that amigos settles our troubles si a low whisper agreed men advanced from the sound of their movements there were four of them they strode warily un fosforo commanded one a match there was a tiny clatter of safety matches in a box the box scraped open but no match was lighted one of the marauders screeched the sound was awful as if invisible hands had seized his heart and were tearing it out the ghastly peal trailed off in a sob a sob like water pouring through a pipe the other three skulkers were brave enough they leaped to assist their companion que hay yelled one what is the matter he found out soon enough something seized his left arm something which crushed flesh against bone with an awful pressure the arm went numb with pain it had no more feeling than a thick cord attached to his body and by that cord the man was abruptly lifted and flung far to one side as he slammed down in brush and rocks the man was quite sure that it could not have been a human hand which had seized him it must have been some hulking colossus of the night he was wrong the other two men became aware of the truth for their groping hands and striking fists encountered a form unmistakably human en verdad choked one indeed it is the bronze hombre our lead missed him the four men seeing doc sink as their shots roared naturally supposed he was done for not knowing the blinding speed with which the bronze giant moved they had been too optimistic doc had been warned in advance by a faint click as a machinegun safety was released and had dropped in time to get clear but some rapidfirer slugs had come so close that his ears still rang with their whine one of the wouldbe killers tried to use his machine gun the weapon muttered deafeningly the bullets dug up a cloud of dust doc seized the gun pulled and got its hideous gobbling stilled before it could do any damage then came a new development somewhere near by running feet sounded reinforcements arriving doc listened wondering if they were his own men they were not a guttural ejaculation in spanish told him that flashlight beams blinding funnels of white jumped from the hands of the newcomers the glare illuminated doc one of the new arrivals fired a revolver had doc not pitched violently to one side that bullet would have ended his career it was well aimed doc savage had for much of his life walked in the shadow of peril and sudden death many men had sought to end his existence by violent means to kill in defense of his own life frequently seemed imperative yet doc never did that the bronze mans enemies by no means went unscathed they frequently perished but always in traps of their own setting doc did not take life with his own hands doc still held the machine gun which he had seized he could have fired upon the approaching gunmen his chances of downing them were excellent for there seemed to be only two but because of the darkness he knew he would have to kill rather than merely wound flinging aside in a leap that was of almost incredible length doc temporarily evaded the white funnels of the flashlights doubling low he raced from the vicinity the surrounding terrain was level boulders and brush were both small and would conceal a man only if he lay prone and perfectly still doc was forced to race fifty yards before he found adequate cover twice in that distance flashlights found him and guns cackled noisily one bullet cut his coat across the shoulders but did not open his bronze skin this was excellent shooting since doc was traveling at great speed he ducked into the shelter of a boulder and waited the newcomers smashed out more random bullets they made no effort at pursuit instead they helped the four they had rescued to stand erect the whole party retreated at a wild run doc promptly set out after them he deemed it wise to go slowly for they blasted frequent bullets in his direction at first because it would be very dangerous he made no effort to overhaul the group once they reached rough going he intended to whip close to them he suddenly quickened his pace the rusty squeak of barbed wire against staples had told him the men were mounting a fence an automobile engine burst into noisy life headlights came on the car rocketed away there was a road beyond the fence very dusty but wide and well graded doc stood in it and watched the receding car the taillight bulb had been extinguished so he could not read the license number a flight of bullets came up the road from the receding auto and doc hastily quitted the thoroughfare going back to the scene of the fight he dabbed his flashlight beam about tracks were numerous docs practiced eye measured these for possible future reference he gathered up several empty machinegun and revolver cartridges beside a studded bush he found his chief clew this was an extremely white panama hat wide of brim and high of crown inside the sweatband of the hat printed in gold lettering was a name oveja thanks to the darkness doc had not glimpsed the features of any of his attackers the first four had been sprawled on the ground when the two rescuers appeared with their flashlights had they been on their feet doc might have glimpsed their faces doc recalled the message in invisible chalk which one of his five men had left on the water glass it had stated that senor oveja had donned a large white panama and who had read docs wire asking the mounted police to surround the train on arrival oveja of course switching on his ultraviolet lantern doc resumed what he had been doing when the attack came following the arrow markers left by his men the indicators jumped out in unearthly blue flame at frequent intervals the route angled away from the railroad tracks and mounted a hill beyond the hill lights were arrayed like whitehot beads strung on taut wires the spots of iridescence were street lamps of the town which the train had been nearing when it had stopped so suddenly it was not a large metropolis only a few thousand in population doc savage followed the luminous arrows down the slope they turned paralleling the railroad when the trail dropped into a small gulley he used his flashlight which gave a light as bright as burning magnesium the sandy gulch floor was pocked with tracks to an individual of average perception they would have looked pretty much alike an experienced tracker might have known from the depth of the prints that two of the men making the tracks were very heavy and that one was a woman doc savage however read the prints like a chart he picked out the tracks of his five men he knew their every peculiarity from the fact that monk and renny the giants made deep big prints to the straight military preciseness of hams walk with the little irregularity when the lawyer twiddled his sword cane when he had the five segregated three sets remained these had been walked over by docs aides so he knew his friends were trailing the three persons two of the quarry were men the other a woman her prints were highheeled and very feminine near the edge of town the trail turned abruptly and began to circle the settlement doc studied the town judging its size from the street lights in small villages telegrams were usually handled from the railway station this borough looked large enough to have an office uptown deserting the trail doc entered a street and ran along it his pace would have taxed a proficient sprinter but even after he had traversed several blocks the bronze mans breathing had not quickened appreciably his mighty muscles were conditioned by regular exercise until they seemed to show no more fatigue than the metal of a machine the telegraph office was nested in the front of a brick hotel it was brilliantly lighted and relays were cheeping on the instrument table on duty was an exceedingly tall and freckled young man whose hair stood up like the coiffure of a fiji islander i want information about certain telegrams which may have come here tonight doc told him that is against the rules the young man replied promptly doc brought a wallet out this held numerous cards he selected one particular pasteboard from the collection in that wallet does this make it any different he asked and exhibited the card the young man looked then whistled softly ill say it does the card was signed by the highest official of the company and informed all employees that doc savage was to receive every assistance possible no matter of what nature or what the possible consequences going behind the counter doc sorted through carbon copies of messages received that evening he found his own communication addressed to the local mounted police there was also a wire signed by senor corto oveja asking the mounties to arrest doc as soon as the train arrived the prize however was one signed simply john smith it was addressed to sam smith doc eyed the body of the message at first glance the thing seemed unintelligible the stuff sounded like bad poetry the horse of iron he saw the city fleas away did run and that very swiftly stop man oh man was the gas buggy handy doc read the doggerel again its meaning became clear it was simply a message from john smith to sam smith advising that the train would be deserted at the edge of town and that an automobile should be on hand the smith names were probably fakes remember the fellow who received this doc asked yep said the operator eagerly there was two of them they came in and asked if there was a message for sam smith i remembered them because of the funny way that message sounded describe them doc requested both were short and darkskinned they wore greasy coveralls i saw an aviators helmet sticking from the hip pocket of each man fliers and strangers in town eh yes sir the telegrapher was beginning to look awed gee whiz say i just happened to think that ive heard of you arent you the doc savage the newspapers carry stories about the fellow they call the man of mystery arent you the man who just got back from arabia where you took a submarine and followed an underground river under the desert and at the end of the river you found ill use your wires doc told the frizzlehaired operator he had not changed expression but he was a bit embarrassed hero worship got docs goat when he was the subject of admiration he examined the john smith telegram it had been sent from a small way station on the railroad some fifty miles back doc opened the telegraph key a moment later he was in communication with the station from which the message had been sent he described the missive in which he was interested it was thrown off the fast train reported the distant telegrapher but i didnt get a look at the party who threw it was it handwritten doc queried over the wire it was printed the other replied doc closed the key and stood up since the message was printed there was no chance of tracing the author by his handwriting the freckled frizzlehaired young man stared at doc in openmouthed amazement he had been listening to the wire talk he had just heard some of the fastest and most perfect handsent morse to which he had ever listened it had been as rapid as if sent with a fast automatic key a bug the freckled young man had not believed such a thing possible leaving the telegraph office and its stunned manager doc resumed the luminousarrow trail left by his friends he had sprinted the entire distance from the telegraph office he continued running as he followed the trail around the fringe of the settlement his course led a prowling dog sighting the bronze man began to growl fiercely cut it out old fellow doc called the calm friendliness of the mighty mans tone had a marked effect upon the dog it exchanged tailwagging for growling doc was forced to toss a rock near the dog to keep the suddenly friendly animal from following him this was another example of the remarkable things his great voice could do unexpectedly doc came upon monk the homely chemist was sprawled flat on the ground the pig habeas corpus lay comfortably beside him hands up monk growled grab a cloud he had failed to recognize doc bite him pig doc ordered dryly habeas corpus promptly stood up and bit furiously at monk monk dodged much to the homely chemists disgust somebody had recently taught his pet pig the trick of biting the nearest human when told to do so monk was usually the victim of these nips he suspected the dapper ham had taught the pig the trick where is the rest of the gang asked doc monk waved a furry arm in the gloom theyre watching that joint over there doc peered into the night he made out a building which resembled a gigantic square hatbox an airplane hangar sure said monk theres a little flying field over there senor oveja the girl and el rabanos are in the hangar youre sure senor oveja is there doc asked quickly you bet weve been right on their heels since they left the train he couldnt have slipped away senor oveja has been wearing his white panama hat doc queried monks voice was very small in the murk he tossed that aside before he left the train what made him do it dont know for sure monk said it looked like el rabanos pointed out that the white hat would show up plain in the dark doc informed monk of the attack which had come as he followed the trail the first four men to jump me might have been off the train he declared from what i learned at the telegraph office the other two were obviously fliers waiting near by in a car monk grunted softly renny said he saw a black monoplane that seemed to be following our train that was just before dark it might have been carrying the two who got the telegram at this town doc admitted this thing is sure a mess monk muttered it shapes up like this senor oveja his daughter and el rabanos are after you another gang is after them and also you and the motivation behind the whole thing is a deep black mystery doc agreed lets collar the three in the hangar here and see what we can dig out of them as if touched off by the decision a hollow roaring burst from the airplane hangar blazes monk barked theyve started up a plane he raced for the hangar the pig habeas corpus bounced after him squealing and grunting with each jump doc joined monk in the race both heard metal doors on the hangar rasp open a plane jumped out of the structure its exhaust stack was a fiery mouth that slavered sparks its roar was like cannonading except for one thing doc and his men might have seized the planes occupants it was doubtful if those in the craft knew of the presence of their pursuers had the wind been coming from straight ahead they would undoubtedly have stopped in front of the hangar to warm the engine before taking off but the wind was in the opposite direction it was necessary to taxi across the field before taking the air the pilot decided to warm his engine while doing that away the ship went it rolled too swiftly even for docs fleet running landing lights jutted fans of incandescence from the wing tips of the airplane reaching the far edge of the tarmac the plane taxied around and took off it was a large yellow biplane with a cabin for six chapter the ivorycube trail doc savages other men came pounding through the night bigfisted renny was leading five of us renny boomed disgustedly and we let em get away six of us doc corrected we could have shot em down of course rumbled renny but the girl was aboard the plane the sky was like an overturned bowl of black cotton into it the moaning yellow biplane crawled lets see if theres another plane in the hangar doc rapped they raced back for the black box of a hangar reaching it doc cast his flash beam into the structure theres a crate renny thundered no two of em the planes were small one was a monoplane the other an open cockpit neither accommodated more than two passengers renny ran to the biplane it looked the speedier he latched out the choke then bounded around in front to spin the prop but his huge hands only dropped listlessly from the metal blade he glared at the engine itself holy cow he muttered theyve got us stumped doc came around and inspected the plane engine they did it very simply too he said dryly they just smashed all the spark plugs theres no need of replacing them the other plane will be gone before we can get in the air doc had been moving as he spoke his last word came from near the door the other five hastily followed the bronze mans rapid movements showed he had a plan whats up monk demanded lets see how fast you are on those bow legs of yours doc suggested heading for town doc set a pace which he judged was about the fastest speed the others could travel it was not slow they were all adept at running monk short gorilla legs going like pistons brought up the rear at his heels trailed habeas corpus the pig could run like a dog but as before the porker was squealing with every jump cut that out or ill kick you loose from your appetite monk advised the homely shoat habeas corpus at once stopped squealing that pig has brains im telling you monk shouted thats more than can be said for the guy who owns him ham replied nastily the purpose of their pellmell progress was still a mystery to docs five men they exchanged puzzled looks when doc entered town and went straight to the telegraph office do you know the surrounding country doc asked the frizzlehaired operator the young man replied ive hunted over most of it mountainous and timbered isnt it you bet i want you to point out all fields which are level enough to land an airplane on doc told him dont count the local airport unless theres more than one the young man seized a pencil which dangled from the counter by a chain planked a telegraph blank on the counter and drew a map his movements were rapid theres only three level places near town he explained one is about a mile north the other two are at least five miles out theres only one local airport you said not to count it so im not doc savage nodded at monk and ham you two pals go to the field farthest out the other three of you take the next one ill go to the nearest were after that black monoplane renny rumbled suddenly enlightened right doc agreed grab taxicabs for the trips doc and his men separated in front of the telegraph office all but doc went hunting taxicabs deciding not to bother himself with a cab doc headed northward through town the distance to the field was only a mile chances were that he would lose time hunting a hack the little metropolis was quiet every other street light had been extinguished to conserve electricity very few houses were illuminated overhead the clouds abruptly parted and let moonlight spill down after the earlier darkness the moon rays seemed as brilliant as sunlight trees along the thoroughfare were scrawny probably because of the cold winters here in canada the shrubs and the houses cast moon shadows dwellings became scattered then abruptly ceased doc crossed a washboard of small black hills gullies gaped here and there as if the skin of the earth had cracked the road was narrow graded only in spots bridges were crude spans of logs earthcovered apparently the road saw little travel indeed according to the telegraphers map the road terminated shortly beyond the field which was docs destination it was a lane leading to a ranch home doc kept on it his long strides eating up distance soon the road dipped two hundred yards ahead in the moonlight doc distinguished a gate beyond that was a patch of level meadow a black raven of a monoplane stood at the meadows edge some distance from the gate without slackening his pace doc came up on his toes making less noise thus he could see no one in or near the black plane but he was taking no chances small hills reared beyond the meadows suddenly the tops of these became weirdly white it was as if an invisible hand had spilled thin snow upon them then doc discarded all caution put on more speed for he knew what the whiteness meant a car was coming up the road behind him and its headlights had bleached the hill he heard the engine mumble the machine was coming fast doc had hoped to reach the ebony monoplane but that he saw now was impossible the neighborhood was unpleasantly hare of vegetation which might furnish shelter a mowing machine stood near the gate its moon shadow made a spidery hump of gloom doc took shelter behind the mowing machine the automobile clattered up tire treads squealing and throwing dust it stopped at the gate the car was a sedan very shiny with good care but a model some three years old it had all the marks of a car hired from a rental agency the sedan was jammed with men in the glare of the moonlight doc could count six men all were swarthy complexioned four of them had been on the passenger train the other two attired in greasy coveralls were obviously the aviators who had called at the telegraph office a man clambered from the rear of the car and walked ahead to open the gate doc savage usually wore a vest of pliable leather under his outer clothing this vest had numerous pockets and these held ingenious devices apparatus with which doc savage could cope with almost any emergency the vest now reposed in his baggage wherever that might now be doc was beaded for a vacation and had not been wearing the vest he was emptyhanded there was no doubt but that these six men were armed under such conditions the course of safety was to remain under cover doc quitted the shelter of the mowing machine and glided up to the car he had little expectation of reaching the sedan unobserved nor did he ver cried one of the gang see the bronze devil the men in the machine seemed to go through a convulsion as they grabbed for weapons the driver let the clutch out the car went forward like a thing kicked doc had anticipated that the sedan would spring into motion he had reasoned that by the time it reached the gate it would be going too swiftly for the man there to spring aboard his logic was right and wrong the man at the gate was caught off guard moreover he must have been a nervous individual as the uproar burst forth he gave one long leap in the wrong direction he was directly in the path of the car the sedan hit him and bore him down as if he were a weed for a moment after he disappeared ugly crunchings and crackings came from under the machine the sounds were those of monster jaws munching when the unlucky man appeared again behind the rear bumper he was shapeless inside the car guns began a hollow coughing the windows were up holes appeared in them the car pushed its radiator snout through the gate with a roar of splintering wood ducking and weaving doc savage ran after the machine until he reached the gate the post on which the gate was swung was large and offered more adequate shelter against bullets than the mowing machine doc ducked behind it and made himself as thin as possible the car was headed for the plane it traveled too swiftly for those in it to do accurate shooting probably twenty shots were fired only two of them hit docs post the rest made short sharp sounds which were strangely remindful of shrilly barking prairie dogs in the road the man who had been run over was moaning and groaning feebly the sedan careened to a stop near the black plane using revolvers four of the men fired steadily in docs direction the other two worked at getting the plane motor started taking a chance doc dashed to the man who had been run over the fellow had carried a revolver he must have had it in his hand when the car hit him for the weapon was buried in the dust near by one of the tires had passed squarely over it doc sought to pick the gun up but the cylinder fell out it was a cheap firearm and the metal pin on which the cylinder turned had been snapped by the weight of the car dropping the useless weapon doc whipped back to the post the dangerous foray had been executed with his best speed so swiftly that his foes had hardly perceived his move the plane engine caught with a bang bang and a moan the four swarthy gunmen ceased shooting and piled into the craft the ship began to scud its tail lifting without time for his engine to warm up the pilot pulled off it was his lucky day the engine kept turning and the black bat of a craft clubbed its way up into the moonlight leveling off in the air the black plane headed westward doc savage watched it only long enough to make certain of the direction it was taking then he swung over and knelt beside the man who had gone under the sedan life remained in the fellow he was still moaning doc grasped the man to a bystander the bronze mans manner might have seemed rough but doc knew what he was doing he possessed a fund of surgical lore which was probably unequaled he straightened the victim out until he was more the shape of a human being then using his flashlight doc examined him an x ray would have helped but he learned the important thing without it this man could not live long not a chance fellow doc told him there was no use keeping it from him como dice the mans query was a wispy tortured whisper what did you say his hearing must have been damaged instead of repeating the statement doc savage put a question whats behind all this hombre the mans eyes only stared glassily it was as if he had not heard what are you fellows after doc asked his voice even louder the mans eyes seemed as crystal balls fixed in his bead nothing came past his lips but labored painful breathing who is your boss doc persisted voy a casa said the man i am going home he was delirious strands were breaking in the already thin life thread which suspended him over the infinite abyss doc savage seeking to draw something of value from the delirium leaned close and shouted loudly senor corto oveja oveja gurgled the dying man oveja fool easily tricked tricked by whom doc shouted this query brought no response with the tips of sinewy practiced fingers doc touched the various nerve centers in the broken body his vast knowledge enabled him to alleviate pain in this fashion although even his surgical skill could not save this mans life be might prolong the flow of information such as it was ivory cube gulped the dying man what doc yelled all square and of ivory the fellow moaned in spanish must get it worth many million pesos doc continued his dulling pressure on the nerve centers it was probable that the man did not even know be was being spoken to whatever information that came would be incoherent and by chance rico hombres came the agonized whisper rich men rich men it will make us skeletons under a rock the ivory cube was gone the galleon with the crew of skeletons we cannot find it docs bronze features remained composed but he was about as near bursting with impatience as he ever got the mutterings of this man only deepened the mystery the dying man said loudly and clearly senor oveja and his daughter are fools and easily deceived alex savage and then the man died but what did he mean monk demanded an ivory cube a galleon with a skeleton crew skeletons under a ledge and a lot of pesos what a hash of information to try to make something out of doc savage had assembled his five men and they stood together in the darkness at the edge of town it was well past midnight figuring it out is a swell job for monk dapper ham said in a jeering voice what do you mean monk asked innocently trying to dope it out would drive an ordinary man halfwitted ham assured him politely youre safe meanin im half simple huh monk growled pleasantly he addressed his pig habeas this shyster dont like you and me whatcha say to that t hell with im said the pig at least it sounded as if the pig had replied ham dropped his sword cane and jumped a foot in the air for crying out loud dont he look funny questioned the voice which seemed to come from the pig ham caught on then he grabbed his sword cane straightened and made a pass at monk only by a frenzied leap did monk escape he retreated to safety carrying his pet shoat i didnt know monk was a ventriloquist chuckled long tom the electrical wizard he must have just picked it up a pitiful groan escaped ham doc savage had delayed his recital while the horseplay progressed their escapades rarely got so perilous but that monk and ham could have no spats this was only monks latest scheme to insult the sartorially perfect ham much of what the dying man said was incoherent doc resumed but two fragments of the information were fairly significant johnny the skinny archaeologist took off his spectacles which had the magnifying left lens which were they the reference to money doc explained once he mentioned a hundred million pesos that must be the motivation the loot the gang is after a hundred million pesos monk gasped from the adjacent darkness it may not be that much doc pointed out the fellow was delirious he may have spoken the first large figure that came to his wandering mind the dying man tipped us to one thing we had already guessed mumbled the bigfisted renny senor oveja the guy with the peach of a daughter is being tricked were making headway said the sharptongued ham now will some one kindly explain what was meant by an ivory cube and skeletons under ledges and in boats no one had an answer to that we may see some action before we get it cleared up doc said dryly lets set sail brothers where to ham questioned to see about our baggage doc told him their luggage they discovered after a bit of reconnoitering was locked in the freight room at the local depot the night station agent not only refused to turn it over but when he learned docs identity ran for a mounted policeman it seemed the agent had been advised that doc was wanted for questioning in connection with the death of the conductor wilkie doc glided to the locked freight room the instant the agent was out of sight he had no implement other than the thin blade of a pocket knife which monk produced but he got the lock on the freightroom door open in a bit less than b minute by the time the station agent returned with a mounted policeman doc and his men had lost themselves in the night carrying their various pieces of luggage with them ordinarily doc cooperated freely with the police but just now he did not care to he delayed these mounted police were thoroughgoing they might jail him despite his influence where are we going asked ham trying to balance both his sword cane and his luggage in his arms to the place where this trouble seems to be coming from doc told him alex savages estate chapter cabin of murder all i can say is that we picked some spot for a vacation ham wailed loudly and mournfully the time was somewhat past noon the following day the spot was in the neighborhood of alex savages cabin ive been in a lot of tropical jungles ham continued dolefully but they were boulevards compared to this ham was a man who entertained little liking for getting close to nature he heartily disapproved of all rough going this was not because he could not stand hardship ham could take it what ham did dislike though was seeing his costly welltailored clothes torn off his back clothes were hams passion he would forego anything except possibly a fight to remain sartorially perfect his present garments were rapidly beckoning rags his spirits were sinking accordingly ham had donned a nifty woodsmans outfit before starting on this hike his park avenue tailor had told him it was the proper thing when he purchased it ham had known better at the time but had failed to resist the welltailored lines of the outfit doc wheres a camera monk demanded loudly i want hams picture as he looks now the newspapers would go for it ham glared indignantly the business of reaching alex savages woodland retreat they had found to be no small task doc had searched for an airplane but the only craft available had been an old twoseater biplane locating the owner shortly after dawn doc bought the decrepit ship outright by dint of howling and groaning like a dying thing the old crate had proved it could take three of them off the ground at once lack of landing fields near alex savages cabin had been another obstacle to complicate things a thick fog had been sweeping in from the sea it had taken three hours of flying to even locate alex savages cabin once he had found it doc could discern no sign of life about the place doc had been forced to land something like ten miles from the cabin directly inland four trips had been necessary to carry his friends and their load of baggage now they had been fighting their way through the wilderness for some hours holy cow renny boomed do you reckon they ever got your telegrams into this country doc i understand the mail is brought up the coast by boat doc told him telegrams would probably come in the same way if we only had docs big plane ham groaned the ship to which ham referred was docs enormous speed plane a bus capable of descending on land or water this craft now reposed in docs hidden hangar on the hudson river in new york city with it a landing on the little bay in front of alex savages cabin would have been a simple matter doc had not used the plane to fly to canada simply because he wished to get away from speed and bustle during his vacation for some time they had been following a small river this stream flowed at a terrific pace a great fiat moaning green serpent which shook white spray off its back at frequent intervals the river doc had determined from the air emptied into the tiny bay on the shores of which alex savages large cabin stood look doc said abruptly he leveled an arm fog was crawling through the brush like lazy smoke the vapor lay like a gray mold on the sky stifling sunbeams and making the day almost twilight in the creamy illumination the object which doc indicated was barely discernible it was a fresh grave marked by a cross as they drew nearer it became apparent that the cross was ponderous reaching above docs shoulders it was of wood roughly hewn the grave is only a few days old long tom offered they all walked around to get a look at the inscription on the cross burned into it on a place where the wood had been chiseled flat alex savage my uncle doc said sharply silence wrapped the little group for some minutes their faces were grim discovery of the grave had been a shower of cold water on their spirits that alex savage was blood kin to their bronze chief accounted for part of the gloom settling on the group ordinarily they were inclined to sail grandly through all sorts of perils taking the occurrence of a death as an unpleasant thing which was part of the game but this was different for a little while as they stood there adventure seemed somewhat to lose its tang do you suppose homely monk made a vague gesture i wonder if the death was natural no one replied he had a daughter patricia savage doc said at last the sartorially inclined ham seemed to have forgotten both his ragged garments and his goodnatured enemy monk lets move he muttered graves always get my goat they left their depressing find the grave was on a level shelf of ground the gray fog hung all around like waterlogged curtains doc surmised that the spot overlooked the sea for the way soon dipped sharply downward and they could hear the mushy splashing of waves they scrambled over rocks shouldered through brush behind them the river moaned but they eventually left that sound behind the fog growing more dense swirled about the men like the clammy tentacles of some fabulous colossus no birds sounded in the trees there was no perceptible wind but waves continued to make low splashings in the distance the splashes came at regular intervals and no doubt were the result of a ground swell in the thick fog these sounds might have been the shuffling steps of some spectral wanderer i dont care a lot for this place monk announced were getting near the cabin doc said monk glanced up sharply he wondered how doc had learned that he decided the bronze man had recognized landmarks the truth was that docs sensitive nostrils had caught certain faint odors scents which the others had missed docs olfactory organs were of almost animal keenness for training them was a part of the daily exercise routine which he took unfailingly the vague odor which he had detected was mainly that of gasoline also there were certain flower scents alien to the region which probably came from a womans dressing room too there was the faint odor of wood smoke the smoke tang was old not such as would come from a blazing fire within the next hundred yards the cabin came in sight the sumptuous nature of the rustic establishment created a sensation holy cow renny ejaculated this is quite a place doc said sharply theres nobody here again the bronze man was voicing what his amazing senses had told him his ears sharp beyond those of an ordinary human had detected no stirrings of life the front door of the cabin gaping open they went in a man lay face up on the floor a length of staghorn stuck upright from his chest the hilt of a knife gliding across the floor doc savage studied the dead man an indian he said then he made a brief examination a halfbreed i should have said he died as near as can be told about the time we were having all our troubles on the train doc indicated the wrinkled condition of the dead mans lower garments the fellow got soaked to the armpits just before his death his clothes show plainly that they dried on his motionless body that means they were wet when he was killed and dried later doc removed the beaded moccasins from the corpse there was more than a spoonful of bright clean sand in each slipper to the trousers on the corpse was sticking smears of an ambercolored sticky gum there was more gum on the lifeless fingers to the gum on the trousers clung bits of bark and to the gum on the hands stuck not only bark but tiny feathers and lint if the gum and the stuff clinging to it informed him of anything doc savage did not remark on the fact at the moment long tom the electrical wizard looking slightly more unhealthy and pale than usual asked who is he doc shook his head in a slow negative he walked through the other rooms everywhere there was evidence of a thorough search furniture ripped apart bedding torn and scattered rugs jerked up the stuffed snarling head of a bearskin rug had been chopped open the cabin was searched twice doc announced after his scrutiny twice exclaimed skeletonthin johnny puzzled how do you figure that moving into the kitchen doc indicated a smear on the floor it resembled molasses which had been spilled and had become as hard as glass an overturned can near by showed where the stuff had come from this can bore a varnish label look at the label doc advised notice how long it requires for that varnish to dry after he had looked the dapper ham said twelve hours exactly it is now perfectly dry but it was spilled during the search that means the hunt occurred at least twelve hours ago doc went into a bedroom a gasoline lantern lay on the floor its fuelreservoir base had been split open the floor about the wreck of the lamp was wet with gasoline you fellows know how fast gasoline evaporates doc said that gas was spilled less than an hour ago the second search was more thorough they even split open the lantern base johnny adjusted his spectacles which had the magnifier lens ive been noticing things too he announced the breed lying dead in the front room is a servant i noticed clothes which would fit him these were in a small room in the rear obviously a servants room there were womans garments in the room too that means he had a wife shes a very large woman too doc agreed her clothes were big shes an indian judging by the bright colors she affects apparently she and her husband were the only servants on the place what about the daughter patricia renny rumbled doc did not reply immediately he roved into a bedroom where feminine garments littered the floor he ended his wandering at a wastebasket which had been overturned and which had held among other trash rumpled cleaning tissues these were the paper napkins young women use to remove facial creams picking up one of these tissues doc crushed it between his sensitive metalbard fingers it was used this morning he said that means the young woman was present that recently but where is she now renny boomed and where is the fat servant renny was asking questions as if he thought his bronze chief had been present at whatever had happened here in the cabin renny knew from past experiences that doc could come upon a scene such as this and because of his weird ability to read vague dews get a story which came uncannily near being the truth ill show you doc said thereby proving renny had not been too optimistic doc beckoned the group outdoors he pointed to tracks in the soft earth it had evidently rained at dawn or shortly afterward and distinguishable in the dirt were footprints of three men and two women one of the women had worn moccasins the other lowheeled hobnailed boots the two women have been kidnaped doc said bluntly the five aides swapped blank glances how doc could look at a set of footprints and tell there had been a kidnaping was beyond their deepest understanding pointing doc said notice the tracks show where one of the men shoved the girl shoved her hard it was no playful push he would hardly have done that if the girl was going with them willingly renny waved acknowledgment with his big hands you win doc the kidnapers were our friends who escaped in the black monoplane doc continued the five men were fairly accustomed to this sort of thing docs habit of plucking gems of information out of thin air they had seen him do miracles on more than one occasion but they could not help looking a bit stunned holy cow renny rumbled i dont see how you can tell that doc these tracks were made by the same men who attacked me when i started to follow the trail of luminous arrows from the train doc replied those men were members of the gang who escaped in the plane he dropped to a knee and inspected the footprints more thoroughly then he reiterated i am sure of it not only the size but certain worn patches on the soles exactly coincide k k renny muttered all we need to know now is where the two women prisoners are being held that will take some trailing doc replied the trail following was an easy matter for a few yards then in the center of a great litter of rocks the prints vanished nowhere could they be seen they began leaping from rock to rock doc decided they cant do that forever well circle scattering doc and his men ranged the vicinity they did not spread so widely but that they could hear each other call however shortly long tom cried loudly come over here you guys i aint got the trail but ive got something else the unhealthylooking electrical wizard was standing near a dense thicket of spruce at his feet brownish stains colored the rank woods grass blood he exclaimed dramatically thoroughly dried doc agreed after a close scrutiny part of it was washed away by the rain last night the bronze man swung slowly around the spot eyes on the ground several times he stopped and parted the grass the rain had washed away signs leaving few that could be read to eyes less than superbly trained the stretch of forest presented absolutely no clew penetrating the spruce thicket doc spent some time in it he came out of the spruce and said in there was where the breed was murdered yeah monk grunted maybe i should have said from in there was where he was murdered the knife must have been thrown signs show the breed came out here to meet some one evidently whoever he was meeting got him with a knife thrown from the thicket any chance of trailin the killer renny demanded no the fellow was careful to follow rocky ground coming and going the rain last night wiped out what few tracks he did make monk had been inspecting the rainfaded prints around the bloodstain laboriously he was finding the tracks which doc had discovered almost at a glance the two women evidently found the slain indian the homely chemist declared they carried him to the cabin herere the tracks one set was made by boots the other by moccasins monk glanced over his shoulder he wanted to see if doc would verify the deduction monk started his eyes flew wide doc savage was nowhere about docs five friends showed no excitement over the bronze mans disappearance doc had a disconcerting habit of vanishing on certain occasions doc had merely glided into the brush of course but his going had been so silent as to seem spectral by the time his absence was noticed doc had covered scores of yards he traveled swiftly until he was a full quarter of a mile from the cabin then he swung in a wide circle the bronze man seemed to undergo a strange change he became animallike in his searching for the trail he utilized not only his eyes but his sense of smell as well much of the time he traveled on all fours occasionally when desiring to move swiftly or to clear a tangle of brush which no man could have penetrated without infinite labor he sprang upward and swung along with the prodigious agility of a monkey from one tree limb to another it was a tangle of spider webs which finally showed doc the trail the webs had been torn from their anchorage by some passing body and hung dangling a few yards from that point doc found a footprint it was small unmistakably feminine he did not touch it did not span its proportions with his fingers but he knew it was the footprint of the girl who had been seized from the cabin it was somewhat uncanny the ability which doc had acquired by long practice to judge size by eye alone like docs other unusual accomplishments there was nothing supernatural about this it was an accomplishment perfected by his remarkable routine of exercises this routine occupied two hours daily and in it was a process where he cast small white balls on the ground repeatedly calculating just how far apart they had fallen careful measurements verified his judgment doc followed the trail it was not easy the kidnapers had taken pains to conceal their path they trod rocky ground wherever possible they entered a small stream followed it fully two hundred yards here water had washed away the tracks at one point an eddy where the water was stagnant doc found a faint haze of mud still suspended it had been stirred up by the passing of his quarry this proved they were not far ahead going became more difficult the trail mounted sheer slopes dived into rocky gulches stony boulders and ledges were steadily underfoot the stuff would not retain footprints the wild western country produces certain individuals who are known as sign readers these are expert trackers and are employed to trail thieves find lost live stock and kindred other jobs so expert do these men become that they can look at a stretch of ground and see a clear trail where another man can distinguish nothing had a sign reader been watching doc savage now he would have been driven to conclude himself a veritable amateur for it was in actuality no trail at all which doc followed the stony earth retained no prints doc ranged back and forth his strange golden eyes photographing everything in his minds eye he discerned certain bugs and small lizards loitering about the rocks in other places these were not in evidence it was plain they had been frightened to cover they were such vague dews as this which guided the bronze giant the noise of the river became audible the kidnapers seemed to be heading straight for the rushing torrent the noise of the river was like that made by a large tree being shaken by some gigantic hand wadded masses of fog crawled through the rocks like enormous gray phantom cats in spots underfoot little puddles of water stood the result of the rain of the night before doc found where one of the party he was following had stepped into a pool and left a plain trail for some distance the boot tracks were small those of the girl a bit farther on doc began finding small colored glass beads of the sort used in decorating indian moccasins both women seemed to be doing their bit to advertise the trail the roaring of the river became louder it might have been a noisy beast drawing near the sound had lost its likeness to a tree being shaken it was ugly and throbbing and full of sobs and gurgles it had a quality of ugly savagery it caused the very eardrums against which it battered to ache then doc came to a canyon it was perhaps a hundred feet deep he could not see the opposite walls nor the bottom he had to climb down to see how deep it was upstream a few rods there was a high waterfall this was making the roaring that hurt the ears the trail which doc was following ended at the waters edge the waterfall made a vast thunder in the canyon and it was shattered into spray by its plunge over the precipice from the noisy inferno mist arose like smoke from a burning house it mingled with the fog it darkened the sun its wetness drooled on the surrounding rocks until they ran rills of water as if it were raining doc lifted his gaze overhead the mist clouds collided and merged and tumbled like fighting things for perhaps a minute he stared upward then he lowered his eyes the river was all foam waves snapped twice the height of his head their tops spat foam like ravenous jaws here and there a rock jutted from the stream bed so swift was the flood that air spaces were left behind these rocks which reached far down toward the stream bed by peering closely doc could discern the tracks of those he was following the party had waded directly out into the boiling waters this was puzzling no human being could wade the current no boat could exist in it doc glanced upward again the mist that lathered the air overhead seemed to fascinate him he watched it go through convulsions for a bit then he clambered up the canyon side the walls were not exactly sheer but they were steep enough that no loose rocks clung in midair fifty feet doc climbed seventyfive he was still in the clouds of spray the stuff dashed against his face pausing he aligned himself with the tracks which had disappeared into the stream he was a little to the right he corrected his position then he looked upward very low yet penetrating the cataclysmic roar of the waterfall with seeming ease came a tiny triiling note the sound that was characteristic of doc savage the fantastic note seemed hardly to come into being then it was gone again doc himself showed no sign of being aware that he had made it the bronze man was studying what he had found it was simply a rope tied securely to a tree the rope stretched across the canyon doc had expected something like this it was the only thing that explained the tracks which had entered the stream some kind of a sling was pulled back and forth on this aerial cableway he believed the sling must hang low enough to enable those in the water to grasp it the ingenious thing about this crossing device was that the cable stretched where it was completely hidden by clouds of mist and spray from the waterfall doc grasped the cable and tested it then he leaped high in the air and landed perfectly balanced on his feet on the cable he did not go hand over hand across the ropes as another man might have done he ran atop it in the fashion of a tightrope walker spray had made the rope very slippery more treacherous footing would have been difficult to imagine doc seemed to give it no more consideration than he would have given a sidewalk he carried no balancing rod without which few tightrope walkers venture to perform yet his balance was perfectly maintained the rope sagged in the middle making the crossing more dangerous below waves darted up like greensnouted repellent lizards of titanic size a fail meant certain death the rope curved sharply upward doc tilted far forward to maintain his balance and his feet slipped repeatedly on the spraywet fiber these slippings which would have raised the hair of a spectator seemed to affect docs nerve not at all he appeared to be as immune from fear as the metal he resembled a tree appeared in the misty void to it was secured the rope end doc discerned a rude basket of sticks pulleys and ropes lying near by it was a makeshift car for the cableway over the canyon doc was almost on the point of leaping from the rope to solid ground when a man appeared beside the tree he was squat swarthy and wore greasy coveralls he had a rifle stock jammed against his shoulder the rifle coughed a tongue of flame which actually blackened the coat fabric over docs heart the bullet made a tiny ragged hole in the patch of powderburned cloth chapter ii the vanished box doc savages shoe soles seemed to acquire roller hearings his giant form skittered back down the sloping wire he was bent nearly double now he had folded into that position an instant after the rifleman fired his movements were strangely grotesque he slouched forward and seized the rope his arms and legs whipping wildly doc seemed to be trying to retain his grip on the rope the swarthy rifleman leaned far out to peer through the mist bueno be hissed my bullets hit his heart the man jacked a fresh cartridge into his rifle planted the weapon against his shoulder and aimed deliberately he could barely make out docs figure it was a feverishly contorting bronzehued smear in the dripping gray abyss the bronze mans movements reminded the rifleman of a squirrel that had been shot and was attempting frantically to cling to its limb even as the man peered over his rifle sights the metallic figure fell away from the overhanging cable spray which boiled up from the water swallowed docs falling body bueno hissed the swarthy man again he lowered his rifle he did not need a second shot the rifleman did not take the death of the bronze man for granted however he scrambled down the steep wall of the canyon to the water there washed by spray which the mad waters flung up he explored he was positive doc savage had fallen into the river where it was roughest and running most violently and equally sure doc could not have escaped even had he not been shot through the heart the man climbed back up the canyon wall and left the vicinity he seemed none too familiar with the region his progress was a series of careful sallies from one landmark to another he stood near a tree which had an extra large trunk until he located a pair of large boulders which looked familiar his next lap was to a brier thicket the fellow was plainly no woodsman and he was taking no chances on getting lost he did not have far to go soon entering a large grove of trees there was a clearing in the center of the grove four tents were pegged out in the clearing the canvas was painted a green hue which camouflaged perfectly with the leaves overhead at the edge of the clearing stood an enormous brushylooking mound of green this had a somewhat artificial look however only close examination would have revealed that the mound was made of freshly cut green boughs the boughs were stacked over a black monoplane concealing it thoroughly it would be almost impossible for an aviator flying over it to detect presence of the black ship several men sprang to meet the bridge guard they had rifles in their hands revolvers were belted about their midriffs mulo cabeza gritted a man mule head you were left to guard the rope over the river keep your shirts on caballeros chuckled the rifleman what do you think i have just done deserted your post somebody growled no amigo i was standing at the rope end with my rifle ready when the bronze man tried to cross i shot him in the heart he fell into the river bueno chortled the other suddenly delighted good did he fall where the water ran swiftest he fell where no man could swim amigo more men stumbled out of the green tents they crowded around the man who was the selfadmitted killer of doc savage they were prepared to make a hero of the fellow you are quite a caballero declared a man many others have tried to kill this bronze wizard and failed i once heard a rumor that he was gifted with everlasting life that he could not be killed where did you hear that rumor senor demanded a listener in our native spain amigos que ejaculated the other what has the fame of doc savage penetrated to our native land si si that bronze man was known to many lands wag is correct senors chuckled another fellow the late bridge guard swelled with pride he flashed white teeth in an expansive grin and stuck out his chest like a pouter pigeon it is possible i shall draw a bonus when our boss hears of this eh senors he queried we must find the ivory cube before anybody draws a bonus one of the others reminded have you not yet learned where the white block is snapped the guard what do you think we are magicians snarled one of the group we have not had time to question the senorita fittingly the fat one the squaw she is what the yankees call a bat from hell a man offered he felt tenderly of an ear from the upper end of the ear a semicircular segment had been bitten like a dog the squaw snapped at me before i could dodge she was spitting out a piece of my ear somebody unkindly laughed five of these men were the fellows who had escaped in the black monoplane the others there were seven more were somewhat incrusted with grease and dirt an indication they had been encamped here in the wilderness for some time the only clean wellkept thing about them was their guns these were spotless freshly oiled and carried in open holsters what do we do next questioned a man we will let our chief know that i have killed doc savage said the rifleman who had guarded the rope bridge have you forgotten my friend somebody chided him that we have strict orders never to go to our chief he always comes to us the chief senors should know what i have done insisted the man it was no small feat here is how i did it the man now proceeded to describe a terrific fight at one end of the rope bridge many blows had been exchanged bullets had flown and knives had flashed to hear him tell it the fellow was an accomplished liar out of his imagination he conjured an amazing battle before he had finished talking he had not only slain doc savage but had first bested the bronze giant in a physical contest and that is how it happened hombres the tale spinner wiped perspiration from his forehead the sweat had been brought out by the very fierceness of the combat which he had just described truly it was the great fight of my life you are mucho hombre a listener agreed tongue in his cheek if you could now lead us to the galleon with the crew of skeletons you would indeed be a hero si si agreed the worlds champion liar the galleon of skeletons we will find it amigo but the ivory cube comes first the words caused the men to exchange glances an ugly determination rode each face here was a question on which they all seemed to be of the same mind a man should go and guard the river crossing some one suggested not me senor snapped the man who had lately been at the post i have done my guardings for this day this struck the others as being a reasonable statement so another man was dispatched to take a position at the rope over the river now to question the senorita savage the leader announced they moved in a body to one of the green tents come out senorita savage commanded the leader there was no response from the tent come senorita the man directed more sharply once more nothing happened the man stooped and looked in he emitted a surprised yell he dived into the tent like a terrier after a rat there was noise as he jumped about and two blankets flew outdoors es no posible the man screeched it is not possible senorita savage is gone had the men suddenly discovered that they were standing over a lighted charge of dynamite they could not have scattered more quickly in a wild wave they spread around the tent at the rear wall one fellow found a stake loose here is where she escaped he cried en verda sneered the former bridge guard indeed so this is the way you hombres keep track of your prisoners your own big mouth is to blame caballero some one advised him angrily while you were talking so loud and fast telling us what you did to this man savage she escaped i scatter hombres shouted the man who seemed to possess some semblance of authority look everywhere for her she cannot have gone far like a pack of hounds which had lost a trail the men dispersed some dashed madly into the woods others peered in brush clumps there was plenty of shrubbery for the gang had not troubled to clear the camp site some of the men probed about the camp one of these went to the green tent which held the squaw tiny a single glance inside sufficed to show that the squaws legs were still bound securely the man started to back out wait grunted tiny you want know what way white gal go si si senorita said the man yes yes cut um loose said tiny me tell um si exclaimed the man delightedly he sprang inside he was hardly in the tent when a slender sinewy brown arm enwrapped his throat from behind this caused his mouth to fly wide open another brown hand promptly stuffed a wadded handkerchief between the gaping jaws patricia savage had been crouching to one side of the tent door while tiny enticed their victim inside during the excitement which had attended the arrival of the killer patricia had managed to free herself and crawl into the tent which sheltered the squaw her escape had been discovered at an inopportune moment given a few seconds more and patricia would have been gone along with tiny tiny reared up to help subdue the man she gave a wrench and the rope fell off her wrists a kick and her ankles were free the ropes had merely been arranged to look like they were tied that was patricias idea the man was probably not more than twentyfive and quite husky he had a neck like a young bull he was more than a match for nine out of ten runofthestreet men patricia however had taken him by surprise moreover she was a young lady who combined good looks with a welldeveloped muscle she not only kept the man from yelling an alarm but she had his wind completely shut off the man kicked struck backward not for nothing had patricia taken fencing lessons in a finishing school she evaded his blows easily the man grabbed her attractive bronze hair and gave it a tremendous yank tiny went into action stooping she seemed to pick something off the floor and plant it forcibly on the mans chin it was a beautiful haymaker the man stopped struggling as suddenly as if he had been shot through the brain me learn that practicing on boat face tiny muttered a moment after she had spoken tiny seemed to remember that boat face was dead her lower lip quivered and tremendous sobs shook her enormous bosom patricia eyed their unconscious victim then appraised the squaws size ill have to put on his clothes and walk out of camp she said if they would fit you id let you go tiny but youre too darn big when i get out of camp ill make a fuss ill yell or something when they rush to investigate you beat it k said tiny the man had a gun patricia took that then she yanked off the mans shirt after this she turned her back when she wheeled around again tiny had the fellows pants and shoes and had spread a blanket over his sleeping form patricia now donned the garments she picked up the mans hat looked at the greasy interior grimaced scrubbed it vigorously with her elbow and put it on she stuffed her bronze hair under it how do i look she asked tiny tiny leaned over and popped their prisoner on the jaw with a fist he had shown signs of reviving you look all right miss pat patricia calmly walked out of the tent and strolled for the woods if any of her enemies discovered her there was a good chance that they would start shooting they were of a race notoriously quick on the trigger no one fortunately saw through her disguise when she reached the first trees patricia resisted an impulse to run the woods were full of maddened searchers patricia had not covered two rods when she saw a human hunter he was prowling around peering this way and that it chanced that he was the same individual who had been guarding the bridge patricia peering out of her tent while making her escape had seen this man she had heard him bragging of the murder he had committed the name of the murder victim had been a shock it was patricias first knowledge that her famous cousin doc savage was in the vicinity the young woman was at a loss to explain why doc was in this part of canada she did not know it but she had not received the bronze mans messages advising her of his northern vacation patricia had intended to send to doc for help but that morning she had found both the storage barrel and the launch tanks empty of gasoline this had prevented her from going to send a telegram she was relieved that no gesture of hers had drawn doc to his death however patricia was horrified to think that doc had perished she was also filled with a consuming rage against his killer patricia was no butterfly who blossomed forth only at social functions that did not mean she was a wallflower when confronted with the glittering pomp of society but at the same time she was a twofisted young woman who could go out and do things glaring at the seffadmitted murderer of doc savage she made a decision she concluded to seize the fellow and turn him over to the nearest mounted policeman stepping behind a tree patricia drew her gun the weapon she had taken from the man she had overpowered she examined it the thing was loaded she waited purposefully patricia could hear her victim approaching he had been headed in this direction when she first saw him she believed his course would take him within arms length of the tree behind which she stood in this she was not wrong the man rounded the tree he was looking in another direction so his back was half turned he did not see patricia reaching out patricia jammed the barrel of her gun against the nape of the mans neck the man gave one horrorstricken scream and fell over in a dead faint patricia was thunderstruck she would have maintained that it was beyond the most nervous of women to faint at the mere touch of cold metal on the back of a neck but what patricia had no means of knowing was that this man was highly wrought up for the last half hour the fellow had been seeing doc savage in his minds eye especially did he remember the metallic quality which was docs chief characteristic when cold metal touched his neck his reaction was that docs frosty ghost had seized him so he fainted darn it snapped patricia and began running deeper into the woods by yelling before he had keeled over the man had upset her plans the howl had spread the alarm que hay shouted a man from somewhere what is the matter patricia hoped he would be a long time finding out she put on more speed and began to have a faint hope that she would make it if she did her plan would have worked out to a nicety the alarm would be exactly what was needed to give tiny her chance to escape patricia was too optimistic however a man hurled himself from behind a tree into her path his gun was in its holster with bare hands he sought to seize the fleeing girl the fact that the man was not using his gun saved his life instead of shooting him as he no doubt deserved patricia made a pass at his head with her revolver barrel clank went the gun on the fellows skull he fell at her feet thinking he was unconscious patricia started to step over him but the man grasped her by the ankles and tripped her too late patricia sought to shoot him through a leg they scuffled for a moment then patricia lost her revolver that marked the finish in a moment more swarthy men came rushing through the timber to the aid of their comrade seizing patricia they bound her hand and foot then they carried her back to camp the first thing patricia saw in camp was the voluminous tiny the squaw lay on the ground in an attitude of slumber what have you done to her patricia shrieked a man tapped his rifle barrel expressively and said i kees her weeth thees senorita patricia gripped her upper lip between firm white teeth and said nothing she was worried and angry enough to burst into tears she felt certain she would not get another such opportunity to escape what do you want with me she demanded of the men we have told you that senorita ne said the ivory cube patricia asked bitterly si senorita the ivory cube is right we want it itll be a long old day before you get it patricia retorted angrily the man shrugged his shoulders and made expressive handspreading gestures quien sabe he smiled coldly but why are you so determined not to give it to us ill never turn the cube over to my fathers murderers patricia rapped the young womans captor looked hurt at this his face assumed an injured expression he shrugged several times but senorita he said mournfully you do us mucho wrong to think that patricia sniffed indignantly of course i have no proof she said you could claim the werewolf did it the man gave a pronounced shiver he rolled his eyes skyward he crossed himself heaven forbid he muttered the werewolf senorita has he bothered you also patricia eyed the man narrowly she could not for the life of her tell whether he was putting on an act for her benefit or telling the truth oh dont try to kid me she said finally we are not kidding anybody senorita we know nothing of this murder but we do know you have a certain ivory cube it is imperative that we have it we are going to get it why do you want it patricia countered that senorita is our own affair i examined the block patricia said wonderingly there is no inscription of any kind on it it seems perfectly solid it does not ring hollow when you tap it of what possible value can a plain ivory block be to you so you do have the block her captor exclaimed triumphantly patricia bit her lips the cat had been in the bag without her knowing it and she had let it out her captor waved his arms in excitement he shouted loudly to his fellows you hear amigos she has the block we have but to make her tell where it is the swarthy men gathered about eying them patricia decided they were about as evillooking a collection as she had ever seen any one of them would have drawn a second look from a policeman she did not like the fierce greed on their ugly faces the men began to make cruel suggestions a knife on her pretty face proposed one that will make her talk si si agreed another but a redhot iron is better why not work on the squaw asked one man i think the senorita savage is a young woman who will talk to save her servant at this point the man who had fainted when he felt patricias cold gun against the back of his neck regained consciousness he glanced about in a dazed fashion keeping silent until he found out what was going on what happened to you somebody asked him she struck me over the head replied the wily liar but at great risk to my life i managed to yell the alarm a man ran up he carried a small portable gasoline stove of the type woodsmen sometimes use usually tenderfoot woodsmen who have trouble building fires he pumped up the pressure tank on the stove and applied a lighted match the stove began to roar softly and give out an intensely hot blue flame the man placed the stove near tiny then he prepared to grasp the squaws feet and hold them over the blue flame he had almost forced the feet into the flame when there was a loud crash the gasoline stove lost much of its shape and jumped end over end it had been hit by a large rock flung with terrific force the swarthy men whirled they saw a sight which to a man they carried in their memories to their day of death chapter the hand that beckoned had an elephant walked out in that clearing in the canadian woods consternation could hardly have been greater certainly the shock would have been less the late bridge guard shrieked loudly spun around and fled his wild terror would have been comical had it not been so harshly real the man was stricken with horror he had seen a ghost coming across the clearing a ghost of the bronze giant he had sent into the torrent below the waterfall more appalling this ghost was not moving with the stately walk usually attributed to its kind the thing was coming with a speed which in itself seemed beyond human ability a towering bronze nemesis doc savage bore down on the swarthy man docs escape had been managed quite simply he now wore the remarkable vest of many pockets which held his assortment of apparatus this was lined with a metallic mail which would stop even a biggame rifle slug in one of the vest pockets was a long slender very strong silk cord to the end of this was fixed a grappling hook doc had simply hooked the grapple over the rope spanning the river then lowered himself until he hung concealed in the clouds of spray boiling above the water it chanced that the wait was almost his undoing however in the terrific roar of the falls he had not heard his enemy descending the canyon side luckily doc had seen the other first doc had climbed back up his silk cord to the cable and swung handoverhand to terra firma the bronze man had followed his assailant to camp and had been lurking near by ever since unfortunately he had not been in a position to help patricia with her escape her flight had been opposite docs place of concealment doc had demolished the gasoline stove with the thrown rock what now transpired happened with the violence of exploding dynamite and the rapidity of an electrical phenomena patricia savage had often wondered what her famous cousin looked like she had read of some of his feats she had heard tales of him but she had never met doc and she had doubted his being the man he was said to be watching doc in action patricia concluded he was all he was rumored to be and then some discounting the fellow who had fled there were eleven men in the clearing all were fair physical specimens moreover they were armed one man sprang forward leveled his revolver at docs chest and pulled the trigger repeatedly the range was short he could hardly miss it was possible to count the ragged holes which his bullets caused to appear magically in the bronze mans coat front doc did not waver the slugs night have been beans pelted at a rhino he came on like a juggernaut of metal the gunman finished shooting and threw his revolver wildly at doc the bronze man dodged the way he did this was in itself reason for popeyed surprise the gun seemed to pass through flesh and bone so swiftly did he weave his head aside and back i shoot him six times shrieked the one who had thrown the gun he should be dead the seeming impossibility of what they had just witnessed held the others spellbound the fractional moment during which they stood and stared proved disastrous the mighty bronze man drove a hand inside his clothing brought out a small metal egg of an object he flung it the metal lump dropped among the swarthy men with a loud report without exception the men clapped hands over their eyes they began to yell in terror they could see nothing the world had suddenly gone jet black they were either too stupid or too surprised to realize they were now standing in a smoke cloud a great wad of inky blackness which had spread with lightning suddenness from the metal egg patricia savage was only slightly less surprised than her captors she was lifted and borne rapidly through the black cloud with such uncanny ease was she carried that patricia was slow to realize human hands were bearing her she could not see a thing in the almost blueblack void but she knew it must be the gigantic bronze man who was bearing her patricia was carried out of the smoke the day dim and vaporous as it was seemed almost brilliant after the sooty pall out of which they had come the young woman discovered her eyes had not been affected by the dense smoke they did not smart she was lying across the bronze mans mighty shoulders she discovered patricia looked down and gave a violent start under one arm as easily as another man would carry a sack of groceries doc had tucked tiny the squaw weighed well over two hundred pounds doc savage whipped across the clearing his great speed seemingly impeded not at all by his burdens patricia found it hard to believe this metallic giant had the strength of a dozen men reaching the edge of the clearing doc planted the two women on their feet run he said and pointed in the direction of the rope spanning the river gorge patricia began if you need any help do what i say doc said sharply patricia looked slightly indignant but began running turning to the right doc veered around the clearing edge his progress was swift but he also zigzagged from side to side keeping behind brush and trees as much as possible none of the swarthy men had come from the black cloud as yet this was probably because the somber pall had spread until it was more than a hundred feet across the smoke boiled like a dark foam one of the men finally staggered into view he stood staring stupidly at the fogpacked sky as if it were something he had never expected to see again suddenly he understood the nature of what he had thought to be a weird blindness drawing his revolver he fired it rapidly into the air this way hombres he screeched we have been tricked i in his excitement the man failed to observe a bronze apparition which streaked under the pile of green boughs that covered the black monoplane the instant he was concealed under the brush doc glanced back to see if he had been observed apparently he was unseen he was under the right wing of the plane doc crawled to the big radial motor and his deft fingers explored its innards docs familiarity with airplane motors was as profound as his other lines of knowledge he had in fact designed a motor which was in use on a large air line in the united states this was not public knowledge it being popularly supposed that the motor was the work of an elderly and kindly inventor whom doc had befriended nor did any one but the inventor who was also the manufacturer know that the design for the motor had saved the old gentlemans business the motor of this black plane was fitted with two carburetors doc removed both his corded fingers loosening the fastener nuts after a little straining fortunately they were not tight doc buried both carburetors under the plane carefully replacing the dirt so that the hiding place would not be noticed peering through the fur of brush which camouflaged the ship doc saw the swarthy men they were in a group and heading for the opposite side of the clearing a moment later veering behind the immense wad of inky smoke they were lost to view doc savage promptly deserted the plane entering the timber he circled widely patricia and tiny had been running with all the speed they could muster patricia gave a start of surprise when doc savage materialized like a phantom beside her one of those men shot right at you she gasped wonderingly i saw the bullets hit why didnt they harm you bulletproof vest doc explained cryptically many things were puzzling patricia speaking as she ran she sought to get them straightened out you are doc savage arent you she asked right doc admitted how does it happen you are here better save the breath for running doc told her patricia gasped with faint indignation the fact that her father was a fairly wealthy man had not exactly spoiled her but she was not accustomed to being told what to do in such short fashion but she snapped i want to know what therere lots of things we both want to know doc told her we can save them until we get clear patricia seemed about to express an opinion contrary to this but a loud fierce shout from behind caused her to change her mind buenos was the cry here is the trail darn it cried patricia and saved her breath for running they reached the rope which spanned the gorge below the falls the canyon was like a great cauldron in which water boiled thunderously and poured up frostcold steam patricia glanced over the brink and shuddered was never so scared in my life as i was when they hauled me over in this thing she declared indicating the rickety cage which could be pulled across the rope doc was somewhat at a loss to know why the swarthy men had spanned the river in this fashion he put a question to clear that up i presume there is no other point near by where the river can be crossed he asked not for miles in either direction patricia replied she peered over the brink once more and watched bucketfills of spray being flung higher than the canyon walls by the force of the torrent patricia had been under a great strain for the last few hours the thought of crossing this ominous chasm was the last straw her grip on her nerves slipped she clapped her hands tightly to her eyes and shrieked i wont go over i cant doc reached for her there was no time to be lost patricia struck at him hysterically shrieked again the young woman realized what she was doing and was not at all proud of her performance nevertheless she could not help it she had a bad case of what is generally called the jitters she felt herself seized one of the bronze mans hands glided past her cheek and pressed a certain spot near the cranial nerve center there was a slight tingling sensation and patricia suddenly found herself powerless to move a muscle it was weird she was tossed lightly across docs shoulders then the mighty bronze man seemed to leap outward straight into the cauldron below the falls however his feet landed on the rope and he came to a perfect balance he glided along the hemp strands during any one of the dozen seconds which followed patricia would have died cheerfully it was the most ghastly interval of her existence she had admired the work of circus performers in the big top trapeze and tightwire artists who did amazing things but she had never seen a feat which equaled this bronze mans seemingly unconcerned defiance of death patricia was placed safely on her feet on the opposite side docs bronze fingers found nerve centers again the young woman recovered use of her limbs magically patricia knew enough of human anatomy to comprehend some of the enormous skill which lay in doc savages fingers she crouched on the edge of the cliff dazed she was frankly ashamed of herself doc savage crossed back over the chasm running lightly on the rope tiny was waiting there she gazed into the chasm and shuddered wait she grunted uneasily me take um chance stay on this side the voluminous tiny never was exactly sure what happened after that the bronze hands pressed her head she became helpless then she also was borne out over the thundering abyss doc seemed to handle the squaws weight as easily as he had managed patricias safely across he loosened the pulley from the anchor tree and let the rope fall back into the torrent this blocked pursuit patricia had said that for several miles there was no other way of crossing the violent little river doc savages five men greeted their chief noisily when he appeared they were no little impressed by the exquisite beauty of patricia savage look at that bronze hair monk breathed ecstatically in an aside say she might almost be docs sister shes a knockout for looks agreed the debonair ham forgetting himself so much as to agree with monk back to the cabin doc directed weve got some talking to do doc had encountered his aides some distance from the cabin they retraced their steps to the structure out of courtesy to the young woman doc unfolded his part of the story first he began with the fake telegram on the train and omitted few details to sum up he finished the whole thing is pretty baffling the gang who just kidnaped you seem to be after an ivory block and in some fashion they must have learned we were coming here on a visit they probably learned that by robbing the mail box patricia savage suggested that would explain it doc agreed they attacked me on the train in an effort to prevent me coming here the theres senor corto oveja his daughter and el rabanos they headed in this direction although we have seen no signs of them being around here what part do they play patricia asked thats more mystery doc told her they were attacked on the train they laid it onto me and their assailants left one of those werewolf marks patricia shuddered violently the werewolf marks i have found several of them around this cabin we saw one on the cabin floor doc admitted yes that one appeared when i found boat face and tiny afflicted with that weird sleep doc and his men exchanged glances they had by no means forgotten their own experience with the weird slumher but what the fantastic affliction was they had not yet learned when did this all start doc asked patricia some weeks ago my father found a prowler in our cabin the fellow fled a little later a mysterious voice called from the woods and demanded that dad hand over the ivory cube dad refused what ivory cube doc interjected one father found on a rock ledge near here patricia replied several human skeletons lay around the little block it was years ago when he found it speaking rapidly the young woman told of the repeated demands for the ivory trinket then my father was found dead she finished jerkily doctors said his heart had gone back on him i think he was murdered a victim of that fantastic sleep doc savage indicated the lifeless figure of boat face when did that happen last night sometime patricia said slowly tiny and i found his body this morning just before the rain we carried it to the cabin a few minutes later those swarthy men came and seized us they took us by surprise you havent the slightest idea why the ivory cube is in demand doc questioned pointedly no lets have a look at it of course patricia went to the barksheathed pillar which supported the livingroom ceiling she pressed a concealed catch and the door flew open she shoved a hand confidently inside and groped around then she bent over and stared into the recess its gone she gasped did boat face know where the cube was hidden doc asked his remarkable voice was smoothly unexcited and told nothing yes patricia admitted and he could have removed it without your knowing it patricia hesitated as yet she had no knowledge of the halfbreeds duplicity he could have she admitted but i would rather think he did not take it no doubt he heard a prowler went to investigate and was knifed boat face him no good said tiny with scant consideration for her dead husband him no mean him just weak and him foxy boat face was killed at a secret meeting doc declared how do you know patricia asked there were tracks i didnt see any tracks they were there doc assured her im sorry pat but boat face seems to have been a crook patricia nodded slowly she felt an agreeable tingling doc savage had called her pat this seemed to indicate that he had accepted her as one of the gang patricia was pleased i dont know who took the ivory blockn she said this thing is getting more involved all the time doc savage now made a second survey of the cabin and its vicinity this search was so intense that it made his earlier hunt seem but a careless glance in comparison from a pack which he had carried to this wilderness retreat he removed what looked like a pair of tiny binoculars mounted in spectacle frames the lenses of these were extremely powerful and adjusted for a short distance docs unaided eyes were keen but wearing these eyeglasses he could cover the ground with microscopic thoroughness it was around the boathouse that his scrutiny became most intensive in addition to the launch the boathouse contained several canoes there was also a rack of holding spades saws axes and other tools doc studied one of the spades closely has this been used recently pat he asked patricia thought it over before she answered no she said im quite sure it hasnt lifting down the canoes one at a time doc examined them especially did he concentrate on the floor boards on one of these be found a semicircular scar when he tried the tip of the spade it exactly fitted the mark doc laid the spade aside patricia picked it up examined it to her astonishment she found nothing i dont understand i she said puzzled johnny came forward hastily removing his glasses which had the magnifying lens he let the young lady inspect the spade under magnification oh patricia ejaculated this spade has been used recently to dig in sand there are tiny scratches which are not a bit rusted inspecting further doc found where a canoe had been carried to the water the canoe had been floated to an outoftheway spot under some overhanging brush there was no reason why it should be used for a regular point of launching yet marks in the sand showed that the canoe had arrived and departed numerous times all of the tracks had been made by boat faces moccasins doc noticed that bushes prevented the landing place from being seen from the cabin boat face seems to have made numerous excursions he announced patricia stared at tiny did you know about his trips the squaw shrugged stoically me sleep sound me not hear doc collected his men before the door of the cabin lets get organized he said docs five aides brightened visibly at the words so far they considered themselves as having been rather useless at least once in each adventure doc usually had occasion to make use of the particular talent which each of his men claimed monk the chemist was first to receive orders got your portable laboratory doc asked him the question was hardly necessary monk was rarely to be found far from his remarkable outfit of chemicals this piece of equipment was wonderfully compact yet monk could do work with it which called ordinarily for a great outlay of equipment monk was something of a houdini with the test tubes ive got it he said i want you to go to work on the inside of the cabin doc told him analyze and test everything monk did not comprehend fully but what will i look for he demanded anything that might give a clew as to what caused the weird sleep doc explained i get you doc renny doc said think you can find our plane renny flicked an enormous hand inland sure i remember the way we came you have a small mapping camera in your luggage havent you a special mapping lens which fits our regular camera renny said it amounts to the same thing k doc told him i want aerial photos of the vicinity of this cabin cover the region for several miles up and down the coast take one set of photos at a height of about five hundred feet take the others from a much higher altitude at least a mile got you boomed renny patricias pretty face was franky incredulous she exclaimed you cant get pictures in this fog we use cameras equipped to utilize infraight doc told her haze and fog dont faze these infrarays renny gathered his equipment together and moved off a giant of a man who was made to look smaller than he was by the incredible hugeness of his hands doc savage now addressed long tom and johnny you two fellows will work at the same job but using different methods he advised long tom i want you to take electricwave tests that will help to determine the possible presence of oil or deposits of mineral underground johnny will prospect outcroppings in search of anything that might be valuable we of course are hunting for whatever this gang is after the two men lost no time getting busy few living men knew more of the earths structure than did johnny if there were mineral outcroppings the gaunt geologist with his manifyinglens spectacles could find them the electrical device which long tom would use employed several principles known to scientific oil prospectors and others wave impulses both sonic and electric were sent into the earth their subsequent reaction betrayed any unusual subterranean formation what about me ham demanded you will guard miss patricia doc said the rather handsome ham grinned widely at this homely monk who had overheard emitted a loud groan if there was anything monk hated it was seeing ham enjoying himself in the company of an attractive girl disgusted with the latest developments monk turned away to conduct his chemical experiments chapter an offer it was midafternoon of the following day things were pretty much at a status quo nothing had happened nothing had been discovered that was of value and it was still foggy renny was off continuing his mapping using the old plane johnny and long tom were still prospecting they had found nothing the day before monk was dividing his time between scowling at ham who was enjoying himself entertaining patricia and dabbling with his chemical equipment doc savage was just completing his exercise routine he had been at it without pause for two hours from the cradle he had never missed a day of this ritual they were unlike anything else in the world those exercises docs father a great surgeon and adventurer had started him taking them they were solely responsible for docs amazing physical and mental powers he made his muscles pull one against the other straining until a fine film of perspiration covered his mighty bronze body he juggled a number of a dozen figures mentally extracting roots multiplying dividing in a small case doc carried an apparatus which made sound waves of frequencies so high and low that an ordinary ear could not detect them through a lifetime of practice doc had perfected his hearing to a point where the sounds were audible he named several score of different odors after a quick olfactory test of small vials racked in the case which held his exercising equipment he read pages of braille printing the writing for the blind which consists of tiny upraised dots he did this as rapidly as another would peruse ordinary type this attuned his sense of touch the whole exercise routine was pushed with an unbounded vigor five minutes at the clip would have prostrated an ordinary man and an ordinary man would have found it impossible to do most of the work monk came outdoors to get a breath of air the chemical analysis he was conducting at the moment was giving off a most unpleasant odor the sight of ham and patricia together seemed painful to monk he turned his gaze away letting it rove the brush surrounding the cabin suddenly his little eyes almost popped from their sockets monk emitted a yell the howl had tremendous volume it scared birds off their limbs almost a mile away a hand monk bawled ordinarily monks voice was small weak as a babys but it underwent a startling change when he was excited it became tremendous bawling and made even rennys thunder seem puny by comparison as he shouted monk pointed with both hands the others followed his gesture they saw nothing what is it patricia gasped racing to monks side youll have to get used to him ham said jerking his thumb at monk hes part ape you can never tell how hell act ignoring this pleasantly monk charged for the clearing edge he hit the brush like a bull moose he had he was mortally certain seen a hand projecting from the brush a slender white hand it was it looked like a womans the hand had been visible for only a fractional moment but monk was certain it had been there as he searched through the brush however he became less positive there was no sign of any young woman monk studied the ground as a woodsman he was no amateur but in this tangle of rocks and shrubs not a track could he discover disgusted he returned to the cabin dont get excited at what the missing link does ham told the attractive patricia just look at his monkey face and youll understand there couldnt possibly be good sense behind a mug like that oh yeah monk grinned listen you shyster where has doc gone to the men glanced about hastily monks words had prepared them for what they found doc savage was not around hes gone patricia gasped what on earth can that mean a grin on his homely face monk began well you see doc has a habit of shut up ham snapped im doing guard duty here go play with your test tubes monk rambled off habeas corpus at his heels there was hardly a mystery about docs disappearance he had simply glided away while the others were watching monks wild charge once in the brush he quickened his pace and swung in a wide circle doc had seen the hand which had excited monk in fact the hand had been gesturing at doc when monk chanced to glimpse it the hand had been feminine and its owner unquestionably wanted to talk with doc doc had not gone far when he found a leaf crushed on a rock a bit farther on a creeper dangled torn from its anchorage there was no breeze here in the undergrowth yet the creeper swung slowly from side to side below it were feminine footprints senorita oveja doc called softly there was no answer the swayings of the creeper however gradually became shorter and shorter theres no one with me miss oveja doc called this secured results attractive darkhaired senorita oveja appeared in the shrubbery some distance ahead buenos dias she greeted good morning i wanted to talk with you senor savage i recognized your hand doc told her your man the big hairy one frightened me away senorita oveja smiled monk makes a lot of noise doc agreed but he wouldnt hurt a fly unless the fly bit him we have been thinking things over my father el rabanos and myself said the girl she came closer doc noted her olive cheeks were flushed from running you havent decided you and i may have the same enemies doc asked dryly then it is that way the girl gasped it looks very much like it doc admitted our common enemy is a fellow who uses a likeness of a werewolf for his mark the beautiful spanish woman shivered from head to foot that is what my father and el rabanos decided after we talked it over this enemy seems to be after an ivory cube doc offered cere started you know that too yes doc replied my cousin patricia savage has the cube or did have it at this the castilian girl showed every evidence of unbounded surprise doc was an expert at reading human character he was watching her closely as far as he could tell her astonishment was genuine doc had a suspicion however that the man did not live who could read a young womans mind unfailingly by looking at her pretty face patricia savage has it gasped cere had it doc corrected the cube seems to have complicated things by disappearing suppose you tell me suppose you tell me doc interposed well start off with what gave you the idea that i was your enemy the girl said promptly more than a week ago your uncle alex savage shot at us from the woods saying he would kill us unless we left the vicinity did you see alex savage at that time no nor did we see him two days ago when he came again and said that he had sent for you and that you would come and kill us for not leaving the vicinity alex savage warned you again two days ago yes it was not alex savage doc said flatly but he said his name was alex savage alex savage has been dead more than a week cere placed a hand over her heart in that case we have been terribly mistaken this other man was a fake any one can be misled doc assured her now suppose you tell me exactly what is behind all this the girl nodded you have heard of sir henry morgan the pirate that is the one cere replied in the year he started across the isthmus of panama with twelve hundred men the spaniards received warning of his coming treasure from the panama city cathedral and wealth belonging to merchants was loaded onto a galleon this craft fled out to sea carrying some of the owners of the treasure besides the crew that incident is a matter of history doc told her the pirate esquemeling who was with morgan at the sacking of panama wrote of the galleon in his book shortly after he had captured panama morgan heard of this treasure craft he knew the treasure to be of more value than all else the expedition had secured put together he seized several spanish boats and sent them out in pursuit of the galleon but they did not find the craft and for a very good reason senor savage cere resumed part of the galleon crew had mutinied murdered the merchants and the others aboard and seized the treasure there is no historical record of such an occurrence doc told her in a moment ill explain how i know it is true cere retorted these men who mutinied and seized the galleon loaded with treasure were not very intelligent one of them had heard that there was a water passage around north america he converted his companions to his belief they sailed north the journey was long and full of hardship the coast became bleak and the climate cold finally it was necessary to anchor in a small bay careen their boat and make repairs to the hull they pulled the galleon up on the sandy floor of a small canyonlike inlet bad luck plagued them an earthquake caused the gulley side to topple over burying the boat in a sort of cavern the castilian beauty paused to stare steadily at doc the spot where the boat met disaster was only a few miles from here how do you know that doc demanded senorita oveja shrugged my story will bring that out senor savage to get back to what happened hundreds of years ago not all the crew were on the galleon when it was entombed about a dozen had camped near by they dug a tunnel to the tomb where their fellows lay that took many days their comrades were dead when reached no doubt by now only their skeletons remain the survivors thought to remove the treasure from the boat but hostile indians made that impossible they determined to leave it and travel southward until they found men of their own race later they would come back by sea one of the men was an expert carver of ivory he took six small flat pieces of ivory and made a relief carving of the vicinity where the boat lay he fitted these ivory pieces together carved portions inward and made a box this he packed with clay due to the cleverness of his construction and the clay packing the box seemed solid the ivory cube doc said understandingly si si cere assured him even when opened and spread flat the relief map inside the box would be apparent only to a close observer go ahead with your story doc directed the men closed up the hole which led to the buried ship cere resumed they started south almost at once they were attacked several were slain including the one who carried the box the massacre took place under a rock ledge in this vicinity those who escaped had to leave the box behind the girl made a somewhat shamefaced gesture one of those men who escaped was an ancestor of mine he left a written account of the incident it was handed down in our family for centuries this clears the situation a lot doc told her you and your father came for the treasure eh myself my father and el rabanos cere corrected el rabanos is financing us you hoped the ivory block would still be under the ledge where the men were massacred doc questioned cere bobbed her attractive head yes but we were disappointed senor it was gone then you began searching for the galleon itself si si but on this rugged coast that is a hopeless task and then this fake alex savage appeared with his lies eh si si one thing puzzles me doc said quien sabe said the girl what is that how did you happen to be on the train the young woman smiled archly at doc obviously she was captivated by the bronze mans manners and unmistakable character for the last few minutes she had hardly taken her eyes off him doc realized this but carefully kept his bronze face expressionless to doc young women were something of a problem there was no provision in his perilous existence for feminine company it was necessary for doc to ignore all eligible girls for the personal safety of the young things it for no other reason docs enemies were legion they would not hesitate to strike at him through a girl whom they thought he liked the prettier the young women were the harder doc found it to gently repulse them the more beautiful the girl the more stunned she was when the bronze man failed to bow before her charms and the more vigorous her renewed efforts to ensnare him you have not answered my question doc reminded her senorita cere oveja colored prettily we were on the train to get rid of you so that you would not give us trouble i trust you didnt contemplate a murder senorita doc said dryly gracias no the castilian beauty ejaculated doc savage nodded slowly i can see now why you suspected me he said it was the work of the prowler the fellow who said he was alex savage darkeyed cere said eagerly he told us he had sent for you to come and take our lives naturally when we got upon the train we looked upon you as a sort of ogre we had heard that you were famous for deeds of violence violence against those who have it coming to them doc corrected the pretty senorita my first sight of you brought doubts senor savage said cere doc hastily headed her off on the train some one tried to choke you to death with a leather strap he said naturally you thought that was my work si si said cere that is father and el rabanos did she paused expectantly as if inviting doc to ask what her own opinion had been doc passed up the opportunity it looked suspicious when you fled the train he reminded father and el rabanos were in terror of you said the girl when the train stopped we decided to flee that brings us down to the present moment i believe doc told her now what is the purpose of this conversation ceres entrancing dark eyes dropped father and el rabanos are still a little doubtful of you i regret to say but they have agreed to talk with you i wish you would do that you came to persuade me to meet them senorita oveja nodded si si please do i shall be delighted to accommodate you buenos senor cere exclaimed you make me so happy doc looked like a fellow who had taken a big swallow of toohot coffee he asked shall i go with you now and meet them oh no the young woman said hastily we are away from our camp now searching the coast for the buried galleon you must meet them tonight let us say shortly after sundown come alone alone doc asked sharply please if you bring your men father and el rabanos will be suspicious of you lifting on tiptoe cere pointed through the trees there was a line of cliffs perhaps a quarter of a mile distant she seemed to be indicating a gap in these the opening was like a knife slash our camp is just beyond that she smiled you can come there just through the gap in those cliffs doc said ill come and alone too usually doc was an extraordinarily quick mover there were men who claimed the bronze giant could dodge a bullet this was a rank exaggeration of course but it gave an idea of the speed with which doc could maneuver himself nevertheless he now got kissed full on the lips before he could avoid it the kiss was clinging and quite ardent the senorita ovejas lips were entirely delicious doc decided as if appalled by her act pretty cere turned and fled however she paused before she was out of sight and looked back doc savage had vanished cere turned hastily and went on she did not head for the gap in the cliff beyond which according to what she had told doc her camp lay instead she angled off to the right unexpectedly her father and el rabanos appeared before her we were watching hila mio senor oveja chuckled it was excellently done as the americans would say cere smiled proudly he fell for it hook line and sinker that bronze caballero is no fool el rabanos reminded seriously are you sure that he did not suspect he was being tricked he was like a lamb in my hands cere said loftily el rabanos shrugged he will be a lion on our hands if he suspects senorita what did you tell him senor oveja demanded as you say he is clever the pretty castilian girl replied i did not trust myself to lie to him so i told the truth i told him all about our ancestor and the galleon of treasure from panama he claimed to know none of the story he has a tongue tied in the middle loose at both ends to tell lies senor oveja snarled it was he who made the attempt on the train to kill us cere looked doubtful i am not so sure about that padre the father eyed his daughter severely he made a tongueclicking sound of disapproval this bronze caballero is very handsome he said a young womans opinion of such a man is not to be trusted senorita oveja stamped her foot i knew you would say that but senor savage is not to be harmed of course he will not be harmed el rabanos put in sharply we will merely seize him and hold him as a hostage to insure our securing the ivory cube we will trade the bronze man for the cube i could slit the big hombres throat senor oveja growled there must be no violence el rabanos rapped i insist on that si si the older man mumbled as you wish they walked off in the direction of their camp the camp was nowhere near the cliff but nearly a mile to the northward it nestled in a forest of large boulders near a rather rocky stretch of level ground at one end of the comparatively level field stood a plane it was canted over on one wing a landing wheel was smashed and the rocks had damaged the wing tip el rabanos stared at the plane and growled in spanish it is unfortunate that the ship had to hit a rock while i was landing it we are virtually marooned here in this wilderness for shelter the party had tents these were small and of a leafgreen in color cere entered a tent and busied herself improving her appearance the woods country she had discovered was hard on complexions moreover it was difficult for a young woman to be captivating in hobnailed boots corduroy trousers and a flannel shirt this was the garb cere was wearing because it was the only raiment which would withstand the rigors of her surroundings senor oveja and el rabanos retired to their tents they were city men not used to hardship and each period of exertion called for a corresponding rest the woods were quiet the fog rolled like smoke it was an altogether dreary day faintly from the distance came the mushy noise of the waves on the rocky shore line possibly an hour later in a gloomy stretch of timber something over a mile from the ovejas camp a sinister meeting occurred it was a convention of evil conducted with a furtive caution it began with the appearance of eleven men they were swarthy fellows and they skulked along as if afraid of being seen their visages were anything but pleasant to look on these were the men who had kidnaped pretty patricia savage the ominous little caravan of men progressed to a spot where the timber was particularly dense they clustered together and waited making no disturbing sound cere led doc savage into the trap for us a hollow voice said suddenly the portentous words were spoken slowly this and the fact that the voice was dull and resonant gave the impression of an exotic drum beating obviously it was a disguised voice the speaker was fifty feet or so to the left he was thoroughly hidden from the group of men by the trees the men showed no surprise at the voice they had been expecting it several peered furtively in the direction from which it had come it was as if they were trying to get a glimpse of the speaker there is no chance of a mistake asked one of the men nervously this man savage has an uncanny way of avoiding traps the drumlike voice boomed a hollow laugh it was a woman who tricked savage this time he was too dizzy to suspect anything you should have seen how still he stood after she kissed him it was clever using the woman a man muttered the beauty of it is that she does not know she is being wed said the concealed voice a man began sharply but i thought that oh the senorita knows she is drawing him into a trap said the concealed man but she does not know that he is to be killed how will we manage it questioned one of the group look off to your right do you see that gap in the line of cliffs there was no need of an answer the rent in the cliffs was plainly distinguishable through an opening in the trees you will post yourselves just inside that opening said the unseen voice you have your machine guns si one fellow muttered we have them set them up just inside the opening in the cliff their hidden chief ordered when savage appears you will turn them on him instantly si si it will work that is all go vamos chapter the trap in a trap the time was approximately one hour before sundown doc savage had not yet informed his men of his meeting with senorita oveja anyway of the five only monk and ham were around the cabin monk was absorbed in the kitchen test tubes retorts mixing howls and glass containers of chemicals stood about once unpacked monks chemical laboratory seemed of considerable size monk was making numberless analysis tests so far he had not announced whether he had drawn any conclusions regarding the weird sleep the debonair ham was having a very enjoyable time entertaining patricia savage the young lady had altogether captivated ham not only was she one of the most beautiful specimens of femininity ham had ever seen but she was also one of the most intelligent ham and patricia were occupying a rustic bench in front of the cabin you wouldnt think it ham was saying but that homely missing link monk has a wife and thirteen children you dont say exclaimed patricia ham nodded solemnly not only that but the thirteen children are just like their father you know they swing from chandeliers and things patricia looked curiously at ham the dapper lawyers expression was sober as a judges patricia knew something was amiss with a face just as straight homely monk had told her the same story about ham monks yarn had differed only in that hams thirteen children were halfwitted you and mr mayfair are very good friends arent you patricia asked ham blinked he so seldom heard monk called mr mayfair that he had failed to recognize the name friends ham exclaimed indignantly he flourished his sword cane nothing would give me more pleasure than to chop the ears off that missing link the pig habeas corpus wandered into the vicinity the shoat sat down and eyed ham the pigs actions were strangely human it raised on its rear legs who is your trampylooking pal miss pat monks ventriloquial voice asked through the medium of the pigs jaws ham launched an indignant kick at the shoat he might as well have tried to kick a mosquito the pig evaded him easily ham glared about in search of the homely chemist monk however was not in sight he must have thrown his voice from concealment patricia was laughing heartily there was something about the easy fearlessness of these men and the frequent touches of comedy which relieved their doings that was highly satisfying fifteen minutes later monk appeared in the cabin door his homely face was innocent doc he called the bronze man appeared from the direction of the boathouse i cant find a thing to indicate what causes the weird sleep monk reported numerous times during the afternoon a plane had prowled overhead this ship was traveling back and forth systematically it seemed to be searching for something it covered the ground twice one hunt was made at a very low altitude less than five hundred feet the second search was conducted at a greater height so high that the roar of the motor was barely audible renny was flying the ship making an aerial photographic map an uninitiated person would have sworn that no one could take pictures in the fog but renny utilizing infrarays was no doubt securing pictures equal to those which could be obtained by sunlight for an interval now however the plane had not been in evidence not unexpectedly renny came out of the brush and strode toward the cabin the disappearance of the plane from the skies indicated that he had landed some time ago under an arm he carried a bulky package which held camera and photographs entering the cabin renny spread his prints on the table it was not necessary to lose time developing them the camera was an ingenious type which printed its pictures as they were taken i got a fair layout of the district renny reported patricia savage came in to inspect the work she was still a bit skeptical about securing pictures in the fog why she ejaculated i never saw clearer photographs taking pictures with fits and lenses sensitive to infrarays isnt a new idea renny told her it was a military secret years ago and for some time it has been utilized on a commercial scale the pictures are in harsh shades ham took up the explanation for patricias benefit because of that photography with infralight is unsuitable for portrait work a picture taken with infralight makes you look ugly as sin like monk for instance monk only grinned at the insult with a powerful magnifying glass doc went to work on the prints he arranged them in the order in which they had been taken this gave him an aerial map of the region johnny and long tom were still missing but the bronze man had hardly begun his examination when they appeared johnny removed his spectacles and polished the magnifier on the left side i have little to report he said of course i could make only a sketchy inspection of the vicinity but there was no sign of a valuable ore outcropping nor are the rock formations favorable for it doc savage eyed long tom what did you find he asked the electrical wizard nothing particularly unusual about the underlying rock strata long tom said wryly so you guys both drew a blank ham put in wait a minute long tom said let me finish i found something all right what doc demanded a rock ledge long tom replied with a bunch of skeletons on it that must be where my father found the ivory cube patricia offered doc said lets take a look gathering rennys aerial photographs together he stuffed them in a pocket the ledge was well up on the stony face of a mountain too it was more of an elongated pit dug in a wall of stone than a ledge a beetling overhang above made the spot almost a cave to reach the recess it was necessary to make a laborious and sometimes dangerous climb until today my father was probably the only visitor to this spot patricia declared i dont wonder ham puffed the climb was wreaking more damage on hams clothing this is a swell spot for a goat he growled the skeletons met their gaze the bone heaps were white as snow cavernouseyed skulls bore marks hacked by a knife ages ago these marks explained themselves the victims had been scalped these are the skeletons of white men said johnny whose knowledge of archaeology made his opinion practically indisputable they are well preserved due to the fact that the overhang of the cliffs kept off the weather this is really a pocket in the side of the mountain doc savage glanced at long tom did you dig up the sand around these bones then smooth it out again no said long tom in a startled voice he peered at the ground the sand had been disturbed all over the ledge it had been dug up and sifted then it had been carefully replaced to give the appearance of having been unmolested you were mistaken doc told patricia your father was not the only visitor to this ledge before today from the condition of the sand it seems a search was made about a week ago they were bunting for the ivory cube patricia gasped doc nodded yes the cube which remained behind with the massacred galleon crew doc became a magnet for astounded looks huh monk ejaculated you must know something that we dont doc nodded then he told them of his meeting with attractive senorita oveja he repeated exactly as the girl had told it to him the story of the treasure galleon from panama and the crew who had mutinied he failed to mention the kiss according to the girls story he finished the galleon is entombed near here the relief map inside the ivory cube is the clew to its location but where in blazes is the ivory block monk demanded to monks query no answer was forthcoming doc savage if he had any knowledge on the subject did not put it into words the others frankly had not the slightest idea what had become of the troublesome white cube monk peered at the red blur in the fog which marked the position of the sun it looked like a bonfire on the horizon you say you are to meet the oveja girl and the two men right after sundown doc right then you had better be on your way monk said its almost that time ham you take patricia back to the cabin doc suggested the rest of us had better be as monk says on our way for once ham looked as if he were not wholly in accord with his job of guarding patricia he sensed that he was going to miss some action nevertheless he offered the young lady his arm and guided her away wait monk called after them miss pat would you mind taking habeas corpus back with you the going with us may get kinda tough for the pig yes she would ham said indignantly she dont want to do it why ill be glad to patricia said contrarily i think the pig is very intelligent sure he is monk laughed habeas follow the prettiest girl in the world habeas corpus instantly trailed after patricia and the disgusted ham the rest of us are going with you eh monk asked doc it looks like it but didnt you say you told the girl you would go alone to the meeting place beyond the opening in the cliffs renny put in were not going to that meeting place doc replied huh monk exclaimed to explain his change of mind doc drew rennys aerial photographs from his pocket he spread them on the smooth sand beside the skeletons then borrowed gaunt johnny spectacles he used the magnifier which was the left lens beckoning his men close doc indicated an irregular whitish line on the map there is the line of cliffs he said and there is the opening which the girl told me to walk through look close notice anything peculiar blazes monk exploded that opening is the mouth of a blind canyon theres no sign of a camp in it look still closer doc suggested monk did so squinting and making grotesque faces he let out a surprised gasp look at this he told bigfisted renny mild voice suddenly fierce holy cow ejaculated renny after a glance well is it a secret snapped long tom who had not yet secured a look theres a gob of machine guns planted around that opening in the cliffs monk explained men are crouched beside them the guys didnt bother to get out of sight when they heard rennys plane they didnt dream we could take pictures through this fog its an ambush long tom snapped take the head of the class son monk said dryly ignoring him long tom turned to doc say did you suspect this before you saw the aerial photographs doc was slow to answer the young womans insistence that i come alone was slightly suspicious ill confess though that my doubts were not strong what do we do now queried bigfisted renny go after the guys with the machine guns well call on senor and senorita oveja and el rabanos first doc decided but where is their camp doc indicated the aerial photograph it shows on here and is not very far away youll notice the plane they flew here is lying in the clearing beside their camp apparently wrecked a grimly silent purposeful file doc and his men clambered down from the ledge which held the macabre collection of skeletons the night had descended with an unexpected abruptness surprisingly with the coming of darkness the fog had disappeared bright stars speckled the sky a fat milky bag of a moon leaked its beams the night was offering better visibility than the fogfilled day an air of expectancy gripped the senor and senorita oveja and el rabanos in their camp they had consumed an evening meal cooked over a gasoline stove which gave forth no smoke pretty senorita oveja had cleaned the dishes outdoor fashion by scouring them with sand and rinsing them from the grimaces she made she apparently did not think much of dishwashing is it not about time we were going she demanded in spanish you are staying here her father said calmly but i wish to go the young woman retorted no the elder oveja refused firmly that settled it as far as cere was concerned in her country young people did not argue with their parents you will not harm the bronze man she asked anxiously what happens to doc savage is not your affair her father snapped he turned to el rabanos come senor let w be on our way the meeting time is near senor oveja went over to get his rifle it was leaning against a large rock a rock the size of an automobile he reached out for the weapon moon shadows darkened the base of the rock like thickly roosting crows senor oveja suddenly emitted a sound between a whimper and a sob and fell backward his body remained perfectly stiff as it tumbled it retained its rigidity when it hit the sand it was as if the senor had turned to stone the momentum of his fall caused him to rock like a frame of sticks from side to side his arms and legs stuck up with weird stiffness padre cere cried shrilly father darting forward the young woman sank beside her parent she grasped his strangely stiffened arm the muscles were rigid under her touch by wrenching she tried to change the position of one of the arms the arm remained at the angle to which she moved it like the cold limb of a dead man oh oh wailed cere she turned wildly in el rabanoss direction she intended to demand his help but her lips parted and her dark eyes became staring el rabanos had also fallen a victim of the fantastic paralysis the swarthy girlfaced man was spreadeagled as if staked out his face was turned sidewise so that moonbeams spilled on it the features showed no agony only an unbounded wonder el rabanos cere cried she was close enough to see the mans eyes roll in her direction it was plain that el rabanos knew what was going on but was powerless to move or speak what had just happened was the most uncanny occurrence the pretty senorita had ever encountered she gazed about in terrified bewilderment there was not a mark on her father or el rabanos there was not a sound from the surrounding shadows to show what had happened suddenly cere sought to spring wildly to one side she moved a trifle too slowly however bronze hands floating out of the shadows beside her trapped her arms the fingers inclosed like steel bands the grip for all of its strength however was not tight enough to inflict pain it was just snug enough to hold the girl tightly cere gave one violent wrench then realized the futility of that she relaxed she knew that doc savage must be responsible for the uncanny happening to her father and el rabanos what have you done to them she demanded doc did not answer renny and monk two mountainous figures came up in the murk johnny and long tom approached from the opposite direction doc released cere the young woman instantly started to run she had taken only her second stride when doc savage overhauled her picked her up and carried her back his touch was still impersonally gentle but the castillan beauty found herself absolutely helpless against his strength cere did not learn what had happened to her father and el rabanos the huge forms of monk and renny blocked her view as doc went to the two strangely paralyzed men with an experienced sureness doc stroked certain nerve centers previous pressure on these had induced a sort of paralysis docs practiced touch relieved this condition use of their limbs did not return instantly to the two men full recovery required perhaps a minute during that interval doc searched senor oveja and el rabanos each had a pair of revolvers belted about his middle doc removed those he also took a knife which he found in a sheath inside senor ovejas shirt what does this mean senor oveja demanded indignantly it means that you werent as slick as you thought rum bled bigfisted renny oveja glared what do you we have no time for an argument doc interrupted long tom johnny you guard the prisoners monk you and renny come with me as he spoke doc was already gliding away through the moonlight renny and monk pounded after him where are we headed for monk demanded for that machinegun ambush at the cliff doc told him chapter when trouble doubles theyre gone monk exclaimed in his small voice yeah renny rumbled you can see that they were around recently too heres a match one of them was chewing on the end is still wet doc and the two men stood on the edge of the blind canyon which penetrated the line of cliffs they had approached with the greatest of caution they were sure the ambushers had not seen or heard them yet the gang was gone doc savage listened intently training had given his ears a keenness which rivaled that of a jungle creature but they picked up no sound the gang isnt in the vicinity he decided aloud but howd they get tipped off renny growled how did he shut his thin lips tightly on the rest two loud reports came snapping through the night they were sharp their echoes bounced back and forth with an uproar that sounded like a fantastic dragon coughing monk confused by the multitude of echoes demanded where did the shots come from from the oveja camp doc decided they listened but a dead stillness had fallen there were no more shots wed better go back doc declared the bronze man whipped over the brink of the cliff below the drop was almost sheer footholds were few and unpleasantly precarious yet doc seemed to take no particular pains with his going his speed seemed unaffected by the peril of a fall monk and renny tackling the dangerous descent found it necessary to lower themselves a few inches at a time doc was far ahead of them by the time they reached the bottom coming in view of the camp some time later monk and renny received a surprise they had expected to find violence however there was nothing about the scene to indicate anything desperate had occurred senor and senorita oveja and el rabanos stood in the moonlight long tom and johnny were near doc savage was to one side the pig habeas corpus was galloping slow circles in the moonlight the shoats running gait was more than ever like that of a dog monk stared at his pet where did habeas come from it came tearing through the brush doc explained thinking it was a prowler johnny fired a couple of shots in the air those were the shots we heard im sure patricia took him back with her monk declated ham must have turned him loose thats the kind of a trick the shyster would pull he dont think a whole lot of habeas corpus i imagine his opinion of the pig is improving a little doc declared monks jaw fell what do you mean doc by way of answer doc savage produced his tiny lantern which threw ultraviolet rays he switched it on and played the beam on habeas corpus letters in an electric blue flame sprang out on the pigs back due to the uncertainty of the bristled surface on which they had been drawn the letters were large and irregular each time the pig moved they seemed to convulse the letters spelled two words sleep getting holy cow renny muttered whats that mean hams idea of a joke monk growled doc savage set out swiftly in the direction of the cabin i hardly think its a joke he called grimly long tom you stay here and guard these three prisoners the electrical wizard nodded and turned back to watch senor and senorita oveja and el rabanos the other three men ran in docs wake toward the cabin the cabin was silent as a house of death it might have been a tomb of logs erected on the shore of the little inlet there was no night breeze to flutter leaves in the surrounding brush small waves were piling sloppily against the shore out on the sea moonbeams glanced in long silver shafts doc savage was first to approach the cabin renny monk and johnny brought up the rear they did not want to spoil any sign with their clumsy tramping using his flashlight which gave a powerful beam doc savage made a quick inspection of the house if he had expected signs of violence he was disappointed the place was in a no more topsyturvy condition than it had been when he left but there was no sign of patricia ham or the fat indian servant its all right for you fellows to come in doc called after his first cursory inspection monk lumbered in and looked around thats funny i dont see any signs of a fight and ham aint the kind to give up without a scrap instead of answering this directly doc savage indicated a black smear on the wall of a bedroom this had the shape of a wolf with an unpleasantly human face the werewolf monk ejaculated placed there recently no doubt by the gang who captured our friends doc replied the presence of the werewolf mark indicates why there was no struggle how do you figure that monk questioned the strange sleep we have not been able to explain doc reminded him it seems to strike coincident with the appearance of these werewolf marks doc led the way to the kitchen fresh food stood on the table a sandwich lay on a plate one bite was missing they mustve been having a snack to eat when the thing happened renny said a saucer holding a large lump of butter stood on the table doc handed this to monk analyze it he said for crying out loud monk grunted what for search for the presence of the following chemicals doc said and rattled off a half dozen highly technical laboratory terms the chemical terminology was unintelligible to renny and johnny both were welleducated men but it was doubtful if either could have picked two comprehensible words out of the list monk nodded with perfect understanding however behind monks low forehead there did not seem room for a teaspoonful of brains but his looks were deceiving a roster of the three greatest living chemists would certainly have included monk taking the platter of butter monk went into the room where he kept his portable laboratory he set to work doc savage peered closely at the kitchen floor then took his portable ultraviolet lantern out of his pocket switched it on and played the invisible beams on the floor a puddle of blue fire seemed to spring into being renny dropped to a knee and rubbed an enormous hand through the glowing spot its the chalk we use to do invisible writing he said ham must have dropped his piece its been stepped on i think we stepped on it while wandering around in here doc said my opinion is that ham patricia and the squaw were in here eating when they felt the weird sleep begin to creep over them ham managed to scrawl those words on the pig habeas corpus he dropped the chalk as he passed out outdoors a voice hailed loudly ahoy the cabin it cried dont shoot me renny and johnny sprang to a window and looked out they could see nothing docs flashlight went out it made no sound doing so for the switch was noiseless the darkness which clamped down was black enough to be solid silence lay over the cabin and the surrounding timber the man who had hailed did not do so again that was long tom doc said unexpectedly if it was his voice was changed rumbled bigfisted renny something has happened to him all right doc agreed but it was his voice the bronze mans tone without seeming to become any louder suddenly acquired a remarkable carrying quality it rolled out of the cabin and far away into the brush come on in long tom he said whats happened to you there was the sound of shuffling footsteps long tom appeared the paleskinned electrical wizard was something of a wreck he was skinned and bruised and carried the beginnings of two black eyes long toms front teeth were of a large protruding variety two of these were missing the missing teeth had the effect of giving his voice a rather comical lisping quality he sounded very much like an irate turkey gobbler monk thrust his head in a door looked at long tom said for cryin in my sleep dont he look funny without them buck teeth what happened to senor and senorita oveja and el rabanos doc asked long tom they took a powder gritted the electrical wizard i thought you were guarding them renny snorted a wide grin sat on the bigfisted engineers usually solemn face he seemed tickled by the ludicrous appearance which the missing teeth gave the electrical wizard senor oveja picked up a rock and whangoed me long tom growled through his missing teeth howd he catch you off guard the truth even if it hurt was the custom of docs aides long tom squirmed felt of the gap where his teeth were missing the darn girl was making eyes at me he admitted everybody laughed they hit you then fled doc asked there was no criticism in his tone yep long tom admitted senor oveja followed the rock up with his fists he walloped me plenty what i mean the rock had knocked me too dizzy to dodge didnt you try to trail em sure kind of a strange thing happened then doc they had not gone far before they managed to get guns they cut down on me with several shots i couldnt see em monkeying around after em was useless with me disarmed guns renny ejaculated but we took their guns when we seized them in their camp yeah they must have had other weapons hidden in the brush doc said monk how about analyzing that butter monk nodded and returned to his work over the portable chemical laboratory he had spread his paraphernalia over a large table several of the mixing trays were giving off strongsmelling odors going outdoors doc searched for tracks finding them was a simple matter for his trained eye in addition to the tracks of patricia ham and the squaw there were prints of at least half a dozen other men the trail did not wander but headed for the shore the procession of footprints crossed a spot where the ground was soft doc got down on all fours to make an examination then he stood up the same gang that we rescued pat from has seized her again he said ive seen some of those footprints so often theyre beginning to look like the tracks of old friends the trail terminated near the boathouse certain marks in the soft sand might have been made by canoe keels doc looked into the boathouse the canoes which had been stored there were missing they came by land he said but they left by water that was a wise trick on their part we havent a chance of trailing them over water at this point monk came running from the direction of the cabin he was excited he had never looked more like a gorilla than now the pig habeas corpus bounded at his heels making frantic efforts to keep up ive got it monk shouted ive got it got what doc demanded the stuff in the butter monk bawled you know how butter absorbs the odor of any smelly food you put in the refrigerator with it well when the house was saturated with this stuff the butter absorbed enough of it for me to find it by making an analysis listen you homely missing link renny rumbled what have you found the stuff which caused the mysterious sleep monk grinned its an odorless and colorless gas which is poisonous if inhaled long enough renny long tom and johnny were plenty surprised at this development doc savage however had expected it he had already surmised the probable cause of the weird slumber so closely had he guessed that he had told monk what chemical components to look for no doubt the stuff was used to kill alex savage monk said to a physician who did not have much experience and who did not suspect foul play the effects of the stuff might look like heart failure long tom grimaced felt of the gap in his teeth i didnt think the stuff was poisonous you know it didnt kill us on the train that was because you didnt get enough of it doc replied i thought at first that the attack on the train was made merely to frighten us since then ive learned more of the nature of these fellows they would as soon kill us as try to scare us just why such a small quantity of gas was injected into our train compartment is hard to explain perhaps the fellow administering the gas was frightened away the stuff must have been sent into the compartment through the crack at the bottom of the door doc ended his long speech abruptly and cupped a palm back of an ear he stood thus for several seconds perfectly rigid theres a boat coming he said it sounds like an outboard engine a minute passed two three the others began to wonder if doc could have been mistaken then they heard the sound of the boat probably the kidnapers coming back to make a deal renny boomed the boat is coming straight in from the open sea doc decided the boat nosed in past the floating mail box it became distinguishable in the moonlight it was simply a squaresterned canoe fitted with an outboard motor ahoy senors called a hoarse voice ive got a notion to take a shot at him renny rumbled bet i can hit him and then theyd bump ham patricia and the squaw monk grunted dont be a dope monk was very earnest although monk and ham seemed continually on the point of flying at each others throats and insulted each other with vigor and delight either would have risked his life for the other on occasion each had done so what do you want doc called to the distant men the ivory block senor savage the fellow shouted back we havent got the block doc told him you cannot deceive us hombre the reply came volleying back the senorita savage had it she admitted that fact when she was our prisoner earlier she thought she had it doc corrected him when she looked in the hiding place the block was gone we are not interested in hearing a smooth story senor savage said the distant man i came to inform you of a fact what fact simply senor that we now have your six friends in a very safe place several seconds of surprised silence followed these words six rennys big voice rumbled ham patricia and the squaw thats only three muttered johnny he took off his glasses with the magnifying lens lingered them thoughtfully did you say six doc called to the boatman si si the fellow shouted back he can only mean one thing long tom said slowly told you that the ovejas and el rabanos started shooting at me right after they escaped you were evidently mistaken doc told him sure i was long tom agreed it was this other gang shooting at me they must have grabbed senor and senorita oveja and el rabanos renny banged his big fists together it beats me me too monk agreed bewilderment was on his homely face i figured senor oveja his daughter and el rabanos were in with the other gang the ambush they fixed for doc made me think that i figured the same way said johnny there must have been a contact between the two parties otherwise how did they know of the meeting with doc the girl and the two men might have set a snare to capture me doc pointed out the other gang hearing of it could have tried to turn it into a death trap that might be too johnny admitted the man in the distant boat had been waiting his boat had drifted near a large rock which thrust out of the bay he had wedged the end of a boat hook into a crack in this rock and was holding his little craft stationary the rock was a bulletproof shelter do you understand me senor the man yelled i have your six friends they are all safe so far ham patricia and the squaw doc called who are the other three el rabanos senor oveja and his daughter came the reply i told you so said long tom when the three got away from me they jumped from the fryin pan to the fire that explains why the machine gunners werent at the cliff when you arrived they were watching the ovejas camp and saw us show up there then they skipped this seems to indicate the senorita is straight after all monk grunted when she said they were camped behind the cliff she lied johnny reminded him you want to make a swap doc shouted si si senor the man in the canoe called hastily we will trade our prisoners for the ivory cube i told you we havent got the ivory cube doc called back you are lying senor called the canoeman i will return in two hours if you do not give me the ivory cube one of the prisoners will be shot and the body tossed out where it will drift ashore with that he started the outboard motor and the squarestern canoe skipped out to sea apparently he had laid down an ultimatum about which there could be no argument chapter inside the ivory block the boat had hardly started its seaward retreat when doc savage whirled on long tom your electrical ear he said get it long tom dashed for the cabin just as monk always carried chemical equipment so did long tom carry a variety of electrical devices among these was an apparatus which had been useful on many occasions this consisted of a compact highly sensitive parabolic microphone pickup together with an amplifier of great power the thing was no radical departure from the listening devices military men use to spot enemy airplanes however it was infinitely more compact long tom hurriedly assembled the mechanism the microphone was directional he pointed it at the receding motor canoe the outboard engine was no longer audible to the unaided ear long tom twisted the dial on his amplifier there was a loudspeaker device the sound of the retreating canoe poured out with loud volume they listened to the noise which the sensitive device picked up after a while the outboard died suddenly long tom turned the amplifier on full force a mosquito flew across the front of the microphone and sounded like a trimotored airplane then the listener picked up several faint shouts but they were not understandable holy cow renny thumped they must be holding the prisoners in a boat out at sea take flashlights doc directed suddenly and hunt for birds nests in pine trees huh monk grunted and looked as if he had not understood birds nests in pine trees doc repeated were not interested in birds nests in any other kind of trees though what do we do when we find them monk wanted to know he was still puzzled climb up and look in them doc said then what when you find the right birds nest you wont need to be told the four men went looking for birds nests each had a dubious and puzzled look on his face just why doc was abruptly interested in nests in pine trees they had no idea monk cast his light up a tree and spied a telltale knot of twigs stringy bark and feathers he prepared to shin up to the nest huntin birds nests he snorted im glad ham aint here to see would he hand out razzberries i wouldnt blame him renny boomed especially since youre looking for nests in pine trees pine trees sure thats a spruce youre starting to climb renny chuckled yeah it is at that monk admitted sheepishly after taking a second look doc savage returned to the cabin he switched on his flashlight which gave the brilliant beam from a pocket he drew the aerial photographs which renny had made as yet doc had not had time to make a complete examination of these photographic prints he did so now on a picture which had been taken something like seven miles up the coast he found a tiny grayish spot this might have been a faded elongated flyspeck but under a magnifying glass it became a small schooner a tender dangled on a painter behind the schooner a canoe fitted with an outboard the discovery convinced doc that it was upon this boat that the prisoners were being held the craft was now standing out to sea of course monk came plunging in from the night i found it doc he howled the gorillalike giant of a chemist held his prize in both hands it was a birds nest the nest of a very large bird judging from its size how did you know what to look for doc monk questioned remember the ambercolored sticky stuff we found on the trousers and on the hands of the murdered indian doc asked sure it was gum off a pine tree monk whistled softly comprehending there was some bark stuck to his trousers and tiny feathers stuck to his hands bark off a pine tree and feathers from a birds nest doc agreed monk dived a furry hand into the birds nest hocus pocus presto he grinned he brought out a block of ivory more than two inches square renny and johnny and long tom came up they stared at the block boat face stole it renny thundered thats where it went he hid it in a birds nest doc took the block and turned it in his hand the workmanship was wonderful the thing looked perfectly solid crooking a finger at monk doc said ive got a job for you the bronze giant and the homely chemist retired to the room which held monks portable laboratory two or three minutes elapsed when doc reappeared he was alone he carried the block in one hand on a foundation of books doc arranged two flashlights that they splashed a brilliant glare on the table he placed the ivory cube in the illumination johnny promptly handed over his glasses with the magnifying left lens the magnifier disclosed narrow straight cracks along all four corners of the ivory block they were too small for the eyes to see unaided with his powerful hands doc tested the construction of the cube he was uncertain just how it opened he tried gentle pressure without result he shook it violently much as one would shake the mercury down in a thermometer this caused the block to separate into six sections it had been held together by tiny ingenious dowel pins the core of the cube was a hard square block of dried mud doc inspected this curiously he turned the mud slowly in his palm then wheeling abruptly he went into another room boat face had been buried his squaw however had kept the clothing he had been wearing at the time of his death doc selected the trousers and turned the pockets inside out he had done this on a previous search but he wanted to make sure several flat leaves fragments of chewing tobacco came to light the tobacco was very black in color doc turned his attention to the mud cube which he had crushed in his palm there was a leaf of the black tobacco in the mud boat faces chewing tobacco inside the cube from monks room came brisk tinkling of test tubes and mixing beakers docs other three aides had been watching the bronze man their expressions showed plainly that they were going to ask questions but before they could interrogate him they all heard the mutter of an approaching outboard motor doc savage whipped outdoors three of his men followed him monk however stayed with the job he was doing the sputter of the outboard loudened a blurred spot appeared out to sea it soon resolved into the squaresterned canoe the speedy little craft was crowded with men in the gloom little could be seen of the canoe passengers their forms were dark humps from each hump a slender black thorn seemed to project this proved they were not the prisoners the thorns were rifle barrels the outboard stopped and the canoe coasted behind a rock the armed passengers used boat hooks to keep themselves sheltered behind the stony hump one or two could be seen using binoculars they discerned doc savage and his aides your decision senor savage one shouted we have found the block doc told him you had it all the time the man jeered doc did not argue where are the prisoners he called they will be produced when you are ready to make the trade im ready now the men in the motor canoe held a brief consultation one of the gun barrels was pointed upward there was a loud report evidently the weapon was a shotgun nothing happened for three or four seconds then high overhead there was another report and a blinding flash regular fourth of july said renny it was a flash rocket fired as a signal announced johnny the prisoners will soon be here called the man from the outboard canoe nothing more happened for possibly fifteen minutes then far out to sea the slow throb of a marine engine came into hearing doc listened intently to the engine noise its a gasoline motor he decided that means there is probably an auxiliary power plant in the schooner shortly afterward using glasses doc was able to discern the craft it was not more than fifty feet long but had a wide beam and stout lines the boat was built for service outside the inlet it swung into the teeth of a light breeze the auxiliary motor turning slowly held it stationary the prisoners are aboard the schooner senor called the man in the motor canoe how do you know that doc countered shouts passed between the canoe and the schooner following this hams voice rang strongly from the schooner ham had a powerful orators voice developed by much courtroom work were all k he shouted h theyre trying to bargain for our release doc tell em to go take a jump at the moon are there six of you doc demanded sure senor and senorita oveja and el rabanos are prisoners tool then the spokesman in the canoe interrupted the conversation will you turn over the ivory cube for their release he called to doc doc lowered his voice so that it could by no chance reach any of the swarthy men monk coming up said monk also lowvoiced the homely chemist ambled out of the cabin his hairy hands swung well below his knees one paw gripped an object wrapped in a handkerchief all set doc asked yep but i was sure pushed for time doc and monk strode together down to the waters edge for a moment they were lost to view in the moonlight as they worked through the brush they waded out until the lapping waves came somewhat above their knees come and get it doc called but you must release the prisoners si si called the man in the canoe the captives will be turned loose the instant we have the ivory block the outboard motor bawled its propeller threw up a fan of spray the canoe darted inshore with the speed of a frightened duck at a low word from doc monk retreated hastily and got under cover the canoe swerved inshore and slackened speed the boat passed doc slowly at a distance of thirty feet throw the cube commanded a man it had better fall in the canoe too we dare not come too close to you we will free the prisoners when we have it docs arm drew back shot forward square and white the little block sailed through the moonlight the man in the canoe caught it bueno he barked good now this is how we intend to return the prisoners as if the exclamation were a signal every man in the canoe lifted his rifle the muzzles lipped flame gun sounds blended in a ragged roar at the moment when he tossed the white cube doc savage was standing in water above his knees he was not taken unawares the first rifle barrel was hardly swaying toward him when be doubled flopping forward violently into the water he was completely submerged before the shots crashed the perfect physical condition in which doc kept himself had given him an ability which had saved his life on other occasions this was the capacity to hold his breath for a seemingly impossible interval actually the breathholding did not depend entirely on physical condition there was a trick to it instead of taking as deep a breath as he could several rapid inhalations were made to charge the lungs with oxygen and the dive was then made with a normal amount of air in the lungs doc had learned this trick from the men who could do it best south sea pearl divers keeping close to the sandy bottom doc swam under water he did not go toward the canoe nor did he swim fast enough to raise a betraying ripple the water was vibrant with hollow chunging noises rifle shots the men were driving lead at random in hopes of making a hit as he swam docs hands encountered a rock he eased around it still submerged when the rock was between himself and the canoe he floated to the surface he was in time to hear the first of a series of remarkable sounds these noises resembled the moan of a gigantic bull fiddle they were so loud they hurt the ears the moans were very short none lasting more than two seconds the cove throbbed with their volume these sounds were strings of shots although a human ear could not distinguish between the reports they came so swiftly as to seem a single shot the shots were fired by the remarkably compact little machine guns which were docs invention doc chanced to look being in shadow he was fairly safe from discovery the little machine guns were charged with bullets which carried unconsciousness rather than death mercy bullets three men were down in the canoe this was not such good shooting considering that all of docs men were good marksmen rather it was evident they were not trying to capture the gang the canoe turned wildly and skittered out toward the bay mouth a few bullets followed it fighting wave crests like angry bees it was noticeable that none of the slugs came close to the canoe which was now in wild flight it is bad shooting and this is lucky for us squawked a man those guns shivered another never before have i heard anything like them senors the terrific rate at which the little machine guns fired had produced a near terror they all showed the effects of it the three men who had been hit lay motionless in the bottom of the canoe as soon as the ugly moans of the machine guns ceased the three victims were examined bueno ejaculated one of the gang they are not dead continuing his inspection the man gave a grunt of surprise what is this the bullets seem to have penetrated only skin deep and then burst evidently the man had never seen a mercy bullet he and his fellows were puzzling over the slugs when the canoe reached the schooner they clambered aboard after lifting their three motionless companions over the rail did you get the ivory block asked a fellow who seemed to be in charge of the boat we did declared one of the group he pulled the white cube from a pocket and passed it over the other examined it from the shore a strange sound drifted it was a series of guttural booming words words which were intelligible to no one on the schooner deck it was doc savage shouting in a strange dialect the man holding the white block looked at his fellows do any of you understand that language amigos he asked there was a general shaking of heads the tongue in which the shout had been couched was wholly foreign to anything they had ever heard dismissing the shout as unimportant the men examined the white cube closely they sought to get it open finally they shook the cube violently it separated into six sections what happened then was strange the holder of the cube stared stupidly at the segments then he leaned over and gazed foolishly down at the deck and as if he had found a place to lie down he toppled forward his fall upon the deck produced a loud thump he lay quite motionless afterward chapter into the earth the apparent magic which had felled the opener of the box reached swiftly to the other members of the crew one went down another there was no outcry no attempt to flee they simply keeled over each man began snoring softly a few seconds after he had sprawled out after perhaps twenty seconds not a man on the schooners deck remained upright ham and the other prisoners were below they had been locked in a small not too clean cabin the wrists of each were bound tightly a long rope had been knotted to the lashings of hams wrist carried to those of pretty senorita oveja and tied thence to the senoritas father and the rest of the prisoners while men were dropping so mysteriously on deck the prisoners were doing something that seemed inexplicable they were holding their breaths senor ovejas cheeks were puffed with the effort he seemed about to explode with one hand ham made slow counting gestures as if he were measuring the passage of a certain length of time finally ham let his breath out in a rush and said k you can start breathing again what was the idea of telling us to hold our breaths ham patricia savage questioned curiously did you hear doc shout in that strange language ham asked yes i couldnt understand a word of it probably not a dozen people in the socalled civilized world could understand it ham told her the language was ancient mayan doc and the rest of us speak it and understand it what did doc say when he shouted he said he had some of his anaesthetic gas in the ivory cube ham replied he said for us to hold our breaths because the stuff would be released when the cube was opened but why hold our breath patricia queried puzzled the anaesthetic gas spreads with lightning swiftness ham explained in less than a minute it dissolves and becomes ineffective we simply held our breaths until it was dissipated ham now got to his feet his ankles were not bound so this was comparatively simple the others followed his example ham headed for the deck the others had no choice but to follow him they were tied in a chain by the rope patricia gasped in surprise when she saw the sleeping forms of her late captors the gas got them ham chuckled now if we can just get this boat headed for shore well be all right did it work doc called loudly from the beach you tell em ham bellowed back like a charm the engine of the launch wont run doc called theres no gasoline in the tank but well paddle out and help you get to shore you want to be careful ham called the whole gang wasnt on the boat weve only got about half of them any idea where the others are doc shouted no ham said theyre liable to be around somewhere doc made no answer ham unable to distinguish the bronze man in the moonlight decided doc had gone to get the launch patricia glanced uneasily at the swarthy men lying senseless on deck arent you afraid theyll revive she asked ham it will take them nearly two hours to wake up ham told her doc has been using this anaesthetic gas for a long time i know exactly how it functions patricia heaved a relieved sigh then were safe she was too optimistic unexpectedly from either side of the schooner rifles banged the shots echoed back noisily from the cliffs bullets chopped savagely at bull and deck house a slug tore a ragged hole in the furled sail the men doing the shooting were as yet some distance away ham peering hard could locate them only from the flash of their rifles they were coming from two directions evidently they were shooting at the schooner as a whole at that distance they could not pick out individual targets its the rest of the gang ham gritted el rabanos wailed diablos the devils they will kill us get in the canoe ham commanded let me in the stern where i can start the motor patricia cried but the schooner was no time to get it under way explained ham come on those birds mustve been listening they heard us talking to doc and knew something had happened to their pals privately ham had no use for canoes years ago one had ducked him when he was togged out in his immaculate clothes they were tricky things even when there was plenty of time to get into them getting six excited individuals all linked together by a rope into the canoe proved to be an agonizing job twice the canoe rocked sickeningly ham groaned and yelled by turns the instant be could reach the outboard motor at the stern be went to work on it the motor was still hot that was lucky for with his hands bound he would never have got it started otherwise rifle bullets were still hitting the schooner with loud chugs some bit at the water and ricocheted with piercing wails others traveled on without touching water or schooner and spanged noisily among the rocks on the inlet shores the outboard motor popped a blue flame through its exhaust ports it fired again then began to moan regularly patricia in the bow had already thrown off the painter ham gave the outboard all the gas it would take the canoe swerved away from the schooner a spatter of lead followed them as they raced for shore the riflemen approaching from two directions were not yet close enough to shoot accurately however a bullet spanged through the thin canvas side of the canoe just at the water line the hole near the bow began to let water in i hope lightning doesnt strike twice in the same place patricia said and put a hand over the bullet hole to shut out the water it was the little supermachine guns in the hands of doc and the others which insured their reaching shore the small guns began to emit the amazing bullfiddle moans the bullets charged with tracer chemical in addition to the sleepproducing potion raced like redhot wires through the moonlight it was probably the sight of the red cords of tracer snapping past their faces that moved the riflemen to stop shooting whatever the cause they fell silent ham ran the canoe against the beach so hard that it skidded up half its length on the sand he piled out dragging the others the giant form of doc savage materialized silently beside them doc produced a knife and cut through their bonds your scheme was swell patricia told doc give monk the credit doc replied he is the one who made up that fake ivory block hes a wizard as a chemist or he couldnt have done it so quickly ham overheard this and he grimaced praise for the homely monk was a pain to his ears the tall girlfaced el rabanos came up i wish to apologize for any trouble i may have caused you mr savage he said earnestly i know now that you are not our enemy senor oveja approached in time to listen he emitted a surly growl en verdad he snapped indeed i am by no means convinced that savage is our friend big bronze doc savage did not seem particularly interested in what senor oveja thought he turned away girlfaced el rabanos said in a low voice i am terribly sorry for my friends actions senor savage dont worry about it doc said wryly but senor savage it is ungrateful of him i am sorry to say el rabanos insisted those hombres on the schooner were going to kill us unquestionably you saved our lives doc said nothing he kept on walking he was headed for the cabin we owe you an explanation also el rabanos continued in an ingratiating voice in case you do not know it we prevailed upon the senorita oveja to deceive you this afternoon i knew it we did not intend to harm you with the trick el rabanos said desperately we were merely going to seize you we had the silly idea that we could trade you to your friends for the ivory cube we had finally decided you must have the cube but did not know its significance pretty senorita oveja overhauled them and joined in the conversation that is the truth senor savage she added her insistence harm to you was the last thing in our minds doc bowed politely but said nothing a few minutes later however when doc and monk were together the homely chemist expressed a private idea doc said monk i may be wrong but i believe theres a connection between our three visitors and that gang out there what makes you think so the fact that the trap set for you was a death trap docs strange flakegold eyes rested intently on the homely chemist who do you suspect monk monk tugged slowly at an ear which resembled a gristle tuft senor oveja he said doc savage did not change expression neither did he speak further on the subject instead he spread a piece of paper on the table then he drew an envelope from a pocket and tore off the corner from envelope to paper he poured a tiny heap of clean white sand whered that sand come from monk queried curiously from the moccasins of the dead boat face doc told him guess you were not around when i took it out going to the door doc called pat patricia alert and prettier than ever entered she gave monk a gorgeous smile apparently by way of thanking him for his work in constructing the trick ivory block which had been responsible for their escape monk reacted with the look of a homely cat which had just dined on the canary patricia was by far the prettiest girl monk had ever seen he would have liked to stay and talk with her a glance at doc however showed that the bronze man wanted to be left alone with patricia monk ambled out leaving the two together hardly more than a minute later patricia reappeared she looked neither to right nor left but walked away along the shore of the inlet she was swallowed by the black shadows which gorged the wilderness of brush doc savage came out of the cabin and moved about in the darkness until he found long tom take your listening device and climb up on top of the cabin doc directed the electrical wizard swing the thing in slow circles report whatever you hear long tom hastily complied the microphone of his contrivance was so sensitive and the amplifier so powerful that it would be almost impossible for any one to approach the cabin without being heard long tom hooked wires together clicked switches and thumbed dials instead of a loudspeaker for listening he used a head set this was more sensitive hey doc he called almost at once i hear somebody already it sounds like one person walking is the person making three sharp rapping sounds at frequent intervals doc asked sounds such as would be made by sticks beaten together long tom strained his ears yes then its patricia doc told him i gave her two pieces of wood and told her to beat them together three times every few steps whenever you hear that youll know its her if you hear anybody else though fire two shots in the air thats to warn patricia to hide herself or to hurry back whats patricia doing long tom asked there was no answer from the bronze man long tom looked over the cabin roof he could see no sign of doc in the moonlight he returned to his listening deciding patricia s mission would have to be a mystery for the present doc had entered the cabin on a table he spread the six sections which had been fitted together to form the ivory block at first glance the inner surfaces of these seemed merely carelessly carved they were a bit rough however when a magnifying glass was put on them the roughness assumed a definite form it was possible to tell that the block held a cleverly carved relief map of the region around the cabin it was necessary to rearrange the parts several times before doc had them in their proper positions thats it renny said at last renny was looking over docs shoulder the bigfisted fellow probably knew as much about maps as any man it was part of his engineering training doc ran the magnifying glass along the irregular line which indicated the shore on the carving it was not hard to find the location of the entombed galleon the spot was marked by a tiny exquisitely carved skull there was no other peculiar mark on the map which made it almost certain the skull identified the location of the galleon the darn thing isnt over a mile from here renny boomed senor oveja his daughter and el rabanos had not been parties to the inspection of the insides of the ivory block chancing to come into the room now they observed what had been going on i demand that block senor oveja said angrily it is mine by what right doc queried senor oveja sputtered indignantly my ancestor your ancestor was a thief doc said shortly the ivory block was admittedly not his property nor was the galleon or its contents senor oveja seemed about to explode before he could do that doc walked away the bronze man had the sections of the ivory block in a pocket you fellows drift out in the brush doc told monk in a low voice ill join you a bit later itll save trouble with senor and senorita oveja and el rabanos if they do not know we are going well leave long tom here to watch them long tom has to stay anyway to protect patricia with his listening device he has to give pat warning if any of our enemies come close so she can duck were going to have a look at that galleon monk guessed in a hushed whisper you have guessed it doc told him twenty minutes later ham was hissing peevishly at monk cant you be quiet you missing link you make more fuss than all the rest of us together this was hardly true ham had just fallen down making a considerable racket monk only sniffed why dont you throw that sword cane away shyster thats what youre stumbling over the dapper ham had retained his sword cane through the excitement he had lost it in the cabin when the gang seized him upon escaping his first act had been to find it you tripped me ham growled you big accident of nature gilt out the funnyboning you culls rennys big voice boomed softly the doggone galleon should be around here some place the sloppy smack of waves began to reach their ears each smack was followed by a long flutter of falling spray this indicated the shore was a rock wall climbing sheer from the water like mountaineers the men were carrying a long rope this was vitally necessary the way they were traversing was incredibly rough deep gashes appeared underfoot with the unexpectedness of crevasses in a glacier more than once they had to lower a man over a lip of stone until he touched bottom just as often they had to remain at the foot of a wall of stone while doc savage climbed with the end of the rope later to haul them up to docs enormous strength agility and sense of balance the canyon wails presented no great obstacles eventually docs men sank on the crest of a small ridge panting they rested there doc had gone on ahead while they climbed they presumed he was searching for the spot marked on the map within the ivory cube here it is men doc called suddenly the men came to life as if lightning had struck near by they scrambled down the steep slope toward the spot docs voice had come from the bronze man stood beside a waisthigh pile of evergreen brush the spot was in a cuplike depression on all sides stone wails sloped up steeply the gaunt johnny looked around vacantly he took off his glasses put them back on again i dont see anything he said doc savage grasped a limb which projected near the bottom of the brush pile he lifted it and upset the entire pile the brush had covered a hole in the steep slope of the hill the mouth of a tunnel it was perhaps three feet wide four high for a few feet the tunnel penetrated soft earth for that distance it was timbered the timbers were bright and new in some spots twigs still clung to them leaves on these were still green beyond the timbering the tunnel dived into solid rock and sloped sharply downward its floor became a series of crude steps this work was done a long long time ago said johnny if any one was qualified to judge the age of mankinds handiwork the gaunt archaeologist was he could look at a goblet from an egyptian tomb and tell what pharaoh drank out of it but the work at the entrance was very recent monk muttered it hasnt been done over a week or two ill bet the steps ended the tunnel traveled straight ahead for a few feet it emptied then into what appeared to be a subterranean room doc snapped a long glaring white beam from his flashlight and roved it slowly about holy cow breathed renny in awestricken tones chapter the skeleton crew the underground recess was not as large as it had seemed at first it was in fact hardly more than enough to contain the thing it held the walls to the right were solid and smooth once a canyon side to the left was rock cracked distorted slidein rock but solid for all of that a small rill of water crawled across the sandy floor it looked like a flow of molten silver the galleon had bulked big in front of their eyes it bad been blocked up on rocks for a bullscraping when disaster had overtaken it the fact that it had been blocked up had preserved it from dampness to a certain extent but it was not exactly seaworthy once the galleon might have been a gilded pride of the spanish main no telling what colors had bedecked it but it was gray now gray because of a repulsive mold which covered it like a carpet to the left of where doc and his men stood a skeleton lay on a rock it lay in a curled position like a slumbering dog one of the hands from which part of the finger bones had dropped was over a gaping eye socket as if to keep out the light one of the galleon crew i guess said renny the big engineers enormous voice was a booming roar which assumed earsplitting proportions in the cavern confines use your muffler monk whispered youll shake this place down on us doc savage turned his flash beam like a rod of white flame impaled each of his men in turn in their eagerness all four had followed him into the tunnel the flash beam went to the sandy floor tracks were there fresh tracks the imprints were those of moccasins doc moved along the side of the galleon his men trailing him they passed three more skeletons rusty streaks beside the bone assemblies might once have been blunderbusses or swords several piles of rust along the cavern wall hinted at cannons which must have been removed to lighten the galleon for careening reaching out doc placed a finger against the hull with a little pressure the finger sank for half its length into the moldcovered wood the galleon was a pile of rot doc came to a halt before him in the hull of the galleon a hole gaped it was a fresh bole and at least four feet square it looked like it had been dug open with a spade doc popped his light into the bole there were more skeletons five six seven of them this time they were gray things made utterly hideous by the mold which covered them it was indeed a macabre argosy this ship from another age with its crew of skeletons doc entered he sank ankledeep in the spongy timbers it seemed inevitable that the whole ship would come down about his ears going on his light picked up objects which bore a marked resemblance to the brassbound chests which historians write of he dropped the glittering thread of light into one of these empty renny thundered the treasure is gone doc savage stepped swiftly to each of the chests in turn he worked his way aft through a bulkhead more of the chests were there he picked up a small circular piece of metal and a green glittering object which might have been colored glass but wasnt he carried the articles back and showed them to his men a pieceofeight and a small emerald monk muttered that indicates there was really a treasure here ham punched angrily at a bulkhead with his sword cane the cane sank part of its length in the soggy wood its gone he snapped who got it you noticed those tracks doc said they were made by feet shod in moccasins ham frowned you mean boat face boat face made the tracks doc said not only did the indian have the ivory cube but he knew its significance the gang who was after it must have told him what it was probably they hired him to get it for them then when he doublecrossed them they killed him it looks like our job now is to find out where boat face put the treasure renny grumbled maybe he didnt take it out of here monk offered after all this is as good a hiding place as any lets look around monk started for the stern doc was at his side they passed through an aperture which had been spaded in a molded bulkhead doc suddenly dropped a hand on monks shoulder monks gristled apish frame weighed in the neighborhood of two hundred and fifty pounds but docs hand brought him up as sharply as if he had been a child back doc rapped blazes whats wrong monk had wheeled was diving back the way he had come as he asked the question doc savage made no answer he was close behind monk just before leaving the compartment he halted half turned and popped his flashlight ahead the light disclosed a thin thread as gray as the mold which covered every inch of the ancient galleon the thread was about six inches above the floor wheeling doc followed monk back to the others they all stared at him expecting an explanation they were all a bit on edge this place they were in a grave which covered a hideous ship and its macabre crew of skeletons had got under their skin somewhat doc did not explain outside he said they scrambled into the rock tunnel mounted the steps and stumbled out into the night the cupshaped depression into which the tunnel mouth opened was fairly deep the moon was low in the sky its beams did not penetrate to the depression bottom wheeew said monk im glad to get out of that place what went wrong doc plenty has gone wrong for you amigos announced a guttural voice with that several flashlights poked white funnels down over the depression rim doc and his men were wrapped in a white glare of light squinting against glare they could see men with guns on all sides of them one of the encircling gang hastily left his fellows and darted down the side of the depression his gait down the steep slope was a series of grotesque hops he came to a stop about halfway down we know all about the gast said the guttural voice which had spoken previously i mean senor savage the gas which does its work while you hold your breath do not try to use it if the man who just came near you drops we will begin shooting sabe monk and ham exchanged uneasy looks they had forgotten their animosity johnny and renny stood perfectly still each of docs men carried one of the little supermachine guns under his coat they debated their chances of seizing the guns and making a fight of it the chances seemed slim easy does it doc said in an expressionless voice if we start fireworks we havent a chance that is very sensible hombres said the voice above each of you will remove his upper garments strip to the skin roll up your trousers legs to show no weapons are concealed beneath them turn your trousers pockets inside out the speaker was not one of the ring of gunmen he stood behind them hidden from view doc and his four men stripped off coats shirts and undershirts doc shed his remarkable vest they rolled up trousers legs then turned pockets out bueno said the masked man we can now be sure that they have no weapons left go amigos and seize them men came sliding down the side of the depression doc savage had seen ail of the gang on other occasions they were the kidnapers of patricia savage doc counted eleven of them that was the entire gang except the leader their chief did not appear he remained above unseen the men carried ropes they began tying the prisoners one fellows rope was of extraordinary length and it was he who bound doc savage the ropes were not of hemp but of braided cotton they were very strong the men doing the knotting knew how it should he done apparently doc submitted meekly to the binding but a close observer might have noticed that the cables of muscles on his wrists were even larger than usual doc was holding the tendons tense if he were tied while they were thus he had merely to relax to get sufficient slack to shake off the binding ropes one of the swarthy gang had a canvas bag slung over a shoulder from this he drew a bottleshaped object of shiny metal the neck was fitted with a valve now i will give the hombres the same thing i gave alex savage growled the man from the same sack which had held the metal flask the fellow withdrew two fragments of rather floppy rubber these were carved rubberstamp fashion the carving was that of a wolf with strangely human features these were obviously the stamps used to leave the weird werewolf marks the gold flakes in docs eyes seemed to have turned to a tawny frost here was the murderer of alex savage no called the unseen leader from above not the gas we can leave them somewhere muttered the man with the gas flask no one can tell but what they died of heart failure no not yet reluctantly the swarthy man replaced the metal gas bottle in the canvas bag container another dark man drew a knife he juggled the blade in a way which showed remarkable dexterity his manner indicated he was the knifethrowing expert of the group and that he was proud of it then i will dispose of them as i did boat face amigos he smirked doc savage said nothing made no move it was a bad sign the frank way these fellows were speaking of past crimes it meant that they had little intention of doc and his men living to bear witness to tell a jury what they had heard no said the concealed chief no knife yet the hidden leader now showed himself he came skidding down the slope he was a tall man little more than that could be seen of him he wore a mask a great bandanna handkerchief which covered his head as well as his features doc savage glanced at monk do you know this fellow monk he asked dryly monk squinted at the masked man nope cant recognize em isnt his walk familiar monk considered acting as if the individual they were discussing were not present aint able to tell doc he said youll have to spill it k said doc the bird is the masked man snarled he doubled and scooped up one of the tiny supermachine guns which doc had been forced to drop leveling it he shot doc in his unprotected chest chapter the killing dead doc dropped the tiny machine gun happened to be latched into singleshot position that was fortunate even though the gun was charged with mercy bullets at that short range a flood of the slugs would have wrought fatal injury as it was doc took only one mercy bullet in the chest the stupefying chemical worked swiftly doc was probably asleep before he hit the ground monk and the others stared at their bronze chief they were dazed now that they thought back this was the first time they could remember having seen doc entirely helpless they themselves being bound with rope which was beyond their strength to break were powerless to aid their bronze chief bueno said the swarthy man who wielded knives let us give him another bullet a real bullet the masked man shook his head slowly no amigos we will delay that these men may have removed the treasure if so we will have to make them lead us to it the fellow stepped into the tunnel his followers crowding eagerly after him they were hungry for sight of this loot which they had gone to such pains to get none troubled to watch the prisoners they were bound too tightly to escape it seemed the last man vanished into the tunnel monk and the others wrenched at the ropes they tried to untie each others bonds with their teeth the task was not hopeless but it would take many minutes well never make it johnny groaned repeatedly the men glanced at doc they knew the bronze giant was a wizard as an escape artist these ropes as vigorously as they had been tied would hardly hold doc but the metallic giant was a victim of the mercy bullet or was he the swarthy men had left a flashlight stuck in the side of the depression the beam of this played directly on doc the bronze mans lids seemed to flutter they did flutter doc renny rumbled softly renny was incredulous he knew the stupefying power of the mercy bullets he had not believed a man could recover from their effects in less than thirty minutes hardly ten minutes had elapsed since doc collapsed his recovery so soon was a tribute to his fine physical condition doc lay perfectly motionless for a time when finally he spoke his voice was unexcited where did they go you mean the gang that grabbed us and the masked big shot monk asked yes they went into the tunnel with a tremendous convulsive effort doc gained his feet the wound on his chest was small merely a puncture which hardly oozed crimson theyll be killed at the galleon he rapped we may have time to get em out before docs words were still banging through the surrounding night when the earth seemed to heave several inches underfoot there was a tremendous bellowing roar it seemed to start deep in the earth and gain and gain in volume the ground vibrated as if it were about to fall to pieces boulders and gravel showered down the depression sides out of the tunnel maw came a dragonbreath spout of crimson fire a gush of yellow smoke followed it then the tunnel seemed to shut itself like a big mouth closing the quaking of the earth stopped the rumbling died a few rocks galloped the last of the distance down the slope then there was silence renny used the exclamation he employed on such occasions holy cowl he exploded what happened doc savage did not answer immediately instead he twisted his arms into various positions the great muscles that had been tense when he was hound had relaxed now the rope which had secured him fell away he started untying his friends making explanations as he worked there was a thread stretched across one of the galleon cabins he said it ran to a contact that was barely visible at one side the contact could have only one purpose it was connected to an electric detonator for dynamite or gunpowder so thats why you rushed us out of the galleon monk exclaimed doc nodded there was a chance of other contacts better concealed in other parts of the craft boat faces work huh monk guessed but whyd he do it boat face evidently did it doc agreed he was the only visitor to the place before ourselves his tracks prove that he must have known he was mixed up with bad actors possibly he set the trap to get rid of them he might have intended to give them the ivory block so that they would visit the galleon monk stared at the tunnel which had closed like a mouth boat face did a great job for a dead man he said theyre all finished down below doc nodded no doubt of it monk swung his gaze back to doc who was the masked guy doc doc started to answer but held the words back when he heard a distant cry the sound was shrilly feminine cutting through the night patricia savages voice she was anxious as to the fate of the men they heard the explosion and are worrying about us doc decided aloud instead of answering monks question wed better let them know were safe doc went to meet patricia he encountered her within two hundred yards with the girl were long tom ample tiny senorita oveja and senor oveja girlfaced el rabanos was not with them long tom was excited what happened he gulped wheres el rabanos monk countered blasted if i know long tom retorted he disappeared somehow without me hearing him with the listening device the only way he could have done it was to creep off at the same time you birds left following you your noise covered his footsteps that explains how the gang found us doc told monk monk emitted a long whistle so the guy in the mask was el rabanos the master mind behind all this violence was el rabanos doc agreed eso hace temblar senor oveja moaned it is shocking el rabanos my best friend a doublecrosser the same gentleman who ordered his men to throttle you on the train using my baggage straps doc agreed give him credit for a devilish mind he covered himself by making you think i was an enemy but the treasure exclaimed monk where is it doc savage turned to patricia i showed you the sand from boat faces moccasins he said you said you knew of a pool in a creek which had that kind of sand in its bottom you said you remembered wading there you went to examine it what did you find the treasure patricia said boat face had carried it out and sunk it the stuff was in fairly deep water it was in carrying it out to deep water that boat face got the sand in his moccasins from a pocket she produced a thin string of scintillating color it was a bangle of emeralds strung on gold heres a sample of the stuff senor oveja stared at the bauble he suddenly forgot his grief over his friends treachery i demand a share amigos he said aggressively at least three fourths of the treasure doc savage ignored him what disposition will be made of the treasure patricia asked then lest motives be misunderstood she added i dont want any nobody will get any doc said dryly some of it came from the churches of old panama city that portion should be easily identified it will be turned over to the church its rightful owner he considered the rest will be used to build public hospitals here in canada and to establish a trust fund to keep them operating without charge to patients that is what we usually do with any money that comes our way wonder how much the stuff is worth monk pondered several millions at least patricia said i know a little of jewels enough to guess at the value senor oveja waved his arms excitedly and shrieked but what do i get out of it you doc told him get the air the end
