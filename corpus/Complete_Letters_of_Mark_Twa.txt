complete letters of mark twain ed ab paine mark twains letters complete arranged with comment by albert bigelow paine volume i foreword nowhere is the human being more truly revealed than in his letters notin literary letters prepared with care and the thought of possible publication but in those letters wrought out of the press of circumstances and with no idea of print in mind a collection of such documents written by one whose life has become of interest to mankind at large has a value quite aside from literature in that it reflects in some degree at least the soul of the writer the letters of mark twain are peculiarly of the revealing sort he was a man of few restraints and of no affectations in his correspondence as in his talk he spoke what was in his mind untrammeled by literary conventions necessarily such a collection does not constitute a detailed life story but is supplementary to it an extended biography of mark twain has already been published his letters are here gathered for those who wish to pursue the subject somewhat more exhaustively from the strictly personal side selections from this correspondence were used in the biography mentioned most of these are here reprinted in the belief that an owner of the letters will wish the collection to be reasonably complete etext editors note a b paine considers this compendium a supplement to his mark twain a biography i have arranged the volumes of the letters to correspond as closely as possible with the dates of the project gutenberg six volumes of the biography dw mark twains letters mark twain a biographical summary samuel langhorne clemens for nearly half a century known and celebrated as mark twain was born in florida missouri on november he was one of the foremost american philosophers of his day he was the worlds most famous humorist of any day during the later years of his life he ranked not only as americas chief man of letters but likewise as her best known and best loved citizen the beginnings of that life were sufficiently unpromising the family was a good one of old virginia and kentucky stock but its circumstances were reduced its environment meager and disheartening the father john marshall clemens a lawyer by profession a merchant by vocation had brought his household to florida from jamestown tennessee somewhat after the manner of judge hawkins as pictured in the gilded age florida was a small town then a mere village of twentyone houses located on salt river but judge clemens as he was usually called optimistic and speculative in his temperament believed in its future salt river would be made navigable florida would become a metropolis he established a small business there and located his family in the humble frame cottage where five months later was born a baby boy to whom they gave the name of samuel a family name and added langhorne after an old virginia friend of his father the child was puny and did not make a very sturdy fight for life still he weathered along season after season and survived two stronger children margaret and benjamin by judge clemens had lost faith in florida he removed his family to hannibal and in this mississippi river town the little lad whom the world was to know as mark twain spent his early life in tom sawyer we have a picture of the hannibal of those days and the atmosphere of his boyhood there his schooling was brief and of a desultory kind it ended one day in when his father died and it became necessary that each one should help somewhat in the domestic crisis his brother orion ten years his senior was already a printer by trade pamela his sister also considerably older had acquired music and now took a few pupils the little boy sam at twelve was apprenticed to a printer named ament his wages consisted of his board and clothes more board than clothes as he once remarked to the writer he remained with ament until his brother orion bought out a small paper in hannibal in the paper in time was moved into a part of the clemens home and the two brothers ran it the younger setting most of the type a still younger brother henry entered the office as an apprentice the hannibal journal was no great paper from the beginning and it did not improve with time still it managed to survive country papers nearly always manage to survive year after year bringing in some sort of return it was on this paper that young sam clemens began his writings burlesque as a rule of local characters and conditions usually published in his brothers absence generally resulting in trouble on his return yet they made the paper sell and if orion had but realized his brothers talent he might have turned it into capital even then in he was not yet eighteen sam clemens grew tired of his limitations and pined for the wider horizon of the world he gave out to his family that he was going to st louis but he kept on to new york where a worlds fair was then going on in new york he found employment at his trade and during the hot months of worked in a printingoffice in cliff street by and by he went to philadelphia where he worked a brief time made a trip to washington and presently set out for the west again after an absence of more than a year onion meanwhile had established himself at muscatine iowa but soon after removed to keokuk where the brothers were once more together till following their trade young sam clemens remained in keokuk until the winter of when he caught a touch of the southamerican fever then prevalent and decided to go to brazil he left keokuk for cincinnati worked that winter in a printingoffice there and in april took the little steamer paul jones for new orleans where he expected to find a southamerican vessel in life on the mississippi we have his story of how he met horace bixby and decided to become a pilot instead of a south american adventurer jauntily setting himself the stupendous task of learning the twelve hundred miles of the mississippi river between st louis and new orleans of knowing it as exactly and as unfailingly even in the dark as one knows the way to his own features it seems incredible to those who knew mark twain in his later years dreamy unpractical and indifferent to details that he could have acquired so vast a store of minute facts as were required by that task yet within eighteen months he had become not only a pilot but one of the best and most careful pilots on the river intrusted with some of the largest and most valuable steamers he continued in that profession for two and a half years longer and during that time met with no disaster that cost his owners a single dollar for damage then the war broke out south carolina seceded in december and other states followed clemens was in new orleans in january when louisiana seceded and his boat was put into the confederate service and sent up the red river his occupation gone he took steamer for the north the last one before the blockade closed a blank cartridge was fired at them from jefferson barracks when they reached st louis but they did not understand the signal and kept on presently a shell carried away part of the pilothouse and considerably disturbed its inmates they realized then that war had really begun in those days clemenss sympathies were with the south he hurried up to hannibal and enlisted with a company of young fellows who were recruiting with the avowed purpose of throwing off the yoke of the invader they were ready for the field presently and set out in good order a sort of nondescript cavalry detachment mounted on animals more picturesque than beautiful still it was a resolute band and might have done very well only it rained a good deal which made soldiering disagreeable and hard lieutenant clemens resigned at the end of two weeks and decided to go to nevada with orion who was a union abolitionist and had received an appointment from lincoln as secretary of the new territory in roughing it mark twain gives us the story of the overland journey made by the two brothers and a picture of experiences at the other end true in aspect even if here and there elaborated in detail he was orions private secretary but there was no privatesecretary work to do and no salary attached to the position the incumbent presently went to mining adding that to his other trades he became a professional miner but not a rich one he was at aurora california in the esmeralda district skimping along with not much to eat and less to wear when he was summoned by joe goodman owner and editor of the virginia city enterprise to come up and take the local editorship of that paper he had been contributing sketches to it now and then under the pen name of josh and goodman a man of fine literary instincts recognized a talent full of possibilities this was in the late summer of clemens walked one hundred and thirty miles over very bad roads to take the job and arrived wayworn and travelstained he began on a salary of twentyfive dollars a week picking up news items here and there and contributing occasional sketches burlesques hoaxes and the like when the legislature convened at carson city he was sent down to report it and then for the first time began signing his articles mark twain a river term used in making soundings recalled from his piloting days the name presently became known up and down the pacific coast his articles were copied and commented upon he was recognized as one of the foremost among a little coterie of overland writers two of whom mark twain and bret harte were soon to acquire a worldwide fame he left carson city one day after becoming involved in a duel the result of an editorial squib written in goodmans absence and went across the sierras to san francisco the duel turned out farcically enough but the nevada law which regarded even a challenge or its acceptance as a felony was an inducement to his departure furthermore he had already aspired to a wider field of literary effort he attached himself to the morning call and wrote occasionally for one or two literary papers the golden era and the californian prospering well enough during the better part of the year bret harte and the rest of the little pacificslope group were also on the staff of these papers and for a time at least the new school of american humor mustered in san francisco the connection with the call was not congenial in due course it came to a natural end and mark twain arranged to do a daily san francisco letter for his old paper the enterprise the enterprise letters stirred up trouble they criticized the police of san francisco so severely that the officials found means of making the writers life there difficult and comfortless with jim gillis brother of a printer of whom he was fond and who had been the indirect cause of his troubles he went up into calaveras county to a cabin on jackass hill jim gillis a lovable picturesque character the truthful james of bret harte owned mining claims mark twain decided to spend his vacation in pocketmining and soon added that science to his store of knowledge it was a halcyon happy three months that he lingered there but did not make his fortune he only laid the cornerstone they tried their fortune at angels camp a place well known to readers of bret harte but it rained pretty steadily and they put in most of their time huddled around the single stove of the dingy hotel of angels telling yarns among the stories was one told by a dreary narrator named ben coon it was about a frog that had been trained to jump but failed to win a wager because the owner of a rival frog had surreptitiously loaded him with shot the story had been circulated among the camps but mark twain had never heard it until then the tale and the tiresome fashion of its telling amused him he made notes to remember it their stay in angels camp came presently to an end one day when the mining partners were following the specks of gold that led to a pocket somewhere up the hill a chill dreary rain set in jim as usual was washing and clemens was carrying water the color became better and better as they ascended and gillis possessed with the mining passion would have gone on regardless of the rain clemens however protested and declared that each pail of water was his last finally he said in his deliberate drawl jim i wont carry any more water this work is too disagreeable lets go to the house and wait till it clears up gillis had just taken out a pan of earth bring one more pail sam he pleaded i wont do it jim not a drop not if i knew there was a million dollars in that pan they left the pan standing there and went back to angels camp the rain continued and they returned to jackass hill without visiting their claim again meantime the rain had washed away the top of the pan of earth left standing on the slope above angels and exposed a handful of nuggetspure gold two strangers came along and observing it had sat down to wait until the thirtyday claimnotice posted by jim gillis should expire they did not mind the rain not with that gold in sight and the minute the thirty days were up they followed the lead a few pans further and took outsome say ten some say twenty thousand dollars it was a good pocket mark twain missed it by one pail of water still it is just as well perhaps when one remembers the jumping frog matters having quieted down in san francisco he returned and took up his work again artemus ward whom he had met in virginia city wrote him for something to use in his wards new book clemens sent the frog story but he had been dilatory in preparing it and when it reached new york carleton the publisher had wards book about ready for the press it did not seem worth while to carleton to include the frog story and handed it over to henry clapp editor of the saturday press a perishing sheetsaying here clapp heres something you can use the story appeared in the saturday press of november according to the accounts of that time it set all new york in a roar which annoyed rather than gratified its author he had thought very little of it indeed yet had been wondering why some of his more highly regarded work had not found fuller recognition but the jumping frog did not die papers printed it and reprinted it and it was translated into foreign tongues the name of mark twain became known as the author of that sketch and the two were permanently associated from the day of its publication such fame as it brought did not yield heavy financial return its author continued to win a more or less precarious livelihood doing miscellaneous work until march when he was employed by the sacramento union to contribute a series of letters from the sandwich islands they were notable letters widely read and freely copied and the sojourn there was a generally fortunate one it was during his stay in the islands that the survivors of the wrecked vessel the hornet came in after long privation at sea clemens was sick at the time but anson burlingame who was in honolulu on the way to china had him carried in a cot to the hospital where he could interview the surviving sailors and take down their story it proved a great beat for the union and added considerably to its authors prestige on his return to san francisco he contributed an article on the hornet disaster to harpers magazine and looked forward to its publication as a beginning of a real career but alas when it appeared the printer and the proofreader had somehow converted mark twain into mark swain and his dreams perished undecided as to his plans he was one day advised by a friend to deliver a lecture he was already known as an entertaining talker and his adviser judged his possibilities well in roughing it we find the story of that first lecture and its success he followed it with other lectures up and down the coast he had added one more profession to his intellectual stock in trade mark twain now provided with money decided to pay a visit to his people he set out for the east in december via panama arriving in new york in january a few days later he was with his mother then living with his sister in st louis a little later he lectured in keokuk and in hannibal his old home it was about this time that the first great mediterranean steamship excursion began to be exploited no such ocean picnic had ever been planned before and it created a good deal of interest east and west mark twain heard of it and wanted to go he wrote to friends on the alta california of san francisco and the publishers of that paper had sufficient faith to advance the money for his passage on the understanding that he was to contribute frequent letters at twenty dollars apiece it was a liberal offer as rates went in those days and a godsend in the fullest sense of the word to mark twain clemens now hurried to new york in order to be there in good season for the sailing date which was in june in new york he met frank fuller whom he had known as territorial governor of utah an energetic and enthusiastic admirer of the western humorist fuller immediately proposed that clemens give a lecture in order to establish his reputation on the atlantic coast clemens demurred but fuller insisted and engaged cooper union for the occasion not many tickets were sold fuller however always ready for an emergency sent out a flood of complimentaries to the schoolteachers of new york and adjacent territory and the house was crammed it turned out to be a notable event mark twain was at his best that night the audience laughed until as some of them declared when the lecture was over they were too weak to leave their seats his success as a lecturer was assured the quaker city was the steamer selected for the great oriental tour it sailed as advertised june and was absent five months during which mark twain contributed regularly to the altacalifornia and wrote several letters for the new york tribune they were read and copied everywhere they preached a new gospel in travel literature a gospel of seeing with an overflowing honesty a gospel of sincerity in according praise to whatever he considered genuine and ridicule to the things believed to be shams it was a gospel that mark twain continued to preach during his whole career it became in fact his chief literary message to the world a world ready for that message he returned to find himself famous publishers were ready with plans for collecting the letters in book form the american publishing company of hartford proposed a volume elaborately illustrated to be sold by subscription he agreed with them as to terms and went to washington to prepare copy but he could not work quietly there and presently was back in san francisco putting his book together lecturing occasionally always to crowded houses he returned in august with the manuscript of the innocents abroad and that winter while his book was being manufactured lectured throughout the east and middle west making his headquarters in hartford and in elmira new york he had an especial reason for going to elmira on the quaker city he had met a young man by the name of charles langdon and one day in the bay of smyrna had seen a miniature of the boys sister olivia langdon then a girl of about twentytwo he fell in love with that picture and still more deeply in love with the original when he met her in new york on his return the langdon home was in elmira and it was for this reason that as time passed he frequently sojourned there when the proofs of the innocents abroad were sent him he took them along and he and sweet livy langdon read them together what he lacked in those days in literary delicacy she detected and together they pruned it away she became his editor that winter a position which she held until her death the book was published in july and its success was immediate and abundant on his weddingday february clemens received a check from his publishers for more than four thousand dollars royalty accumulated during the three months preceding the sales soon amounted to more than fifty thousand copies and had increased to very nearly one hundred thousand at the end of the first three years it was a book of travel its lowest price three dollars and fifty cents even with our increased reading population no such sale is found for a book of that description today and the innocents abroad holds its place still outsells every other book in its particular field this in dw mark twain now decided to settle down he had bought an interest in the express of buffalo new york and took up his residence in that city in a house presented to the young couple by mr langdon it did not prove a fortunate beginning sickness death and trouble of many kinds put a blight on the happiness of their first married year and gave them a distaste for the home in which they had made such a promising start a baby boy langdon clemens came along in november but he was never a strong child by the end of the following year the clemenses had arranged for a residence in hartford temporary at first later made permanent it was in hartford that little langdon died in clemens meanwhile had sold out his interest in the express severed his connection with the galaxy a magazine for which he was doing a department each month and had written a second book for the american publishing company roughing it published in in august of the same year he made a trip to london to get material for a book on england but was too much sought after too continuously feted to do any work he went alone but in november returned with the purpose of taking mrs clemens and the new baby susy to england the following spring they sailed in april and spent a good portion of the year in england and scotland they returned to america in november and clemens hurried back to london alone to deliver a notable series of lectures under the management of george dolby formerly managing agent for charles dickens for two months mark twain lectured steadily to london audiences the big hanover square rooms always filled he returned to his family in january meantime a home was being built for them in hartford and in the autumn of they took up residence in ita happy residence continued through seventeen years wellnigh perfect years their summers they spent in elmira on quarry farm a beautiful hilltop the home of mrs clemenss sister it was in elmira that much of mark twains literary work was done he had a special study there some distance from the house where he loved to work out his fancies and put them into visible form it was not so easy to work at hartford there was too much going on the clemens home was a sort of general headquarters for literary folk near and far and for distinguished foreign visitors of every sort howells and aldrich used it as their halfway station between boston and new york and every foreign notable who visited america made a pilgrimage to hartford to see mark twain some even went as far as elmira among them rudyard kipling who recorded his visit in a chapter of his american notes kipling declared he had come all the way from india to see mark twain hartford had its own literary group mrs harriet beecher stowe lived near the clemens home also charles dudley warner the clemens and warner families were constantly associated and the gilded age published in resulted from the friendship of warner and mark twain the character of colonel sellers in that book has become immortal and it is a character that only mark twain could create for though drawn from his mothers cousin james lampton it embodies and in no very exaggerated degree characteristics that were his own the tendency to make millions was always imminent temptation was always hard to resist moneymaking schemes are continually being placed before men of means and prominence and mark twain to the day of his death found such schemes fatally attractive it was because of the sellers characteristics in him that he invested in a typesettingmachine which cost him nearly two hundred thousand dollars and helped to wreck his fortunes by and by it was because of this characteristic that he invested in numberless schemes of lesser importance but no less disastrous in the end his one successful commercial venture was his association with charles l webster in the publication of the grant memoirs of which enough copies were sold to pay a royalty of more than four hundred thousand dollars to grants widow the largest royalty ever paid from any single publication it saved the grant family from poverty yet even this triumph was a misfortune to mark twain for it led to scores of less profitable book ventures and eventual disaster meanwhile he had written and published a number of books tom sawyer the prince and the pauper life on the mississippi huckleberry finn and a connecticut yankee in king arthurs court were among the volumes that had entertained the world and inspired it with admiration and love for their author in he had taken his family to europe where they spent their time in traveling over the continent it was during this period that he was joined by his intimate friend the rev joseph h twichell of hartford and the two made a journey the story of which is told in a tramp abroad in the hartford house was again closed this time indefinitely and the family now five in number took up residence in berlin the typesettingmachine and the unfortunate publishing venture were drawing heavily on the family finances at this period and the cost of the hartford establishment was too great to be maintained during the next three years he was distracted by the financial struggle which ended in april with the failure of charles l webster co mark twain now found himself bankrupt and nearly one hundred thousand dollars in debt it had been a losing fight with this bitter ending always in view yet during this period of hard hopeless effort he had written a large portion of the book which of all his works will perhaps survive the longest his tender and beautiful story of joan of arc all his life joan had been his favorite character in the worlds history and during those trying months and years of the early nineties in berlin in florence in paris he was conceiving and putting his picture of that gentle girlwarrior into perfect literary form it was published in harpers magazine anonymously because as he said it would not have been received seriously had it appeared over his own name the authorship was presently recognized exquisitely reverently as the story was told it had in it the touch of quaint and gentle humor which could only have been given to it by mark twain it was only now and then that mark twain lectured during these years he had made a reading tour with george w cable during the winter of but he abominated the platform and often vowed he would never appear before an audience again yet in when he was sixty years old he decided to rebuild his fortunes by making a reading tour around the world it was not required of him to pay his debts in full the creditors were willing to accept fifty per cent of the liabilities and had agreed to a settlement on that basis but this did not satisfy mrs clemens and it did not satisfy him they decided to pay dollar for dollar they sailed for america and in july set out from elmira on the long trail across land and sea mrs clemens and clara clemens joined this pilgrimage susy and jean clemens remaining at elmira with their aunt looking out of the car windows the travelers saw susy waving them an adieu it was a picture they would long remember the reading tour was one of triumph high prices and crowded houses prevailed everywhere the authorreader visited australia new zealand india ceylon south africa arriving in england at last with the money and material which would pay off the heavy burden of debt and make him once more free before the world and in that hour of triumph came the heavy blow susy clemens never very strong had been struck down the first cable announced her illness the mother and clara sailed at once before they were halfway across the ocean a second cable announced that susy was dead the father had to meet and endure the heartbreak alone he could not reach america in time for the burial he remained in england and was joined there by the sorrowing family they passed that winter in london where he worked at the story of his travels following the equator the proofs of which he read the next summer in switzerland the returns from it and from his reading venture wiped away mark twains indebtedness and made him free he could go back to america as he said able to look any man in the face again yet he did not go immediately he could live more economically abroad and economy was still necessary the family spent two winters in vienna and their apartments there constituted a veritable court where the worlds notables gathered another winter in england followed and then in the latter part of they went home that is to america mrs clemens never could bring herself to return to hartford and never saw their home there again mark twains return to america was in the nature of a national event wherever he appeared throngs turned out to bid him welcome mighty banquets were planned in his honor in a house at west tenth street and in a beautiful place at riverdale on the hudson most of the next three years were passed then mrs clemenss health failed and in the autumn of the family went to florence for her benefit there on the th of june she died they brought her back and laid her beside susy at elmira that winter the family took up residence at fifth avenue new york and remained there until the completion of stormfield at redding connecticut in in his later life mark twain was accorded high academic honors already in he had received from yale college the degree of master of arts and the same college made him a doctor of literature in a year later the university of his own state at columbia missouri conferred the same degree and then in came the crowning honor when venerable oxford tendered him the doctors robe i dont know why they should give me a degree like that he said quaintly i never doctored any literature i wouldnt know how he had thought never to cross the ocean again but he declared he would travel to mars and back if necessary to get that oxford degree he appreciated its full meaningrecognition by the worlds foremost institution of learning of the achievements of one who had no learning of the institutionary kind he sailed in june and his sojourn in england was marked by a continuous ovation his hotel was besieged by callers two secretaries were busy nearly twenty hours a day attending to visitors and mail when he appeared on the street his name went echoing in every direction and the multitudes gathered on the day when he rose in his scarlet robe and black mortarboard to receive his degree he must have made a splendid picture in that dress with his crown of silver hair the vast assembly went wild what a triumph indeed for the little missouri printerboy it was the climax of a great career mark twains work was always of a kind to make people talk always important even when it was mere humor yet it was seldom that there was always wisdom under it and purpose and these things gave it dynamic force and enduring life some of his aphorisms so quaint in form as to invite laughter are yet fairly startling in their purport his paraphrase when in doubt tell the truth is of this sort frankness is a jewel only the young can afford it he once said to the writer apropos of a little girls remark his daily speech was full of such things the secret of his great charm was his great humanity and the gentle quaintness and sincerity of his utterance his work did not cease when the pressing need of money came to an end he was full of ideas and likely to begin a new article or story at any time he wrote and published a number of notable sketches articles stories even books during these later years among them that marvelous short story the man that corrupted hadleyburg in that story as in most of his later work he proved to the world that he was much more than a humorist that he was in fact a great teacher moralist philosopherthe greatest perhaps of his age his life at stormfield he had never seen the place until the day of his arrival june was a peaceful and serene old age not that he was really old he never was that his step his manner his point of view were all and always young he was fond of children and frequently had them about him he delighted in games especially in billiards and in building the house at stormfield the billiardroom was first considered he had a genuine passion for the sport without it his afternoon was not complete his mornings he was likely to pass in bed smoking he was always smoking and attending to his correspondence and reading history and the sciences interested him and his bed was strewn with biographies and stories of astronomical and geological research the vastness of distances and periods always impressed him he had no head for figures but he would labor for hours over scientific calculations trying to compass them and to grasp their gigantic import i remember once finding him highly elated over the fact that he had figured out for himself the length in hours and minutes of a light year he showed me the pages covered with figures and was more proud of them than if they had been the pages of an immortal story then we played billiards but even his favorite game could not make him altogether forget his splendid achievement it was on the day before christmas that heavy bereavement once more came into the life of mark twain his daughter jean long subject to epileptic attacks was seized with a convulsion while in her bath and died before assistance reached her he was dazed by the suddenness of the blow his philosophy sustained him he was glad deeply glad for the beautiful girl that had been released i never greatly envied anybody but the dead he said when he had looked at her i always envy the dead the coveted estate of silence times only absolute gift it was the one benefaction he had ever considered worth while yet the years were not unkindly to mark twain they brought him sorrow but they brought him likewise the capacity and opportunity for large enjoyment and at the last they laid upon him a kind of benediction naturally impatient he grew always more gentle more generous more tractable and considerate as the seasons passed his final days may be said to have been spent in the tranquil light of a summer afternoon his own end followed by a few months that of his daughter there were already indications that his heart was seriously affected and soon after jeans death he sought the warm climate of bermuda but his malady made rapid progress and in april he returned to stormfield he died there just a week later april any attempt to designate mark twains place in the worlds literary history would be presumptuous now yet i cannot help thinking that he will maintain his supremacy in the century that produced him i think so because of all the writers of that hundred years his work was the most human his utterances went most surely to the mark in the long analysis of the ages it is the truth that counts and he never approximated never compromised but pronounced those absolute verities to which every human being of whatever rank must instantly respond his understanding of subjective human nature the vast unwritten life within was simply amazing such knowledge he acquired at the fountainhead that is from himself he recognized in himself an extreme example of the human being with all the attributes of power and of weakness and he made his exposition complete the world will long miss mark twain his example and his teaching will be neither ignored nor forgotten genius defies the laws of perspective and looms larger as it recedes the memory of mark twain remains to us a living and intimate presence that today even more than in life constitutes a stately moral bulwark reared against hypocrisy and superstition a mighty national menace to sham mark twains letters i early letters new york and philadelphia we have no record of mark twains earliest letters very likely they were soiled pencil notes written to some school sweetheart to becky thatcher perhaps and tossed across at lucky moments or otherwise with happy or disastrous results one of those smudgy muchfolded school notes of the tom sawyer period would be priceless today and somewhere among forgotten keepsakes it may exist but we shall not be likely to find it no letter of his boyhood no scrap of his earlier writing has come to light except his penciled name sam clemens laboriously inscribed on the inside of a small worn purse that once held his meager almost nonexistent wealth he became a printers apprentice at twelve but as he received no salary the need of a purse could not have been urgent he must have carried it pretty steadily however from its appearance as a kind of symbol of hope maybe a token of that sellersoptimism which dominated his early life and was never entirely subdued no other writing of any kind has been preserved from sam clemenss boyhood none from that period of his youth when he had served his apprenticeship and was a capable printer on his brothers paper a contributor to it when occasion served letters and manuscripts of those days have vanished even his contributions in printed form are unobtainable it is not believed that a single number of orion clemenss paper the hannibal journal exists today it was not until he was seventeen years old that sam clemens wrote a letter any portion of which has survived he was no longer in hannibal orions unprosperous enterprise did not satisfy him his wish to earn money and to see the world had carried him first to st louis where his sister pamela was living then to new york city where a worlds fair in a crystal palace was in progress the letter tells of a visit to this great exhibition it is not complete and the fragment bears no date but it was written during the summer of fragment of a letter from sam l clemens to his sister pamela moffett in st louis summer of from the gallery second floor you have a glorious sight the flags of the different countries represented the lofty dome glittering jewelry gaudy tapestry c with the busy crowd passing to and fro tis a perfect fairy palace beautiful beyond description the machinery department is on the main floor but i cannot enumerate any of it on account of the lateness of the hour past oclock it would take more than a week to examine everything on exhibition and as i was only in a little over two hours tonight i only glanced at about onethird of the articles and having a poor memory i have enumerated scarcely any of even the principal objects the visitors to the palace average daily double the population of hannibal the price of admission being cents they take in about the latting observatory height about feet is near the palace from it you can obtain a grand view of the city and the country round the croton aqueduct to supply the city with water is the greatest wonder yet immense sewers are laid across the bed of the hudson river and pass through the country to westchester county where a whole river is turned from its course and brought to new york from the reservoir in the city to the westchester county reservoir the distance is thirtyeight miles and if necessary they could supply every family in new york with one hundred barrels of water per day i am very sorry to learn that henry has been sick he ought to go to the country and take exercise for he is not half so healthy as ma thinks he is if he had my walking to do he would be another boy entirely four times every day i walk a little over one mile and working hard all day and walking four miles is exercise i am used to it now though and it is no trouble where is it orions going to tell ma my promises are faithfully kept and if i have my health i will take her to ky in the spring i shall save money for this tell jim and all the rest of them to write and give me all the news i am sorry to hear such bad news from will and captain bowen i shall write to will soon the chathamsquare post office and the broadway office too are out of my way and i always go to the general post office so you must write the direction of my letters plain new york city n y without giving the street or anything of the kind or they may go to some of the other offices it has just struck am and i always get up at and am at work at you ask me where i spend my evenings where would you suppose with a free printers library containing more than volumes within a quarter of a mile of me and nobody at home to talk to i shall write to ella soon write soon truly your brother sam p s i have written this by a light so dim that you nor ma could not read by it he was lodging in a mechanics cheap boardinghouse in duane street and we may imagine the bareness of his room the feeble poverty of his lamp tell ma my promises are faithfully kept it was the day when he had left hannibal his mother jane clemens a resolute wiry woman of fortynine had put together his few belongings then holding up a little testament i want you to take hold of the end of this sam she said and make me a promise i want you to repeat after me these words i do solemnly swear that i will not throw a card or drink a drop of liquor while i am gone it was this oath repeated after her that he was keeping faithfully the will bowen mentioned is a former playmate one of tom sawyers outlaw band he had gone on the river to learn piloting with an elder brother the captain what the bad news was is no longer remembered but it could not have been very serious for the bowen boys remained on the river for many years ella was samuel clemenss cousin and onetime sweetheart ella creel jim was jim wolfe an apprentice in orions office and the hero of an adventure which long after mark twain wrote under the title of jim wolfe and the cats there is scarcely a hint of the future mark twain in this early letter it is the letter of a boy of seventeen who is beginning to take himself rather seriously who finding himself for the first time far from home and equal to his own responsibilities is willing to carry the responsibility of others henry his brother three years younger had been left in the printingoffice with orion who after a long profitless fight is planning to remove from hannibal the young traveler is concerned as to the family outlook and will furnish advice if invited he feels the approach of prosperity and will take his mother on a longcoveted trip to her old home in the spring his evenings where should he spend them with a free library of four thousand volumes close by it is distinctly a youthful letter a bit pretentious and wanting in the spontaneity and humor of a later time it invites comment now chiefly because it is the first surviving document in the long human story he was working in the printingoffice of john a gray and green on cliff street and remained there through the summer he must have written more than once during this period but the next existing letter also to sister pamela was written in october it is perhaps a shade more natural in tone than the earlier example and there is a hint of mark twain in the first paragraph to mrs moffett in st louis new york oct saturday my dear sister i have not written to any of the family for some time from the fact firstly that i didnt know where they were and secondly because i have been fooling myself with the idea that i was going to leave new york every day for the last two weeks i have taken a liking to the abominable place and every time i get ready to leave i put it off a day or so from some unaccountable cause it is as hard on my conscience to leave new york as it was easy to leave hannibal i think i shall get off tuesday though edwin forrest has been playing for the last sixteen days at the broadway theatre but i never went to see him till last night the play was the gladiator i did not like parts of it much but other portions were really splendid in the latter part of the last act where the gladiator forrest dies at his brothers feet in all the fierce pleasure of gratified revenge the mans whole soul seems absorbed in the part he is playing and it is really startling to see him i am sorry i did not see him play damon and pythias the former character being his greatest he appears in philadelphia on monday night i have not received a letter from home lately but got a journal the other day in which i see the office has been sold i suppose ma orion and henry are in st louis now if orion has no other project in his head he ought to take the contract for getting out some weekly paper if he cannot get a foremanship now for such a paper as the presbyterian containing about sixty thousand ems type measurement he could get or per week and he and henry could easily do the work nothing to do but set the type and make up the forms if my letters do not come often you need not bother yourself about me for if you have a brother nearly eighteen years of age who is not able to take care of himself a few miles from home such a brother is not worth ones thoughts and if i dont manage to take care of no be assured you will never know it i am not afraid however i shall ask favors from no one and endeavor to be and shall be as independent as a woodsawyers clerk i never saw such a place for military companies as new york go on the street when you will you are sure to meet a company in full uniform with all the usual appendages of drums fifes c i saw a large company of soldiers of the other day with a veteran scattered here and there in the ranks and as i passed through one of the parks lately i came upon a company of boys on parade their uniforms were neat and their muskets about half the common size some of them were not more than seven or eight years of age but had evidently been welldrilled passage to albany miles on the finest steamers that ply the hudson is now cents cheap enough but is generally cheaper than that in the summer i want you to write as soon as i tell you where to direct your letter i would let you know now if i knew myself i may perhaps be here a week longer but i cannot tell when you write tell me the whereabouts of the family my love to mr moffett and ella tell ella i intend to write to her soon whether she wants me to nor not truly your brother saml l clemens he was in philadelphia when he wrote the nest letter that has come down to us and apparently satisfied with the change it is a letter to orion clemens who had disposed of his paper but evidently was still in hannibal an extended description of a trip to fairmount park is omitted because of its length its chief interest being the tendency it shows to descriptive writing the field in which he would make his first great fame there is however no hint of humor and only a mild suggestion of the author of the innocents abroad in this early attempt the letter as here given is otherwise complete the omissions being indicated to orion clemens in hannibal philadelphia pa oct my dear brother it was at least two weeks before i left new york that i received my last letter from home and since then not a word have i heard from any of you and now since i think of it it wasnt a letter either but the last number of the daily journal saying that that paper was sold and i very naturally supposed from that that the family had disbanded and taken up winter quarters in st louis therefore i have been writing to pamela till ive tired of it and have received no answer i have been writing for the last two or three weeks to send ma some money but devil take me if i knew where she was and so the money has slipped out of my pocket somehow or other but i have a dollar left and a good deal owing to me which will be paid next monday i shall enclose the dollar in this letter and you can hand it to her i know its a small amount but then it will buy her a handkerchief and at the same time serve as a specimen of the kind of stuff we are paid with in philadelphia for you see its against the law in pennsylvania to keep or pass a bill of less denomination than i have only seen two or three bank bills since i have been in the state on monday the hands are paid off in sparkling gold fresh from the mint so your dreams are not troubled with the fear of having doubtful money in your pocket i am subbing at the inquirer office one man has engaged me to work for him every sunday till the first of next april when i shall return home to take ma to ky and another has engaged my services for the th of next month and if i want it i can get subbing every night of the week i go to work at oclock in the evening and work till oclock the next morning i can go to the theatre and stay till oclock and then go to the office and get work from that till the next morning when i go to bed and sleep till oclock then get up and loaf the rest of the day the type is mostly agate and minion with some bourgeois and when one gets a good agate take agate minion etc sizes of type take a piece of work type measurement is by ems meaning the width of the letter m he is sure to make money i made last sunday and was laughed at by all the hands the poorest of whom sets on sunday and if i dont set at least next sunday ill give them leave to laugh as much as they want to out of the compositors in this office at least set on sunday unlike new york i like this philadelphia amazingly and the people in it there is only one thing that gets my dander up and that is the hands are always encouraging me telling me its no use to get discouraged no use to be downhearted for there is more work here than you can do downhearted the devil i have not had a particle of such a feeling since i left hannibal more than four months ago i fancy theyll have to wait some time till they see me downhearted or afraid of starving while i have strength to work and am in a city of inhabitants when i was in hannibal before i had scarcely stepped out of the town limits nothing could have convinced me that i would starve as soon as i got a little way from home the grave of franklin is in christ churchyard corner of fifth and arch streets they keep the gates locked and one can only see the flat slab that lies over his remains and that of his wife but you cannot see the inscription distinctly enough to read it the inscription i believe reads thus benjamin and franklin deborah i counted cannons pounders planted in the edge of the sidewalk in water st the other day they are driven into the ground about a foot with the mouth end upwards a ball is driven fast into the mouth of each to exclude the water they look like so many posts they were put there during the war i have also seen them planted in this manner round the old churches in n y there is one fine custom observed in phila a gentleman is always expected to hand up a ladys money for her yesterday i sat in the front end of the bus directly under the drivers box a lady sat opposite me she handed me her money which was right but lord a st louis lady would think herself ruined if she should be so familiar with a stranger in st louis a man will sit in the front end of the stage and see a lady stagger from the far end to pay her fare the phila bus drivers cannot cheat in the front of the stage is a thing like an office clock with figures from to marked on its face when the stage starts the hand of the clock is turned toward the when you get in and pay your fare the driver strikes a bell and the hand moves to the figure that is one fare and paid for and there is your receipt as good as if you had it in your pocket when a passenger pays his fare and the driver does not strike the bell immediately he is greeted strike that bell will you i must close now i intend visiting the navy yard mint etc before i write again you must write often you see i have nothing to write interesting to you while you can write nothing that will not interest me dont say my letters are not long enough tell jim wolfe to write tell all the boys where i am and to write jim robinson particularly i wrote to him from n y tell me all that is going on in h l truly your brother sam those were primitive times imagine a passenger in these easygoing days calling to a driver or conductor to strike that bell h l is his abbreviation for hannibal he had first used it in a title of a poem which a few years before during one of orions absences he had published in the paper to mary in hannibal was too long to set as a display head in single column the poem had no great merit but under the abbreviated title it could hardly fail to invite notice it was one of several things he did to liven up the circulation during a brief period of his authority the doubtful money he mentions was the paper issued by private banks wild cat as it was called he had been paid with it in new york and found it usually at a discount sometimes even worthless wages and money were both better in philadelphia but the fund for his mothers trip to kentucky apparently did not grow very rapidly the next letter written a month later is also to orion clemens who had now moved to muscatine iowa and established there a new paper with an old title the journal to orion clemens in muscatine iowa philadelphia nov th my dear brother i received your letter today i think ma ought to spend the winter in st louis i dont believe in that climate its too cold for her the printers annual ball and supper came off the other night the proceeds amounted to about the printers as well as other people are endeavoring to raise money to erect a monument to franklin but there are so many abominable foreigners here and among printers too who hate everything american that i am very certain as much money for such a purpose could be raised in st louis as in philadelphia i was in franklins old office this morning the north american formerly philadelphia gazette and there was at least one foreigner for every american at work there how many subscribers has the journal got what does the jobwork pay and what does the whole concern pay i will try to write for the paper occasionally but i fear my letters will be very uninteresting for this incessant nightwork dulls ones ideas amazingly from some cause i cannot set type nearly so fast as when i was at home sunday is a long day and while others set and yesterday i only set however i will shake this laziness off soon i reckon how do you like freesoil i would like amazingly to see a good oldfashioned negro my love to all truly your brother sam we may believe that it never occurred to the young printer looking up landmarks of ben franklin that time would show points of resemblance between the great franklins career and his own yet these seem now rather striking like franklin he had been taken out of school very young and put at the printers trade like franklin he had worked in his brothers office and had written for the paper like him too he had left quietly for new york and philadelphia to work at the trade of printing and in time samuel clemens like benjamin franklin would become a worldfigure manysided human and of incredible popularity the boy sam clemens may have had such dreams but we find no trace of them there is but one more letter of this early period young clemens spent some time in washington but if he wrote from there his letters have disappeared the last letter is from philadelphia and seems to reflect homesickness the novelty of absence and travel was wearing thin to mrs moffett in st louis philadelphia dec my dear sister i have already written two letters within the last two hours and you will excuse me if this is not lengthy if i had the money i would come to st louis now while the river is open but within the last two or three weeks i have spent about thirty dollars for clothing so i suppose i shall remain where i am i only want to return to avoid nightwork which is injuring my eyes i have received one or two letters from home but they are not written as they should be and i know no more about what is going on there than the man in the moon one only has to leave home to learn how to write an interesting letter to an absent friend when he gets back i suppose you board at mrs hunters yet and that i think is somewhere in olive street above fifth philadelphia is one of the healthiest places in the union i wanted to spend this winter in a warm climate but it is too late now i dont like our present prospect for cold weather at all truly your brother sam but he did not return to the west for another half year the letters he wrote during that period have not survived it was late in the summer of when he finally started for st louis he sat up for three days and nights in a smokingcar to make the journey and arrived exhausted the river packet was leaving in a few hours for muscatine iowa where his mother and his two brothers were now located he paid his sister a brief visit and caught the boat wornout he dropped into his berth and slept the thirtysix hours of the journey it was early whenhe arrived too early to arouse the family in the office of the little hotel where he waited for daylight he found a small book it contained portraits of the english rulers with the brief facts of their reigns young clemens entertained himself by learning this information by heart he had a fine memory for such things and in an hour or two had the printed data perfectly and permanently committed this incidentally acquired knowledge proved of immense value to him it was his groundwork for all english history ii letters keokuk and the river end of piloting there comes a period now of nearly four years when samuel clemens was either a poor correspondent or his letters have not been preserved only two from this time have survived happily of intimate biographical importance young clemens had not remained in muscatine his brother had no inducements to offer and he presently returned to st louis where he worked as a compositor on the evening news until the following spring rooming with a young man named burrough a journeyman chairmaker with a taste for the english classics orion clemens meantime on a trip to keokuk had casually married there and a little later removed his office to that city he did not move the paper perhaps it did not seem worth while and in keokuk he confined himself to commercial printing the ben franklin book and job office started with fair prospects henry clemens and a boy named dick hingham were the assistants and somewhat later when brother sam came up from st louis on a visit an offer of five dollars a week and board induced him to remain later when it became increasingly difficult to pay the five dollars orion took his brother into partnership which perhaps relieved the financial stress though the office methods would seem to have left something to be desired it is about at this point that the first of the two letters mentioned was written the writer addressed it to his mother and sister jane clemens having by this time taken up her home with her daughter mrs moffett to mrs clemens and mrs moffett in st louis keokuk iowa june th my dear mother sister i have nothing to write everything is going on well the directory is coming on finely i have to work on it occasionally which i dont like a particle i dont like to work at too many things at once they take henry and dick away from me too before we commenced the directory i could tell before breakfast just how much work could be done during the day and manage accordingly but now they throw all my plans into disorder by taking my hands away from their work i have nothing to do with the book if i did i would have the two book hands do more work than they do or else i would drop it it is not a mere supposition that they do not work fast enough i know it for yesterday the two book hands were at work all day henry and dick all the afternoon on the advertisements and they set up five pages and a halfand i set up two pages and a quarter of the same matter after supper night before last and i dont work fast on such things they are either excessively slow motioned or very lazy i am not getting along well with the job work i cant work blindly without system i gave dick a job yesterday which i calculated he would set in two hours and i could work off in three and therefore just finish it by supper time but he was transferred to the directory and the job promised this morning remains untouched through all the great pressure of job work lately i never before failed in a promise of the kind your son sam excuse brevity this is my rd letter tonight samuel clemens was never celebrated for his patience we may imagine that the disorder of the office tried his nerves he seems on the whole however to have been rather happy in keokuk there were plenty of young people there and he was a favorite among them but he had grown dissatisfied and when one day some weeks later there fell into his hands an account of the riches of the newly explored regions of the upper amazon he promptly decided to find his fortune at the headwaters of the great southamerican river the second letter reports this momentous decision it was written to henry clemens who was temporarily absentprobably in hannibal to henry clemens keokuk august th my dear brother ward and i held a long consultation sunday morning and the result was that we two have determined to start to brazil if possible in six weeks from now in order to look carefully into matters there and report to dr martin in time for him to follow on the first of march we propose going via new york now between you and i and the fence you must say nothing about this to orion for he thinks that ward is to go clear through alone and that i am to stop at new york or new orleans until he reports but that dont suit me my confidence in human nature does not extend quite that far i wont depend upon wards judgment or anybodys else i want to see with my own eyes and form my own opinion but you know what orion is when he gets a notion into his head and more especially if it is an erroneous one the devil cant get it out again so i know better than to combat his arguments long but apparently yielded inwardly determined to go clear through ma knows my determination but even she counsels me to keep it from orion she says i can treat him as i did her when i started to st louis and went to new york i can start to new york and go to south america although orion talks grandly about furnishing me with fifty or a hundred dollars in six weeks i could not depend upon him for ten dollars so i have feelers out in several directions and have already asked for a hundred dollars from one source keep it to yourself i will lay on my oars for awhile and see how the wind sets when i may probably try to get more mrs creel is a great friend of mine and has some influence with ma and orion though i reckon they would not acknowledge it i am going up there tomorrow to press her into my service i shall take care that ma and orion are plentifully supplied with south american books they have herndons report now ward and the dr and myself will hold a grand consultation tonight at the office we have agreed that no more shall be admitted into our company i believe the guards went down to quincy today to escort our first locomotive home write soon your brother sam readers familiar with the life of mark twain know that none of the wouldbe adventurers found their way to the amazon his two associates gave up the plan probably for lack of means young clemens himself found a fiftydollar bill one bleak november day blowing along the streets of keokuk and after duly advertising his find without result set out for the amazon by way of cincinnati and new orleans i advertised the find and left for the amazon the same day he once declared a statement which we may take with a literary discount he remained in cincinnati that winter working at his trade no letters have been preserved from that time except two that were sent to a keokuk weekly the saturday post and as these were written for publication and are rather a poor attempt at burlesque humor their chief feature being a pretended illiteracy they would seem to bear no relation to this collection he roomed that winter with a rugged selfeducated scotchman a mechanic but a man of books and philosophies who left an impress on mark twains mental life in april he took up once more the journey toward south america but presently forgot the amazon altogether in the new career that opened to him all through his boyhood and youth samuel clemens had wanted to be a pilot now came the longdeferred opportunity on the little cincinnati steamer the paul jones there was a pilot named horace bixby young clemens idling in the pilothouse was one morning seized with the old ambition and laid siege to bixby to teach him the river the terms finally agreed upon specified a fee to bixby of five hundred dollars one hundred down the balance when the pupil had completed the course and was earning money but all this has been told in full elsewhere and is only summarized here because the letters fail to complete the story bixby soon made some trips up the missouri river and in his absence turned his apprentice or cub over to other pilots such being the river custom young clemens in love with the life and a favorite with his superiors had a happy time until he came under a pilot named brown brown was illiterate and tyrannical and from the beginning of their association pilot and apprentice disliked each other cordially it is at this point that the letters begin once more the first having been written when young clemens now twentytwo years old had been on the river nearly a year life with brown of course was not all sorrow and in this letter we find some of the fierce joy of adventure which in those days samuel clemens loved to onion clemens and wife in keokuk iowa saint louis march th dear brother and sister i must take advantage of the opportunity now presented to write you but i shall necessarily be dull as i feel uncommonly stupid we have had a hard trip this time left saint louis three weeks ago on the pennsylvania the weather was very cold and the ice running densely we got miles below town landed the boat and then one pilot second mate and four deck hands took the sounding boat and shoved out in the ice to hunt the channel they failed to find it and the ice drifted them ashore the pilot left the men with the boat and walked back to us a mile and a half then the other pilot and myself with a larger crew of men started out and met with the same fate we drifted ashore just below the other boat then the fun commenced we made fast a line fathoms long to the bow of the yawl and put the men both crews to it like horses on the shore brown the pilot stood in the bow with an oar to keep her head out and i took the tiller we would start the men and all would go well till the yawl would bring up on a heavy cake of ice and then the men would drop like so many tenpins while brown assumed the horizontal in the bottom of the boat after an hours hard work we got back with ice half an inch thick on the oars sent back and warped up the other yawl and then george the first mentioned pilot and myself took a double crew of fresh men and tried it again this time we found the channel in less than half an hour and landed on an island till the pennsylvania came along and took us off the next day was colder still i was out in the yawl twice and then we got through but the infernal steamboat came near running over us we went ten miles further landed and george and i cleared out again found the channel first trial but got caught in the gorge and drifted helplessly down the river the ocean spray came along and started into the ice after us but although she didnt succeed in her kind intention of taking us aboard her waves washed us out and that was all we wanted we landed on an island built a big fire and waited for the boat she started and ran aground it commenced raining and sleeting and a very interesting time we had on that barren sandbar for the next four hours when the boat got off and took us aboard the next day was terribly cold we sounded hat island warped up around a bar and sounded again but in order to understand our situation you will have to read dr kane it would have been impossible to get back to the boat but the maria denning was aground at the head of the island they hailed us we ran alongside and they hoisted us in and thawed us out we had then been out in the yawl from oclock in the morning till half past without being near a fire there was a thick coating of ice over men yawl ropes and everything else and we looked like rockcandy statuary we got to saint louis this morning after an absence of weeks that boat generally makes the trip in henry was doing little or nothing here and i sent him to our clerk to work his way for a trip by measuring wood piles counting coal boxes and other clerkly duties which he performed satisfactorily he may go down with us again for i expect he likes our bill of fare better than that of his boarding house i got your letter at memphis as i went down that is the best place to write me at the post office here is always out of my route somehow or other remember the direction slc steamer pennsylvania care duval algeo wharfboat memphis i cannot correspond with a paper because when one is learning the river he is not allowed to do or think about anything else i am glad to see you in such high spirits about the land and i hope you will remain so if you never get richer i seldom venture to think about our landed wealth for hope deferred maketh the heart sick i did intend to answer your letter but i am too lazy and too sleepy now we have had a rough time during the last hours working through the ice between cairo and saint louis and i have had but little rest i got here too late to see the funeral of the victims by the burning of the pacific hotel in th street ma says there were hearses with the fire companies their engines in mourning firemen in uniform the various benevolent societies in uniform and mourning and a multitude of citizens and strangers forming altogether a procession of persons one steam fire engine was drawn by four white horses with crape festoons on their heads well i am just about asleep your brother sam among other things we gather from this letter that orion clemens had faith in his brother as a newspaper correspondent though the two contributions from cincinnati already mentioned were not promising furthermore we get an intimation of orions unfailing confidence in the future of the land that is to say the great tract of land in eastern tennessee which in an earlier day his father had bought as a heritage for his children it is the same tennessee land that had millions in it for colonel sellers the land that would become as orion clemens long afterward phrased it the worry of three generations the doctor kane of this letter is of course dr elisha kent kane the american arctic explorer any book of exploration always appealed to mark twain and in those days kane was a favorite the paragraph concerning henry and his employment on the pennsylvania begins the story of a tragedy the story has been fully told elsewhere mark twain a biography by same author and need only be sketched briefly here henry a gentle faithful boy shared with his brother the enmity of the pilot brown some two months following the date of the foregoing letter on a down trip of the pennsylvania an unprovoked attack made by brown upon the boy brought his brother sam to the rescue brown received a good pummeling at the hands of the future humorist who though upheld by the captain decided to quit the pennsylvania at new orleans and to come up the river by another boat the brown episode has no special bearing on the main tragedy though now in retrospect it seems closely related to it samuel clemens coming up the river on the a t lacey two days behind the pennsylvania heard a voice shout as they approached the greenville mississippi landing the pennsylvania is blown up just below memphis at ship island one hundred and fifty lives lost it was a true report at six oclock of a warm midjune morning while loading wood sixty miles below memphis the pennsylvanias boilers had exploded with fearful results henry clemens was among the injured he was still alive when his brother reached memphis on the lacey but died a few days later samuel clemens had idolized the boy and regarded himself responsible for his death the letter that follows shows that he was overwrought by the scenes about him and the strain of watching yet the anguish of it is none the less real to mrs onion clemens memphis tenn friday june th dear sister mollie long before this reaches you my poor henry my darling my pride my glory my all will have finished his blameless career and the light of my life will have gone out in utter darkness o god this is hard to bear hardened hopeless aye lost lost lost and ruined sinner as i am i even i have humbled myself to the ground and prayed as never man prayed before that the great god might let this cup pass from me that he would strike me to the earth but spare my brother that he would pour out the fulness of his just wrath upon my wicked head but have mercy mercy mercy upon that unoffending boy the horrors of three days have swept over me they have blasted my youth and left me an old man before my time mollie there are gray hairs in my head tonight for fortyeight hours i labored at the bedside of my poor burned and bruised but uncomplaining brother and then the star of my hope went out and left me in the gloom of despair men take me by the hand and congratulate me and call me lucky because i was not on the pennsylvania when she blew up may god forgive them for they know not what they say mollie you do not understand why i was not on that boat i will tell you i left saint louis on her but on the way down mr brown the pilot that was killed by the explosion poor fellow quarreled with henry without cause while i was steering henry started out of the pilothouse brown jumped up and collared him turned him half way around and struck him in the face and him nearly six feet high struck my little brother i was wild from that moment i left the boat to steer herself and avenged the insult and the captain said i was right that he would discharge brown in n orleans if he could get another pilot and would do it in st louis anyhow of course both of us could not return to st louis on the same boat no pilot could be found and the captain sent me to the a t lacey with orders to her captain to bring me to saint louis had another pilot been found poor brown would have been the lucky man i was on the pennsylvania five minutes before she left n orleans and i must tell you the truth mollie three hundred human beings perished by that fearful disaster henry was asleep was blown up then fell back on the hot boilers and i suppose that rubbish fell on him for he is injured internally he got into the water and swam to shore and got into the flatboat with the other survivors henry had returned once to the pennsylvania to render assistance to the passengers later he had somehow made his way to the flatboat he had nothing on but his wet shirt and he lay there burning up with a southern sun and freezing in the wind till the kate frisbee carne along his wounds were not dressed till he got to memphis hours after the explosion he was senseless and motionless for hours after that but may god bless memphis the noblest city on the face of the earth she has done her duty by these poor afflicted creatures especially henry for he has had five aye ten fifteen twenty times the care and attention that any one else has had dr peyton the best physician in memphis he is exactly like the portraits of webster sat by him for hours there are scalded men in that room and you would know dr peyton better than i can describe him if you could follow him around and hear each man murmur as he passes may the god of heaven bless you doctor the ladies have done well too our second mate a handsome noble hearted young fellow will die yesterday a beautiful girl of stooped timidly down by his side and handed him a pretty bouquet the poor suffering boys eyes kindled his lips quivered out a gentle god bless you miss and he burst into tears he made them write her name on a card for him that he might not forget it pray for me mollie and pray for my poor sinless brother your unfortunate brother saml l clemens p s i got here two days after henry it is said that mark twain never really recovered from the tragedy of his brothers death that it was responsible for the serious pathetic look that the face of the worlds greatest laughmaker always wore in repose he went back to the river and in september of the same year after an apprenticeship of less than eighteen months received his license as a st louis and new orleans pilot and was accepted by his old chief bixby as full partner on an important boat in life on the mississippi mark twain makes the period of his study from two to two and a half years but this is merely an attempt to magnify his dullness he was in fact an apt pupil and a pilot of very high class clemens was now suddenly lifted to a position of importance the mississippi river pilot of those days was a person of distinction earning a salary then regarded as princely certainly two hundred and fifty dollars a month was large for a boy of twentythree at once of course he became the head of the clemens family his brother orion was ten years older but he had not the gift of success by common consent the younger brother assumed permanently the position of family counselor and financier we expect him to feel the importance of his new position and he is too human to disappoint us incidentally we notice an improvement in his english he no longer writes between you and i fragment of a letter to orion clemens written at st louis in i am not talking nonsense now i am in earnest i want you to keep your troubles and your plans out of the reach of meddlers until the latter are consummated so that in case you fail no one will know it but yourself above all things between you and me never tell ma any of your troubles she never slept a wink the night your last letter came and she looks distressed yet write only cheerful news to her you know that she will not be satisfied so long as she thinks anything is going on that she is ignorant of and she makes a little fuss about it when her suspicions are awakened but that makes no difference i know that it is better that she be kept in the dark concerning all things of an unpleasant nature she upbraids me occasionally for giving her only the bright side of my affairs but unfortunately for her she has to put up with it for i know that troubles that i curse awhile and forget would disturb her slumbers for some time parenthesis no possibly because she is deprived of the soothing consolation of swearing tell her the good news and me the bad putting all things together i begin to think i am rather lucky than otherwise a notion which i was slow to take up the other night i was about to round to for a storm but concluded that i could find a smoother bank somewhere i landed miles below the storm came passed away and did not injure us coming up day before yesterday i looked at the spot i first chose and half the trees on the bank were torn to shreds we couldnt have lived minutes in such a tornado and i am also lucky in having a berth while all the young pilots are idle this is the luckiest circumstance that ever befell me not on account of the wages for that is a secondary consideration but from the fact that the city of memphis is the largest boat in the trade and the hardest to pilot and consequently i can get a reputation on her which is a thing i never could accomplish on a transient boat i can bank in the neighborhood of a month on her and that will satisfy me for the present principally because the other youngsters are sucking their fingers bless me what a pleasure there is in revenge and what vast respect prosperity commands why six months ago i could enter the rooms and receive only a customary fraternal greeting but now they say why how are you old fellow when did you get in and the young pilots who used to tell me patronizingly that i could never learn the river cannot keep from showing a little of their chagrin at seeing me so far ahead of them permit me to blow my horn for i derive a living pleasure from these things and i must confess that when i go to pay my dues i rather like to let the d d rascals get a glimpse of a hundred dollar bill peeping out from amongst notes of smaller dimensions whose face i do not exhibit you will despise this egotism but i tell you there is a stern joy in it pilots did not remain long on one boat as a rule just why it is not so easy to understand perhaps they liked the experience of change perhaps both captain and pilot liked the pursuit of the ideal in the lighthearted letter that follows written to a friend of the family formerly of hannibal we get something of the uncertainty of the pilots engagements to mrs elizabeth w smith in jackson cape girardeau county mo st louis oct probably dear aunt betsey ma has not written you because she did not know when i would get started down the river again you see aunt betsey i made but one trip on the packet after you left and then concluded to remain at home awhile i have just discovered this morning that i am to go to new orleans on the col chambers fine lightdraught swiftrunning passenger steamer all modern accommodations and improvements through with dispatch for freight or passage apply on board or to but i have forgotten the agents name however it makes no difference and as i was saying or had intended to say aunt betsey probably if you are ready to come up you had better take the ben lewis the best boat in the packet line she will be at cape girardeau at noon on saturday day after tomorrow and will reach here at breakfast time sunday if mr hamilton is chief clerk very well i am slightly acquainted with him and if messrs carter gray and dean somebody i have forgotten his other name are in the pilothouse very well againi am acquainted with them just tell mr gray aunt betsey that i wish him to place himself at your command all the family are well except myself i am in a bad way again disease love in its most malignant form hopes are entertained of my recovery however at the dinner table excellent symptom i am still as terrible as an army with banners aunt betsey the wickedness of this world but i havent time to moralize this morning goodbye sam clemens as we do not hear of this attack again the recovery was probably prompt his letters are not frequent enough for us to keep track of his boats but we know that he was associated with bixby from time to time and now and again with one of the bowen boys his old hannibal schoolmates he was reveling in the river life the ease and distinction and romance of it no other life would ever suit him as well he was at the age to enjoy just what it brought him at the airy golden overweening age of youth to orion clemens in keokuk iowa st louis mch my dear bro your last has just come to hand it reminds me strongly of tom hoods letters to his family which i have been reading lately but yours only remind me of his for although there is a striking likeness your humour is much finer than his and far better expressed tom hoods wit in his letters has a savor of labor about it which is very disagreeable your letter is good that portion of it wherein the old sow figures is the very best thing i have seen lately its quiet style resembles goldsmiths citizen of the world and don quixote which are my beau ideals of fine writing you have paid the preacher well that is good also what a man wants with religion in these breadless times surpasses my comprehension pamela and i have just returned from a visit to the most wonderfully beautiful painting which this city has ever seen churchs heart of the andes which represents a lovely valley with its rich vegetation in all the bloom and glory of a tropical summer dotted with birds and flowers of all colors and shades of color and sunny slopes and shady corners and twilight groves and cool cascades all grandly set off with a majestic mountain in the background with its gleaming summit clothed in everlasting ice and snow i have seen it several times but it is always a new picture totally new you seem to see nothing the second time which you saw the first we took the opera glass and examined its beauties minutely for the naked eye cannot discern the little wayside flowers and soft shadows and patches of sunshine and halfhidden bunches of grass and jets of water which form some of its most enchanting features there is no slurring of perspective effect about it the most distant the minutest object in it has a marked and distinct personality so that you may count the very leaves on the trees when you first see the tame ordinarylooking picture your first impulse is to turn your back upon it and say humbug but your third visit will find your brain gasping and straining with futile efforts to take all the wonder in and appreciate it in its fulness and understand how such a miracle could have been conceived and executed by human brain and human hands you will never get tired of looking at the picture but your reflections your efforts to grasp an intelligible something you hardly know what will grow so painful that you will have to go away from the thing in order to obtain relief you may find relief but you cannot banish the picture it remains with you still it is in my mind now and the smallest feature could not be removed without my detecting it so much for the heart of the andes ma was delighted with her trip but she was disgusted with the girls for allowing me to embrace and kiss them and she was horrified at the schottische as performed by miss castle and myself she was perfectly willing for me to dance until oclock at the imminent peril of my going to sleep on the after watch but then she would top off with a very inconsistent sermon on dancing in general ending with a terrific broadside aimed at that heresy of heresies the schottische i took ma and the girls in a carriage round that portion of new orleans where the finest gardens and residences are to be seen and although it was a blazing hot dusty day they seemed hugely delighted to use an expression which is commonly ignored in polite society they were hellbent on stealing some of the lusciouslooking oranges from branches which overhung the fences but i restrained them they were not aware before that shrubbery could be made to take any queer shape which a skilful gardener might choose to twist it into so they found not only beauty but novelty in their visit we went out to lake pontchartrain in the cars your brother sam clemens we have not before heard of miss castle who appears to have been one of the girls who accompanied jane clemens on the trip which her son gave her to new orleans but we may guess that the other was his cousin and good comrade ella creel one wishes that he might have left us a more extended account of that longago river journey a fuller glimpse of a golden age that has vanished as completely as the days of washington we may smile at the natural youthful desire to air his reading and his art appreciation and we may find his opinions not without interest we may even commend them in part perhaps we no longer count the leaves on churchs trees but goldsmith and cervantes still deserve the place assigned them he does not tell us what boat he was on at this time but later in the year he was with bixby again on the alonzo child we get a bit of the pilot in port in his next to orion clemens in keokuk iowa alonzo child n orleans sep th dear brother i just received yours and mollies letter yesterday they had been here two weeks forwarded from st louis we got here yesterday will leave at noon today of course i have had no time in hours to do anything therefore ill answer after we are under way again yesterday i had many things to do but bixby and i got with the pilots of two other boats and went off dissipating on a ten dollar dinner at a french restaurant breathe it not unto ma where we ate sheephead fish with mushrooms shrimps and oysters birds coffee with brandy burnt in it c cate drank and smoked from pm until oclock and then then the day was too far gone to do any thing please find enclosed and acknowledge receipt of in haste sam l clemens it should be said perhaps that when he became pilot jane clemens had released her son from his pledge in the matter of cards and liquor this license did not upset him however he cared very little for either of these dissipations his one great indulgence was tobacco a matter upon which he was presently to receive some grave counsel he reports it in his next letter a sufficiently interesting document the clairvoyant of this visit was madame caprell famous in her day clemens had been urged to consult her and one idle afternoon concluded to make the experiment the letter reporting the matter to his brother is fragmentary and is the last remaining to us of the piloting period fragment of a letter to orion clemens in keokuk iowa new orleans february shes a very pleasant little lady rather pretty about say feet and one quarter would weigh has black eyes and hair is polite and intelligent used good language and talks much faster than i do she invited me into the little back parlor closed the door and we were alone we sat down facing each other then she asked my age then she put her hands before her eyes a moment and commenced talking as if she had a good deal to say and not much time to say it in something after this style madame yours is a watery planet you gain your livelihood on the water but you should have been a lawyer there is where your talents lie you might have distinguished yourself as an orator or as an editor you have written a great deal you write well but you are rather out of practice no matter you will be in practice some day you have a superb constitution and as excellent health as any man in the world you have great powers of endurance in your profession your strength holds out against the longest sieges without flagging still the upper part of your lungs the top of them is slightly affected you must take care of yourself you do not drink but you use entirely too much tobacco and you must stop it mind not moderate but stop the use of it totally then i can almost promise you when you will surely die otherwise look out for and be careful for you are not of a longlived race that is on your fathers side you are the only healthy member of your family and the only one in it who has anything like the certainty of attaining to a great age so stop using tobacco and be careful of yourself in some respects you take after your father but you are much more like your mother who belongs to the longlived energetic side of the house you never brought all your energies to bear upon any subject but what you accomplished it for instance you are selfmade selfeducated s l c which proves nothing madame dont interrupt when you sought your present occupation you found a thousand obstacles in the way obstacles unknown not even suspected by any save you and me since you keep such matters to yourself but you fought your way and hid the long struggle under a mask of cheerfulness which saved your friends anxiety on your account to do all this requires all the qualities i have named s l c you flatter well madame madame dont interrupt up to within a short time you had always lived from hand to mouthnow you are in easy circumstances for which you need give credit to no one but yourself the turning point in your life occurred in s l c which was madame a death perhaps and this threw you upon the world and made you what you are it was always intended that you should make yourself therefore it was well that this calamity occurred as early as it did you will never die of water although your career upon it in the future seems well sprinkled with misfortune you will continue upon the water for some time yet you will not retire finally until ten years from now what is your brothers age and a lawyer and in pursuit of an office well he stands a better chance than the other two and he may get it he is too visionary is always flying off on a new hobby this will never do tell him i said so he is a good lawyer a very good lawyer and a fine speaker is very popular and much respected and makes many friends but although he retains their friendship he loses their confidence by displaying his instability of character the land he has now will be very valuable after a while s l c say a years hence or thereabouts madame madame no less timebut never mind the land that is a secondary consideration let him drop that for the present and devote himself to his business and politics with all his might for he must hold offices under the government after a while you will possess a good deal of property retire at the end of ten years after which your pursuits will be literary try the law you will certainly succeed i am done now if you have any questions to ask ask them freely and if it be in my power i will answer without reserve without reserve i asked a few questions of minor importance paid her and left under the decided impression that going to the fortune tellers was just as good as going to the opera and the cost scarcely a trifle more ergo i will disguise myself and go again one of these days when other amusements fail now isnt she the devil that is to say isnt she a right smart little woman when you want money let ma know and she will send it she and pamela are always fussing about change so i sent them a hundred and twenty quarters yesterday fiddlers change enough to last till i get back i reckon sam it is not so difficult to credit madame caprell with clairvoyant powers when one has read the letters of samuel clemens up to this point if we may judge by those that have survived her prophecy of literary distinction for him was hardly warranted by anything she could have known of his past performance these letters of his youth have a value today only because they were written by the man who later was to become mark twain the squibs and skits which he sometimes contributed to the new orleans papers were bright perhaps and pleasing to his pilot associates but they were without literary value he was twentyfive years old more than one author has achieved reputation at that age mark twain was of slower growth at that age he had not even developed a definite literary ambition whatever the basis of madame caprells prophecy we must admit that she was a good guesser on several matters a right smart little woman as clemens himself phrased it she overlooked one item however the proximity of the civil war perhaps it was too close at hand for second sight a little more than two months after the caprell letter was written fort sumter was fired upon mask twain had made his last trip as a pilot up the river to st louis the nation was plunged into a four years conflict there are no letters of this immediate period young clemens went to hannibal and enlisting in a private company composed mainly of old schoolmates went soldiering for two rainy inglorious weeks by the end of which he had had enough of war and furthermore had discovered that he was more of a union abolitionist than a slaveholding secessionist as he had at first supposed convictions were likely to be rather infirm during those early days of the war and subject to change without notice especially was this so in a border state iii letters on the frontier mining adventures journalistic beginnings clemens went from the battlefront to keokuk where orion was preparing to accept the appointment prophesied by madame caprell orion was a stanch unionist and a member of lincolns cabinet had offered him the secretaryship of the new territory of nevada orion had accepted and only needed funds to carry him to his destination his pilot brother had the funds and upon being appointed private secretary agreed to pay both passages on the overland stage which would bear them across the great plains from st jo to carson city mark twain in roughing it has described that glorious journey and the frontier life that followed it his letters form a supplement of realism to a tale that is more or less fictitious though marvelously true in color and background the first bears no date but it was written not long after their arrival august it is not complete but there is enough of it to give us a very fair picture of carson city a wooden town its population two thousand souls part of a letter to mrs jane clemens in st louis date not given but sept or oct my dear mother i hope you will all come out here someday but i shant consent to invite you until we can receive you in style but i guess we shall be able to do that one of these days i intend that pamela shall live on lake bigler until she can knock a bull down with her fist say about three months tell everything as it is no better and no worse well gold hill sells at per foot cash down wild cat isnt worth ten cents the country is fabulously rich in gold silver copper lead coal iron quick silver marble granite chalk plaster of paris gypsum thieves murderers desperadoes ladies children lawyers christians indians chinamen spaniards gamblers sharpers coyotes pronounced kiyoties poets preachers and jackass rabbits i overheard a gentleman say the other day that it was the d dest country under the sun and that comprehensive conception i fully subscribe to it never rains here and the dew never falls no flowers grow here and no green thing gladdens the eye the birds that fly over the land carry their provisions with them only the crow and the raven tarry with us our city lies in the midst of a desert of the purest most unadulterated and compromising sand in which infernal soil nothing but that fagend of vegetable creation sagebrush ventures to grow if you will take a lilliputian cedar tree for a model and build a dozen imitations of it with the stiffest article of telegraph wire set them one foot apart and then try to walk through them youll understand provided the floor is covered inches deep with sand what it is to wander through a sagebrush desert when crushed sage brush emits an odor which isnt exactly magnolia and equally isnt exactly polecat but is a sort of compromise between the two it looks a good deal like greasewood and is the ugliest plant that was ever conceived of it is gray in color on the plains sagebrush and greasewood grow about twice as large as the common geranium and in my opinion they are a very good substitute for that useless vegetable greasewood is a perfectmost perfect imitation in miniature of a live oak treebarring the color of it as to the other fruits and flowers of the country there aint any except pulu or tuler or what ever they call it a species of unpoetical willow that grows on the banks of the carson a river yards wide knee deep and so villainously rapid and crooked that it looks like it had wandered into the country without intending it and had run about in a bewildered way and got lost in its hurry to get out again before some thirsty man came along and drank it up i said we are situated in a flat sandy desert true and surrounded on all sides by such prodigious mountains that when you gaze at them awhile and begin to conceive of their grandeur and next to feel their vastness expanding your soul and ultimately find yourself growing and swelling and spreading into a giant i say when this point is reached you look disdainfully down upon the insignificant village of carson and in that instant you are seized with a burning desire to stretch forth your hand put the city in your pocket and walk off with it as to churches i believe they have got a catholic one here but like that one the new york fireman spoke of i believe they dont run her now now although we are surrounded by sand the greatest part of the town is built upon what was once a very pretty grassy spot and the streams of pure water that used to poke about it in rural sloth and solitude now pass through on dusty streets and gladden the hearts of men by reminding them that there is at least something here that hath its prototype among the homes they left behind them and up kings canon please pronounce canyon after the manner of the natives there are ranches or farms where they say hay grows and grass and beets and onions and turnips and other truck which is suitable for cows yes and even irish potatoes also cabbage peas and beans the houses are mostly frame unplastered but papered inside with floursacks sewed together and the handsomer the brand upon the sacks is the neater the house looks occasionally you stumble on a stone house on account of the dryness of the country the shingles on the houses warp till they look like short joints of stove pipe split lengthwise remainder missing in this letter is something of the wild freedom of the west which later would contribute to his fame the spirit of the frontier of mark twain was beginning to stir him there had been no secretary work for him to do and no provision for payment he found his profit in studying human nature and in prospecting native resources he was not interested in mining not yet with a boy named john kinney he made an excursion to lake bigler now tahoe and located a timber claim really of great value they were supposed to build a fence around it but they were too full of the enjoyment of camplife to complete it they put in most of their time wandering through the stately forest or drifting over the transparent lake in a boat left there by lumbermen they built themselves a brush house but they did not sleep in it in roughing it he writes it never occurred to us for one thing and besides it was built to hold the ground and that was enough we did not wish to strain it they were having a glorious time when their campfire got away from them and burned up their claim his next letter of which the beginning is missing describes the fire fragment of a letter to mrs jane clemens and mrs moffett in st louis the level ranks of flame were relieved at intervals by the standardbearers as we called the tall dead trees wrapped in fire and waving their blazing banners a hundred feet in the air then we could turn from this scene to the lake and see every branch and leaf and cataract of flame upon its bank perfectly reflected as in a gleaming fiery mirror the mighty roaring of the conflagration together with our solitary and somewhat unsafe position for there was no one within six miles of us rendered the scene very impressive occasionally one of us would remove his pipe from his mouth and say superb magnificent beautiful butby the lord god almighty if we attempt to sleep in this little patch tonight well never live till morning for if we dont burn up well certainly suffocate but he was persuaded to sit up until we felt pretty safe as far as the fire was concerned and then we turned in with many misgivings when we got up in the morning we found that the fire had burned small pieces of drift wood within six feet of our boat and had made its way to within or steps of us on the south side we looked like lava men covered as we were with ashes and begrimed with smoke we were very black in the face but we soon washed ourselves white again john d kinney a cincinnati boy and a firstrate fellow too who came out with judge turner was my comrade we staid at the lake four days i had plenty of fun for john constantly reminded me of sam bowen when we were on our campaign in missouri but first and foremost for annies mollies and pamelas comfort be it known that i have never been guilty of profane language since i have been in this territory and kinney hardly ever swears but sometimes human nature gets the better of him on the second day we started to go by land to the lower camp a distance of three miles over the mountains each carrying an axe i dont think we got lost exactly but we wandered four hours over the steepest rockiest and most dangerous piece of country in the world i couldnt keep from laughing at kinneys distress so i kept behind so that he could not see me after he would get over a dangerous place with infinite labor and constant apprehension he would stop lean on his axe and look around then behind then ahead and then drop his head and ruminate awhile then he would draw a long sigh and say well could any billygoat have scaled that place without breaking his neck and i would reply no i dont think he could no you dont think he could mimicking me why dont you curse the infernal place you know you want to i do and will curse the thieving country as long as i live then we would toil on in silence for awhile finally i told him well john what if we dont find our way out of this today well know all about the country when we do get out oh stuff i know enough and too much about the d d villainous locality already finally we reached the camp but as we brought no provisions with us the first subject that presented itself to us was how to get back john swore he wouldnt walk back so we rolled a drift log apiece into the lake and set about making paddles intending to straddle the logs and paddle ourselves back home sometime or other but the lake objected got stormy and we had to give it up so we set out for the only house on this side of the lake three miles from there down the shore we found the way without any trouble reached there before sundown played three games of cribbage borrowed a dugout and pulled back six miles to the upper camp as we had eaten nothing since sunrise we did not waste time in cooking our supper or in eating it either after supper we got out our pipes built a rousing camp fire in the open airestablished a faro bank an institution of this country on our huge flat granite dining table and bet white beans till one oclock when john went to bed we were up before the sun the next morning went out on the lake and caught a fine trout for breakfast but unfortunately i spoilt part of the breakfast we had coffee and tea boiling on the fire in coffeepots and fearing they might not be strong enough i added more ground coffee and more tea but you know mistakes will happen i put the tea in the coffeepot and the coffee in the teapot and if you imagine that they were not villainous mixtures just try the effect once and so bella is to be married on the st of oct well i send her and her husband my very best wishes and i may not be here but wherever i am on that night well have a rousing campfire and a jollification in honor of the event in a day or two we shall probably go to the lake and build another cabin and fence and get everything into satisfactory trim before our trip to esmeralda about the first of november what has become of sam bowen i would give my last shirt to have him out here i will make no promises but i believe if john would give him a thousand dollars and send him out here he would not regret it he might possibly do very well here but he could do little without capital remember me to all my st louis and keokuk friends and tell challie and hallie renson that i heard a military band play what are the wild waves saying the other night and it reminded me very forcibly of them it brought ella creel and belle across the desert too in an instant for they sang the song in orions yard the first time i ever heard it it was like meeting an old friend i tell you i could have swallowed that whole band trombone and all if such a compliment would have been any gratification to them love to the young folks sam the reference in the foregoing letter to esmeralda has to do with mining plans he was beginning to be mildly interested and with his brother orion had acquired feet in an esmeralda camp probably at a very small price so small as to hold out no exciting prospect of riches in his next letter he gives us the size of this claim which he has visited his interest however still appears to be chiefly in his timber claim on lake bigler tahoe though we are never to hear of it again after this letter to mrs moffett in st louis carson city oct my dear sister i have just finished reading your letter and mas of sept th how in the world could they have been so long coming you ask me if i have for gotten my promise to lay a claim for mr moffett by no means i have already laid a timber claim on the borders of a lake bigler which throws como in the shade and if we succeed in getting one mr jones to move his sawmill up there mr moffett can just consider that claim better than bank stock jones says he will move his mill up next spring in that claim i took up about two miles in length by one in width and the names in it are as follows sam l clemens wm a moffett thos nye and three others it is situated on sam clemens bay so named by capt nye and it goes by that name among the inhabitants of that region i had better stop about the lake though for whenever i think of it i want to go there and die the place is so beautiful ill build a country seat there one of these days that will make the devils mouth water if he ever visits the earth jim lampton will never know whether i laid a claim there for him or not until he comes here himself we have now got about feet of mining ground and if it proves good mr moffetts name will go in if not i can get feet for him in the spring which will be good you see pamela the trouble does not consist in getting mining ground for that is plenty enough but the money to work it with after you get it is the mischief when i was in esmeralda a young fellow gave me fifty feet in the black warrior an unprospected claim the other day he wrote me that he had gone down eight feet on the ledge and found it eight feet thick and pretty good rock too he said he could take out rock now if there were a mill to crush it but the mills are all engaged there are only four of them so if i were willing he would suspend work until spring i wrote him to let it alone at present because you see in the spring i can go down myself and help him look after it there will then be twenty mills there orion and i have confidence enough in this country to think that if the war will let us alone we can make mr moffett rich without its ever costing him a cent of money or particle of trouble we shall lay plenty of claims for him but if they never pay him anything they will never cost him anything orion and i are not financiers therefore you must persuade uncle jim to come out here and help us in that line i have written to him twice to come i wrote him today in both letters i told him not to let you or ma know that we dealt in such romantic nonsense as brilliant prospects because i always did hate for anyone to know what my plans or hopes or prospects were for if i kept people in ignorance in these matters no one could be disappointed but myself if they were not realized you know i never told you that i went on the river under a promise to pay bixby until i had paid the money and cleared my skirts of the possibility of having my judgment criticised i would not say anything about our prospects now if we were nearer home but i suppose at this distance you are more anxious than you would be if you saw us every monthand therefore it is hardly fair to keep you in the dark however keep these matters to yourselves and then if we fail well keep the laugh in the family what we want now is something that will commence paying immediately we have got a chance to get into a claim where they say a tunnel has been run feet and the ledge struck i got a horse yesterday and went out with the attorneygeneral and the claimowner and we tried to go to the claim by a new route and got lost in the mountains sunset overtook us before we found the claim my horse got too lame to carry me and i got down and drove him ahead of me till within four miles of town then we sent rice on ahead bunker whose horse was in good condition undertook to lead mine and i followed after him darkness shut him out from my view in less than a minute and within the next minute i lost the road and got to wandering in the sage brush i would find the road occasionally and then lose it again in a minute or so i got to carson about nine oclock at night but not by the road i traveled when i left it the general says my horse did very well for awhile but soon refused to lead then he dismounted and had a jolly time driving both horses ahead of him and chasing them here and there through the sage brush it does my soul good when i think of it until he got to town when both animals deserted him and he cursed them handsomely and came home alone of course the horses went to their stables tell sammy i will lay a claim for him and he must come out and attend to it he must get rid of that propensity for tumbling down though for when we get fairly started here i dont think we shall have time to pick up those who fall that is stoughters house i expect that cousin jim has moved into this is just the country for cousin jim to live in i dont believe it would take him six months to make here if he had dollars to commence with i suppose he cant leave his family though tell mrs benson i never intend to be a lawyer i have been a slave several times in my life but ill never be one again i always intend to be so situated unless i marry that i can pull up stakes and clear out whenever i feel like it we are very thankful to you pamela for the papers you send we have received half a dozen or more and next to letters they are the most welcome visitors we have write oftener pamela yr brother sam the cousin jim mentioned in this letter is the original of the character of colonel sellers whatever mark twains later opinion of cousin jim lamptons financial genius may have been he seems to have respected it at this time more than three months pass until we have another letter and in that time the mining fever had become well seated mark twain himself was full of the sellers optimism and it was bound to overflow fortify as he would against it he met with little enough encouragement with three companions in midwinter he made a mining excursion to the much exploited humboldt region returning emptyhanded after a month or two of hard experience this is the trip picturesquely described in chapters xxvii to xxxiii of roughing it it is set down historically in mark twain a biography harper brothers he mentions the humboldt in his next letter but does not confess his failure to mrs jane clemens and mrs moffett in st louis carson city feb my dear mother and sister by george pamela i begin to fear that i have invoked a spirit of some kind or other which i will find some difficulty in laying i wasnt much terrified by your growing inclinations but when you begin to call presentiments to your aid i confess that i weaken mr moffett is right as i said before and i am not much afraid of his going wrong men are easily dealt with but when you get the women started you are in for it you know but i have decided on two things viz any of you or all of you may live in california for that is the garden of eden reproduced but you shall never live in nevada and secondly none of you save mr moffett shall ever cross the plains if you were only going to pikes peak a little matter of miles from st jo you might take the coach and i wouldnt say a word but i consider it over miles from st jo to carson and the first or miles is mere fourth of july compared to the balance of the route but lord bless you a man enjoys every foot of it if you ever come here or to california it must be by sea mr moffett must come by overland coach though by all means he would consider it the jolliest little trip he ever took in his life either june july or august are the proper months to make the journey in he could not suffer from heat and three or four heavy army blankets would make the cold nights comfortable if the coach were full of passengers two good blankets would probably be sufficient if he comes and brings plenty of money and fails to invest it to his entire satisfaction i will prophesy no more but i will tell you a few things which you wouldnt have found out if i hadnt got myself into this scrape i expect to return to st louis in july per steamer i dont say that i will return then or that i shall be able to do it but i expect to you bet i came down here from humboldt in order to look after our esmeralda interests and my sorebacked horse and the bad roads have prevented me from making the journey yesterday one of my old esmeralda friends bob howland arrived here and i have had a talk with him he owns with me in the horatio and derby ledge he says our tunnel is in feet and a small stream of water has been struck which bids fair to become a big thing by the time the ledge is reached sufficient to supply a mill now if you knew anything of the value of water here you would perceive at a glance that if the water should amount to or inches we wouldnt care whether school kept or not if the ledge should prove to be worthless wed sell the water for money enough to give us quite a lift but you see the ledge will not prove to be worthless we have located near by a fine site for a mill and when we strike the ledge you know well have a millsite water power and payrock all handy then we shant care whether we have capital or not millfolks will build us a mill and wait for their pay if nothing goes wrong well strike the ledge in june and if we do ill be home in july you know pamela dont you know that undemonstrated human calculations wont do to bet on dont you know that i have only talked as yet but proved nothing dont you know that i have expended money in this country but have made none myself dont you know that i have never held in my hands a gold or silver bar that belonged to me dont you know that its all talk and no cider so far dont you know that people who always feel jolly no matter where they are or what happens to them who have the organ of hope preposterously developed who are endowed with an uncongealable sanguine temperament who never feel concerned about the price of corn and who cannot by any possibility discover any but the bright side of a picture are very apt to go to extremes and exaggerate with horse microscopic power of course i never tried to raise these suspicions in your mind but then your knowledge of the fact that some peoples poor frail human nature is a sort of crazy institution anyhow ought to have suggested them to you now if i hadnt thoughtlessly got you into the notion of coming out here and thereby got myself into a scrape i wouldnt have given you that highlycolored paragraph about the mill etc because you know if that pretty little picture should fail and wash out and go the devil generally it wouldnt cost me the loss of an hours sleep but you fellows would be so much distressed on my account as i could possibly be if circumstances beyond my control were to prevent my being present at my own funeral but but in the bright lexicon of youth theres no such word as fail and ill prove it and look here i came near forgetting it dont you say a word to me about trains across the plains because i am down on that arrangement that sort of thing is played out you know the overland coach or the mail steamer is the thing you want to know something about the route between california and nevada territory suppose you take my word for it that it is exceedingly jolly or take for a winter view j ross browns picture in harpers monthly of pack mules tumbling fifteen hundred feet down the side of a mountain why bless you theres scenery on that route you can stand on some of those noble peaks and see jerusalem and the holy land and you can start a boulder and send it tearing up the earth and crashing over treesdowndowndownto the very devil madam and you would probably stand up there and look and stare and wonder at the magnificence spread out before you till you starved to death if let alone but you should take someone along to keep you moving since you want to know i will inform you that an eightstamp water mill put up and ready for business would cost about to then the water to run it with would cost from to and even more according to the location what i mean by that is that water powers in this vicinity are immensely valuable so also in esmeralda but humboldt is a new country and things dont cost so much there yet i saw a good water power sold there for but here is the way the thing is managed a man with a good water power on carson river will lean his axe up against a tree provided you find him chopping cordwood at a day and taking his chalk pipe out of his mouth to afford him an opportunity to answer your questions will look you coolly in the face and tell you his little property is worth forty or fifty thousand dollars but you can easily fix him you tell him that youll build a quartz mill on his property and make him a fourth or a third or half owner in said mill in consideration of the privilege of using said property and that will bring him to his milk in a jiffy so he spits on his hands and goes in again with his axe until the mill is finished when lo out pops the quondam woodchopper arrayed in purple and fine linen and prepared to deal in bankstock or bet on the races or take government loans with an air as to the amount of the most dont caread dest unconcern that you can conceive of by george if i just had a thousand dollars id be all right now theres the horatio for instance there are five or six shareholders in it and i know i could buy half of their interests at say per foot now that flour is worth per barrel and they are pressed for money but i am hard up myself and cant buy and in june theyll strike the ledge and then goodbye canary i cant get it for love or money twenty dollars a foot think of it for ground that is proven to be rich twenty dollars madam and we wouldnt part with a foot of our for five times the sum so it will be in humboldt next summer the boys will get pushed and sell ground for a song that is worth a fortune but i am at the helm now i have convinced orion that he hasnt business talent enough to carry on a peanut stand and he has solemnly promised me that he will meddle no more with mining or other matters not connected with the secretarys office so you see if mines are to be bought or sold or tunnels run or shafts sunk parties have to come to me and me only im the firm you know how long does it take one of those infernal trains to go through well anywhere between three and five months tell margaret that if you ever come to live in california that you can promise her a home for a hundred years and a bully one but she wouldnt like the country some people are malicious enough to think that if the devil were set at liberty and told to confine himself to nevada territory that he would come here and look sadly around awhile and then get homesick and go back to hell again but i hardly believe it you know i am saying mind you that margaret wouldnt like the country perhaps nor the devil either for that matter or any other man but i like it when it rains here it never lets up till it has done all the raining it has got to do and after that theres a dry spell you bet why i have had my whiskers and moustaches so full of alkali dust that youd have thought i worked in a starch factory and boarded in a flour barrel since we have been here there has not been a fire although the houses are built of wood they holler fire sometimes though but i am always too late to see the smoke before the fire is out if they ever have any now they raised a yell here in front of the office a moment ago i put away my papers and locked up everything of value and changed my boots and pulled off my coat and went and got a bucket of water and came back to see what the matter was remarking to myself i guess ill be on hand this time any way but i met a friend on the pavement and he said where you been fires out half an hour ago ma says axtele was above suspition but i have searched through websters unabridged and cant find the word however its of no consequence i hope he got down safely i knew axtele and his wife as well as i know dan haines mrs a once tried to embarrass me in the presence of company by asking me to name her baby when she was well aware that i didnt know the sex of that phenomenon but i told her to call it frances and spell it to suit herself that was about nine years ago and axtele had no property and could hardly support his family by his earnings he was a pious cuss though member of margaret sextons church and ma says it looks like a man cant hold public office and be honest why certainly not madam a man cant hold public office and be honest lord bless you it is a common practice with orion to go about town stealing little things that happen to be lying around loose and i dont remember having heard him speak the truth since we have been in nevada he even tries to prevail upon me to do these things ma but i wasnt brought up in that way you know you showed the public what you could do in that line when you raised me madam but then you ought to have raised me first so that orion could have had the benefit of my example do you know that he stole all the stamps out of an stamp quartz mill one night and brought them home under his overcoat and hid them in the back room yrs etc sam a little later he had headed for the esmeralda hills some time in february he was established there in a camp with a young man by the name of horatio phillips raish later he camped with bob howland who as city marshal of aurora became known as the most fearless man in the territory and still later with calvin h higbie cal to whom roughing it would one day be dedicated his own funds were exhausted by this time and orion with his rather slender salary became the financial partner of the firm it was a comfortless life there in the esmeralda camp snow covered everything there was nothing to do and apparently nothing to report for there are no letters until april then the first one is dated carson city where he seems to be making a brief sojourn it is a rather heavy attempt to be lighthearted its playfulness suggests that of a dancing bear to mrs jane clemens in st louis carson city april my dear mother yours of march nd has just been received i see i am in for it again with annie but she ought to know that i was always stupid she used to try to teach me lessons from the bible but i never could understand them doesnt she remember telling me the story of moses one sunday last spring and how hard she tried to explain it and simplify it so that i could understand it but i couldnt and how she said it was strange that while her ma and her grandma and her uncle orion could understand anything in the world i was so dull that i couldnt understand the easiest thing and doesnt she remember that finally a light broke in upon me and i said it was all right that i knew old moses himself and that he kept a clothing store in market street and then she went to her ma and said she didnt know what would become of her uncle sam he was too dull to learn anything ever and im just as dull yet now i have no doubt her letter was spelled right and was correct in all particulars but then i had to read it according to my lights and they being inferior she ought to overlook the mistakes i make specially as it is not my fault that i wasnt born with good sense i am sure she will detect an encouraging ray of intelligence in that last argument i am waiting here trying to rent a better office for orion i have got the refusal after next week of a room on first floor of a fireproof brickrent eighteen hundred dollars a year dont know yet whether we can get it or not if it is not rented before the week is up we can i was sorry to hear that dick was killed i gave him his first lesson in the musket drill we had half a dozen muskets in our office when it was over isbells music rooms i hope i am wearing the last white shirt that will embellish my person for many a day for i do hope that i shall be out of carson long before this reaches you love to all very respectfully sam the annie in this letter was his sister pamelas little daughter long years after she would be the wife of charles l webster mark twains publishing partner dick the reader may remember as dick hingham of the keokuk printingoffice he was killed in charging the works at fort donelson clemens was back in esmeralda when the next letter was written and we begin now to get pictures of that cheerless miningcamp and to know something of the alternate hopes and discouragements of the hunt for gold the miner one day soaring on wings of hope on the next becoming excited irritable profane the names of new mines appear constantly and vanish almost at a touch suggesting the fairylike evanescence of their riches but a few of the letters here will best speak for themselves not all of them are needed it is perhaps unnecessary to say that there is no intentional humor in these documents to orion clemens in carson city esmeralda th april my dear brother wasson got here night before last from the wars tell lockhart he is not wounded and not killed is altogether unhurt he says the whites left their stone fort before he and lieut noble got there a large amount of provisions and ammunition which they left behind them fell into the hands of the indians they had a pitched battle with the savages some fifty miles from the fort in which scott sheriff and another man was killed this was the day before the soldiers came up with them i mean nobles men and those under cols evans and mayfield from los angeles evans assumed the chief command and next morning the forces were divided into three parties and marched against the enemy col mayfield was killed and sergeant gillespie also nobles colonel was wounded the california troops went back home and noble remained to help drive the stock over here and as cousin sally dillard says this is all i know about the fight work not yet begun on the h and derby havent seen it yet it is still in the snow shall begin on it within or weeks strike the ledge in july guess it is good worth from to a foot in california why didnt you send the live yankee deedthe very one i wanted have made no inquiries about it much dont intend to until i get the deed send it along by mail d n the express have to pay three times for all express matter once in carson and twice here i dont expect to take the saddlebags out of the express office i paid twentyfive cts for the express deeds man named gebhart shot here yesterday while trying to defend a claim on last chance hill expect he will die these mills here are not worth a d nexcept claytons and it is not in full working trim yet send me or by mail immediately the red bird is probably good cant work on the tunnel on account of snow the pugh i have thrown away shant relocate it it is nothing but bedrock croppings too much work to find the ledge if there is one shant record the farnum until i know more about it perhaps not at all governor under the snow douglas and red bird are both recorded i have had opportunities to get into several ledges but refused all but three expect to back out of two of them stir yourself as much as possible and lay up or subject to my call i go to work tomorrow with pick and shovel somethings got to come by g before i let go here col youngs says you must rent kinkeads room by all means government would rather pay a month for your office than for gen norths says you are playing your hand very badly for either the governments good opinion or anybodys else in keeping your office in a shanty says put gov nye in your place and he would have a stylish office and no objections would ever be made either when old col youngs talks this way i think it time to get a fine office i wish you would take that office and fit it up handsomely so that i can omit telling people that by this time you are handsomely located when i know it is no such thing i am living with ratio phillips send him one of those black portfolios by the stage and put a couple of penholders and a dozen steel pens in it if you should have occasion to dispose of the long desk before i return dont forget to break open the middle drawer and take out my things envelop my black cloth coat in a newspaper and hang it in the back room dont buy anything while i am here but save up some money for me dont send any money home i shall have your next quarters salary spent before you get it i think i mean to make or break here within the next two or three months yrs sam the wars mentioned in the opening paragraph of this letter were incident to the trouble concerning the boundary line between california and nevada the trouble continued for some time with occasional bloodshed the next letter is an exultant one there were few enough of this sort we cannot pretend to keep track of the multiplicity of mines and shares which lure the goldhunters pecking away at the flinty ledges usually in the snow it has been necessary to abbreviate this letter for much of it has lost all importance with the years and is merely confusing hope is still high in the writers heart and confidence in his associates still unshaken later he was to lose faith in raish whether with justice or not we cannot know now to orion clowns in carson city esmeralda may my dear bro to use a french expression i have got my d d satisfy at last two years time will make us capitalists in spite of anything therefore we need fret and fume and worry and doubt no more but just lie still and put up with privations for six months perhaps three months will let us out then if government refuses to pay the rent on your new office we can do it ourselves we have got to wait six weeks anyhow for a dividend maybe longer but that it will come there is no shadow of a doubt i have got the thing sifted down to a dead moral certainty i own oneeighth of the new monitor ledge clemens company and money cant buy a foot of it because i know it to contain our fortune the ledge is six feet wide and one needs no glass to see gold and silver in it phillips and i own one half of a segregated claim in the flyaway discovery and good interests in two extensions on it we put men to work on our part of the discovery yesterday and last night they brought us some fine specimens rock taken from ten feet below the surface on the other part of the discovery has yielded to the ton in the mill and we are at work feet from their shaft may yours by the mail received last night eighteen hundred feet in the c t rices company well i am glad you did not accept of the feet tell rice to give it to some poor man but hereafter when anybody holds up a glittering prospect before you just argue in this wise viz that if all spare change be devoted to working the monitor and flyaway months or at furthest will find all our earthly wishes satisfied so far as money is concerned and the more feet we have the more anxiety we must bear therefore why not say no d n your prospects i wait on a sure thing and a man is less than a man if he cant wait years for a fortune when you and i came out here we did not expect or to find us rich men and if that proposition had been made we would have accepted it gladly now it is made well i am willing now that nearys tunnel or anybody elses tunnel shall succeed some of them may beat us a few months but we shall be on hand in the fullness of time as sure as fate i would hate to swap chances with any member of the tribe in fact i am so lost to all sense and reason as to be capable of refusing to trade flyaway with but feet in the company of four foot for foot for that splendid lady washington with its lists of capitalist proprietors and its feet of priceless ground i wouldnt mind being in some of those clear creek claims if i lived in carson and we could spare the money but i have struck my tent in esmeralda and i care for no mines but those which i can superintend myself i am a citizen here now and i am satisfied although r and i are strapped and we havent three days rations in the house raish is looking anxiously for money and so am i send me whatever you can spare conveniently i want it to work the flyaway with my fourth of that claim only cost me which isnt paid yet though and i suppose i could sell it here in town for ten times that amount today but i shall probably hold onto it till the cows come home i shall work the monitor and the other claims with my own hands i prospected of a pound of m yesterday and raish reduced it with the blowpipe and got about ten or twelve cents in gold and silver besides the other half of it which we spilt on the floor and didnt get the specimen came from the croppings but was a choice one and showed much free gold to the naked eye well i like the corner upstairs office amazingly provided it has one fine large front room superbly carpeted for the safe and a desk or such a matter one handsome room amidships less handsomely gotten up perhaps for records and consultations and one goodsized bedroom and adjoining it a kitchen neither of which latter can be entered by anybody but yourself and finally when one of the ledges begins to pay the whole to be kept in parlor order by two likely contrabands at big wages the same to be free of expense to the government you want the entire second story no less room than you would have had in harris and cos make them fix for you before the st of julyfor maybe you might want to come out strong on the th you know no the post office is all right and kept by a gentleman but w f express isnt they charge cts to express a letter from here but i believe they have quit charging twice for letters that arrive prepaid the flyaway specimen i sent you taken by myself from dekays shaft feet from where we are going to sink cannot be called choice exactly say something above medium to be on the safe side but i have seen exceedingly choice chunks from that shaft my intention at first in sending the antelope specimen was that you might see that it resembles the monitor but come to think a man can tell absolutely nothing about that without seeing both ledges themselves i tried to break a handsome chunk from a huge piece of my darling monitor which we brought from the croppings yesterday but it all splintered up and i send you the scraps i call that choice any d d fool would dont ask if it has been assayed for it hasnt it dont need it it is amply able to speak for itself it is six feet wide on top and traversed through and through with veins whose color proclaims their worth what the devil does a man want with any more feet when he owns in the flyaway and the invincible bombproof monitor if i had anything more to say i have forgotten what it was unless perhaps that i want a sum of money anywhere from to as soon as possible raish sends regards he or i one will drop a line to the age occasionally i suppose you saw my letters in the enterprise yr bro sam p s i suppose pamela never will regain her health but she could improve it by coming to california provided the trip didnt kill her you see bixby is on the flagship he always was the best pilot on the mississippi and deserves his posish they have done a reckless thing though in putting sam bowen on the swan for if a bombshell happens to come his way he will infallibly jump overboard send me another package of those envelopes per bagleys coat pocket we see how anxious he was for his brother to make a good official showing if a niggardly government refused to provide decent quarters no matter the miners with gold pouring in would themselves pay for a suite superbly carpeted and all kept in order by two likely contrabands that is to say negroes samuel clemens in those days believed in expansion and impressive surroundings his brother though also mining mad was rather inclined to be penny wise in the matter of office luxury not a bad idea as it turned out orion by the way was acquiring feet on his own account and in one instance at least seems to have won his brothers commendation the enterprise letters mentioned we shall presently hear of again to orion clemens in carson city esmeralda sunday may my dear brother well if you havent struck it rich that is if the piece of rock you sent me came from a bona fide ledge and it looks as if it did if that is a ledge and you own feet in it why its a big thing and i have nothing more to say if you have actually made something by helping to pay somebodys prospecting expenses it is a wonder of the first magnitude and deserves to rank as such if that rock came from a welldefined ledge that particular vein must be at least an inch wide judging from this specimen which is fully that thick when i came in the other evening hungry and tired and illnatured and threw down my pick and shovel raish gave me your specimen said bagley brought it and asked me if it were cinnabar i examined it by the waning daylight and took the specks of fine gold for sulphurets wrote you i did not think much of it and posted the letter immediately but as soon as i looked at it in the broad light of day i saw my mistake during the week we have made three horns got a blowpipe c and yesterday all prepared we prospected the mountain house i broke the specimen in two and found it full of fine gold inside then we washed out onefourth of it and got a noble prospect this we reduced with the blowpipe and got about two cents herewith enclosed in pure gold as the fragment prospected weighed rather less than an ounce this would give about to the ton we were eminently well satisfied therefore hold on to the mountain house for it is a big thing touch it lightly as far as money is concerned though for it is well to reserve the code of justice in the matter of quartz ledges that is consider them all and their owners guilty of shenanigan until they are proved innocent p s monday ratio and i have bought onehalf of a segregated claim in the original flyaway for down we havent a cent in the house we two will work the ledge and have full control and pay all expenses if you can spare conveniently let me have it or anyhow considering that i own one fourth of this it is of course more valuable than one of the mountain house although not so rich there is too much of a sameness in the letters of this period to use all of them there are always new claims and work done apparently without system or continuance hoping to uncover sudden boundless affluence in the next letter and the one following it we get a hint of an episode or rather of two incidents which he combined into an episode in roughing it the story as told in that book is an account of what might have happened rather than history there was never really any money in the blind lead of the wide west claim except that which was sunk in it by unfortunate investors only extracts from these letters are given the other portions are irrelevant and of slight value extract from a letter to orion clemens in carson city two or three of the old salina company entered our hole on the monitor yesterday morning before our men got there and took possession armed with revolvers and according to the d d laws of this forever d d country nothing but the district court and there aint any can touch the matter unless it assumes the shape of an infernal humbug which they call forcible entry and detainer and in order to bring that about you must compel the jumpers to use personal violence toward you we went up and demanded possession and they refused said they were in the hole armed and meant to die for it if necessary i got in with them and again demanded possession they said i might stay in it as long as i pleased and work but they would do the same i asked one of our company to take my place in the hole while i went to consult a lawyer he did so the lawyer said it was no go they must offer some force our boys will try to be there first in the morning in which case they may get possession and keep it now you understand the shooting scrape in which gebhart was killed the other day the clemens company all of us hate to resort to arms in this matter and it will not be done until it becomes a forced hand but i think that will be the end of it nevertheless the mine relocated in this letter was not the wide west but it furnished the proper incident the only mention of the wide west is found in a letter written in july extract from a letter to orion clemens in carson city if i do not forget it i will send you per next mail a pinch of decom decomposed rock which i pinched with thumb and finger from wide west ledge awhile ago raish and i have secured out of a ft in it which perhaps the ledge i mean is a spur from the w w our shaft is about ft from the w w shaft in order to get in we agreed to sink ft we have sublet to another man for ft and we pay for powder and sharpening tools the wide west claim was forfeited but there is no evidence to show that clemens and his partners were ever except in fiction millionaires for ten days the background the local color and the possibilities are all real enough but mark twains aim in this as in most of his other reminiscent writing was to arrange and adapt his facts to the needs of a good story the letters of this summer most of them bear evidence of waning confidence in mining as a source of fortune the miner has now little faith in his own judgment and none at all in that of his brother who was without practical experience letter to orion clemens in carson city esmeralda thursday my dear bro yours of the th per express just received part of it pleased me exceedingly and part of it didnt concerning the letter for instance you have promised me that you would leave all mining matters and everything involving an outlay of money in my hands sending a man fooling around the country after ledges for gods sake when there are hundreds of feet of them under my nose here begging for owners free of charge i dont want any more feet and i wont touch another foot so you see orion as far as any ledges of perrys are concerned or any other except what i examine first with my own eyes i freely yield my right to share ownership with you the balance of your letter i say pleases me exceedingly especially that about the h and d being worth from to in cal it pleases me because if the ledges prove to be worthless it will be a pleasant reflection to know that others were beaten worse than ourselves raish sold a man feet yesterday at a foot although i was present at the sale and told the man the ground wasnt worth a d n he said he had been hankering after a few feet in the h and d for a long time and he had got them at last and he couldnt help thinking he had secured a good thing we went and looked at the ledges and both of them acknowledged that there was nothing in them but good indications yet the owners in the h and d will part with anything else sooner than with feet in these ledges well the work goes slowly very slowly on in the tunnel and well strike it some day but if we strike it rich ive lost my guess thats all i expect that the way it got so high in cal was that raishs brother over there was offered for feet of it and he refused couldnt go on the hill today it snowed it always snows here i expect dont you suppose they have pretty much quit writing at home when you receive your next yrs salary dont send any of it here until after you have told me you have got it remember this i am afraid of that h and d they have struck the ledge in the live yankee tunnel and i told the president mr allen that it wasnt as good as the croppings he said that was true enough but they would hang to it until it did prove rich he is much of a gentleman that man allen and ask gaslerie why the devil he dont send along my commission as deputy sheriff the fact of my being in california and out of his country wouldnt amount to a d n with me in the performance of my official duties i have nothing to report at present except that i shall find out all i want to know about this locality before i leave it how do the records pay yr bro sam in one of the foregoing letters the one dated may there is a reference to the writers enterprise letters sometimes during idle days in the camp the miner had followed old literary impulses and written an occasional burlesque sketch which he had signed josh and sent to the territorial enterprise at virginia city one contribution was sent to a keokuk paper the gate city and a letter written by mrs jane clemens at the time would indicate that mark twains mother did not always approve of her sons literary efforts she hopes that he will do better and some time write something that his kin will be proud of the rough vigorous humor of these had attracted some attention and orion pleased with any measure of success that might come to his brother had allowed the authorship of them to become known when in july the financial situation became desperate the esmeralda miner was moved to turn to literature for relief but we will let him present the situation himself to orion clemens in carson city esmeralda july d my dear bro no i dont own a foot in the johnson ledge i will tell the story some day in a more intelligible manner than tom has told it you neednt take the trouble to deny toms version though i own feet of the st east ex on it and johnson himself has contracted to find the ledge for feet contract signed yesterday but as the ledge will be difficult to find he is allowed six months to find it in an eighteenth of the ophir was a fortune to john d winters and the ophir cant beat the johnson any my debts are greater than i thought for i bought worth of clothing and sent to higbie in the cement diggings i owe about or and have got about in my pocket but how in the h l i am going to live on something over until october or november is singular the fact is i must have something to do and that shortly too now write to the sacramento union folks or to marsh and tell them ill write as many letters a week as they want for a week my board must be paid tell them i have corresponded with the n orleans crescent and other papers and the enterprise california is full of people who have interests here and its d d seldom they hear from this country i cant write a specimen letter now at any rate id rather undertake to write a greek poem tell em the mail and express leave three times a week and it costs from to cents to send letters by the blasted express if they want letters from here wholl run from morning till night collecting materials cheaper ill write a short letter twice a week for the present for the age for per week now it has been a long time since i couldnt make my own living and it shall be a long time before i loaf another year if i get the other feet in the johnson ex i shant care a d n ill be willing to curse awhile and wait and if i cant move the bowels of those hills this fall i will come up and clerk for you until i get money enough to go over the mountains for the winter yr bro sam the territorial enterprise at virginia city was at this time owned by joseph t goodman who had bought it on the eve of the great comstock silvermining boom and from a struggling starving sheet had converted it into one of the most important certainly the most picturesquepapers on the coast the sketches which the esmeralda miner had written over the name of josh fitted into it exactly and when a young man named barstow in the business office urged goodman to invite josh to join their staff the enterprise owner readily fell in with the idea among a lot of mining matters of no special interest clemens july oth wrote his brother barstow has offered me the post as local reporter for the enterprise at a week and i have written him that i will let him know next mail if possible in roughing it we are told that the miner eagerly accepted the proposition to come to virginia city but the letters tell a different story mark twain was never one to abandon any undertaking easily his unwillingness to surrender in a lost cause would cost him more than one fortune in the years to come a week following the date of the foregoing he was still undecided to orion clemens in carson city esmeralda aug my dear bro barstow wrote that if i wanted the place i could have it i wrote him that i guessed i would take it and asked him how long before i must come up there i have not heard from him since now i shall leave at midnight tonight alone and on foot for a walk of or miles through a totally uninhabited country and it is barely possible that mail facilities may prove infernally slow during the few weeks i expect to spend out there but do you write barstow that i have left here for a week or so and in case he should want me he must write me here or let me know through you the contractors say they will strike the fresno next week after fooling with those assayers a week they concluded not to buy mr flower at although they would have given five times the sum for it four months ago so i have made out a deed for one half of all johnnys ground and acknowledged and left in judge f k becktels hands and if judge turner wants it he must write to becktel and pay him his notary fee of i would have paid that fee myself but i want money now as i leave town tonight however if you think it isnt right you can pay the fee to judge turner yourself hang to your money now i may want some when i get back see that you keep out of debtto anybody bully for b write him that i would write him myself but i am to take a walk tonight and havent time tell him to bring his family out with him he can rely upon what i say and i say the land has lost its ancient desolate appearance the rose and the oleander have taken the place of the departed sagebush a rich black loam garnished with moss and flowers and the greenest of grass smiles to heaven from the vanished sandplains the endless snows have all disappeared and in their stead or to repay us for their loss the mountains rear their billowy heads aloft crowned with a fadeless and eternal verdure birds and fountains and treestropical bees everywhere and the poet dreamt of nevada when he wrote and sharon waves in solemn praise her silent groves of palm and today the royal raven listens in a dreamy stupor to the songs of the thrush and the nightingale and the canary and shudders when the gaudy plumaged birds of the distant south sweep by him to the orange groves of carson tell him he wouldnt recognize the d d country he should bring his family by all means i intended to write home but i havent done it yr bro sam in this letter we realize that he had gone into the wilderness to reflect to get a perspective on the situation he was a great walker in those days and sometimes with higbie sometimes alone made long excursions one such is recorded in roughing it the trip to mono lake we have no means of knowing where his seventymile tour led him now but it is clear that he still had not reached a decision on his return indeed we gather that he is inclined to keep up the battle among the barren esmeralda hills last mining letter written to mrs moffett in st louis esmeralda cal aug my dear sisteri mailed a letter to you and ma this morning but since then i have received yours to orion and me therefore i must answer right away else i may leave town without doing it at all what in thunder are pilots wages to me which question i beg humbly to observe is of a general nature and not discharged particularly at you but it is singular isnt it that such a matter should interest orion when it is of no earthly consequence to me i never have once thought of returning home to go on the river again and i never expect to do any more piloting at any price my livelihood must be made in this country and if i have to wait longer than i expected let it be so i have no fear of failure you know i have extravagant hopes for orion tells you everything which he ought to keep to himself but its his nature to do that sort of thing and i let him alone i did think for awhile of going home this fall but when i found that that was and had been the cherished intention and the darling aspiration every year of these old careworn californians for twelve weary years i felt a little uncomfortable but i stole a march on disappointment and said i would not go home this fall i will spend the winter in san francisco if possible do not tell any one that i had any idea of piloting again at present for it is all a mistake this country suits me and it shall suit me whether or no dan twing and i and dans dog cabin together and will continue to do so for awhile until i leave for the mansion is x with a domestic roof yesterday it rained the first shower for five months domestic it appears to me is not waterproof we went outside to keep from getting wet dan makes the bed when it is his turn to do it and when it is my turn i dont you know the dog is not a good hunter and he isnt worth shucks to watch but he scratches up the dirt floor of the cabin and catches flies and makes himself generally useful in the way of washing dishes dan gets up first in the morning and makes a fire and i get up last and sit by it while he cooks breakfast we have a cold lunch at noon and i cook supper very much against my will however one must have one good meal a day and if i were to live on dans abominable cookery i should lose my appetite you know dan attended dr chorpennings funeral yesterday and he felt as though he ought to wear a white shirt and we had a jolly good time finding such an article we turned over all our traps and he found one at last but i shall always think it was suffering from yellow fever he also found an old black coat greasy and wrinkled to that degree that it appeared to have been quilted at some time or other in this gorgeous costume he attended the funeral and when he returned his own dog drove him away from the cabin not recognizing him this is true you would not like to live in a country where flour was a barrel very well then i suppose you would not like to live here where flour was a barrel when i first came here and shortly afterwards it couldnt be had at any price and for one month the people lived on barley beans and beef and nothing beside oh no we didnt luxuriate then perhaps not but we said wise and severe things about the vanity and wickedness of high living we preached our doctrine and practised it which course i respectfully recommend to the clergymen of st louis where is beack jolly a pilot and bixby your brother sam iv letters mark twain comstock journalism artemus ward there is a long hiatus in the correspondence here for a space of many months there is but one letter to continue the story others were written of course but for some reason they have not survived it was about the end of august when the miner finally abandoned the struggle and with his pack on his shoulders walked the one and thirty miles over the mountains to virginia city arriving dusty lame and travelstained to claim at last his rightful inheritance at the enterprise office he was welcomed and in a brief time entered into his own goodman the proprietor himself a man of great ability had surrounded himself with a group of gayhearted fellows whose fresh wild way of writing delighted the comstock pioneers far more than any sober presentation of mere news samuel clemens fitted exactly into this group by the end of the year he had become a leader of it when he asked to be allowed to report the coming carson legislature goodman consented realizing that while clemens knew nothing of parliamentary procedure he would at least make the letters picturesque it was in the midst of this work that he adopted the name which he was to make famous throughout the world the story of its adoption has been fully told elsewhere and need not be repeated here see mark twain a biography by the same author chapter xl mark twain was first signed to a carson letter february and from that time was attached to all of samuel clemenss work the letters had already been widely copied and the name now which gave them personality quickly obtained vogue it was attached to himself as well as to the letters heretofore he had been called sam or clemens now he became almost universally mark twain and mark this early period of mark twains journalism is full of delicious history but we are permitted here to retell only such of it as will supply connection to the infrequent letters he wrote home briefly in february but the letter contained nothing worth preserving then two months later he gives us at least a hint of his employment to mrs jane clemens and mrs moffett in st louis virginia april my dear mother and sister it is very late at night and i am writing in my room which is not quite as large or as nice as the one i had at home my board washing and lodging cost me seventyfive dollars a month i have just received your letter ma from carson the one in which you doubt my veracity about the statements i made in a letter to you thats right i dont recollect what the statements were but i suppose they were mining statistics i have just finished writing up my report for the morning paper and giving the unreliable a column of advice about how to conduct himself in church and now i will tell you a few more lies while my hand is in for instance some of the boys made me a present of fifty feet in the east india g and s m company ten days ago i was offered ninetyfive dollars a foot for it yesterday in gold i refused it not because i think the claim is worth a cent for i dont but because i had a curiosity to see how high it would go before people find out how worthless it is besides what if one mining claim does fool me i have got plenty more i am not in a particular hurry to get rich i suppose i couldnt well help getting rich here some time or other whether i wanted to or not you folks do not believe in nevada and i am glad you dont just keep on thinking so i was at the gould and curry mine the other day and they had two or three tons of choice rock piled up which was valued at a ton i gathered up a hatfull of chunks on account of their beauty as specimens they dont let everybody supply themselves so liberally i send mr moffett a little specimen of it for his cabinet if you dont know what the white stuff on it is i must inform you that it is purer silver than the minted coin there is about as much gold in it as there is silver but it is not visible i will explain to you some day how to detect it pamela you wouldnt do for a local reporter because you dont appreciate the interest that attaches to names an item is of no use unless it speaks of some person and not then unless that persons name is distinctly mentioned the most interesting letter one can write to an absent friend is one that treats of persons he has been acquainted with rather than the public events of the day now you speak of a young lady who wrote to hollie benson that she had seen me and you didnt mention her name it was just a mere chance that i ever guessed who she was but i did finally though i dont remember her name now i was introduced to her in san francisco by hon a b paul and saw her afterwards in gold hill they were a very pleasant lot of girls she and her sisters p s i have just heard five pistol shots down street as such things are in my line i will go and see about it p s no am the pistol did its work well one man a jackson county missourian shot two of my friends police officers through the heart both died within three minutes murderers name is john campbell the unreliable of this letter was a rival reporter on whom mark twain had conferred this name during the legislative session his real name was rice and he had undertaken to criticize clemenss reports the brisk reply that rices letters concealed with a show of parliamentary knowledge a festering mass of misstatements the author of whom should be properly termed the unreliable fixed that name upon him for life this burlesque warfare delighted the frontier and it did not interfere with friendship clemens and rice were constant associates though continually firing squibs at each other in their respective papers a form of personal journalism much in vogue on the comstock in the next letter we find these two journalistic blades enjoying themselves together in the coast metropolis this letter is labeled no meaning probably the second from san francisco but no has disappeared and even no is incomplete to mrs jane clemens and mrs moffett in st louis no enclosed lick house s f june my dear mother and sister the unreliable and myself are still here and still enjoying ourselves i suppose i know at least a thousand people here a great many of them citizens of san francisco but the majority belonging in washoe and when i go down montgomery street shaking hands with tom dick and harry it is just like being in main street in hannibal and meeting the old familiar faces i do hate to go back to washoe we fag ourselves completely out every day and go to sleep without rocking every night we dine out and we lunch out and we eat drink and are happy as it were after breakfast i dont often see the hotel again until midnight or after i am going to the dickens mighty fast i know a regular village of families here in the house but i never have time to call on them thunder well know a little more about this town before we leave than some of the people who live in it we take trips across the bay to oakland and down to san leandro and alameda and those places and we go out to the willows and hayes park and fort point and up to benicia and yesterday we were invited out on a yachting excursion and had a sail in the fastest yacht on the pacific coast rice says oh no we are not having any fun mark oh no i reckon not its somebody else its probably the gentleman in the wagon popular slang phrase when i invite rice to the lick house to dinner the proprietors send us champagne and claret and then we do put on the most disgusting airs rice says our calibre is too light we cant stand it to be noticed i rode down with a gentleman to the ocean house the other day to see the sea horses and also to listen to the roar of the surf and watch the ships drifting about here and there and far away at sea when i stood on the beach and let the surf wet my feet i recollected doing the same thing on the shores of the atlantic and then i had a proper appreciation of the vastness of this country for i had traveled from ocean to ocean across it remainder missing not far from virginia city there are some warm springs that constantly send up jets of steam through fissures in the mountainside the place was a health resort and clemens always subject to bronchial colds now and again retired there for a cure a letter written in the late summer a gay youthful document belongs to one of these periods of convalescence to mrs jane clemens and mrs moffett in st louis no enclosed steamboat springs august my dear mother and sister ma you have given my vanity a deadly thrust behold i am prone to boast of having the widest reputation as a local editor of any man on the pacific coast and you gravely come forward and tell me if i work hard and attend closely to my business i may aspire to a place on a big san francisco daily some day theres a comment on human vanity for you why blast it i was under the impression that i could get such a situation as that any time i asked for it but i dont want it no paper in the united states can afford to pay me what my place on the enterprise is worth if i were not naturally a lazy idle goodfornothing vagabond i could make it pay me a year but i dont suppose i shall ever be any account i lead an easy life though and i dont care a cent whether school keeps or not everybody knows me and i fare like a prince wherever i go be it on this side of the mountains or the other and i am proud to say i am the most conceited ass in the territory you think that picture looks old well i cant help it in reality i am not as old as i was when i was eighteen i took a desperate cold more than a week ago and i seduced wilson a missouri boy reporter of the daily union from his labors and we went over to lake bigler but i failed to cure my cold i found the lake house crowded with the wealth and fashion of virginia and i could not resist the temptation to take a hand in all the fun going those virginians men and women both are a stirring set and i found if i went with them on all their eternal excursions i should bring the consumption home with me so i left day before yesterday and came back into the territory again a lot of them had purchased a site for a town on the lake shore and they gave me a lot when you come out ill build you a house on it the lake seems more supernaturally beautiful now than ever it is the masterpiece of the creation the hotel here at the springs is not so much crowded as usual and i am having a very comfortable time of it the hot white steam puffs up out of fissures in the earth like the jets that come from a steamboats scape pipes and it makes a boiling surging noise like a steamboat toohence the name we put eggs in a handkerchief and dip them in the springs they soft boil in minutes and boil as hard as a rock in minutes these fissures extend more than a quarter of a mile and the long line of steam columns looks very pretty a large bath house is built over one of the springs and we go in it and steam ourselves as long as we can stand it and then come out and take a cold shower bath you get baths board and lodging all for a week cheaper than living in virginia without baths yrs aft mark it was now the autumn of mark twain was twentyeight years old on the coast he had established a reputation as a gaily original newspaper writer thus far however he had absolutely no literary standing nor is there any evidence that he had literary ambitions his work was unformed uncultivated all of which seems strange now when we realize that somewhere behind lay the substance of immortality rudyard kipling at twentyeight had done his greatest work even joseph goodman who had a fine literary perception and a deep knowledge of men intimately associated with mark twain as he was received at this time no hint of his greater powers another man on the staff of the enterprise william wright who called himself dan de quille a graceful humorist gave far more promise goodman thought of future distinction it was artemus ward who first suspected the value of mark twains gifts and urged him to some more important use of them artemus in the course of a transcontinental lecture tour stopped in virginia city and naturally found congenial society on the enterprise staff he had intended remaining but a few days but lingered three weeks a period of continuous celebration closing only with the holiday season during one night of final festivities ward slipped away and gave a performance on his own account his letter to mark twain from austin nevada written a day or two later is most characteristic artemus wards letter to mark twain austin jan my dearest love i arrived here yesterday am at oclock it is a wild untamable place full of lionhearted boys i speak tonight see small bills why did you not go with me and save me that night i mean the night i left you after that dinner party i went and got drunker beating i may say alexander the great in his most drinkinist days and i blackened my face at the melodeon and made a gibbering idiotic speech goddam it i suppose the union will have it but let it go i shall always remember virginia as a bright spot in my existence as all others must or rather cannot be as it were love to jo goodman and dan i shall write soon a powerfully convincing note to my friends of the mercury your notice by the way did much good here as it doubtlessly will elsewhere the miscreants of the union will be batted in the snout if they ever dare pollute this rapidly rising city with their loathsome presence some of the finest intellects in the world have been blunted by liquor do not sir do not flatter yourself that you are the only chastelyhumorous writer onto the pacific slopes goodbye old boy and god bless you the matter of which i spoke to you so earnestly shall be just as earnestly attended to and again with very many warm regards for jo and dan and regards to many of the good friends we met i am faithfully gratefully yours artemus ward the union which ward mentions was the rival virginia city paper the mercury was the new york sunday mercury to which he had urged mark twain to contribute ward wrote a second letter after a siege of illness at salt lake city he was a frail creature and three years later in london died of consumption his genius and encouragement undoubtedly exerted an influence upon mark twain wards second letter here follows artemus ward to s l clemens salt lake city jan my dear mark i have been dangerously ill for the past two weeks here of congestive fever very grave fears were for a time entertained of my recovery but happily the malady is gone though leaving me very very weak i hope to be able to resume my journey in a week or so i think i shall speak in the theater here which is one of the finest establishments of the kind in america the saints have been wonderfully kind to me i could not have been better or more tenderly nursed at home god bless them i am still exceedingly weak cant write any more love to jo and dan and all the rest write me at st louis always yours artemus ward if one could only have mark twains letters in reply to these but they have vanished and are probably long since dust a letter which he wrote to his mother assures us that he undertook to follow wards advice he was not ready however for serious literary effort the article sent to the mercury was distinctly of the comstock variety it was accepted but it apparently made no impression and he did not follow it up for one thing he was just then too busy reporting the legislature at carson city and responding to social demands from having been a scarcely considered unit during the early days of his arrival in carson mark twain had attained a high degree of importance in the little nevada capital in the legislature he was a power as correspondent for the enterprise he was feared and respected as well as admired his humor his satire and his fearlessness were dreaded weapons also he was of extraordinary popularity orions wife with her little daughter jennie had come out from the states the governor of nevada had no household in carson city and was generally absent orion clemens reigned in his stead and indeed was usually addressed as governor clemens his home became the social center of the capital and his brilliant brother its chief ornament from the roughest of miners of a year before he had become once more almost a dandy in dress and no occasion was complete without him when the two houses of the legislature assembled in january a burlesque third house was organized and proposed to hold a session as a church benefit after very brief consideration it was decided to select mark twain to preside at this third house assembly under the title of governor and a letter of invitation was addressed to him his reply to it follows to s pixley and g a sears trustees carson city january gentlemen certainly if the public can find anything in a grave state paper worth paying a dollar for i am willing that they should pay that amount or any other and although i am not a very dusty christian myself i take an absorbing interest in religious affairs and would willingly inflict my annual message upon the church itself if it might derive benefit thereby you can charge what you please i promise the public no amusement but i do promise a reasonable amount of instruction i am responsible to the third house only and i hope to be permitted to make it exceedingly warm for that body without caring whether the sympathies of the public and the church be enlisted in their favor and against myself or not respectfully mark twain there is a quality in this letter more suggestive of the later mark twain than anything that has preceded it his third house address unfortunately has not been preserved but those who heard it regarded it as a classic it probably abounded in humor of the frontier sortunsparing ridicule of the governor the legislature and individual citizens it was all taken in good part of course and as a recognition of his success he received a gold watch with the case properly inscribed to the governor of the third house this was really his first public appearance in a field in which he was destined to achieve very great fame v letters san francisco and hawaii life on the comstock came to an end for mark twain in may it was the time of the flour sack sanitary fund the story of which he has told in roughing it he does not however refer to the troubles which this special fund brought upon himself coming into the enterprise office one night after a gay day of fund celebration clemens wrote for next days paper a paragraph intended to be merely playful but which proved highly offending to certain ladies concerned with the floursack enterprise no files of the paper exist today so we cannot judge of the quality of humor that stirred up trouble the trouble however was genuine enough virginias rival paper seized upon the chance to humiliate its enemy and presently words were passed back and forth until nothing was left to write but a challenge the story of this duel which did not come off has been quite fully told elsewhere both by mark twain and the present writer but the following letter a revelation of his inner feelings in the matter of his offense has never before been published to mrs cutler in carson city virginia may rd mrs w k cutler madam i address a lady in every sense of the term mrs clemens has informed me of everything that has occurred in carson in connection with that unfortunate item of mine about the sanitary funds accruing from the ball and from what i can understand you are almost the only lady in your city who has understood the circumstances under which my fault was committed or who has shown any disposition to be lenient with me had the note of the ladies been properly worded i would have published an ample apology instantly and possibly i might even have done so anyhow had that note arrived at any other time but it came at a moment when i was in the midst of what ought to have been a deadly quarrel with the publishers of the union and i could not come out and make public apologies to any one at such a time it is bad policy to do it even now as challenges have already passed between myself and a proprietor of the union and the matter is still in abeyance but i suppose i had better say a word or two to show the ladies that i did not wilfully and maliciously do them a wrong but my chief object mrs cutler in writing you this note and you will pardon the liberty i have taken was to thank you very kindly and sincerely for the consideration you have shown me in this matter and for your continued friendship for mollie while others are disposed to withdraw theirs on account of a fault for which i alone am responsible very truly yours sam l clemens the matter did not end with the failure of the duel a very strict law had just been passed making it a felony even to send or accept a challenge clemens on the whole rather tired of virginia city and carson thought it a good time to go across the mountains to san francisco with steve gillis a printer of whom he was very fond an inveterate joker who had been more than half responsible for the proposed duel and was to have served as his second he took the stage one morning and in due time was in the california metropolis at work on the morning call clemens had been several times in san francisco and loved the place we have no letter of that summer the first being dated several months after his arrival he was still working on the call when it was written and contributing literary articles to the californian of which bret harte unknown to fame was editor harte had his office just above the rooms of the call and he and clemens were good friends san francisco had a real literary group that for a time at least centered around the offices of the golden era in a letter that follows clemens would seem to have scorned this publication but he was a frequent contributor to it at one period joaquin miller was of this band of literary pioneers also prentice mulford charles warren stoddard fitzhugh ludlow and orpheus c kerr to mrs jane clemens and mrs moffett in st louis sept my dear mother and sister you can see by my picture that this superb climate agrees with me and it ought after living where i was never out of sight of snow peaks twentyfour hours during three years here we have neither snow nor cold weather fires are never lighted and yet summer clothes are never worn you wear spring clothing the year round steve gillis who has been my comrade for two years and who came down here with me is to be married in a week or two to a very pretty girl worth in her own right and then i shall be alone again until they build a house which they will do shortly we have been here only four months yet we have changed our lodgings five times and our hotel twice we are very comfortably fixed where we are now and have no fault to find with the rooms or with the people we are the only lodgers in a welltodo private family with one grown daughter and a piano in the parlor adjoining our room but i need a change and must move again i have taken rooms further down the street i shall stay in this little quiet street because it is full of gardens and shrubbery and there are none but dwelling houses in it i am taking life easy now and i mean to keep it up for awhile i dont work at night any more i told the call folks to pay me a week and let me work only in daylight so i get up at ten every morning and quit work at five or six in the afternoon you ask if i work for greenbacks hardly what do you suppose i could do with greenbacks here i have engaged to write for the new literary paper the californian same pay i used to receive on the golden era one article a week fifty dollars a month i quit the era long ago it wasnt hightoned enough the californian circulates among the highest class of the community and is the best weekly literary paper in the united states and i suppose i ought to know i work as i always did by fits and starts i wrote two articles last night for the californian so that lets me out for two weeks that would be about seventyfive dollars in greenbacks wouldnt it been down to san jose generally pronounced sannozay emphasis on last syllable today fifty miles from here by railroad town of inhabitants buried in flowers and shrubbery the climate is finer than ours here because it is not so close to the ocean and is protected from the winds by the coast range i had an invitation today to go down on an excursion to san luis obispo and from thence to the city of mexico to be gone six or eight weeks or possibly longer but i could not accept on account of my contract to act as chief mourner or groomsman at steves wedding i have triumphed they refused me and other reporters some information at a branch of the coroners office masseys undertaker establishment a few weeks ago i published the wickedest article on them i ever wrote in my life and you can rest assured we got all the information we wanted after that by the new census san francisco has a population of they dont count the hordes of chinamen yrs aftly sam i send a picture for annie and one for aunt ella that is if she will have it relations with the call ceased before the end of the year though not in the manner described in roughing it mark twain loved to make fiction of his mishaps and to show himself always in a bad light as a matter of fact he left the call with great willingness and began immediately contributing a daily letter to the enterprise which brought him a satisfactory financial return in the biographical sketch with which this volume opens and more extendedly elsewhere has been told the story of the trouble growing out of the enterprise letters and of mark twains sojourn with james gillis in the tuolumne hills also how in the frowsy hotel at angels camp he heard the frog anecdote that would become the cornerstone of his fame there are no letters of this period only some notebook entries it is probable that he did not write home believing no doubt that he had very little to say for more than a year there is not a line that has survived yet it had been an important year the jumping frog story published in new york had been reprinted east and west and laughed over in at least a million homes fame had not come to him but it was on the way yet his outlook seems not to have been a hopeful one to mrs jane clemens and mrs moffett in st louis san francisco jan my dear mother and sister i do not know what to write my life is so uneventful i wish i was back there piloting up and down the river again verily all is vanity and little worth save piloting to think that after writing many an article a man might be excused for thinking tolerably good those new york people should single out a villainous backwoods sketch to compliment me on jim smiley and his jumping frog a squib which would never have been written but to please artemus ward and then it reached new york too late to appear in his book but no matter his book was a wretchedly poor one generally speaking and it could be no credit to either of us to appear between its covers this paragraph is from the new york correspondence of the san francisco alta clipping pasted in mark twains story in the saturday press of november th called jim smiley and his jumping frog has set all new york in a roar and he may be said to have made his mark i have been asked fifty times about it and its author and the papers are copying it far and near it is voted the best thing of the day cannot the californian afford to keep mark all to itself it should not let him scintillate so widely without first being filtered through the california press the new york publishing house of carleton co gave the sketch to the saturday press when they found it was too late for the book though i am generally placed at the head of my breed of scribblers in this part of the country the place properly belongs to bret harte i think though he denies it along with the rest he wants me to club a lot of old sketches together with a lot of his and publish a book i wouldnt do it only he agrees to take all the trouble but i want to know whether we are going to make anything out of it first however he has written to a new york publisher and if we are offered a bargain that will pay for a months labor we will go to work and prepare the volume for the press yours affy sam bret harte and clemens had by this time quit the californian expecting to contribute to eastern periodicals clemens however was not yet through with coast journalism there was much interest just at this time in the sandwich islands and he was selected by the foremost sacramento paper to spy out the islands and report aspects and conditions there his letters home were still infrequent but this was something worth writing to mrs jane clemens and mrs moffett in st louis san francisco march th my dear mother and sister i start to do sandwich islands day after tomorrow i suppose annie is geographer enough by this time to find them on the map in the steamer ajax we shall arrive there in about twelve days my friends seem determined that i shall not lack acquaintances for i only decided today to go and they have already sent me letters of introduction to everybody down there worth knowing i am to remain there a month and ransack the islands the great cataracts and the volcanoes completely and write twenty or thirty letters to the sacramento union for which they pay me as much money as i would get if i staid at home if i come back here i expect to start straight across the continent by way of the columbia river the pend doreille lakes through montana and down the missouri river only miles of land travel from san francisco to new orleans goodbye for the present yours sam his home letters from the islands are numerous enough everything there being so new and so delightful that he found joy in telling of it also he was still young enough to air his triumphs a little especially when he has dined with the grand chamberlain and is going to visit the king the languorous life of the islands exactly suited mask twain all his life he remembered them always planning to return some day to stay there until he died in one of his notebooks he wrote went with mr dam to his cool vineshaded home no careworn or eager anxious faces in this land of happy contentment god what a contrast with california and the washoe and again oh islands there are on the face of the deep where the leaves never fade and the skies never weep the letters tell the story of his sojourn which stretched itself into nearly five months to mrs jane clemens and mrs moffett in st louis honolulu sandwich islands april my dear mother and sister i have been here two or three weeks and like the beautiful tropical climate better and better i have ridden on horseback all over this island oahu in the meantime and have visited all the ancient battlefields and other places of interest i have got a lot of human bones which i took from one of these battlefields i guess i will bring you some of them i went with the american minister and took dinner this evening with the kings grand chamberlain who is related to the royal family and although darker than a mulatto he has an excellent english education and in manners is an accomplished gentleman the dinner was as ceremonious as any i ever attended in california five regular courses and five kinds of wine and one of brandy he is to call for me in the morning with his carriage and we will visit the king at the palace both are good masons the king is a royal arch mason after dinner tonight they called in the singing girls and we had some beautiful music sung in the native tongue

shine i stumbled and fell over my horses lariat a minute ago and hurt my leg so i must stay here tonight i got the same leg hurt last week i said i hadnt got hold of a spirited horse since i had been on the island and one of the proprietors loaned me a big vicious colt he was altogether too spirited i went to tighten the cinch before mounting him when he let out with his left leg and kicked me across a tenacre lot a native rubbed and doctored me so well that i was able to stand on my feet in half an hour it was then half after four and i had an appointment to go seven miles and get a girl and take her to a card party at five i have been clattering around among the plantations for three weeks now and next week i am going to visit the extinct crater of mount haleakala the largest in the world it is ten miles to the foot of the mountain it rises feet above the valley the crater is miles in circumference and feet deep seen from the summit the city of st louis would look like a picture in the bottom of it as soon as i get back from haleakala pronounced hallyekkalah i will sail for honolulu again and thence to the island of hawaii pronounced hahwyye to see the greatest active volcano in the world that of kilauea pronounced keelowwayah and from thence back to san francisco and then doubtless to the states i have been on this trip two months and it will probably be two more before i get back to california yrs affy sam he was having a glorious time one of the most happy carefree adventures of his career no form of travel or undertaking could discountenance mark twain at thirty to

the sugar plantations looking up the splendid scenery and visiting the lofty crater of haleakala it has been a perfect jubilee to me in the way of pleasure i have not written a single line and have not once thought of business or care or human toil or trouble or sorrow or weariness few such months come in a lifetime i set sail again a week hence for the island of hawaii to see the great active volcano of kilauea i shall not get back here for four or five weeks and shall not reach san francisco before the latter part of july so it is no use to wait for me to go home go on yourselves if i were in the east now i could stop the publication of a piratical book which has stolen some of my sketches it is lategoodbye mollie yr bro sam to mrs jane clemens and mrs moffett in st louis honolulu sandwich islands june my dear mother and sister i have just got back from a hard trip through the island of hawaii begun on the th of may and finished on the th of june only six or seven days at sea all the balance horseback and the hardest mountain road in the world i staid at the volcano about a week and witnessed the greatest eruption that has occurred for years i lived well there they charge a day for board and a dollar or two extra for guides and horses i had a pretty good time they didnt charge me anything i have got back sick went to bed as soon as i arrived here shall not be strong again for several days yet i rushed too fast i ought to have taken five or six weeks on that trip a week hence i start for the island of kauai to be gone three weeks and then i go back to california the crown princess is dead and thousands of natives cry and wail and dance and dance for the dead around the kings palace all night and every night they will keep it up for a month and then she will be buried hon anson burlingame u s minister to china and gen van valkenburgh minister to japan with their families and suites have just arrived here en route they were going to do me the honor to call on me this morning and that accounts for my being out of bed now you know what condition my room is always in when you are not around so i climbed out of bed and dressed and shaved pretty quick and went up to the residence of the american minister and called on them mr burlingame told me a good deal about hon jere clemens and that virginia clemens who was wounded in a duel he was in congress years with both of them mr b sent for his son to introduce him said he could tell that frog story of mine as well as anybody i told him i was glad to hear it for i never tried to tell it myself without making a botch of it at his request i have loaned mr burlingame pretty much everything i ever wrote i guess he will be an almighty wise man by the time he wades through that lot if the new united states minister to the sandwich islands hon edwin mccook were only here now so that i could get his views on this new condition of sandwich island politics i would sail for california at once but he will not arrive for two weeks yet and so i am going to spend that interval on the island of kauai i stopped three days with hon mr cony deputy marshal of the kingdom at hilo hawaii last week and by a funny circumstance he knew everybody that i ever knew in hannibal and palmyra we used to sit up all night talking and then sleep all day he lives like a prince confound that island i had a streak of fat and a streak of lean all over it got lost several times and had to sleep in huts with the natives and live like a dog of course i couldnt speak fifty words of the language take it altogether though it was a mighty hard trip yours affect sam burlingame and van valkenburgh were on their way to their posts and their coming to the islands just at this time proved a most important circumstance to mark twain we shall come to this presently in a summary of the newspaper letters written to the union june th he wrote to his mother and sister a letter only a fragment of which survives in which he tells of the arrival in honolulu of the survivors of the ship hornet burned on the line and of his securing the first news report of the lost vessel part of a letter to mrs jane clemens and mrs moffett in st louis honolulu june with a gill of water a day to each man i got the whole story from the third mate and two of the sailors if my account gets to the sacramento union first it will be published first all over the united states france england russia and germany all over the world i may say you will see it mr burlingame went with me all the time and helped me question the men throwing away invitations to dinner with the princes and foreign dignitaries and neglecting all sorts of things to accommodate me you know how i appreciate that kind of thing especially from such a man who is acknowledged to have no superior in the diplomatic circles of the world and obtained from china concessions in favor of america which were refused to sir frederick bruce and envoys of france and russia until procured for them by burlingame himself which service was duly acknowledged by those dignitaries he hunted me up as soon as he came here and has done me a hundred favors since and says if i will come to china in the first trip of the great mail steamer next january and make his house in pekin my home he will afford me facilities that few men can have there for seeing and learning he will give me letters to the chiefs of the great mail steamship company which will be of service to me in this matter i expect to do all this but i expect to go to the states first and from china to the paris worlds fair dont show this letter yours affly sam p s the crown princess of this kingdom will be buried tomorrow with great ceremony after that i sail in two weeks for california this concludes mark twains personal letters from the islands of his descriptive news letters there were about twenty and they were regarded by the readers of the union as distinctly notable rereading those old letters today it is not altogether easy to understand why they were set in fine nonpareil type for one thing which presentday eyes simply refuse at any price and the reward by presentday standards is not especially tempting the letters began in the union with the issue of april the th the first of date march th tells of the writers arrival at honolulu the humor in it is not always of a high order it would hardly pass for humor today at all that the same man who wrote the hawaiian letters in he was then over thirty years old could two years later have written that marvelous book the innocents abroad is a phenomenon in literary development the hawaiian letters however do show the transition stage between the rough elemental humor of the comstock and the refined and subtle style which flowered in the innocents abroad certainly mark twains genius was finding itself and his association with the refined and cultured personality of anson burlingame undoubtedly aided in that discovery burlingame pointed out his faults to him and directed him to a better way no more than that was needed at such a time to bring about a transformation the sandwich islands letters however must have been precisely adapted to their audience a little more refined than the log comstock a little less subtle than the atlantic public and they added materially to his coast prestige but let us consider a sample extract from the first sandwich islands letter our little band of passengers were as well and thoughtfully cared for by the friends they left weeping upon the wharf as ever were any similar body of pilgrims the traveling outfit conferred upon me began with a naval uniform continued with a case of wine a small assortment of medicinal liquors and brandy several boxes of cigars a bunch of matches a finetoothed comb and a cake of soap and ended with a pair of socks n b i gave the soap to brown who bit into it and then shook his head and said that as a general thing he liked to prospect curious foreign dishes and find out what they were made of but he couldnt go that and threw it overboard it is nearly impossible to imagine humor in this extract yet it is a fair sample of the entire letter he improves in his next at least in description and gives us a picture of the crater in this letter also he writes well and seriously in a prophetic strain of the great trade that is to be established between san francisco and hawaii and argues for a line of steamers between the ports in order that the islands might be populated by americans by which course european trade in that direction could be superseded but the humor in this letter such as it is would scarcely provoke a smile today as the letters continue he still urges the fostering of the island trade by the united states finds himself impressed by the work of the missionaries who have converted cannibals to christians and gives picturesque bits of the life and scenery hawaii was then dominated chiefly by french and english though the american interests were by no means small extract from letter no cap fitch said theres the king thats him in the buggy i know him as far as i can see him i had never seen a king and i naturally took out a notebook and put him down tall slender dark fullbearded green frockcoat with lapels and collar bordered with gold band an inch wide plug hat broad gold band around it royal costume looks too much like livery this man is not as fleshy as i thought he was i had just got these notes when cap fitch discovered that hed got hold of the wrong king or rather that hed got hold of the kings driver or a carriage driver of one of the nobility the king wasnt present at all it was a great disappointment to me i heard afterwards that the comfortable easygoing king kamehameha v had been seen sitting on a barrel on the wharf the day before fishing but there was no consolation in that that did not restore me my lost king this has something of the flavor of the man we were to know later the quaint gentle resignation to disappointment which is one of the finest touches in his humor further on he says i had not shaved since i left san francisco as soon as i got ashore i hunted up a striped pole and shortly found one i always had a yearning to be a king this may never be i suppose but at any rate it will always be a satisfaction to me to know that if i am not a king i am the next thing to it i have been shaved by the kings barber honolulu was a place of cats he saw cats of every shade and variety he says i saw cats tomcats maryann cats bobtailed cats blind cats oneeyed cats walleyed cats crosseyed cats gray cats black cats white cats yellow cats striped cats spotted cats tame cats wild cats singed cats individual cats groups of cats platoons of cats companies of cats armies of cats multitudes of cats millions of cats and all of them sleek fat and lazy and sound asleep which illustrates another characteristic of the humor we were to know later the humor of grotesque exaggeration in which he was always strong he found the islands during his periods of inaction conducive to indolence if i were not so fond of looking into the rich mass of green leaves he says that swathe the stately tamarind right before my door i would idle less and write more i think the union made good use of his letters sometimes it printed them on the front page evidently they were popular from the beginning the union was a fine handsome paper beautiful in its minute typography and in its presswork more beautiful than most papers of today with their machineset type their vulgar illustrations and their chainlightning presses a few more extracts the only cigars here are those trifling insipid tasteless flavorless things they call manilas ten for twentyfive cents and it would take a thousand of them to be worth half the money after you have smoked about thirtyfive dollars worth of them in the forenoon you feel nothing but a desperate yearning to go out somewhere and take a smoke captains and ministers form about half the population the third fourth is composed of kanakas and mercantile foreigners and their families the final fourth is made up of high officers of the hawaiian government and there are just about enough cats to go round in no april the d he says an excursion to diamond head and the kings cocoanut grove was planned today at p m the party to consist of half a dozen gentlemen and three ladies they all started at the appointed hour except myself somebody remarked that it was twenty minutes past five oclock and that woke me up it was a fortunate circumstance that cap phillips was there with his turnout as he calls his top buggy that cap cook brought here in and a horse that was here when cap cook came this bit has something the savor of his subsequent work but as a rule the humor compares poorly with that which was to come later in no he speaks of the natives singing american songs not always to his comfort marching through georgia was one of their favorite airs he says if it had been all the same to gen sherman i wish he had gone around by the way of the gulf of mexico instead of marching through georgia letters nos and were not of special importance in no he gives some advice to san francisco as to the treatment of whalers he says if i were going to advise san francisco as to the best strategy to employ in order to secure the whaling trade i should say cripple your facilities for pulling sea captains on any pretence that sailors can trump up and show the whaler a little more consideration when he is in port in no may th he tells of a trip to the kalehi valley and through historic points at one place he looked from a precipice over which old kamehameha i drove the army of oahu threequarters of a century before the vegetation and glory of the tropics attracted him in one open spot a vine of a species unknown had taken possession of two tall dead stumps and wound around and about them and swung out from their tops and twined their meeting tendrils together into a faultless arch man with all his art could not improve upon its symmetry he saw sam brannans palace the bungalow built by one shillaber of san francisco at a cost of from thirty to forty thousand dollars in its day it had outshone its regal neighbor the palace of the king but had fallen to decay after passing into brannans hands and had become a picturesque theban ruin by the time of mark twains visit in no june th written may d he tells of the hawaiian legislature and of his trip to the island of maui where as he says he never spent so pleasant a month before or bade any place goodby so regretfully in no he continues the legislature and gives this picture of minister harris he is six feet high bony and rather slender long ungainly arms stands so straight he leans back a little has small side whiskers his head long up and down he has no command of language or ideas oratory all show and pretence a big washing and a small hangout weak insipid and a damn fool in general in no june d published july th he tells of the death and burial ceremonies of the princess victoria k k and what was to be of more importance to him of the arrival of anson burlingame u s minister to china and gen van valkenburgh u s minister to japan they were to stay ten or fourteen days he said but an effort would be made to have them stay over july th speaking of burlingame burlingame is a man who could be esteemed respected and popular anywhere no matter whether he was among christians or cannibals then in the same letter comes the great incident a letter arrived here yesterday giving a meagre account of the arrival on the island of hawaii of nineteen poor starving wretches who had been buffeting a stormy sea in an open boat for fortythree days their ship the hornet from new york with a quantity of kerosene on board had taken fire and burned in lat d north and long d west when they had been entirely out of provisions for a day or two and the cravings of hunger become insufferable they yielded to the shipwrecked mariners fearful and awful alternative and solemnly drew lots to determine who of their number should die to furnish food for his comrades and then the morning mists lifted and they saw land they are being cared for at sanpahoe not yet corroborated the hornet disaster was fully told in his letter of june th the survivors were brought to honolulu and with the assistance of the burlingame party clemens laid up with saddle boils was carried on a stretcher to the hospital where aided by burlingame he interviewed the shipwrecked men securing material for the most important piece of serious writing he had thus far performed letter no to the union of date june th occupied the most of the first page in the issue of july it was a detailed account of the sufferings of officers and crew as given by the third officer and members of the crew from letter no in the postscript of a letter which i wrote two or three days ago and sent by the ship live yankee i gave you the substance of a letter received here from hilo by walker allen and co informing them that a boat containing fifteen men in a helpless and starving condition had drifted ashore at sanpahoe island of hawaii and that they had belonged to the clipper ship hornet cap mitchell master had been afloat since the burning of that vessel about one hundred miles north of the equator on the third of may fortythree days the third mate and ten of the seamen have arrived here and are now in the hospital cap mitchell one seaman named antonio passene and two passengers samuel and henry ferguson of new york city eighteen and twentyeight years are still at hilo but are expected here within the week in the captains modest epitome of the terrible romance you detect the fine old hero through it it reads like grant here follows the whole terrible narrative which has since been published in more substantial form and has been recognized as literature it occupied three and a half columns on the front page of the union and of course constituted a great beat for that paper a fact which they appreciated to the extent of one hundred dollars the column upon the writers return from the islands in letters nos and he gives further particulars of the month of mourning for the princess and funeral ceremonials he refers to burlingame who was still in the islands the remaining letters are unimportant the hawaiian episode in mark twains life was one of those spots that seemed to him always filled with sunlight from beginning to end it had been a long luminous dream in the next letter written on the homewardbound ship becalmed under a cloudless sky we realize the fitting end of the experience to mrs jane clemens and mrs moffett in st louis on board ship smyrniote at sea july dear mother and sister i write now because i must go hard at work as soon as i get to san francisco and then i shall have no time for other things though truth to say i have nothing now to write which will be calculated to interest you much we left the sandwich islands eight or ten days or twelve days ago i dont know which i have been so hard at work until today at least part of each day that the time has slipped away almost unnoticed the first few days we came at a whooping gait being in the latitude of the northeast trades but we soon ran out of them we used them as long as they lastedhundred of miles and came dead straight north until exactly abreast of san francisco precisely straight west of the city in a beeline but a long beeline as we were about two thousand miles at seaconsequently we are not a hundred yards nearer san francisco than you are and here we lie becalmed on a glassy sea we do not move an inchwe throw banana and orange peel overboard and it lies still on the water by the vessels side sometimes the ocean is as dead level as the mississippi river and glitters glassily as if polished but usually of course no matter how calm the weather is we roll and surge over the grand groundswell we amuse ourselves tying pieces of tin to the ships log and sinking them to see how far we can distinguish them under water feet was the deepest we could see a small piece of tin but a white plate would show about as far down as the steeple of dr bullards church would reach i guess the sea is very dark and blue here ever since we got becalmed five days i have been copying the diary of one of the young fergusons the two boys who starved and suffered with thirteen others in an open boat at sea for fortythree days lately after their ship the hornet was burned on the equator both these boys and captain mitchell are passengers with us i am copying the diary to publish in harpers magazine if i have time to fix it up properly when i get to san francisco i suppose from present appearances light winds and calms that we shall be two or three weeks at sea yet and i hope so i am in no hurry to go to work sunday morning aug this is rather slow we still drift drift drift along at intervals a spanking breeze and then drift again hardly move for half a day but i enjoy it we have such snowy moonlight and such gorgeous sunsets and the ship is so easy even in a gale she rolls very little compared to other vessels and in this calm we could dance on deck if we chose you can walk a crack so steady is she very different from the ajax my trunk used to get loose in the stateroom and rip and tear around the place as if it had life in it and i always had to take my clothes off in bed because i could not stand up and do it there is a ship in sight the first object we have seen since we left honolulu we are still or miles from land and so anything like this that varies the vast solitude of the ocean makes all hands lighthearted and cheerful we think the ship is the comet which left honolulu several hours before we did she is about twelve miles away and so we cannot see her hull but the sailors think it is the comet because of some peculiarity about her foretopgallant sails we have watched her all the forenoon afternoon we had preaching on the quarterdeck by rev mr rising of virginia city old friend of mine spread a flag on the boobyhatch which made a very good pulpit and then ranged the chairs on either side against the bulwarks last sunday we had the shadow of the mainsail but today we were on the opposite tack close hauled and had the sun i am leader of the choir on this ship and a sorry lead it is i hope they will have a better opinion of our music in heaven than i have down here if they dont a thunderbolt will come down and knock the vessel endways the other ship is the comet she is right abreast three miles away sailing on our course both of us in a dead calm with the glasses we can see what we take to be men and women on her decks i am well acquainted with nearly all her passengers and being so close seems right sociable monday i had just gone to bed a little after midnight when the d mate came and roused up the captain and said the comet has come round and is standing away on the other tack i went up immediately and so did all our passengers without waiting to dressmen women and children there was a perceptible breeze pretty soon the other ship swept down upon us with all her sails set and made a fine show in the luminous starlight she passed within a hundred yards of us so we could faintly see persons on her decks we had two minutes chat with each other through the medium of hoarse shouting and then she bore away to windward in the morning she was only a little black peg standing out of the glassy sea in the distant horizon an almost invisible mark in the bright sky dead calm so the ships have stood all day long have not moved yards aug the calm continues magnificent weather the gentlemen have all turned boys they play boyish games on the poop and quarterdeck for instance they lay a knife on the fiferail of the mainmast stand off three steps shut one eye walk up and strike at it with the forefinger seldom hit it also they lay a knife on the deck and walk seven or eight steps with eyes close shut and try to find it they kneel place elbows against knees extend hands in front along the deck place knife against end of fingers then clasp hands behind back and bend forward and try to pick up the knife with their teeth and rise up from knees without rolling over or losing their balance they tie a string to the shrouds stand with back against it walk three steps eyes shut turn around three times and go and put finger on the string only a military man can do it if you want to know how perfectly ridiculous a grown man looks performing such absurdities in the presence of ladies get one to try it afternoon the calm is no more there are three vessels in sight it is so sociable to have them hovering about us on this broad waste of water it is sunny and pleasant but blowing hard every rag about the ship is spread to the breeze and she is speeding over the sea like a bird there is a large brig right astern of us with all her canvas set and chasing us at her best she came up fast while the winds were light but now it is hard to tell whether she gains or not we can see the people on the forecastle with the glass the race is exciting i am sorry to know that we shall soon have to quit the vessel and go ashore if she keeps up this speed friday aug we have breezes and calms alternately the brig is two miles to three astern and just stays there we sail directly east this brings the brig with all her canvas set almost in the eye of the sun when it sets beautiful she looks sharply cut and black as a coal against a background of fire and in the midst of a sea of blood san francisco aug we never saw the comet again till the th in the morning three miles away at three oclock that afternoon days out from honolulu both ships entered the golden gate of san francisco side by side and yards apart there was a gale blowing and both vessels clapped on every stitch of canvas and swept up through the channel and past the fortresses at a magnificent gait i have been up to sacramento and squared accounts with the union they paid me a great deal more than they promised me yrs aff sam vi letters the lecturer success on the coast in new york the great ocean excursion it was august th when he reached san francisco and wrote in his notebook home again no not home again in prison again and all the wild sense of freedom gone city seems so cramped and so dreary with toil and care and business anxieties god help me i wish i were at sea again the transition from the dreamland of a becalmed sailingvessel to the dull cheerless realities of his old life and the uncertainties of his future depressed him filled him with forebodings at one moment he felt himself on the verge of suicide the world seemed so little worth while he wished to make a trip around the world a project that required money he contemplated making a book of his island letters and experiences and the acceptance by harpers magazine of the revised version of the hornet shipwreck story encouraged this thought friends urged him to embody in a lecture the picturesque aspect of hawaiian life the thought frightened him but it also appealed to him strongly he believed he could entertain an audience once he got started on the right track as governor of the third house at carson city he had kept the audience in hand men in whom he had the utmost confidence insisted that he follow up the lecture idea and engage the largest house in the city for his purpose the possibility of failure appalled him but he finally agreed to the plan in roughing it and elsewhere has been told the story of this venture the tale of its splendid success he was no longer concerned now as to his immediate future the lecture field was profitable his audience laughed and shouted he was learning the flavor of real success and exulting in it with dennis mccarthy formerly one of the partners in the enterprise as manager he made a tour of california and nevada to mrs jane clemens and others in st louis virginia city nov all the folks affectionate greeting you know the flush times are past and it has long been impossible to more than half fill the theatre here with any sort of attraction but they filled it for me night before last full dollar all over the house i was mighty dubious about carson but the enclosed call and some telegrams set that all right i lecture there tomorrow night they offer a full house and no expense in dayton go there next sandy baldwin says i have made the most sweeping success of any man he knows of i have lectured in san francisco sacramento marysville grass valley nevada you bet red dog and virginia i am going to talk in carson gold hill silver city dayton washoe san francisco again and again here if i have time to rehash the lecture then i am bound for new york lecture on the steamer maybe ill leave toward st december but ill telegraph you love to all yrs mark his lecture tour continued from october until december a period of picturesque incident the story of which has been recorded elsewhere see mark twain a biography by the same author it paid him well he could go home now without shame indeed from his next letter full of the boyish elation which always to his last years was the complement of his success we gather that he is going home with special honors introductions from ministers and the like to distinguished personages of the east to mrs jane clemens and family in st louis san f dec my dear folks i have written to annie and sammy and katie some time ago also to the balance of you i called on rev dr wadsworth last night with the city college man but he wasnt at home i was sorry because i wanted to make his acquaintance i am thick as thieves with the rev stebbings and i am laying for the rev scudder and the rev dr stone i am running on preachers now altogether i find them gay stebbings is a regular brick i am taking letters of introduction to henry ward beecher rev dr tyng and other eminent parsons in the east whenever anybody offers me a letter to a preacher now i snaffle it on the spot i shall make rev dr bellows trot out the fast nags of the cloth for me when i get to new york bellows is an able upright and eloquent man a man of imperial intellect and matchless power he is christian in the truest sense of the term and is unquestionably a brick gen drum has arrived in philadelphia and established his headquarters there as adjutant genl to maj gen meade col leonard has received a letter from him in which he offers me a complimentary benefit if i will come there i am much obliged really but i am afraid i shant lecture much in the states the china mail steamer is getting ready and everybody says i am throwing away a fortune in not going in her i firmly believe it myself i sail for the states in the opposition steamer of the th inst positively and without reserve my room is already secured for me and is the choicest in the ship i know all the officers yrs affy mark we get no hint of his plans and perhaps he had none if his purpose was to lecture in the east he was in no hurry to begin arriving in new york after an adventurous voyage he met a number of old californians men who believed in him and urged him to lecture he also received offers of newspaper engagements and from charles henry webb who had published the californian which bret harte had edited came the proposal to collect his published sketches including the jumping frog story in book form webb himself was in new york and offered the sketches to several publishers including canton who had once refused the frog story by omitting it from artemus wards book it seems curious that canton should make a second mistake and refuse it again but publishers were wary in those days and even the newspaper success of the frog story did not tempt him to venture it as the title tale of a book webb finally declared he would publish the book himself and clemens after a few weeks of new york joined his mother and family in st louis and gave himself up to a considerable period of visiting lecturing meantime in both hannibal and keokuk fate had great matters in preparation for him the quaker city mediterranean excursion the first great ocean picnic was announced that spring and mark twain realized that it offered a possible opportunity for him to see something of the world he wrote at once to the proprietors of the altacalifornia and proposed that they send him as their correspondent to his delight his proposition was accepted the alta agreeing to the twelve hundred dollars passage money and twenty dollars each for letters the quaker city was not to sail until the th of june but the alta wished some preliminary letters from new york furthermore webb had the frog book in press and would issue it may st clemens therefore returned to new york in april and now once more being urged by the californians to lecture he did not refuse frank fuller formerly governor of utah took the matter in hand and engaged cooper union for the venture he timed it for may th which would be a few days after the appearance of webbs book clemens was even more frightened at the prospect of this lecture than he had been in san francisco and with more reason for in new york his friends were not many and competition for public favor was very great there are two letters written may st one to his people and one to bret harte in san francisco that give us the situation
