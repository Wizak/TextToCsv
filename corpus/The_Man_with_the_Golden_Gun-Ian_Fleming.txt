 chapter one can i help you everyone thought that commander james bond one of the best agents in the british secret intelligence service was dead a year ago the head of the secret service who was a man known only by the initial m had chosen bond to go to japan on a highly important mission his task had been to gather secret information from the japanese about the soviet union but the job had gone badly wrong and bond had become involved in a dangerous battle with a known criminal called blofeld it was thought that bond had killed blofeld but no one knew what had happened to bond himself after the fight he had simply disappeared those who knew him at the secret service had now given up any hope that he could still be alive however bond was not dead he had been captured by the russians they had taken him to a secret medical institute in leningrad where the kgb began trying to brainwash him after many months of torture bond had grown weaker and weaker and could take no more the kgb had finally won their battle to control his mind a man called colonel boris had then spent several more months carefully preparing bond for his return to england he had told bond exactly how to behave what to wear and even which hotel to stay in he had also told him who to contact at the secret service headquarters and precisely how to answer their many questions james bond was sitting on his bed in the ritz hotel in london holding the telephone to his ear there was a moment of silence and then he heard a mans voice this is captain walker speaking can i help you bond spoke slowly and clearly this is commander james bond agent number please would you put me through to m or his secretary miss moneypenny captain walker was very surprised to hear what sounded like bonds voice he quickly pressed two buttons on the side of his phone the first button started a machine which would record the conversation the second sent a message to the special branch of the police who would listen to the conversation trace the call and immediately arrange for the caller to be followed then walker said im afraid i dont know those two names who exactly are these people m is admiral sir miles messervy james bond answered calmly his office is on the eighth floor he used to have a secretary called miss moneypenny i want to see him no im sorry walker responded apologetically i dont know either of them can you give me any more information well lets see what else i can tell you then said bond frowning its wednesday today that means meat pie will be the main dish on the menu in the canteen due to the brainwashing bond could not remember all these things himself he was using the detailed information that colonel boris had given him over the last few months captain walker thought for a moment could this man really be james bond there was always something strange about s death they had never found a body there was no solid evidence for his death perhaps he had escaped alive walker decided to send him to the security section of the secret service for further questioning im afraid i cant help you myself he told bond but try major townsend his office is at kensington cloisters ill call and make an appointment for you to see him today a short while later james bond left his hotel room stepped out into a cold clear november morning and got into a taxi his every move was now being carefully watched by special branch police officers and a black car followed close behind his taxi im here to see major townsend bond announced when he arrived at kensington cloisters yes hes expecting you sir confirmed the man who had opened the door please come in shall i take your raincoat the doorman put the coat on a hook near the entrance as soon as he was inside major townsends office bonds raincoat would be taken quickly upstairs to a laboratory there someone would test the material to find out where the coat had come from and if it really belonged to james bond and now as bond followed the man down a long corridor a hidden xray camera secretly took a picture of bond and what he was carrying in his pockets the man knocked on a door opened it and asked bond to go inside it was a pleasant very light room with expensive furniture a tall man with a friendly face stood up from a comfortable looking chair smiled and walked towards bond come in and sit down he said warmly would you like a cigarette im sorry these arent the ones i remember you prefer the man watched bond carefully and noted his reaction bond took a cigarette with a blank expression on his face and said nothing then both men sat down major townsend crossed his legs comfortably bond sat up straight well now how can i help you enquired townsend bond looked at major townsend colonel boriss description was very good the big friendly face the brown eyes the military moustache and the smart suit but he had not mentioned how very cold and intelligent the eyes were its really quite simple bond explained steadily i am who i say i am and i want to speak to m yes replied townsend but you havent been in contact with us for nearly a year we all thought you were dead so youll understand that we must make sure that you really are major townsend asked him several questions which bond answered fully and calmly then townsend said now please tell me where youve come from and where youve been all these months im sorry bond apologized but i can only tell that to m himself i see replied major townsend he thought for a few seconds and then went on well ill make a telephone call and see what i can do ill only be a few minutes he stood up and picked up a newspaper from a nearby table would you like to see todays times he asked and held out the paper bond took it from him his fingerprints were now on the specially treated newspaper which would be carefully examined later major townsend went to the next room closed the door quickly telephoned the laboratory and then telephoned bill tanner the chief of staff at the secret service headquarters yes sir he said a few moments later i think it must be hes wearing the same type of clothes he usually wears although everything looks very new the laboratory report says that his coat was bought yesterday in london he answered all the questions correctly but hes insisting that hell only talk to m about whats happened but i dont like it he has a strange look in his eyes i apologized for not being able to offer him his favourite type of cigarette but he didnt know what i was talking about and the xray camera showed that hes carrying a gun a strange sort of weapon we havent seen before personally i dont think m should see him alone although i think thats the only way well get him to talk to us when major townsend went back into the other room a few minutes later bond was still sitting stiffly in the same chair he was holding the newspaper but he had not opened it major townsend smiled well ive arranged everything he announced cheerfully m is extremely pleased to hear that you are all right and hell be free to see you in about half an hour a car should be here to collect you in about ten minutes and drive you there james bond smiled for the first time but it was a thin smile which did not light up his eyes chapter two the attack bill tanner the chief of staff at the secret service stood in front of ms desk i really dont think you should see him on your own sir he repeated firmly theres no doubt that its james weve matched the fingerprints but i dont like the feel of this at all why has he got new clothes and why did he check into the ritz and phone our main reception desk he could have just phoned me on my personal number or come straight here to see you it seems like a typical kgb brainwashing job to me m looked up at bill tanners tired worried face and smiled thank you he said quietly but i need to talk to myself when i sent him to japan i had no idea that what should have been a peaceful job was going to end so badly or that would go missing for a year hes quite right it was i who sent him on the mission and he has every right to report back to me personally ill see him but i want you to wait in the next room and listen in to the conversation and dont worry about his gun i can use the new safety device m pointed up at a thin line on the ceiling are you sure that the glass wall will come down quickly enough when i press the button he asked yes sir said the chief of staff nervously weve tested it and it works all right but a light started to flash on ms intercom that must mean bond is here said m tell him to come straight in please yes sir bill tanner replied then he left the room and closed the door behind him james bond was standing outside ms office he was smiling strangely at miss moneypenny who was sitting behind her desk and looking very upset clearly confused by his odd behaviour then he turned and greeted the chief of staff flatly hello bill hello james responded bill long time no see m is ready for you now so lets talk when you come out that will be fine said bond slowly then he went into ms office bill walked quickly into the office next to ms and shut the door he pressed a button on his desk there was a small click and then the sound of ms voice came into the room over a loud speaker the chief of staff listened to what was being said in the next room hello james its wonderful to see you again sit down and tell me all about it said m james bond sat down in front of m bond knew this chair and had sat in it and talked to m many times before suddenly lots of different confused memories came quickly into his head bond tried not to think about them he knew that he must think only about what he needed to say and do im afraid i still cant remember very much sir he said i was hit on the head while i was doing that job in japan i was badly hurt and i lost my memory to begin with i couldnt even remember who or where i was the russian police found me some months later in vladivostok ive no idea how i got there the police passed me on to the kgb and when they checked my fingerprints they got very excited for weeks they asked me question after question i couldnt remember much but i told them what i could you told them what you could repeated m slowly was that a good idea they were very nice to me bond replied so i wanted to help them then i was taken to a hospital in leningrad while i was there specialist brain doctors came to look at my head and other people came to talk to me about the political situation and that sort of thing they explained to me how the east and west need to work together for world peace i hadnt thought about it in that way before and i think they are right he looked confidently across the table at m however you probably dont understand youre always making war against someone and youve been using me as a weapon to do that for you but not anymore thats finished you say the russians want peace began m angrily then why do they need the kgb at the last estimate the kgb had about one hundred thousand men and women making war as you call it against other countries and did they tell you that they killed two of our agents in munich last month oh yes sir bond said in a patient voice they have to protect themselves from the secret services of the west but if you close down the british secret service they wont need the kgb i dont believe that for one minute replied m shortly anyway if the russians are such good people then why didnt you stay in their country we thought that it was more important for me to come back and fight for peace here sir explained bond m noticed his use of the word we just then bonds right hand started to move slowly towards the pocket of his coat m knew now that bond was planning to kill him he pushed his chair back from the desk and put his fingers on a button under the left arm of his chair bonds face was white and he looked uncomfortable he was staring at m and began to speak in a hard forceful voice we want to remove the people who are responsible for this war he said and you are the first person on the list bond pulled his hand out of his coat pocket he was holding a gun and was starting to point it towards m m quickly pressed the button on the arm of his chair with a loud rush of air a large sheet of thick bulletproof glass dropped down in front of him from the ceiling at the same moment brown liquid poison came from the gun and splashed onto the glass wall that now separated the two men almost instantly bill tanner and another man came running into the room and threw themselves on james bond as they caught him his head fell forwards and his eyes closed its cyanide said bill he must have breathed some of the fumes in we must all get out of here the men pulled bond quickly from the room and m followed them dont tell anyone about this m said to the chief of staff a few minutes later ill call sir james molony at the park hospital and tell him what has happened take down there theyll know how to treat him you heard bond say what happened to him he was hurt and as a result he lost his memory and then the kgb got him they brainwashed him all right thats all bill tanner was busy writing everything down in his notebook but now he looked up dont you want to press any charges sir he tried to kill you he said certainly not answered m is a sick man and doesnt know what hes doing sir james knows about brainwashing and will know what to do if the kgb has the nerve to use one of my best men to attack me then i have the nerve to send him back to attack them was a good agent once and im sure hell be a good agent again after lunch please give me the information we have on scaramanga when is ready that will be his next mission scaramanga the shocked chief of staff cried but wouldnt be able to kill him no one can kill scaramanga for what he tried to do here this morning said m coldly would have to spend twenty years or more in prison i dont want that it would be better for him to die on a mission it will be a test if he can kill scaramanga then we can forget the past thats my final decision chapter three scaramanga when m returned from lunch he found miss moneypenny typing at her desk your office is safe to use again she informed him but keep the windows open for a while oh and heres the file you wanted sir m took the brown file from his secretary it had a red top secret star stamped on the top right hand corner hows did he wake up all right he enquired concerned i think so sir replied miss moneypenny the medical officer gave him a sedative and then he was carried out of the back door under a blanket no ones asked me any questions about it good remarked m he walked through the door into his office and sat down behind the large desk for the hundredth time he assured himself that his decision was the right one m opened the brown folder and started to read the report francisco scaramanga scaramanga is an assassin who works mainly for the kgb in havana cuba and for other organizations in the caribbean and central american states he is known to be responsible for the death of five british secret agents and has seriously injured another he is well known in the caribbean and is widely feared by the local people he always uses a colt handgun made of gold and has therefore become known as the man with the golden gun he uses gold and silver bullets which are specially designed to cause maximum damage the police are aware of him although he has never been arrested description age about height m eyes light brown hair short red hair with a small moustache build slim strong broad shoulders personality ruthless serious enjoys the company of women origins in his early years he lived in spain and travelled with his fathers circus he learnt to use pistols very skilfully as part of his circus act his childhood was difficult and painful aged he shot a policeman during an incident at the circus he then hid on a ship and travelled to america on arrival in the united states he worked as a gunman for the spangled mob in a las vegas hotel his job was to execute people who had cheated at the casino in he got into trouble with a rival gang the purple gang and had to leave the united states he then became rich by buying and selling property for criminals in the caribbean in he moved to havana when fidel castro came to power there after the revolution scaramanga began working for the cuban secret police conclusion scaramanga is a very cold secretive paid assassin with connections to the kgb and the cuban secret police a highly experienced and welltrained agent would be needed for this dangerous mission however the recommendation is that scaramanga should be removed as soon as possible at the end of the report was a handwritten note which read i am in agreement and below it was the signature of the head of the caribbean and central american section next to this was the chief of staffs signature m looked up from the paper for about five minutes he sat and gazed across the room then he reached for his pen and wrote the word action and signed the page he sat very still for another five minutes and wondered whether he had just signed james bonds death warrant chapter four to jamaica it was a hot deppressive day when james bonds flight arrived in jamaica several months had passed since the terrible incident in ms office and following bonds intensive and difficult rehabilitation at the park hospital in london he had been declared fit enough to be sent on a new mission for six weeks now bond had been travelling around the caribbean and central america trying to track down his target scaramanga he had apparently missed him by just one day in caracas but now he had lost the trail he was waiting in kingston international airport for a flight to havana as scaramanga was known to have spent a lot of time in cuba it seemed too obvious to search there but bond was running out of places to look bond wandered around the airport looking at the shops to kill time as he did so he walked past a notice board which held messages for passengers travelling through the airport he stopped and looked to see if there were any messages under the letter h for hazard mark the false name that he was travelling under nothing he was not surprised in all his life he had never found a message for him at an airport but then as he walked past s he suddenly froze he looked around as casually as possible to make sure no one was watching him then he covered his hand with his handkerchief and quickly reached out and took an envelope on which was written the word scaramanga a few moments later bond walked calmly to the nearby mens toilets and when he was safely inside he carefully opened the envelope the message he found read to scaramanga boac passenger from lima peru from message message received from kingston jamaica at beckford slm from midday tomorrow bond could not believe his eyes at last he had some solid information bond read the message again and then carefully slid the piece of paper back into the envelope and returned it to the notice board then he found the british overseas airways corporation desk and checked their flight timetables yes the boac flight from lima to kingston was due in at the next day bond thought quickly about what he needed to do he walked to the cuban airlines desk and cancelled his flight reservation to havana before finding a public telephone and calling the head of the british secret service in jamaica after a moment he heard a girls voice on the line commander rosss secretary speaking can i help you could you put me through to commander ross please asked bond this is a friend of his from london im afraid commander ross is away from jamaica replied the girl bond thought her voice sounded a little familiar is there anything i can do she offered brightly well my names started bond dont tell me the girl said excitedly its james isnt it bond laughed it was his wonderful secretary from the old days in the double section mary goodnight he exclaimed what on earth are you doing here more or less the same job that i used to do for you she answered warmly i was so pleased to hear you were back but i thought you were ill or something how wonderful to hear from you where are you now kingston airport said bond now listen mary i need your help and quickly we can talk later first do the initials slm mean anything to you no i dont think so she said slowly oh im not sure but they could stand for savannalamar thats a town in the south of the island bond spoke decisively right i need a car any car and a detailed map of jamaica can you bring the car to morgans harbour im going to stay there tonight all right replied goodnight anything else yes wear something pretty and bring me one hundred pounds in jamaican money so i can buy you dinner added bond smiling broadly to himself she laughed well now i know its definitely you james ill see you at about seven bond was drinking a bourbon whisky with ice when mary goodnight walked into the little bar on the waterfront later that evening oh james she cried and kissed him on the cheek its so wonderful to have you back she was wearing a stylish orangeypink dress and a pearl necklace and james thought that she looked beautiful its good to see you again bond told her warmly so tell me the news have you managed to get what i asked for she handed him an envelope saying heres the money and the cars outside its old but the tanks full of petrol and its reliable while they ate dinner mary goodnight brought bond up to date with what was happening in jamaica there are a lot of problems with the sugar cane crops she explained sugar cane is worth a lot of money to jamaica cubas sugar crop is jamaicas main rival but with the recent hurricane and all the rain theyve been having there the cuban crop is only going to be about three million tons this year thats less than half of what it should be so castro wants to keep the world price high and sell as much cuban sugar cane to russia as possible they say that hes actually paying people to burn the rival jamaican crops so he can sell the cuban sugar at a high price and savannalamar those initials you were asking me about thats the area where most of the jamaican sugar cane crops are grown wisco the west indian sugar company has a huge sugargrowing estate near there at frome the top man of the company tony hugill is having a lot of problems because his crops keep being burnt they discussed the political situation in jamaica for a few minutes and then bond asked thoughtfully and wheres your chief commander ross well i dont really know answered goodnight in a worried tone he went to trinidad last week to look for somebody called scaramanga a local gunman of some sort commander ross was due back two days ago but he still hasnt turned up ive informed headquarters and theyve told me to wait for another week i much prefer working with his assistant anyway remarked bond with a smile chapter five number beckford street the next morning having studied the map james bond got into the old car and began the kilometre drive down to the south coast of the island it was around midday when he finally arrived in the small unattractive town of savannalamar he parked the car near the quiet seafront and wandered casually back into the streets of the town bond stopped and asked a shop owner if there was a road named beckford somewhere in the town he was informed that there was a beckford street and was given directions to it bond walked on and after several wrong turns eventually found number beckford street it was a big wooden house with steps up to the front door and an old sign that read dreamland cafe once the building would have been quite grand but now it looked tired and the paint was peeling off in the front garden there was a large tree covered in beautiful blue flowers in the welcoming shade of this tree a young woman was sitting in a rocking chair reading a magazine bond walked up the steps and through the open door into the cafe he was looking at the various unappetizing plates of food on the counter when he heard quick footsteps outside the girl from the garden came in and walked towards the counter she was pretty with long black hair and big brown eyes she greeted him in a friendly voice afternoon good afternoon replied bond could i have a bottle of beer please sure she walked slowly behind the counter opened a bottle and passed it to bond together with a glass that was almost clean thats one shilling and sixpence bond paid for his beer and then pulled a stool up to the counter and sat down on it are you just here for the day the girl asked as she leant on the counter yes thats right he replied my names mark and im tiffy she replied do you own this place bond asked her no said the girl and laughed im just the manager it might be quiet now but its busy in the evenings she looked towards a clock on the wall it was halfpast one oh exclaimed the girl suddenly ive forgotten to feed joe and may she walked over to one of the windows and opened it at once from the direction of the large tree two big black birds flew down and through the open window they flew around the room and with loud cries landed untidily on the counter top within reach of bonds hand tiffy broke a biscuit into small bits and held them for the birds who greedily took the pieces from her fingers theyre called jamaican grackles she explained smiling theyre very friendly she reached for another biscuit but then stopped arm outstretched and listened the sound of footsteps came from upstairs and the smile fell from her face theres a man upstairs who rents a room for meetings hes an important man but i dont like him hes rough and he doesnt like joe and may he says they make too much noise she waved her arms trying to get the birds to fly in the direction of the open window but they wanted the second biscuit and refused to move tiffy turned to bond and begged him urgently please just sit quietly whatever he says he likes to make people angry and then her face was suddenly very serious at that moment a door opened behind the counter and a large man quietly stepped into the room he came up and leant on the counter without saying a word the description of him in the report bond had been given was exact but he had not expected the mans shoulders to be so wide or that there would be no emotion in the small eyes that now examined bond coldly he was wearing an expensivelooking suit a tie and a gold tie pin in the shape of a tiny pistol there could be no doubt this was scaramanga scaramanga looked towards the birds then back at bond and then said i sometimes make them dance then i shoot their feet off really replied bond confidently that sounds a bit extreme what do you do it for the last time it was for five thousand dollars it seems like you dont know who i am didnt the girl tell you bond glanced towards tiffy she was standing very still and she looked nervous why should she bond asked as he moved his hand ever so slightly nearer to the gun which was pushed into his waistband why would i want to know suddenly there was flash of gold because of this replied scaramanga aggressively as he pointed his gun at bonds stomach what are you doing here stranger we dont usually get tourists here youre not from the police are you or any of their friends a second passed then bond casually crossed his legs and allowed a small smile to appear on his face he turned to tiffy and said well ive no idea who this man is but ask him what hed like to drink whoever he is that was a good circus act tiffy looked terrified and did not move she opened her mouth to speak but no sound came out suddenly the two birds perhaps sensing the tension in the room cried out and took off towards the open window like two thieves escaping the shots from the gold colt handgun were deafening the two birds exploded in mid air and black feathers flew in all directions then there was a moment of awful silence james bond did not move tiffy grabbed his bottle of beer from the counter and threw it angrily across the room then she fell to the floor crying loudly bond picked up his glass and drank what was left of the beer then he got slowly to his feet he walked towards scaramanga looked him directly in the eyes and then walked past him over to where tiffy was lying he knelt down beside her and helped her to sit up he then took a cloth wetted it at the tap and gently wiped it over her face chapter six the easy grand once tiffy had calmed down bond stood up and turned to face scaramanga again that may have been a good circus act but it was rough on the girl give her some money bond demanded knowing scaramangas history bond had used the word circus again on purpose no replied scaramanga simply then suspiciously and whats all this talk of circuses like i said before are you with the cops you certainly seem like you are people dont tell me what to do i tell them stated bond then he walked into the middle of the room and sat down at a table stop trying to give me a hard time and come and sit down he added scaramangas expression did not change he slowly walked across the room picked up one of the metal chairs turned it around and sat down on it facing the wrong way round his right hand rested on the top of his leg centimetres away from the handle of his gun which was tucked into the top of his trousers bond recognized that this was a sensible working position for a gunman the metal back of the chair was in front of him protecting his body this was certainly a most careful and professional man bond with both hands in full view on the table top said in a relaxed way no im not from the police my names mark hazard im from a company called transworld consortium ive been doing a job at frome the wisco sugar place do you know it of course i know it what have you been doing there asked scaramanga not so fast my friend first of all who are you and whats your business said bond firmly scaramanga francisco scaramanga i work in labour relations the man with the golden gun is what they call me around here he said coldly well said bond looking thoughtful a gun can be a useful tool for solving labour problems we could do with you up at frome have they been having trouble up there scaramanga asked but he looked bored yes theyve been having too many sugar cane fires one of the jobs of my company is insurance investigation lied bond ah sneered scaramanga security work i thought i could smell the copsmell he looked satisfied that his guess had been close enough did you catch anyone most of them explained bond but not all of them thats why i say we could do with a good labour relations person up there there was a pause and then scaramanga asked bond do you carry a gun of course you dont go after people like that without one what kind of gun scaramanga wanted to know a walther ppk millimetre said bond scaramanga seemed impressed by this and remained silent for a moment then he turned to tiffy hey two bottles of beer if youre in business again he turned back and looked hard at bond whats your next job i dont know im in no hurry ill call london and see if theyve got any other problems in the area i work for them more or less on a freelance basis tiffy came out from behind the counter and brought the drinks to the table she gave scaramanga a long hard look and then turned around sharply and walked away a few moments passed while both men simply sat and drank their beers scaramanga appeared to be deep in thought about something at last he spoke do you want to earn yourself a grand a thousand dollars bond said possibly then after a moment he added probably but what he was really thinking was yes definitely if it means being able to stay near you scaramanga did not take his cold eyes from bonds face now he began to talk more openly to bond ive got a problem mister he began some partners of mine have taken an interest in the negril property development its at a place called bloody bay about thirty kilometres down the coast from here do you know it bond told the man that he had seen the area on the map near green island harbour right well ive got shares in the business we started building a hotel there but halfway through building it the tourist industry went quiet the americans probably got frightened of being so close to cuba and the banks have got difficult with us so weve started to run out of money so youre trapped you havent got the money to finish it and presumably its not easy to sell summarized bond right so i came here a few days ago and im staying at the thunderbird hotel the one that weve only half finished ive asked half a dozen of the main shareholders to fly in for a meeting straight away to decide what to do next now i want to give these guys a good time so ive arranged everything a great night with a band from kingston singers dancers theres even a small railway near the hotel that used to transport the sugar cane the next day ill take them on a train trip down that line to green island harbour where ive got a big luxury motorboat so they can go deepsea fishing and have a really good time do you get me bond nodded scaramanga looked into bonds eyes some of these men are sort of rough were all shareholders but that doesnt mean were friends i want to hold some meetings private meetings with maybe only two or three guys at a time to find out what all the different interests are it could be that some of the other guys the ones not invited to a particular meeting might try to bug a meeting or try to find out in some other way whats been said so its just occurred to me that you could act as a kind of guard at those meetings you would check the room for microphones then stay outside the door and make sure that no one comes nosing around bond could not stop himself from laughing then he said so you want to hire me as a kind of personal bodyguard is that right scaramanga frowned and whats so funny about that mister its good money isnt it three maybe four days in a luxury hotel like the thunderbird for a thousand dollars he stared at bond bond scratched the back of his head thinking quickly he knew he had not heard the full story he also knew it was odd for this man to hire a complete stranger to do this job for him however it did make sense that scaramanga would not want to hire a local man an expoliceman for example even if he could find one local people know too much if bond accepted the offer it would be a perfect way to stay close to scaramanga and find out more yet it felt too convenient to be true could it be a trap bond decided to take the risk he then said i was only laughing at the idea of a man like you wanting protection but it all sounds great fun of course ill come along when do we start chapter seven into scaramangas world it was early evening now and bond was driving his car in the dark along a country road he did not know he had been told to follow scaramangas car to get to the halfbuilt thunderbird hotel he knew more or less the direction they were travelling in and could tell that the sea had always been close to him on his left while he had been driving but he felt uncomfortable the first law for a secret agent is to be sure of exactly where he is to know his route of escape and to have a means of communication with the outside world for the last hour james bond had been driving into the unknown and his nearest contact was a girl he hardly knew in a bar thirty kilometres away the situation was worrying just as bond was considering his position some glowing lights appeared up ahead and what had to be the hotel began to sweep into view the two cars came to a stop in front of the building with the darkness of the night hiding the evidence of any building work the brilliantly lit entrance to the hotel looked impressive and convincing enough james bond got out of his car and followed scaramanga inside where a hotel clerk dressed in a smart uniform came to greet them bond wrote mark hazard and the london address of transworld consortium in the hotel register after speaking for several moments to the hotel manager scaramanga turned to bond and said youre in room number in the west wing im close by in number order whatever you want from room service see you at about ten oclock in the morning the guys will be coming in from kingston at around midday ok the expressionless face and cold eyes did not care if it was ok or not bond said it was once inside the pleasant modem double bedroom bond turned off the air conditioning he had never liked the idea of it and opened the window then he inspected the room in detail he checked behind the paintings on the walls and under the bed and then he slowly unscrewed the bottom plate of the telephone as he suspected he discovered a small microphone which had been connected to the main cable inside he smiled to himself left the microphone untouched and then carefully replaced the bottom plate and put the phone back on the bedside table he knew this kind of device well it would be powerful enough to pick up and transmit a conversation from anywhere in the room james bond unpacked his few belongings and then called room service and ordered some food while he was waiting for his food to arrive he poured himself a glass of whisky and sat down near the open window he could hear the waves breaking softly on the nearby beach and could smell the sea air as he sat holding the glass of whisky in one hand he thought about what would happen the next day it would certainly be interesting to see these fat frightened shareholders bond had a strong suspicion that they would be gangsters the type of men who owned the havana hotels and discos or who were in control in las vegas and miami and who was scaramanga working for whose money was he representing it could be anyone in the caribbean yet bond was sure that the money would have come from criminal sources he was probably still working for the cuban secret police and what about the man himself the incident with the birds certainly proved that scaramanga knew what he was doing with a gun how on earth was bond going to kill him later after eating dinner in his room bond pushed his empty suitcase up against the bedroom door and balanced three empty glasses on top of it although only a simple booby trap it would give him all the warning he needed if anyone tried to come into his room then he undressed got into bed and slept after a night full of disturbing dreams james bond woke up at halfpast seven he got dressed had a quick breakfast in his room and then decided to go for a walk to find out more about the property it did not take long to get a good picture of the place the darkness of the night before had covered up a halfproject bond now clearly saw that the east wing of the hotel had only just been started while in the main section of the building there were workmen everywhere they were hurriedly fitting carpets hanging curtains and even painting walls but no one was employed on the essentials the big cement mixers and diggers lay untouched outside beyond the newly laid gardens the wild mangrove swamps spread out far and wide full of crocodiles and giving off a strong unpleasant smell bond guessed that the place needed at least another year and another five million dollars before it would be properly finished some of the shareholders were not going to be happy when they saw this they might want to sell their shares in it but other businessmen might want to buy into it as long as they could do so cheaply and use it as a taxloss to set against more profitable business elsewhere businessmen often preferred to have money in property here because jamaica gave big tax concessions that was better than having to pay high taxes to the government in the united states cuba or anywhere else so scaramanga planned to blind his guests with pleasure and send them back happy to their syndicates so that they would recommend buying into the project would it work bond seriously doubted it bond glanced at his watch it was nearly ten oclock so he walked back to the main reception desk of the hotel scaramanga dressed in another smart suit was at the desk talking to the manager he nodded to bond lets go and have a look at the conference room he said bond followed him through the hotel bar to a big simply furnished room it had a large round table with a telephone on it and seven white leather chairs around it bond began to look carefully around the room he said the wall lights could be bugged and of course the telephone do you want me to have a close look at it scaramanga turned to bond and answered theres no need to its definitely bugged by me ive got to have a record of exactly what is said all right then where do you want me to be bond asked sit outside the door scaramanga told him read a magazine or something therell be a general meeting this afternoon at around four tomorrow therell be one or two smaller meetings i want all these meetings to be private i dont want anyone to disturb us no problem replied bond confidently now isnt it time you told me the names of these men who they represent and which ones if any youre expecting trouble from scaramanga picked up a pad of paper and a pencil from the table and handed them to bond sit down then first theres mr hendriks hes a dutchman and he represents the european money mostly swiss hes not the arguing type so he should be ok then theres sam binion from detroit he and his friends are worth about twenty million dollars next theres leroy gengerella miami hes big in the entertainment world and owns gengerella enterprises hes the kind of person who wants quick profits he might be rough and ruby rotkopf the hotel man from las vegas hell ask the most difficult questions because hell already know most of the answers from experience hal garfinkel from chicago hes in labour relations like me and represents a lot of teamster union funds he shouldnt be any trouble that makes five so far the last one is louie paradise from phoenix arizona hes involved in casinos and owns paradise slots the biggest company in the onearmed bandit business im not sure what hes going to say and who do you represent mr scaramanga asked bond casually caribbean money came the vague reply cuban said bond pushing him further i said caribbean cubas in the caribbean isnt it castro or batista insisted bond a heavy frown fell on scaramangas face and his right hand formed into a fist stay out of my business mister he warned or youll get hurt and i mean that then he turned and walked quickly out of the room james bond smiled he looked down at the list of names in front of him it certainly looked like a suspicious group of men but the name he was most interested in was mr hendriks who represented european money bond felt sure that this man was probably not what he seemed bond picked up the pad of paper and walked back to the hotel reception area a large man was approaching the desk from the entrance he looked hot and uncomfortable in his formal suit he looked like a typical european businessman a german dentist or a swiss banker he put down his heavy suitcase next to the reception desk and said in a heavy european accent and with poor english grammar it is mr hendriks i think it is that you are having a room for me isnt it chapter eight the six men the men on the list had begun to arrive scaramanga was there in the hotel lobby to greet them and bond stood nearby mentally trying to match each man to one of the names on the list as they came through the door they all looked quite similar darkfaced cleanshaven hard eyes and each one carried a briefcase bond also noticed that one or two of them were carrying guns under their suit jackets once they had all arrived scaramanga walked over to bond and told him see you in the bar around twelve oclock ill be introducing you as my personal assistant bond nodded before strolling off in the direction of his bedroom when he walked into the room he carefully checked that everything was exactly as it had been when he had left the room at about nine oclock that morning his razor was a couple of millimetres closer to the basin than it had been before he now knew without question that his room had been searched while he was out and that a real expert had done it bond was pleased it was good to know that at last the fight really had begun he took a shower and afterwards he looked at himself in the bathroom mirror and smiled at last after so many difficult months he saw the real james bond looking back at him he felt a wave of excitement pass through him he was ready for this mission when bond walked into the bar just an hour or so later all the men were already there wearing more relaxed clothes and drinking champagne scaramanga stood leaning against the bar and was spinning his golden gun round and round on the first finger of his right hand like a character from an old western film as the door closed with a click behind bond scaramanga swung round and the golden gun suddenly stopped in mid turn its barrel pointing directly at bonds stomach guys said scaramanga loudly meet my personal assistant mr mark hazard from london england hes come along to make sure things run smoothly this weekend mark come here and meet everyone he lowered the gun and pushed it into the top of his trousers bond knowing that this was his chance to get to know more about the men smiled and walked up to the bar he ordered a gin and began to move among the gangsters making small talk with one man he asked how his flight had been with another he enquired about the weather in the united states and commented on the beautiful scenery in jamaica as he talked to each man he made a mental note of his voice and recalled his name after a while bond walked purposefully towards mr hendriks and tried to start a conversation it seems were the only two europeans here i gather youre from holland ive often passed through it but never stayed there its a beautiful country commented bond yes answered hendriks simply and with a heavy accent what part do you come from bond enquired den haag came the short reply have you lived there long asked bond many years replied hendriks its a very beautiful town said bond yes said hendriks without interest bond waited a moment to see if he would add anything further but nothing happened is this your first visit to jamaica asked bond hoping to get more than one word in reply no replied the dutchman and he looked straight past bond in the direction of the bar excuse me please he added drily and then moved away he walked over to scaramanga who was standing alone leaning against the bar mr hendriks said something and his words acted like a command on the other man mr scaramanga stood up straight and immediately followed mr hendriks into a far corner of the room then he stood and listened carefully as mr hendriks talked rapidly in a low voice bond watched the scene closely he noted with interest the way in which scaramanga who until now had been full of arrogance and selfimportance treated this man with respect and deference seeing mr hendriks now bond guessed that he must be part of either the mafia or the kgb after having lunch together the group of men split up and went to their rooms to rest for a few hours before the conference started later that afternoon as bond returned from his room and walked through the lobby the hotel manager came out from behind the reception desk er mr hazard yes answered bond i dont think youve met my assistant manager mr travis he stated no i dont think i have said bond would you like to step into my office for a moment and meet him he asked politely later perhaps im on my way to the conference bond explained the smartly dressed man came a step closer then said quietly he particularly wants to meet you mr er bond bond suddenly understood this man was clearly also working undercover like him and possibly wanted to introduce him to another agent right agreed bond wed better make it quick the manager stepped behind the desk and opened a door bond went in and the manager closed the door behind them a tall slim man was standing with his back to them leaning over a desk he turned he had straight fair hair a bronzed texan face and instead of a right hand he had a bright metal hook bond stopped in his tracks a broad smile spread across his face and his eyes shone with joy felix leiter i cant believe its you he cried and went up to the man and gave him a friendly punch on the shoulder the face was slightly more lined than bond remembered but the mans smile was just as friendly and warm as it had always been the men knew each other well leiter was in the cia and had worked with bond on several previous missions they had been through a lot together and during one very challenging mission several years earlier leiter had lost his right arm and part of his left leg to a shark bond was hugely relieved to know that leiter was also working for scaramanga and that he would no longer be working on this mission alone chapter nine the conference james bond left the reception area and quickly made his way to the bar when he got there he saw that all the men were already seated around the table in the adjacent conference room and that scaramanga was waiting impatiently by the door right he said looking directly into bonds eyes lock the door and wait outside while were talking dont let anyone in not even if the hotel catches fire and with that he turned and went inside to join the other six men bond looked into the room and noted the seating order before he closed and locked the door as he had been told to do he then quickly locked the other door which led from the bar into the hotel lobby moving quietly and rapidly he picked up a champagne glass from the bar and placed the bowl of the glass against the conference room door holding the glass by the stem he placed his left ear against its base and listened what had been the unintelligible rumble of a voice now became mr hendriks speaking and i have a very important message for our chairman from my superiors in europe it is from a sure source there is a man called james bond who is looking for him here this is a man who is from the british secret service i have no information or description of this man but my superiors believe that he is a serious threat mr scaramanga have you heard of him scaramanga laughed loudly no i havent and should i care i eat one of their famous secret agents for breakfast from time to time only ten days ago i killed one of them who came looking for me a man called ross his body is now very slowly sinking to the bottom of an oil lake in trinidad next question please mr hendriks we must talk about the cane sabotage began hendriks at our meeting six months ago in havana it was decided to help fidel castro to maintain and even increase the world price of sugar to balance out the damage caused by hurricane flora our help would be in exchange for certain favours from him this decision was taken against my wishes since that time there have been a lot of fires in the sugar cane fields of jamaica and trinidad and my superiors have discovered that some members of this group mr gengerella mr rotkopf mr binion and indeed our chairman have been purchasing large quantities of july sugar futures in order to make money for themselves there came low angry voices from around the table why shouldnt we shouted gengerella who said we werent allowed to make money isnt that one of the reasons we are all here i asked you six months ago mr hendriks and ill ask you again now which of your superiors wants to keep the price of raw sugar down my guess is that its soviet russia theyre selling goods to cuba including a recent shipment of missiles to fire against the united states my homeland in exchange for raw sugar mr hendriks is one of your superiors somebody in the kremlin the voice of scaramanga shouted for calm and a reluctant silence fell when we formed this group we all agreed to work together scaramanga reminded the men so mr hendriks let me explain as an investment group we have good bets and bad bets sugar is a good bet and we should continue to bet on it even if you personally have decided not to be involved in it now listen at this moment there are six ships controlled by this group that are waiting outside new york and other us harbours these ships are loaded with raw sugar these ships mr hendriks will not dock and unload their sugar until sugar futures july futures specifically have risen by another ten cents the us government the sugar lobby and other powerful groups know this they know that we have them cornered they want the ships to dock and the sugar to be unloaded before theres a real shortage and the price rises too high but theres another side to it its costing us a lot of money to have our ships sitting there waiting so the situation cant carry on like this forever one side will win and one side will lose four of us here could win or lose about ten million dollars and at the same time our investment in this thunderbird hotel isnt looking good its in the red so what do you think mr hendriks of course we bum the sugar crops if we can get away with it i know the right people in jamaica and i pay them to do the job for us thats how it works so you just tell your superiors that what goes up must come down and thats true for the price of sugar like anything else ok there was a moment of silence before mr hendriks spoke i will pass on what you say but they will not be happy then he added now there is the question of this hotel what is the exact financial situation i think we all want to know the truth there was a murmur of agreement around the table and then scaramanga began a long and detailed explanation which was of little interest to bond in any case felix leiter had told him that the whole meeting would be secretly recorded on electronic equipment in the small room where they had seen each other earlier leiter was working with the smart american hotel manager an undercover electronics expert in the cia whose real name was nick nicholson and their job was to get a better understanding of the members of the group and what they were trying to do leiter had confirmed what bond had suspected hendriks was in fact a top man in the kgb the cia believed that gengerella was a member of the mafia this was therefore a worrying situation the first time that a mafia member had been found working with the kgb and it would need to be ended leiter said by removing someone if necessary bond had explained his own mission to leiter and nicholson and they had agreed that they should continue to work separately but they would support each other if the need arose so now bond was on his own outside the conference room and scaramanga was just finishing what he was saying so in summary gentlemen we need to find another ten million dollars the interests that i represent which are the majority of the interests believe that a loan for this amount of money should be provided to the project by all of us we would be paid interest at a rate of ten per cent and the loan would be repayable in ten years the voice of mr rotkopf broke in angrily not on your life what about the seven per cent second mortgage my friends and i agreed to only a year ago if i went back to las vegas and told them about this new loan what do you think they would do to me we dont have a choice its that or the hotel closes responded scaramanga calmly what do you other guys say hendriks said ten per cent is a very good rate my friends and i will lend one million dollars as long as the agreement is clear and fair ok ok mr binion murmured reluctantly count us in for the same amount but this had better be the last time in turn the other men all agreed to lend a share of the money although mr rotkopf was still unhappy no i dont want any part of this he said firmly as soon as i get back im going to find the best lawyers in the states you cant just cancel that mortgage there was silence the voice of scaramanga was soft and deadly youre making a big mistake this is a nice big taxloss to balance out your las vegas business interests and dont forget that we all promised each other that we would work together are you sure your answer is no i am absolutely sure he stated decisively would this help to change your mind scaramanga said coldly there was a loud gunshot and a sudden scream of terror something possibly a chair fell to the floor with a crash and then there was silence then someone coughed nervously and mr gengerella said calmly i think that was the right solution to an embarrassing difference of opinion mr rotkopfs friends in las vegas like a quiet life im sure they wont even complain lets say that he has agreed that he and his friends will put in a million dollars shall we yes thats right came scaramangas voice happy and relaxed mr rotkopf has left here to go back to las vegas we never saw him again we dont know anything do we ive got some hungry crocodiles out there in the swamps that need feeding therell be nothing left of poor mr rotkopf after theyve had their dinner ill need some help with it tonight though can you come with me gengerella and you paradise no not me pleaded the voice of mr paradise its against my religion mr hendriks said i will take his place i am not a religious person fine said scaramanga and added well guys is there any other business to discuss if not well finish the meeting and have a drink hal garfinkel broke in nervously just a minute what about that british guy outside the door he must have heard the gunshot whats he going to say about it mr scaramangas laugh was dry and cruel dont worry about him i picked him up in a bar a few kilometres away ive only got temporary staff here to make sure you guys have a good time this weekend and hes the most temporary of all of them those crocodiles really are hungry rotkopf will be the main course but theyll need a dessert for all i know he might be this james bond man mr hendriks has told us about no dont you worry about the british guy ill sort him out bond carried the empty champagne glass over to the bar and slowly filled it with champagne at that moment he heard scaramanga turning his key in the lock scaramanga looked at bond from the doorway ok thats enough champagne go to the manager and tell him mr rotkopf will be checking out tonight and say that a major fuse blew during the meeting and no one can go into this room and that im going to find out why were having so much bad workmanship around the place ok then its drinks dinner and dancing girls got it james bond said that he understood he was slightly unsteady on his feet as he walked towards the lobby door and unlocked it yes he understood mr rotkopf was dead and bond was the next person on scaramangas list he understood only too well what the situation was chapter ten the dinner party back in the small office behind the hotel reception desk james bond quickly went over the key parts of the meeting with leiter and nicholson they all agreed that they had enough evidence recorded on tape to have scaramanga locked away in prison for the rest of his life leiter planned to follow the men later that night when they got rid of rotkopfs dead body he wanted to try and get enough evidence to take garfinkel and hendriks to court as well bond returned to his room poured himself a large whisky and then lay on his bed thinking about the days events one thing was certainly clear he now found himself in a very delicate and dangerous situation when bond joined the others for dinner he could sense that things had changed the men now seemed to be avoiding him they knew the boss did not trust him and wanted him dead he was certainly not someone they now wanted to be friendly with the restaurant had been decorated with tropical plants and colourful fruits and as the men ate their meal a calypso band was playing rather too loudly on the stage a pretty girl dressed in a bright red and gold costume and wearing a large false pineapple on top of her head was singing a slow song unenthusiastically bond was finding the evening extremely boring the food was unremarkable and the other guests were ignoring him he got up and went to the head of the table he told scaramanga ive got a headache im going to bed no scaramanga declared quite forcefully looking coldly at bond if you think the evening isnt going well make it go better thats what youre being paid for do something about it it was many years since james bond had accepted a dare he felt the eyes of the group watching him waiting to see what would happen next stupidly he wanted to show these men who thought him unimportant what he could do he did not stop to think that it would have been better for him to keep quiet at that moment instead he said decisively all right mr scaramanga give me a hundreddollar note and your gun scaramanga did not move he looked up at bond with surprise and uncertainty mr paradise shouted come on lets see what he can do scaramanga reached for his wallet and slowly took out a folded hundreddollar note next he carefully reached into his waistband and pulled out his gun he laid the golden gun and the note on the table in front of him with his back to the stage james bond picked up the gun and checked that it was loaded at once bond turned dropped onto one knee so that his aim would be above the musicians on the stage and shot the gun the explosion was deafening and the music stopped immediately there was a tense silence what was left of the false pineapple fell to the floor with a thud a second later the girl put her hands to her face and slowly fell down onto the floor as the men started to comment to each other in low voices bond picked up the hundreddollar note and approached the girl he lifted her up by her arm and pushed the folded note into her hand that was a fine act we did together dont worry you were in no danger i aimed for the top half of the pineapple now run off and get ready for your next song he turned her round and gave her a gentle push she gave him a horrified glance and ran off into the shadows bond turned to the band all right then listen to me this isnt a tea party mr scaramangas friends want some action and some fun you can drink as much rum as you want but youd better start playing some decent music i want that pretty girl back and her friends and i want them to dance down here near where were sitting not up on the stage do you understand now unless you get moving ill finish this show now and therell be no money ok then lets go there was nervous laughter from the band as they exchanged smiles and one of the men ran off after the girl bond walked back and laid the pistol down in front of scaramanga who gave bond a long questioning look and then pushed the gun back into his waistband after bonds impressive act the atmosphere lifted and the evening became a success it had been a risk but it had paid off and it wasnt until the early hours of the morning that bond slipped away back to his room with relief bond took a shower and climbed into bed he worried for a while about having shown off with the gun but it was a stupid mistake that he could not change now he soon went to sleep and dreamt of three dark figures dragging a shapeless heavy weight towards dark waters that were full of long twisting snapping crocodiles chapter eleven unexpected visitors a soft tapping sound woke bond from his restless sleep it took him a moment to realize that the tapping noise was coming from behind the curtains he quietly picked up his gun and crept along the wall to the edge of the curtains he pulled them aside with one quick movement the golden blonde hair was immediately visible in the moonlight through the halfopen window mary goodnight was looking at him through the glass bond breathed a sigh of relief he put down his gun carefully opened the window fully and helped goodnight to climb into the room there was a bang as the window snapped shut and they both froze after a moment or two he quietly guided her through the moonlit room and into the bathroom after closing the door and turning on the taps to cover the sound of their conversation he said firmly what on earth are you doing here mary her voice was desperate i had to come i had to find you somehow i went to that bar and the girl there told me where she thought youd gone i left the car in the trees at the bottom of the hotel drive and crept up here i didnt know where you were but then i saw the open window and i just somehow knew that you would be the only one to sleep with your window open so i took the chance whats happened asked bond theres an urgent message from headquarters they said it had to be given to you at all costs they think you are in havana but they said that one of the kgb top men who goes by the name hendriks is staying at this hotel you must stay away from him apparently one of his jobs is to find you and er well kill you so i put two and two together and knowing you were in this corner of the island i thought you might already be on his track but that you might not know he was looking for you while you were looking for him if that makes sense there was a pause while bond thought then he responded yes hes here thats for sure and so is a gunman called scaramanga you might as well know mary that scaramanga killed ross in trinidad she put her hand to her mouth in shock and as for hendriks continued bond hes here all right although i dont think hes identified me for certain but dont worry i think i can handle the situation besides ive got help he told her about felix leiter and nicholson now weve got to get you out of here just tell headquarters that youve delivered the message that im here and that the two cia men are here as well with that he gently put a hand on her shoulder then turned off the taps and opened the bathroom door as they stepped back into the room a steady voice came from the darkness at the end of the bed step forward both of you put your hands together behind your head scaramanga walked to the door and turned the lights on the golden gun remained pointing at bond as he moved bond looked at him in disbelief he looked towards the bedroom door his case was there as it had been the night before with the glasses balanced on top and scaramanga could not possibly have got through the small window on his own then he saw that the wardrobe was open and a light was shining through it from the room next door it was the simplest of secret doors just the whole of the back of the cupboard and it would have been impossible for bond to discover it while checking his room scaramanga stood looking at both of them i didnt see this dancer on the stage tonight where has she come from he said accusingly were engaged to be married stated bond thinking quickly shes a clerk at the british high commissioners office in kingston her names mary goodnight she found out where i was staying from that bar where you and i met and came out to tell me that my mothers in hospital in london shes had a bad fall bond then challenged scaramanga adding a note of anger to his voice whats wrong with that and what do you think you are doing coming into my room in the middle of the night waving a gun around after a pause he dropped his hands to his sides and turned to the girl put your hands down mary mr scaramanga must have thought there were burglars in here when he heard the window slam shut now youd better be going youve got a long drive back to kingston mary began to play her part in the story gosh yes id better go she said as she picked up her small bag from the bed where she had dropped it i really mustnt be late into the office in the morning im organizing a big party for the prime minister and its tomorrow so ive a lot to do so mr er scramble im terribly sorry for waking you up and she stepped forward between bond and scaramanga and offered him her hand to shake but scaramanga was not going to be taken in so easily stop there lady and you mister stay where you are mary goodnight let her hand fall to her side and looked at him questioningly as though he had just refused a cup of tea a second passed yet it felt like an eternity before scaramanga conceded ok i believe you put her through the window again he waved his gun at the girl ok get moving and dont come back bond led goodnight to the window and hurriedly helped to push her out then he moved away from the window and sat down on the bed with considerable relief he could feel the hard shape of his gun under the pillow against his leg scaramanga had put his gun away and was leaning against the wall the high commissioners office he said and paused that also houses the representative of your famous secret service doesnt it i wonder mr hazard if your real name isnt james bond you were pretty quick with that gun tonight i seem to have heard somewhere that this man bond likes his guns i also have information that hes somewhere in the caribbean and that hes looking for me quite a coincidence dont you think bond laughed easily i thought theyd got rid of that secret service years ago i am who i say i am all youve got to do is call mr tony hugill the boss up at frame and check on my story and can you explain how this bond man could possibly have tracked you down to a sleepy bar in savannalamar and what does he want from you anyway scaramanga watched him silently for a while weighing up the evidence then he spoke in a serious tone you just remember this mister if it turns out youre not who you say you are ill shoot you dead got it there was silence while the men looked at each other bond said nothing now youd better get some sleep said scaramanga ive got a meeting at ten oclock in the conference room with hendriks and i dont want to be disturbed after that were all going for a ride down to green island harbour on that train i was telling you about itll be your job to make sure that the trip is well organized talk to the hotel manager first thing in the morning all right scaramanga did not wait for an answer he walked into the wardrobe pushed bonds suit to one side and disappeared chapter twelve bad news the next morning bond arrived at the conference room a few minutes before ten oclock the evidence of the day before was still there to be seen the chairs were roughly in their correct positions but the ashtrays had not been emptied bond looked for stains on the carpet or for signs that the carpet had been washed but there were none rotkopf had probably been killed by a single bullet through the heart bond tidied the room and then dutifully started to examine the windows and curtains at that moment in walked scaramanga followed by hendriks he said roughly ok mr hazard lock both doors like yesterday no one comes in right yes affirmed bond and he then went out and locked the door again he fetched a champagne glass and took up his position listening through the door immediately hendriks began talking quickly and urgently mr s i have bad troubles to report i spoke with my people in havana this morning they have heard direct from moscow that man the man outside this room right now is the british secret agent james bond they have given me his description and the scar down the right side of his face leaves no doubt and his shooting last night there was a pause and then hendriks spoke in a calmer more threatening tone but how can this have happened what a shocking mistake if it werent for the watchfulness of my superiors who knows what damage this man might have done i must give my superiors a full report you must tell me exactly how this man ended up working for you in this way there was silence bond imagined scaramanga sitting back in his chair looking directly into the eyes of mr hendriks the voice when it came was decisive and firm mr hendriks thank you for this information and for your concern however tell your people this i met this man completely by accident at least i thought so at the time so there is no point in worrying about how it has happened it hasnt been easy to set up this conference so quickly and i needed help someone to make things go smoothly this guy seemed ok but im not stupid i knew that when this was all over id have to get rid of him just in case hed learnt anything he shouldnt have now you say hes a member of the secret service what youve told me only changes one thing hell die today instead of tomorrow and heres how its going to happen scaramanga lowered his voice now bond could only hear a few words of what was being said the sweat ran down his ear as he pressed it to the bottom of the champagne glass our train trip rats in the sugar cane unfortunate accident before i do it a big laugh there was a pause and then scaramanga went on in a louder voice so you can relax therell be nothing left of the guy by this evening ok mr hendriks voice was flat and uninterested he had carried out his orders and definite action was going to follow yes what you are saying will be satisfactory i will watch with amusement and now i want to talk about other business the sabotage of the aluminium industry my superiors want to know what the situation is yes replied scaramanga everything is going to plan with the three aluminium producing companies we agreed on reynolds metal kaiser bauxite and alumina of jamaica the barrels of explosives you gave me are pretty powerful arent they weve already got most of them hidden away in their aluminium mines theyre certainly going to cause a lot of problems for the metal industry and shake the economy here and in the united states good that is all then concluded hendriks ok lets go and see if the others are ready to go out its halfpast eleven and the train is due to leave in an hour or so explained scaramanga bond moved quickly away from the door and sat on a nearby chair as scaramanga unlocked the door and stepped into the room bond looked up and yawned mr scaramanga and mr hendriks looked down at him with a look of only mild interest it was as if bond were a piece of steak and they were wondering whether to have it cooked rare or medium rare chapter thirteen the train trip at twelve oclock the men all met in the hotel lobby and scaramanga now wearing a large white stetson cowboy hat and a white suit announced the plans for the day ok guys were going to have a great time first we have to drive a couple of kilometres down the road to the station well get aboard this amazing steam train then were going to steam along this old train track through the sugar cane fields for about kilometres until we get to green island harbour there are plenty of birds rats and crocodiles in the rivers we might do a bit of hunting have some fun with our guns youve all got your guns with you fine fine then well have lunch with some champagne at green island harbour and the music and girls will be there to keep us happy after lunch we can get aboard the thunder girl a big beautiful motorboat and well go for a cruise and catch ourselves some big fish then back here for some drinks all right everyone satisfied then lets go as they travelled in the cars to the station bond wondered what the plan was for his removal it would happen during the hunting he presumed and smiled darkly to himself strangely he was feeling happy he would not have been able to explain the emotion but it was a feeling of being tightly wound up like a spring ready to uncoil after six weeks of following this man today was the day he was going to win or lose scaramanga was just amusing himself and entertaining his friends whereas bond was fighting for his life surely that would give him the edge when the moment came thinking about all of this was beginning to make bond feel tense he took a deep breath told himself to relax and looked out of the window at the passing scenery the steam train called the belle was an impressive replica black and yellow engine it stood in the station shining brightly in the hot midday sun with a thin line of black smoke curling up from its funnel behind the engine was a coaltender and then there was one carriage which was opentopped and had several rows of bench seats the brake van came last and was also painted in black and yellow it had just one large goldenarmed chair where the guard would normally sit to control the brake wheel of the train all aboard cried scaramanga enthusiastically and then he turned immediately to bond now then you climb up in the front with the driver bond smiled happily thanks ive always wanted to do that since i was a child what fun scaramanga ignored the comment and turned to speak to the other men you can all sit in the carriage mr hendriks you sit in the first row of seats behind the coaltender please the rest of you sit behind him ill be at the back in the brake van its a good place to hunt from ok everybody took their seats moments later the engine gave a triumphant toot and the train pulled out of the station it started to pick up speed as it moved along the track which disappeared as straight as an arrow into the distance bond had studied in detail the map that mary had given him and he knew exactly the route that the train line took first there would be kilometres of cane fields then came middle river followed by huge areas of swampland then would come orange river leading into orange bay and then more sugar cane and mixed forest and small farms until they came to green island harbour now he looked around him and paid careful attention to his immediate surroundings next to him stood the driver who looked dirty and violent he was shovelling coal into the engine and seemed to have no interest in bond whatsoever bond said my names mark hazard whats yours the man simply stared at bond in a way which made it very clear that he did not want to talk bond looked back over the low coaltender to the carriage behind he gave a cheery wave to the men and shouted great fun they all stared back at him but not one of them responded to his comment so thought bond they had been told that he was a spy among them and that he would be killed today it was an uncomfortable feeling having those ten enemy eyes watching him like ten gun barrels he rested his hand against his gun then on the three spare magazines of ammunition he carried in his pocket and felt reassured about metres ahead a large bird rose up from beside the track and after a few heavy flaps caught the wind and moved up and away there came the boom of scaramangas gun a single feather came floating down from the wing of the bird a second shot was fired the bird gave a sudden jerk and then began to fall untidily out of the sky before crashing into the sugar cane there were shouts of joy from the carriage bond leant out of the carriage and shouted thatll cost you five pounds thats the fine for killing a john crow a shot whistled past bonds head scaramanga laughed sorry i thought i saw a rat then another shot rang out as bond jumped down out of sight and the other men began to laugh watch what youre saying man scaramanga shouted to bond or i really will shut you up beside bond the driver swore and then sounded the trains whistle bond looked down the line far ahead there was something lying across the rails of the track with the train still whistling the driver pulled back hard on the accelerator lever the train began to slow down but then scaramanga fired two shots into the air and yelled keep going fast you idiot the driver quickly pushed up the lever and alarmingly the train began to regain its speed he glanced at bond and commented flatly theres a girl on the line i guess it must be some friend of the boss bond leant out and looked more carefully yes it was a woman a woman with golden blonde hair bond heard scaramangas voice shouting from the brake van hey guys its a surprise for you all something from the good old western films theres a girl tied across the line and you know what its the girlfriend of a certain man weve been hearing of called james bond would you believe it and her names goodnight mary goodnight if only that man bond were on the train now i imagine wed be hearing him cry out to save her chapter fourteen the swamplands james bond threw himself towards the accelerator lever and pushed it down with all his strength the engine lost some of its power but there were only metres between the train and the girl the only thing that could save the girl was if scaramanga used the brakes in the last van she was going to die bond knowing that scaramanga would expect him to come out from the right side of the engine jumped to the left hendriks had his gun out but before he could turn bond shot a bullet straight between the mans cold eyes the head was knocked back and his body fell to one side scaramangas golden gun fired two shots a bullet crashed into the cabin of the engine the second struck the driver who fell to the ground screaming there were only metres of track left the golden hair was blowing over the face and bond could clearly see the rope tied around the ankles and wrists bond shut his mind to the dreadful crash that would come any moment now he leant out of the left side of the cabin again and fired three more shots he thought two of them had found their targets but then he felt a great blow to his shoulder which knocked him to the floor of the cabin his head hanging out of the train and it was from there only a couple of metres away that he saw the front wheels of the engine crash through the body on the line he saw the blonde head cut from the body saw the blue glass eyes give him a last empty stare saw the pieces of the shop window dummy break into bits with a sharp cracking of plastic and fall into the grass beside the track james bond relieved that it had not been mary on the track but feeling sick and shocked struggled to get to his feet he reached for the accelerator lever and pushed it upwards as far as it would go he thought that a gun battle against five men on a stationary train would be difficult for him but he would have a better chance of survival on a fast moving train he hardly felt the pain in his shoulder he looked out of the righthand side of the engine four guns boomed bond threw himself back under cover but he had just had time to see a glorious sight in the brake van scaramanga had slid from the large chair and was down on his knees looking as though he was in pain bonds bullet had hit him it was very good news but there were still four armed men remaining then a voice from the back of the train felix leiters voice called out ok you four guys throw your guns over the side now quick there came the boom of a shot i said quick there mr gengerella is dead do the rest of you want to go the same way ok then thats better and now put your hands behind your heads right ok james the battles over are you ok show yourself bond rose carefully he could hardly believe it leiter must have been riding secretly on the buffers behind the brake van he would not have been able to show himself earlier for fear of bonds gunfire yes it was definitely leiter he was standing beside the now fallen body of scaramanga and pointing his pistol at the three surviving men in the carriage bonds shoulder had really begun to hurt now he shouted with the anger of huge relief thanks a lot leiter why on earth didnt you show up before i could have been hurt leiter laughed thatll be the day now listen get ready to jump im going to stay with these guys for a while and hand them over to the police in green island harbour at this point he shook his head silently to show bond that these words were actually a lie its swampland so youll have a soft landing it stinks a bit but dont worry well give you some aftershave when you get home all right bond looked ahead down the line in the distance he could see the metal structure of the orange river bridge he looked back into the carriage he could see the dead body of hendriks rolling from side to side on the bench in the seat behind hendriks gengerella also lay dead next to him and behind him the other three gangsters looked terrified they had not expected all this they were in serious trouble and they knew it bond gave these cold men who had been prepared to murder him one last look before he got down onto the steps of the cabin ready to jump he chose his moment and threw himself clear of the train and into the soft wet mass of the stinking mangrove swamp as he fell a bird gave a loud screech and flew up and away the stink was unbearable he raised his head in time to see leiter some metres away throw himself off the brake van he seemed to land clumsily and did not get up and now within only a few metres of the long metal bridge another man jumped from the train it was a tall figure wearing a white jacket there was no doubt about it it was scaramanga why on earth had leiter left the train without putting a finishing bullet through the mans head the fight was not over yet bond watched as the track began to take the steam train across the bridge he wondered what would happen to those three men perhaps the train would run out of steam and they would run away to the hills or could they get the train under control and go on to green island harbour and try and take the motorboat over to cuba immediately the answer came halfway across the bridge the engine suddenly rose up into the air at the same time there came a crash of thunder and a huge sheet of flames before the bridge started to collapse bond watched as the bridge folded in on itself and the train crashed down into the river a terrible silence fell a bird then began to sing and two butterflies lazily flew past bond where he lay his shoulder was causing him a great deal of pain but he got slowly to his feet pulled himself out of the wet mud and began walking up the track towards the bridge leiter lay in the stinking swamp his left leg was at a hideous angle bond knew that it was badly broken he knelt down by the man and said softly i cant do much for you now ill give you a bullet to bite on for the pain and get you into some shade therell be people coming soon ive got to follow scaramanga hes somewhere up there by the bridge what made you think he was dead leiter groaned more with anger with himself than from the pain there was blood all over the place and i thought that if he wasnt dead already the bridge would put an end to him he gave bond a weak smile did you like what id planned for the bridge did it get rid of the train ok bond smiled in return it was a fabulous fireworks display the crocodiles will be sitting down to their dinner right now but that shop dummy that gave me a real shock did you put it on the track ah yes sorry about that james i had no idea your girlfriend was blonde or that youd believe it was her mr s told me to tie the thing to the track and as im supposed to be the assistant manager i couldnt refuse but it gave me the excuse i needed to get the explosives under the bridge this morning stupid of me i suppose admitted bond i thought hed caught her last night anyway come on here bite on this bullet this is going to hurt but i must get you under cover and out of the sun bond put his hands under leiters armpits and dragged him as carefully as he could to a dry patch under a big mangrove bush leiter gave a groan as he fainted from the pain bond looked thoughtfully down at him fainting was probably the best thing that could happen to him right now he took leiters gun out of his waistband and put it beside his left and only hand bond was still in a lot of danger if he ended up dead then scaramanga would certainly make felix his second target bond started to creep along the line of mangrove bushes towards the bridge it was early afternoon now and the sun was high he was hungry and very thirsty and his shoulder wound was hurting as he moved he struggled to remain focused on what he had to do about metres lay between him and the bridge he covered another by walking near the track then moved sideways into the mangroves he found that if he kept close to the roots of the bushes he could move fairly easily and silently his ears were alert like an animal ready to hear the smallest sound bond guessed that he had gone about metres into the swamp when he heard a single controlled cough chapter fifteen the end of the road the cough sounded as though it was about metres away towards the river bond dropped to one knee listening intently looking all around he waited for five minutes without moving when the cough was not repeated he crept forward on his hands and knees his gun gripped between his teeth in a small clearing of dried cracked mud he saw the man bond stopped in his tracks trying to calm his breathing scaramanga was lying stretched out his back resting against a large mangrove root his hat had gone and the whole of the right side of his white suit was dark with blood yet the mans eyes were still very much alive they swept the clearing every few seconds looking for any signs of movement in the swamp his hands rested on the roots beside him bond noticed and there was no sign of a gun after a while scaramanga very carefully coughed again and spat into his hand he examined the bright pink results and threw them down onto the ground the cough did not seem to hurt him or cause him much effort bond guessed that his bullet had hit scaramanga in the right side of his chest and had just missed a lung there was bleeding but the bloodsoaked jacket was not telling the whole truth in bonds opinion mr scaramanga was still very much alive and dangerous bond was grateful that he was wearing a darkcoloured suit he was well camouflaged and scaramanga had not seen him he got quietly up from his knees put the gun in his right hand and keeping his gaze firmly on scaramanga he strolled slowly out into the clearing the other man barely looked up but said youve taken your time getting here he nodded his head towards the gun and added youre not frightened of a dying man are you you brits are pretty cowardly bond ignored the comment and walked a little closer have you got any more weapons on you open your jacket slowly no quick movements show me your belt now your armpits and your trouser legs as scaramanga moved his trouser leg bond caught sight of a shining blade right just throw that knife gently into the trees gently very gently scaramanga took the knife and with a flick of his wrist threw the knife upwards the silver blade went spinning like a wheel through the sunshine bond had to step aside and the knife landed blade downwards in the mud exactly where bond had been standing scaramanga gave a cold laugh then the laugh turned into a cough and his face twisted with the terrible pain of it or was he faking it then he relaxed again now then began bond lets talk youve killed too many of my friends i have the licence to kill you and thats what i am going to do but ill make it quick not like margesson do you remember him you were stupid enough to boast about killing him to your friends in cuba and we heard about it bond paused and then asked as a matter of interest how many men have you killed in your life with you itll be exactly fifty replied scaramanga he looked up at bond and said you wont get any secrets out of me if thats what youre trying to do ive been shot at by all kinds of experts and im still alive ive never heard of a brit whos got the guts to shoot a wounded defenceless man i bet well just sit here chatting until the rescue team get here then ill be glad to go to court what will they get me for anyway well just for a start theres that nice mr rotkopf with one of your famous gold and silver bullets in him in the river at the back of your hotel that matches the nice mr hendriks with one of your bullets somewhere in him maybe well spend a bit of time in prison together thatd be nice wouldnt it and anyway who says i killed rotkopf scaramanga asked it seems youve made quite a few mistakes recently mr scaramanga you hired all the wrong security men both of your managers were from the cia they bugged all of your phones and your conference room the recording of the gunshot and the conversation about getting rid of rotkopfs body will be on its way to the cia headquarters by now the recordings also include you admitting to the murder of one of our best agents ross of course see what i mean theres no way out ok mister secret agent mistakes seem to have been made so then take one million dollars let me go and lets call it a deal offered scaramanga i dont think so refused bond as he prepared himself to take the other mans life this is the end of the road for you he forced himself to think of the people that this man had killed of the people he would go on to kill in the future if bond weakened this man was the most dangerous cruel and efficient oneman killer in the world bond had been instructed to kill him he must kill him lying down wounded or in any other position although nervous bond tried to appear casual any messages for anyone scaramanga anyone you want looking after ill take care of it if its personal ill keep that information to myself scaramanga laughed his cold laugh but carefully what an english gentleman you are a few long moments passed without either man speaking scaramanga lay breathing steadily against the mangrove root bond stood with sweat dripping from his face and his gun pointing at the man then scaramanga held up a hand for the first time his face showed emotion and he spoke softly just let me say one last prayer ok it wont take long and then you can fire your bullets james bond lowered his gun he decided that he would give the man a few minutes but no longer go ahead he uttered in a tired voice one minute only scaramangas hand came up and covered his face there came murmurings in latin which seemed to go on for a long time bond stood there in the sunshine his gun lowered watching scaramanga but at the same time not really watching him the pain in his shoulder the heat his thirst and the thought of what he was about to do all began to distract him the fingers of scaramangas right hand crawled ever so slowly sideways across his face centimetre by centimetre they got to his ear and stopped the murmuring of the prayer carried on exactly as before and then the hand leapt behind the head and a tiny golden handgun fired loudly bond spun round as if he had taken a punch to the right side of his face and then he crashed to the ground at once scaramanga was on his feet and was moving forward quickly like a cat he grabbed the knife he had thrown away earlier and held it in front of him in a threatening way bond was twisting on the ground like a dying animal and the gun in his hand cracked loudly again and again five times then the gun fell sideways onto the black earth as his gunhand went to the right side of his body and stayed there grabbing at the terrible pain there the big man stood for a moment and looked up at the deep blue sky his fingers opened suddenly and let go of the knife his heart shot through by a bullet stopped beating and he crashed backwards now he lay unmoving his arms out wide to the sides as if someone had thrown him away chapter sixteen the case ends a week later james bond slowly opened his eyes he was confused and anxious and did not know where he was he opened his mouth to scream but only a low groan came out the nurse at the end of the bed stood up at once and went to his side and put a cool hand on his forehead bond looked up at her with unfocused eyes and muttered youre pretty before closing his eyes again half an hour later a young doctor stood outside the door to bonds hospital room in kingston explaining to the head nurse what he had found hes going to be all right his temperature is down now his pulse is a little fast though that may have been a result of his waking up ill come back later to check his wounds hes likely to wake up again if he does and he asks for something to drink give him fruit juice he should be on soft foods soon its a miracle really the bullet just hit muscle and didnt even touch a kidney but that bullet was dipped in enough poison to kill a horse thank goodness that doctor in savannalamar recognized the symptoms of snake venom and gave him those powerful antisnakebite injections he saved the mans life now then there should be no visitors of course ill tell the police and the high commissioners office that hes recovering i dont know who this mr bond is but apparently london keep calling us about him hes something to do with the ministry of defence he paused by the way hows his friend getting on in room mr leiter isnt it the one the american ambassador and washington have been calling about he keeps on asking to see this mr bond hes broken his leg in several places replied the nurse hes doing fine and should be walking with a stick in ten days hes already seen the police i suppose its all connected with that story in the papers about those american tourists being killed when the bridge collapsed near green island harbour the police commissioner is handling the case himself ten days later the small hospital room was crowded with people bond who was being supported by a pile of pillows was amused by the number of official people who had been brought to his bedside on his left was the commissioner of police who was wearing full uniform complete with a row of very impressivelooking medals on his right was a judge of the supreme court who was also very formally dressed and was accompanied by a clerk among the rest a huge man to whom felix leiter on crutches was quite respectful had been introduced to bond as colonel bannister from washington mary goodnight was also there and had been asked to take notes of the meeting she had also been asked by the nurse to watch for any signs of tiredness or discomfort in james bond and had been given the authority to end the meeting if she felt it necessary but james bond did not feel tired he was delighted to see all these people and to know at last that he was very much alive the only thing that concerned him was that he and leiter had not been able to see each other and agree their stories before this meeting they had carried out this dangerous mission without the knowledge of the jamaican authorities a couple of years ago when jamaica had still been under british rule that would have been fine but now bond knew things were different they had been wrong not to keep the police commissioner informed the police commissioner straightened himself and began to speak in a formal tone commander bond our meeting here today is being held on the prime ministers instructions and with your doctors approval there are many rumours going around the island and we are keen to understand exactly what happened so that justice can be carried out so this meeting takes the form of a judicial inquiry i will outline the facts of the case mary goodnight will take notes and then a formal document will be prepared we very much hope that if the conclusions of the meeting are satisfactory the case will be closed do you understand yes said bond who did not understand now the commissioner said in a serious tone the facts we know are as follows there recently took place at the thunderbird hotel a meeting of what can only be described as foreign gangsters of the worst kind including representatives of the soviet secret service the mafia and the cuban secret police they met to discuss the sabotage of the jamaican sugar cane and aluminium industries among other related things am i correct commander yes agreed bond quickly at least this part was true now the commissioner spoke in an even more serious tone knowledge of this meeting came to the attention of the criminal investigation department of the jamaican police secret conversations then took place between the jamaican authorities the ministry of defence in britain and the central intelligence agency in the united states as a result of these conversations you mr nicholson and mr leiter were sent to help us to uncover these secret plans against jamaica as the man spoke bond noticed that leiter was nodding his head enthusiastically and looking directly into bonds eyes bond smiled leiter was clearly trying to tell him that they should both agree with these comments which were not true they both knew that there had never been any contact with the jamaican authorities working very closely with the jamaican authorities the commissioner went on mr bond mr nicholson and mr leiter carried out their duties with professionalism they uncovered the true intentions of the gangsters but unfortunately during their mission at least one of their identities was discovered and a battle then took place during the battle the following enemy agents the finished report will include a list here were killed thanks to the skilful gunfire of commander bond and mr leiter and the following enemy agents there will be another list here were killed by mr leiters use of explosives on orange river bridge unfortunately commander bond and mr leiter received severe wounds from which they are now recovering in the kingston memorial hospital finally it must be noted that constable percival sampson of the negril constabulary was the first to discover the wounded felix leiter who then directed constable sampson to the scene of the final fight on the instructions of the prime minister sir alexander bustamante a judicial inquiry was held today at the bedside of commander bond with felix leiter present to confirm the above facts these facts in the presence of justice morris cargill of the supreme court are here and now confirmed the commissioner was obviously pleased with how the formalities had gone he smiled broadly at bond theres just one more thing he added as he handed bond a sealed packet another similar one to felix and a third to colonel bannister i present now to commander james bond of great britain mr felix leiter of the united states and in his absence mr nicholas nicholson of the united states the award of the jamaican police medal for gallant and meritorious services to the independent state of jamaica those watching began to clap in recognition of the mens bravery and james bond and felix leiter muttered a few words of thanks justice cargill rose to his feet and in a serious tone asked bond and leiter in turn is this a true and correct account of what happened yes indeed it is said bond yes it is your honour agreed leiter enthusiastically in that case justice cargill announced formally i declare this inquiry closed he then turned to mary goodnight please could you ask everyone here to sign this document and then have it delivered to my office thank you so much certainly your honour replied mary goodnight and then she glanced at bond but now if you dont mind i think mr bond needs to rest slowly everyone stood up and left the room everyone that is apart from leiter who waited until he was alone with bond and then moved closer to his bedside well james that was the easiest inquiry ive ever attended exclaimed leiter i lied my head off but weve come out of it looking good and weve even been given an award bonds wounds were beginning to hurt and he felt exhausted he smiled trying to hide the pain leiter was going to leave jamaica that afternoon but bond did not want to say goodbye bond treasured his good friends and felix and he had shared a lot of important things over the years bond said scaramanga was quite a guy if only we could have caught him alive what and make a hero out of him i dont think so in my book an enemys an enemy you did the right thing killing that man you did a good job so dont you worry about it leiter limped towards the door and opened it he raised his hand briefly the two men had never shaken hands in their lives his final words were and keep away from me for a few weeks every time i see you a piece of me gets broken off i dont like the idea of myself as the vanishing man he smiled and left the room chapter seventeen mary goodnight just over a week later james bond was sitting up in a chair reading a book and wondering when he was going to be able to leave the hospital he was feeling much better and although the nurses were fabulous especially the pretty one who had been with him when he had woken up he had had enough of the place he glanced at his watch four oclock it was visiting time and mary goodnight would be there any minute although he knew it was not fair he was looking forward to complaining at length to her about his situation mary goodnight came through the door despite the jamaican heat she was looking as fresh as a rose under her arm she was carrying a mediumsized officiallooking envelope with an elaborate wax seal on it bond gave oneword answers to her questions about his health and then demanded whats in that envelope its a top secret message for you from m she said excitedly open it for me ordered bond mary goodnight looked shocked but im not allowed to bond gave her a look which told her that today was not a day to argue with him she carefully opened the envelope pulled out the thick sheet of paper and began to read top secret to from m i have received your report and the report from our partners you have done well and carried out an exceptionally difficult and dangerous mission to my total satisfaction i trust you are in good health please inform me when you will be reporting for your next mission in good health interrupted bond incredulously mary goodnight looked up and smiled delightedly ive never known him to be so complimentary have you james its wonderful she looked hopefully at james yet his face remained expressionless she looked down and began to read the message again oh james she exploded with excitement dont tell me commented bond in a voice heavy with sarcasm hes going to give me free lunch vouchers every second friday and a new suit to replace the one that ive carelessly allowed to get damaged but secretly what mary had read out had delighted him and he very much wanted to know what was in the rest of the message james please stop interrupting and dont look so miserable said mary goodnight bond allowed a smile to creep onto his face he liked the fact that she could get so excited on his behalf as he watched her concentrating on the letter bond thought that she was someone he would always want to have near him but as what as his secretary as his girlfriend mary goodnight looked up at him and the question as it had done for weeks remained without an answer all right mary go on bond finally said mary goodnights face became serious now just listen to this she told him and then began to read the remaining part of the message in view of the outstanding quality of the services mentioned above the prime minister plans to recommend to her majesty queen elizabeth that she immediatley grant you a knighthood this would be in addition to the kcmg that you already hold as is usual i am writing now to accept this high honour before her majesty puts her seal upon it you should first send telegraphed confirmation of acceptance and then follow this with a formal written letter i am of course in full agreement with this award and send you my personal congratulations of course james bond was pleased above all he was pleased that m had been so complimentary about what he had done the rest of the message was not important to him he was not interested in medals or being able to write special letters after his name he had never been a public figure and he did not want to become one now there was one thing he treasured above everything else and that was his privacy so now james bond said to mary goodnight avoiding her eyes write down what i am about to say and send it in a telegram tonight all right yes of course replied goodnight with enthusiasm bond began top secret for ms eyes only your message has been received and greatly appreciated am informed by hospital that i shall be returning to london able to work in one month regarding the high honour please ask her majesty to allow me to refuse the honour that her majesty is kind enough to consider awarding her obedient servant my main reason for refusing this honour is that i do not want to pay more at hotels and restaurants mary goodnight interrupted bond horrified by what he was saying james it is your decision what you write in the rest of the letter but you really cant say that last part bond nodded if you say so lets change the whole of that last sentence to this i am a scottish peasant and will always feel comfortable being a scottish peasant and i know sir that you will understand my preference a formal letter will follow mary goodnight closed her notepad with a snap she looked at bond angrily well really james why dont we talk about this tomorrow you are clearly in a bad mood and might feel differently in the morning its just not my sort of thing bond told her apologetically i just refuse to call myself sir james bond its ridiculous and i know m will understand he thinks much the same way about these things as i do anyway im not going to change my mind so you can telegraph that straight away and ill write the letter this evening anything else well there is one thing james she said more softly the head nurse said you can leave hospital at the end of the week but that you really need to rest somewhere quiet for at least three weeks have you got any plans for where you might go you need to be near the hospital ive no idea what do you suggest enquired bond well er ive got a little villa up by mona dam she spoke more quickly now her cheeks reddening a little with embarrassment its got quite a nice spare room looking out over kingston harbour its cool up there you could relax and i would cook for you james bond looked at mary for a moment and said and meant it mary goodnight youre an angel at the same time he knew deep down that love from mary goodnight or from any other woman was not enough for him the kind of life he had led and the things he had seen had made bond quite different from most other men he knew he would always need something more although he would perhaps never know what exactly that something was the end
