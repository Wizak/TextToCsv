when the world screamed by sir arthur conan doyle i had a vague recollection of having heard my friend edward malone of the gazette speak of professor challenger with whom he had been associated in some remarkable adventures i am so busy however with my own profession and my firm has been so overtaxed with orders that i know little of what is going on in the world outside my own special interests my general recollection was that challenger has been depicted as a wild genius of a violent and intolerant disposition i was greatly surprised to receive a business communication from him which was in the following terms enmore gardens kensington sir i have occasion to engage the services of an expert in artesian borings i will not conceal from you that my opinion of experts is not a high one and that i have usually found that a man who like myself has a wellequipped brain can take a sounder and broader view than the man who professes a special knowledge which alas is so often a mere profession and is therefore limited in his outlook none the less i am disposed to give you a trial looking down the list of artesian authorities a certain oddity i had almost written absurdity in your name attracted my attention and i found upon inquiry that my young friend mr edward malone was actually acquainted with you i am therefore writing to say that i should be glad to have an interview with you and that if you satisfy my requirements and my standard is no mean one i may be inclined to put a most important matter into your hands i can say no more at present as the matter is of extreme secrecy which can only be discussed by word of mouth i beg therefore that you will at once cancel any engagement which you may happen to have and that you will call upon me at the above address at in the morning of next friday there is a scraper as well as a mat and mrs challenger is most particular i remain sir as i began george edward challenger i handed this letter to my chief clerk to answer and he informed the professor that mr peerless jones would be glad to keep the appointment as arranged it was a perfectly civil business note but it began with the phrase your letter has been received this drew a second epistle from the professor sir he said and his writing looked like a barbed wire fence i observe that you animadvert upon the trifle that my letter was undated might i draw your attention to the fact that as some return for a monstrous taxation our government is in the habit of affixing a small circular sign or stamp upon the outside on the envelope which notifies the date of posting should this sign be missing or illegible your remedy lies with the proper postal authorities meanwhile i would ask you to confine your observations to matters which concern the business over which i consult you and to cease to comment upon the form which my own letters may assume it was clear to me that i was dealing with a lunatic so i thought it well before i went any further in the matter to call upon my friend malone whom i had known since the old days when we both played rugger for richmond i found him the same jolly irishman as ever and much amused at my first brush with challenger thats nothing my boy said he youll feel as if you had been skinned alive when you have been with him five minutes he beats the world for offensiveness but why should the world put up with it they dont if you collected all the libel actions and all the rows and all the policecourt assaults assaults bless you he would think nothing of throwing you downstairs if you have a disagreement he is a primitive caveman in a lounge suit i can see him with a club in one hand and a jagged bit of flint in the other some people are born out of their proper century but he is born out of his millennium he belongs to the early neolithic or thereabouts and he a professor there is the wonder of it its the greatest brain in europe with a driving force behind it that can turn all his dreams into facts they do all they can to hold him back for his colleagues hate him like poison but a lot of trawlers might as well try to hold back the berengaria he simply ignores them and steams on his way well said i one thing is clear i dont want to have anything to do with him ill cancel that appointment not a bit of it you will keep it to the minuteand mind that it is to the minute or you will hear of it why should i well ill tell you first of all dont take too seriously what i have said about old challenger everyone who gets close to him learns to love him there is no real harm in the old bear why i remember how he carried an indian baby with the smallpox on his back for a hundred miles from the back country down to the madeira river he is big every way he wont hurt if you get right with him i wont give him the chance you will be a fool if you dont have you ever heard of the hengist down mysterythe shaftsinking on the south coast some secret coalmining exploration i understand malone winked well you can put it down as that if you like you see i am in the old mans confidence and i cant say anything until he gives the word but i may tell you this for it has been in the press a man betterton who made his money in rubber left his whole estate to challenger some years ago with the provision that it should be used in the interests of science it proved to be an enormous sum several millions challenger then bought a property at hengist down in sussex it was worthless land on the north edge of the chalk country and he got a large tract of it which he wired off there was a deep gully in the middle of it here he began to make an excavation he announced here malone winked again that there was petroleum in england and that he meant to prove it he built a little model village with a colony of wellpaid workers who are all sworn to keep their mouths shut the gully is wired off as well as the estate and the place is guarded by bloodhounds several pressmen have nearly lost their lives to say nothing of the seats of their trousers from these creatures its a big operation and sir thomas mordens firm has it in hand but they also are sworn to secrecy clearly the time has come when artesian help is needed now would you not be foolish to refuse such a job as that with all the interest and experience and a big fat cheque at the end of it to say nothing of rubbing shoulders with the most wonderful man you have ever met or are ever likely to meet malones arguments prevailed and friday morning found me on my way to enmore gardens i took such particular care to be in time that i found myself at the door twenty minutes too soon i was waiting in the street when it struck me that i recognized the rolls royce with the silver arrow mascot at the door it was certainly that of jack devonshire the junior partner of the great morden firm i had always known him as the most urbane of men so that it was rather a shock to me when he suddenly appeared and standing outside the door he raised both his hands to heaven and said with great fervour damn him oh damn him what is up jack you seem peeved this morning hullo peerless are you in on this job too there seems a chance of it well you find it chastening to the temper rather more so than yours can stand apparently well i should say so the butlers message to me was the professor desired me to say sir that he was rather busy at present eating an egg and that if you would call at some more convenient time he would very likely see you that was the message delivered by a servant i may add that i had called to collect fortytwo thousand pounds that he owes us i whistled you cant get your money oh yes he is all right about money ill do the old gorilla the justice to say that he is open handed with money but he pays when he likes and how he likes and he cares for nobody however you go and try your luck and see how you like it with that he flung himself into his motor and was off i waited with occasional glances at my watch until the zero hour should arrive i am if i may say so a fairly hefty individual and a runnerup for the belsize boxing club middleweights but i have never faced an interview with such trepidation as this it was not physical for i was confident i could hold my own if this inspired lunatic should attack me but it was a mixture of feelings in which fear of some public scandal and dread of losing a lucrative contract were mingled however things are always easier when imagination ceases and action begins i snapped up my watch and made for the door it was opened by an old woodenfaced butler a man who bore an expression or an absence of expression which gave the impression that he was so inured to shocks that nothing on earth would surprise him by appointment sir he asked certainly he glanced at a list in his hand your name sir quite so mr peerless jones tenthirty everything is in order we have to be careful mr jones for we are much annoyed by journalists the professor as you may be aware does not approve of the press this way sir professor challenger is now receiving the next instant i found myself in the presence i believe that my friend ted malone has described the man in his lost world yarn better than i can hope to do so ill leave it at that all i was aware of was a huge trunk of a man behind a mahogany desk with a great spadeshaped black beard and two large grey eyes half covered with insolent drooping eyelids his big head sloped back his beard bristled forward and his whole appearance conveyed one single impression of arrogant intolerance well what the devil do you want was written all over him i laid my card on the table ah yes he said picking it up and handling it as if he disliked the smell of it of course you are the expert socalled mr jones mr peerless jones you may thank your godfather mr jones for it was this ludicrous prefix which first drew my attention to you i am here professor challenger for a business interview and not to discuss my own name said i with all the dignity i could master dear me you seem to be a very touchy person mr jones your nerves are in a highly irritable condition we must walk warily in dealing with you mr jones pray sit down and compose yourself i have been reading your little brochure upon the reclaiming of the sinai peninsula did you write it yourself naturally sir my name is on it quite so quite so but it does not always follow does it however i am prepared to accept your assertion the book is not without merit of a sort beneath the dullness of the diction one gets glimpses of an occasional idea there are germs of thought here and there are you a married man no sir i am not then there is some chance of your keeping a secret if i promised to do so i would certainly keep my promise so you say my young friend malone he spoke as if ted were ten years of age has a good opinion of you he says that i may trust you this trust is a very great one for i am engaged just now in one of the greatest experiments i may even say the greatest experiment in the history of the world i ask for your participation i shall be honoured it is indeed an honour i will admit that i should have shared my labours with no one were it not that the gigantic nature of the undertaking calls for the highest technical skill now mr jones having obtained your promise of inviolable secrecy i come down to the essential point it is thisthat the world upon which we live is itself a living organism endowed as i believe with a circulation a respiration and a nervous system of its own clearly the man was a lunatic your brain i observe he continued fails to register but it will gradually absorb the idea you will recall how a moor or heath resembles the hairy side of a giant animal a certain analogy runs through all nature you will then consider the secular rise and fall of land which indicates the slow respiration of the creature finally you will note the fidgetings and scratchings which appear to our lilliputian perceptions as earthquakes and convulsions what about volcanoes i asked tut tut they correspond to the heat spots upon our own bodies my brain whirled as i tried to find some answer to these monstrous contentions the temperature i cried is it not a fact that it rises rapidly as one descends and that the centre of the earth is liquid heat he waved my assertion aside you are probably aware sir since council schools are now compulsory that the earth is flattened at the poles this means that the pole is nearer to the centre than any other point and would therefore be most affected by this heat of which you spoke it is notorious of course that the conditions of the poles are tropical is it not the whole idea is utterly new to me of course it is it is the privilege of the original thinker to put forward ideas which are new and usually unwelcome to the common clay now sir what is this he held up a small object which he had picked from the table i should say it is a seaurchin exactly he cried with an air of exaggerated surprise as when an infant has done something clever it is a seaurchin a common echinus nature repeats itself in many forms regardless of the size this echinus is a model a prototype of the world you perceive that it is roughly circular but flattened at the poles let us then regard the world as a huge echinus what are your objections my chief objection was that the thing was too absurd for argument but i did not dare to say so i fished around for some less sweeping assertion a living creature needs food i said where could the world sustain its huge bulk an excellent pointexcellent said the professor with a huge air of patronage you have a quick eye for the obvious though you are slow in realizing the more subtle implications how does the world get nourishment again we turn to our little friend the echinus the water which surrounds it flows through the tubes of this small creature and provides its nutrition then you think that the water no sir the ether the earth browses upon a circular path in the fields of space and as it moves the ether is continually pouring through it and providing its vitality quite a flock of other little worldechini are doing the same thing venus mars and the rest each with its own field for grazing the man was clearly mad but there was no arguing with him he accepted my silence as agreement and smiled at me in most beneficent fashion we are coming on i perceive said he light is beginning to break in a little dazzling at first no doubt but we will soon get used to it pray give me your attention while i found one or two more observations upon this little creature in my hand we will suppose that on this outer hard rind there were certain infinitely small insects which crawled upon the surface would the echinus ever be aware of their existence i should say not you can well imagine then that the earth has not the least idea of the way in which it is utilized by the human race it is quite unaware of this fungus growth of vegetation and evolution of tiny animalcules which has collected upon it during its travels round the sun as barnacles gather upon the ancient vessel that is the present state of affairs and that is what i propose to alter i stared in amazement you propose to alter it i propose to let the earth know that there is at least one person george edward challenger who calls for attention who indeed insists upon attention it is certainly the first intimation it has ever had of the sort and how sir will you do this ah there we get down to business you have touched the spot i will again call your attention to this interesting little creature which i hold in my hand it is all nerves and sensibility beneath that protective crust is it not evident that if a parasitic animalcule desired to call its attention it would sink a hole in its shell and so stimulate its sensory apparatus certainly or again we will take the case of the homely flea or a mosquito which explores the surface of the human body we may be unaware of its presence but presently when it sinks its proboscis through the skin which is our crust we are disagreeably reminded that we are not altogether alone my plans now will no doubt begin to dawn upon you light breaks in the darkness good heavens you propose to sink a shaft through the earths crust he closed his eyes with ineffable complacency you see before you he said the first who will ever pierce that horny hide i may even put it in the present tense and say who has pierced it you have done it with the very efficient aid of morden and think i may say that i have done it several years of constant work which has been carried on night and day and conducted by every known species of drill borer crusher and explosive has at last brought us to our goal you dont mean to say you are through the crust if your expressions denote bewilderment they may pass if they denote incredulity no sir nothing of the kind you will accept my statement without question we are through the crust it was exactly fourteen thousand four hundred and fortytwo yards thick or roughly eight miles in the course of our sinking it may interest you to know that we have exposed a fortune in the matter of coalbeds which would probably in the long run defray the cost of the enterprise our chief difficulty has been the springs of water in the lower chalk and hastings sands but these we have overcome the last stage has now been reached and the last stage is none other than mr peerless jones you sir represent the mosquito your artesian borer takes the place of the stinging proboscis the brain has done its work exit the thinker enter the mechanical one the peerless one with his rod of metal do i make myself clear you talk of eight miles i cried are you aware sir that five thousand feet is considered nearly the limit for artesian borings i am acquainted with one in upper silesia which is six thousand two hundred feet deep but it is looked upon as a wonder you misunderstand me mr peerless either my explanation or your brain is at fault and i will not insist upon which i am well aware of the limits of artesian borings and it is not likely that i would have spent millions of pounds upon my colossal tunnel if a sixinch boring would have met my needs all that i ask you is to have a drill ready which shall be as sharp as possible not more than a hundred feet in length and operated by an electric motor an ordinary percussion drill driven home by a weight will meet every requirement why by an electric motor i am here mr jones to give orders not reasons before we finish it may happen it may i say happen that your very life may depend upon this drill being started from a distance by electricity it can i presume be done certainly it can be done then prepare to do it the matter is not yet ready for your actual presence but your preparations may now be made i have nothing more to say but it is essential i expostulated that you should let me know what soil the drill is to penetrate sand or clay or chalk would each need different treatment let us say jelly said challenger yes we will for the present suppose that you have to sink your drill into jelly and now mr jones i have matters of some importance to engage my mind so i will wish you good morning you can draw up a formal contract with mention of your charges for my head of works i bowed and turned but before i reached the door my curiosity overcame me he was already writing furiously with a quill pen screeching over the paper and he looked up angrily at my interruption well sir what now i had hoped you were gone i only wished to ask you sir what the object of so extraordinary an experiment can be away sir away he cried angrily raise your mind above the base mercantile and utilitarian needs of commerce shake off your paltry standards of business science seeks knowledge let the knowledge lead us where it will we still must seek it to know once for all what we are why we are where we are is that not in itself the greatest of all human aspirations away sir away his great black head was bowed over his papers once more and blended with his beard the quill pen screeched more shrilly than ever so i left him this extraordinary man with my head in a whirl at the thought of the strange business in which i now found myself to be his partner when i got back to my office i found ted malone waiting with a broad grin upon his face to know the result of my interview well he cried none the worse no case of assault and battery you must have handled him very tactfully what do you think of the old boy the most aggravating insolent intolerant selfopinionated man i have ever met but exactly cried malone we all come to that but of course he is all you say and a lot more but one feels that so big a man is not to be measured in our scale and that we can endure from him what we would not stand from any other living mortal is that not so well i dont know him well enough yet to say but i will admit that if he is not a mere bullying megalomaniac and if what he says is true then he certainly is in a class by himself but is it true of course it is true challenger always delivers the goods now where are you exactly in the matter has he told you about hengist down yes in a sketchy sort of way well you may take it from me that the whole thing is colossal colossal in conception and colossal in execution he hates pressmen but i am in his confidence for he knows that i will publish no more than he authorizes therefore i have his plans or some of his plans he is such a deep old bird that one never is sure if one has really touched bottom anyhow i know enough to assure you that hengist down is a practical proposition and nearly completed my advice to you now is simply to await events and meanwhile to get your gear all ready youll hear soon enough either from him or from me as it happened it was from malone himself that i heard he came round quite early to my office some weeks later as the bearer of a message ive come from challenger said he you are like the pilot fish to the shark im proud to be anything to him he really is a wonder he has done it all right its your turn now and then he is ready to ring up the curtain well i cant believe it until i see it but i have everything ready and loaded on a lorry i could start it off at any moment then do so at once ive given you a tremendous character for energy and punctuality so mind you dont let me down in the meantime come down with me by rail and i will give you an idea of what has to be done it was a lovely spring morning may nd to be exact when we made that fateful journey which brought me on to a stage which is destined to be historical on the way malone handed me a note from challenger which i was to accept as my instructions sir upon arriving at hengist down you will put yourself at the disposal of mr barforth the chief engineer who is in possession of my plans my young friend malone the bearer of this is also in touch with me and may protect me from any personal contact we have now experienced certain phenomena in the shaft at and below the fourteen thousandfoot level which fully bear out my views as to the nature of a planetary body but some more sensational proof is needed before i can hope to make an impression upon the torpid intelligence of the modern scientific world that proof you are destined to afford and they to witness as you descend in the lifts you will observe presuming that you have the rare quality of observation that you pass in succession the secondary chalk beds the coal measures some devonian and cambrian indications and finally the granite through which the greater part of our tunnel is conducted the bottom is now covered with tarpaulin which i order you not to tamper with as any clumsy handling of the sensitive inner cuticle of the earth might bring about premature results at my instruction two strong beams have been laid across the shaft twenty feet above the bottom with a space between them this space will act as a clip to hold up your artesian tube fifty feet of drill will suffice twenty of which will project below the beams so that the point of the drill comes nearly down to the tarpaulin as you value your life do not let it go further thirty feet will then project upwards in the shaft and when you have released it we may assume that not less than forty feet of drill will bury itself in the earths substance as this substance is very soft i find that you will probably need no driving power and that simply a release of the tube will suffice by its own weight to drive it into the layer which we have uncovered these instructions would seem to be sufficient for any ordinary intelligence but i have little doubt that you will need more which can be referred to me through our young friend malone george edward challenger it can be imagined that when we arrived at the station of storrington near the northern foot of the south downs i was in a state of considerable nervous tension a weatherworn vauxhall thirty landaulette was awaiting us and bumped us for six or seven miles over bypaths and lanes which in spite of their natural seclusion were deeply rutted and showed every sign of heavy traffic a broken lorry lying in the grass at one point showed that others had found it rough going as well as we once a huge piece of machinery which seemed to be the valves and piston of a hydraulic pump projected itself all rusted from a clump of furze thats challengers doing said malone grinning said it was onetenth of an inch out of estimate so he simply chucked it by the wayside with a lawsuit to follow no doubt a lawsuit my dear chap we should have a court of our own we have enough to keep a judge busy for a year government too the old devil cares for no one rex v george challenger and george challenger v rex a nice devils dance the two will have from one court to another well here we are all right jenkins you can let us in a huge man with a notable cauliflower ear was peering into the car a scowl of suspicion upon his face he relaxed and saluted as he recognized my companion all right mr malone i thought it was the american associated press oh they are on the track are they they today and the times yesterday oh they are buzzing round proper look at that he indicated a distant dot upon the skyline see that glint thats the telescope of the chicago daily news yes they are fair after us now ive seen em in rows same as the crows along the beacon yonder poor old press gang said malone as we entered a gate in a formidable barbed wire fence i am one of them myself and i know how it feels at this moment we heard a plaintive bleat behind us of malone ted malone it came from a fat little man who had just arrived upon a motorbike and was at present struggling in the herculean grasp of the gatekeeper here let me go he sputtered keep your hands off malone call off this gorilla of yours let him go jenkins hes a friend of mine cried malone well old bean what is it what are you after in these parts fleet street is your stamping ground not the wilds of sussex you know what i am after perfectly well said our visitor ive got the assignment to write a story about hengist down and i cant go home without the copy sorry roy but you cant get anything here youll have to stay on that side of the wire if you want more you must go and see professor challenger and get his leave ive been said the journalist ruefully i went this morning well what did he say he said he would put me through the window malone laughed and what did you say i said whats wrong with the door and i skipped through it just to show there was nothing wrong with it it was no time for argument i just went what with that bearded assyrian bull in london and this thug down here who has ruined my clean celluloid you seem to be keeping queer company ted malone i cant help you roy i would if i could they say in fleet street that you have never been beaten but you are up against it this time get back to the office and if you just wait a few days ill give you the news as soon as the old man allows no chance of getting in not an earthly money no object you should know better than to say that they tell me its a short cut to new zealand it will be a short cut to the hospital if you butt in here roy goodbye now we have some work to do of our own thats roy perkins the war correspondent said malone as we walked across the compound weve broken his record for he is supposed to be undefeatable its his fat little innocent face that carries him through everything we were on the same staff once now there he pointed to a cluster of pleasant redroofed bungalows are the quarters of the men they are a splendid lot of picked workers who are paid far above ordinary rates they have to be bachelors and teetotallers and under oath of secrecy i dont think there has been any leakage up to now that field is their football ground and the detached house is their library and recreation room the old man is some organizer i can assure you this is mr barforth the head engineerincharge a long thin melancholy man with deep lines of anxiety upon his face had appeared before us i expect you are the artesian engineer said he in a gloomy voice i was told to expect you i am glad youve come for i dont mind telling you that the responsibility of this thing is getting on my nerves we work away and i never know if its a gush of chalk water or a seam of coal or a squirt of petroleum or maybe a touch of hell fire that is coming next weve been spared the last up to now but you may make the connection for all i know is it so hot down there well its hot theres no denying it and yet maybe it is not hotter than the barometric pressure and the confined space might account for of course the ventilation is awful we pump the air down but twohour shifts are the most the men can do and they are willing lads too the professor was down yesterday and he was very pleased with it all you had best join us at lunch and then you will see it for yourself after a hurried and frugal meal we were introduced with loving assiduity upon the part of the manager to the contents of his enginehouse and to the miscellaneous scrapheap of disused implements with which the grass was littered on one side was a huge dismantled arrol hydraulic shovel with which the first excavations had been rapidly made beside it was a great engine which worked a continuous steel rope on which the skips were fastened which drew up the debris by successive stages from the bottom of the shaft in the powerhouse were several escher wyss turbines of great horsepower running at one hundred and forty revolutions a minute and governing hydraulic accumulators which evolved a pressure of fourteen hundred pounds per square inch passing in threeinch pipes down the shaft and operating four rock drills with hollow cutters of the brandt type abutting upon the enginehouse was the electric house supplying power for a very large lighting instalment and next to that again was an extra turbine of two hundred horsepower which drove a tenfoot fan forcing air down a twelveinch pipe to the bottom of the workings all these wonders were shown with many technical explanations by their proud operator who was well on his way to boring me stiff as i may in turn have done my reader there came a welcome interruption however when i heard the roar of wheels and rejoiced to see my leyland threetonner come rolling and heaving over the grass heaped up with tools and sections of tubing and bearing my foreman peters and a very grimy assistant in front the two of them set to work at once to unload my stuff and to carry it in leaving them at their work the manager with malone and myself approached the shaft it was a wondrous place on a very much larger scale than i had imagined the spoil banks which represented the thousands of tons removed had been built up into a great horseshoe around it which now made a considerable hill in the concavity of this horseshoe composed of chalk clay coal and granite there rose up a bristle of iron pillars and wheels from which the pumps and the lifts were operated they connected with the brick power building which filled up the gap in the horseshoe beyond it lay the open mouth of the shaft a huge yawning pit some thirty or forty feet in diameter lined and topped with brick and cement as i craned my neck over the side and gazed down into the dreadful abyss which i had been assured was eight miles deep my brain reeled at the thought of what it represented the sunlight struck the mouth of it diagonally and i could only see some hundreds of yards of dirty white chalk bricked here and there where the surface had seemed unstable even as i looked however i saw far far down in the darkness a tiny speck of light the smallest possible dot but clear and steady against the inky background what is that light i asked malone bent over the parapet beside me thats one of the cages coming up said he rather wonderful is it not that is a mile or more from us and that little gleam is a powerful arc lamp it travels quickly and will be here in a few minutes sure enough the pinpoint of light came larger and larger until it flooded the tube with its silvery radiance and i had to turn away my eyes from its blinding glare a moment later the iron cage clashed up to the landing stage and four men crawled out of it and passed on to the entrance nearly all in said malone it is no joke to do a twohour shift at that depth well some of your stuff is ready to hand here i suppose the best thing we can do is to go down then you will be able to judge the situation for yourself there was an annexe to the enginehouse into which he led me a number of baggy suits of the lightest tussore material were hanging from the wall following malones example i took off every stitch of my clothes and put on one of these suits together with a pair of rubbersoled slippers malone finished before i did and left the dressingroom a moment later i heard a noise like ten dogfights rolled into one and rushing out i found my friend rolling on the ground with his arms round the workman who was helping to stack my artesian tubing he was endeavouring to tear something from him to which the other was most desperately clinging but malone was too strong for him tore the object out of his grasp and danced upon it until it was shattered to pieces only then did i recognize that it was a photographic camera my grimyfaced artisan rose ruefully from the floor confound you ted malone said he that was a new tenguinea machine cant help it roy i saw you take the snap and there was only one thing to do how the devil did you get mixed up with my outfit i asked with righteous indignation the rascal winked and grinned there are always and means said he but dont blame your foreman he thought it was just a rag i swapped clothes with his assistant and in i came and out you go said malone no use arguing roy if challenger were here he would set the dogs on you ive been in a hole myself so i wont be hard but i am watchdog here and i can bite as well as bark come on out you march so our enterprising visitor was marched by two grinning workmen out of the compound so now the public will at last understand the genesis of that wonderful fourcolumn article headed mad dream of a scientist with the subtitle a beeline to australia which appeared in the adviser some days later and brought challenger to the verge of apoplexy and the editor of the adviser to the most disagreeable and dangerous interview of his lifetime the article was a highly coloured and exaggerated account of the adventure of roy perkins our experienced war correspondent and it contained such purple passages as this hirsute bully of enmore gardens a compound guarded by barbed wire pluguglies and bloodhounds and finally i was dragged from the edge of the angloaustralian tunnel by two ruffians the more savage being a jackofall trades whom i had previously known by sight as a hangeron of the journalistic profession while the other a sinister figure in a strange tropical garb was posing as an artesian engineer though his appearance was more reminiscent of whitechapel having ticked us off in this way the rascal had an elaborate description of rails at the pit mouth and of a zigzag excavation by which funicular trains were to burrow into the earth the only practical inconvenience arising from the article was that it notably increased that line of loafers who sat upon the south downs waiting for something to happen the day came when it did happen and when they wished themselves elsewhere my foreman with his faked assistant had littered the place with all my apparatus my bellbox my crowsfoot the vdrills the rods and the weight but malone insisted that we disregard all that and descend ourselves to the lowest level to this end we entered the cage which was of latticed steel and in the company of the chief engineer we shot down into the bowels of the earth there were a series of automatic lifts each with its own operating station hollowed out in the side of the excavation they operated with great speed and the experience was more like a vertical railway journey than the deliberate fall which we associate with the british lift since the cage was latticed and brightly illuminated we had a clear view of the strata which we passed i was conscious of each of them as we flashed past there were the sallow lower chalk the coffeecoloured hastings beds the lighter ashburnham beds the dark carboniferous clays and then gleaming in the electric light band after band of jetblack sparkling coal alternating with the rings of clay here and there brickwork had been inserted but as a rule the shaft was selfsupported and one could but marvel at the immense labour and mechanical skill which it represented beneath the coalbeds i was conscious of jumbled strata of a concretelike appearance and then we shot down into the primitive granite where the quartz crystals gleamed and twinkled as if the dark walls were sown with the dust of diamonds down we went and ever down lower now than ever mortals had ever before penetrated the archaic rocks varied wonderfully in colour and i can never forget one broad belt of rosecoloured felspar which shone with an unearthly beauty before our powerful lamps stage after stage and lift after lift the air getting ever closer and hotter until even the light tussore garments were intolerable and the sweat was pouring down into those rubbersoled slippers at last just as i was thinking that i could stand it no more the last lift came to a stand and we stepped out upon a circular platform which had been cut in the rock i noticed that malone gave a curiously suspicious glance round at the walls as he did so if i did not know him to be amongst the bravest of men i should say that he was exceedingly nervous funnylooking stuff said the chief engineer passing his hand over the nearest section of rock he held it to the light and showed that it was glistening with a curious slimy scum there have been shiverings and tremblings down here i dont know what we are dealing with the professor seems pleased with it but its all new to me i am bound to say ive seen that wall fairly shake itself said malone last time i was down here we fixed those two crossbeams for your drill and when we cut into it for the supports it winced at every stroke the old mans theory seemed absurd in solid old london town but down here eight miles under the surface i am not so sure about it if you saw what was under that tarpaulin you would be even less sure said the engineer all this lower rock cut like cheese and when we were through it we came on a new formation like nothing on earth cover it up dont touch it said the professor so we tarpaulined it according to his instructions and there it lies could we not have a look a frightened expression came over the engineers lugubrious countenance its no joke disobeying the professor said he he is so damn cunning too that you never know what check he has set on you however well have a peep and chance it he turned down our reflector lamp so that the light gleamed upon the black tarpaulin then he stooped and seizing a rope which connected up with the corner of the covering he disclosed halfadozen square yards of the surface beneath it it was a most extraordinary and terrifying sight the floor consisted of some greyish material glazed and shiny which rose and fell in slow palpitation the throbs were not direct but gave the impression of a gentle ripple or rhythm which ran across the surface this surface itself was not entirely homogeneous but beneath it seen as through ground glass there were dim whitish patches or vacuoles which varied constantly in shape and size we stood all three gazing spellbound at this extraordinary sight does look rather like a skinned animal said malone in an awed whisper the old man may not be so far out with his blessed echinus good lord i cried and am i to plunge a harpoon into that beast thats your privilege my son said malone and sad to relate unless i give it a miss in baulk i shall have to be at your side when you do it well i wont said the head engineer with decision i was never clearer on anything than i am on that if the old man insists then i resign my portfolio good lord look at that the grey surface gave a sudden heave upwards welling towards us as a wave does when you look down from the bulwarks then it subsided and the dim beatings and throbbings continued as before barforth lowered the rope and replaced the tarpaulin seemed almost as if it knew we were here said he why should it swell up towards us like that i expect the light had some sort of effect upon it what am i expected to do now i asked mr barforth pointed to two beams which lay across the pit just under the stopping place of the lift there was an interval of about nine inches between them that was the old mans idea said he i think i could have fixed it better but you might as well try to argue with a mad buffalo it is easier and safer just to do whatever he says his idea is that you should use your sixinch bore and fasten it in some way between these supports well i dont think there would be much difficulty about that i answered ill take the job over as from today it was as one might imagine the strangest experience of my very varied life which has included wellsinking in every continent upon earth as professor challenger was so insistent that the operation should be started from a distance and as i began to see a good deal of sense in his contention i had to plan some method of electric control which was easy enough as the pit was wired from top to bottom with infinite care my foreman peters and i brought down our lengths of tubing and stacked them on the rocky ledge then we raised the stage of the lowest lift so as to give ourselves room as we proposed to use the percussion system for it would not do to trust entirely to gravity we hung our hundredpound weight over a pulley beneath the lift and ran our tubes down beneath it with a vshaped terminal finally the rope which held the weight was secured to the side of the shaft in such a way that an electrical discharge would release it it was delicate and difficult work done in a more than tropical heat and with the everpresent feeling that a slip of a foot or the dropping of a tool upon the tarpaulin beneath us might bring about some inconceivable catastrophe we were awed too by our surroundings again and again i have seen a strange quiver and shiver pass down the walls and have even felt a dull throb against my hands as i touched them neither peters nor i were very sorry when we signalled for the last time that we were ready for the surface and were able to report to mr barforth that professor challenger could make his experiment as soon as he chose and it was not long that we had to wait only three days after my date of completion my notice arrived it was an ordinary invitation card such as one uses for at homes and it ran thus professor g e challenger frs md dsc etc late president zoological institute and holder of so many honorary degrees and appointments that they overtax the capacity of this card requests the attendance of mr jones at am of tuesday june st to witness a remarkable triumph of mind over matter at hengist down sussex special train victoria passengers pay their own fares lunch after the experiment or not according to circumstances station storrington rsvp enmore gardens sw i found that malone had just received a similar missive over which he was chuckling it is mere swank sending it to us said he we have to be there whatever happens as the hangman said to the murderer but i tell you this has set all london buzzing the old man is where he likes to be with a pinpoint limelight right on his hairy old head and so at last the great day came personally i thought it well to go down the night before so as to be sure that everything was in order our borer was fixed in position the weight was adjusted the electric contacts could be easily switched on and i was satisfied that my own part in this strange experiment would be carried out without a hitch the electric controls were operated at a point some five hundred yards from the mouth of the shaft to minimize any personal danger when on the fateful morning an ideal english summer day i came to the surface with my mind assured i climbed halfway up the slope of the down in order to have a general view of the proceedings all the world seemed to be coming to hengist down as far as we could see the roads were dotted with people motorcars came bumping and swaying down the lanes and discharged their passengers at the gate of the compound this was in most cases the end of their progress a powerful band of janitors waited at the entrance and no promises or bribes but only the production of the coveted buff tickets could get them any farther they dispersed therefore and joined the vast crowd which was already assembling on the side of the hill and covering the ridge with a dense mass of spectators the place was like epsom downs on the derby day inside the compound certain areas had been wiredoff and the various privileged people were conducted to the particular pen to which they had been allotted there was one for peers one for members of the house of commons and one for the heads of learned societies and the men of fame in the scientific world including le pellier of the sorbonne and dr driesinger of the berlin academy a special reserved enclosure with sandbags and a corrugated iron roof was set aside for three members of the royal family at a quarter past eleven a succession of charsabancs brought up speciallyinvited guests from the station and i went down into the compound to assist at the reception professor challenger stood by the select enclosure resplendent in frockcoat white waistcoat and burnished tophat his expression a blend of overpowering and almost offensive benevolence mixed with most portentous selfimportance clearly a typical victim of the jehovah complex as one of his critics described him he assisted in conducting and occasionally in propelling his guests into their proper places and then having gathered the elite of the company around him he took his station upon the top of a convenient hillock and looked around him with the air of the chairman who expects some welcoming applause as none was forthcoming he plunged at once into his subject his voice booming to the farthest extremities of the enclosure gentlemen he roared upon this occasion i have no need to include the ladies if i have not invited them to be present with us this morning it is not i can assure you for want of appreciation for i may say with elephantine humour and mock modesty that the relations between us upon both sides have always been excellent and indeed intimate the real reason is that some small element of danger is involved in our experiment though it is not sufficient to justify the discomposure which i see upon many of your faces it will interest the members of the press to know that i have reserved very special seats for them upon the spoil banks which immediately overlook the scene of the operation they have shown an interest which is sometimes indistinguishable from impertinence in my affairs so that on this occasion at least they cannot complain that i have been remiss in studying their convenience if nothing happens which is always possible i have at least done my best for them if on the other hand something does happen they will be in an excellent position to experience and record it should they ultimately feel equal to the task it is as you will readily understand impossible for a man of science to explain to what i may describe without undue disrespect as the common herd the various reasons for his conclusions or his actions i hear some unmannerly interruptions and i will ask the gentleman with the horn spectacles to cease waving his umbrella a voice your description of your guests sir is most offensive possibly it is my phrase the common herd which has ruffled the gentleman let us say then that my listeners are a most uncommon herd we will not quibble over phrases i was about to say before i was interrupted by this unseemly remark that the whole matter is very fully and lucidly discussed in my forthcoming volume upon the earth which i may describe with all due modesty as one of the epochmaking books of the worlds history general interruption and cries of get down to the facts what are we here for is this a practical joke i was about to make the matter clear and if i have any further interruption i shall be compelled to take means to preserve decency and order the lack of which is so painfully obvious the position is then that i have sunk a shaft through the crust of the earth and that i am about to try the effect of a vigorous stimulation of its sensory cortex a delicate operation which will be carried out by my subordinates mr peerless jones a selfstyled expert in artesian borings and mr edward malone who represents myself upon this occasion the exposed and sensitive substance will be pricked and how it will react is a matter for conjecture if you will now kindly take your seats these two gentlemen will descend into the pit and make the final adjustments i will then press the electric button upon this table and the experiment will be complete an audience after one of challengers harangues usually felt as if like the earth its protective epidermis had been pierced and its nerves laid bare this assembly was no exception and there was a dull murmur of criticism and resentment as they returned to their places challenger sat alone on the top of the mound a small table beside him his black mane and beard vibrating with excitement a most portentous figure neither malone nor i could admire the scene however for we hurried off upon our extraordinary errand twenty minutes later we were at the bottom of the shaft and had pulled the tarpaulin from the exposed surface it was an amazing sight which lay before us by some strange cosmic telepathy the old planet seemed to know that an unheardof liberty was about to be attempted the exposed surface was like a boiling pot great grey bubbles rose and burst with a crackling report the airspaces and vacuoles below the skin separated and coalesced in an agitated activity the transverse ripples were stronger and faster in their rhythm than before a dark purple fluid appeared to pulse in the tortuous anastomoses of channels which lay under the surface the throb of life was in it all a heavy smell made the air hardly fit for human lungs my gaze was fixed upon this strange spectacle when malone at my elbow gave a sudden gasp of alarm my god jones he cried look there i gave one glance and the next instant i released the electric connection and i sprang into the lift come on i cried it may be a race for life what we had seen was indeed alarming the whole lower shaft it would seem had shared in the increased activity which we had observed below and the walls were throbbing and pulsing in sympathy this movement had reacted upon the holes in which the beams rested and it was clear that a very little further retraction a matter of inches the beams would fall if they did so then the sharp end of my rod would of course penetrate the earth quite independently of the electric release before that happened it was vital that malone and i should be out of the shaft to be eight miles down in the earth with the chance any instant of some extraordinary convulsion taking place was a terrible prospect we fled wildly for the surface shall either of us ever forget that nightmare journey the lifts whizzed and buzzed and yet the minutes seemed to be hours as we reached each stage we sprang out jumped into the next lift touched the release and flew onwards through the steel latticed roof we could see far away the little circle of light which marked the mouth of the shaft now it grew wider and wider until it came full circle and our glad eyes rested upon the brickwork of the opening up we shot and up and then at last in a glad moment of joy and thankfulness we sprang out of our prison and had our feet upon the green sward once more but it was touch and go we had not gone thirty paces from the shaft when far down in the depths my iron dart shot into the nerve ganglion of old mother earth and the great moment had arrived what was it happened neither malone nor i was in a position to say for both of us were swept off our feet as by a cyclone and swirled along the grass revolving round and round like two curling stones upon an ice rink at the same time our ears were assailed by the most horrible yell that ever yet was heard who is there of all the hundreds who have attempted it who has ever yet described adequately that terrible cry it was a howl in which pain anger menace and the outraged majesty of nature all blended into one hideous shriek for a full minute it lasted a thousand sirens in one paralysing all the great multitude with its fierce insistence and floating away through the still summer air until it went echoing along the whole south coast and even reached our french neighbours across the channel no sound in history has ever equalled the cry of the injured earth dazed and deafened malone and i were aware of the shock and of the sound but it is from the narrative of others that we learned the other details of that extraordinary scene the first emergence from the bowels of the earth consisted of the lift cages the other machinery being against the walls escaped the blast but the solid floors of the cages took the full force of the upward current when several separate pellets are placed in a blowpipe they still shoot forth in their order and separately from each other so the fourteen lift cages appeared one after the other in the air each soaring after the other and describing a glorious parabola which landed one of them in the sea near worthing pier and a second one in a field not far from chichester spectators have averred that of all the strange sights that they had ever seen nothing could exceed that of the fourteen lift cages sailing serenely through the blue heavens then came the geyser it was an enormous spout of vile treacly substance of the consistence of tar which shot up into the air to a height which has been computed at two thousand feet an inquisitive aeroplane which had been hovering over the scene was picked off as by an archie and made a forced landing man and machine buried in filth this horrible stuff which had a most penetrating and nauseous odour may have represented the life blood of the planet or it may be as professor driesinger and the berlin school maintain that it is a protective secretion analogous to that of the skunk which nature has provided in order to defend mother earth from intrusive challengers if that were so the prime offender seated on his throne upon the hillock escaped untarnished while the unfortunate press were so soaked and saturated being in the direct line of fire that none of them was capable of entering decent society for many weeks this gush of putridity was blown southwards by the breeze and descended upon the unhappy crowd who had waited so long and so patiently upon the crest of the downs to see what would happen there were no casualties no home was left desolate but many were made odoriferous and still carry within their walls some souvenir of that great occasion and then came the closing of the pit as nature slowly closes a wound from below upwards so does the earth with extreme rapidity mend any rent which is made in its vital substance there was a prolonged highpitched crash as the sides of the shaft came together the sound reverberating from the depths and then rising higher and higher until with a deafening bang the brick circle at the orifice flattened out and clashed together while a tremor like a small earthquake shook down the spoil banks and piled a pyramid fifty feet high of debris and broken iron over the spot where the hole had been professor challengers experiment was not only finished it was buried from human sight for ever if it were not for the obelisk which has now been erected by the royal society it is doubtful if our descendants would ever know the exact site of that remarkable occurrence and then came the grand finale for a long period after these successive phenomena there was a hush and a tense stillness as folk reassembled their wits and tried to realize exactly what had occurred and how it had come about and then suddenly the mighty achievement the huge sweep of the conception the genius and wonder of the execution broke upon their minds with one impulse they turned upon challenger from every part of the field there came the cries of admiration and from his hillock he could look down upon the lake of upturned faces broken only by the rise and fall of the waving handkerchiefs as i look back i see him best as i saw him then he rose from his chair his eyes half closed a smile of conscious merit upon his face his left hand upon his hip his right buried in the breast of his frockcoat surely that picture will be fixed for ever for i heard the cameras clicking round me like crickets in a field the june sun shone golden upon him as he turned gravely bowing to each quarter of the compass challenger the super scientist challenger the archpioneer challenger the first man of all men whom mother earth had been compelled to recognize only a word by way of epilogue it is of course well known that the effect of the experiment was a worldwide one it is true that nowhere did the injured planet emit such a howl as at the actual point of penetration but she showed that she was indeed one entity by her conduct elsewhere through every vent and every volcano she voiced her indignation hecla bellowed until the icelanders feared a cataclysm vesuvius blew its head off etna spewed up a quantity of lava and a suit of halfamillion lira damages has been decided against challenger in the italian courts for the destruction of vineyards even in mexico and in the belt of central america there were signs of intense plutonic indignation and the howls of stromboli filled the whole eastern mediterranean it has been the common ambition of mankind to set the whole world talking to set the whole world screaming was the privilege of challenger alone
