i ken wards arrival in utah dick i shore will be glad to see ken said jim williams in his lazy drawl i reckon youll be too jims cool and careless way of saying things sometimes irritated me glad to see ken ward i was crazy to see the lad jim what you know about being glad to see any one isnt a whole lot i replied youve been a texan ranger all your life ive only been out here in this wild forsaken country for three years ken ward is from my home in pennsylvania he probably saw my mother the day he left to come westglad to see him say wal you neednt git peevish now if we calkilated right from kens letter hell be on todays stage an there she comes bowlin round the corner of the pink cliffs i glanced up eagerly my eye sweeping out on the desert climbing the red ridge to see a cloud of dust rolling along the base of the great walls by jingo youre right jim here she comes say i hope ken is aboard jim and i were sitting on a box in front of a store in the little town of kanab utah the day before we had ridden in off buckskin mountain having had ken wards letter brought out to us by one of the forest rangers we had a room in a cottage where we kept what traps and belongings we did not need out on the preserve and here i had stored kens saddle rifle lasso blanket all the things he had used during his memorable sojourn with us on penetier the year before also we had that morning sent out to one of the ranches for kens mustang which was now in a nearby corral we intended to surprise ken for it was not likely we would forget how much he cared for that mustang so we waited watching the cloud of dust roll down the ridge till we could see under it the old gray stage swaying from side to side shore he mightnt be aboard said jim i reproached myself then for having scorned jims matteroffact way after all there was no telling from jims looks or words just how he felt no doubt he looked forward to kens visit as pleasurably as i we were two lonely forest rangers seldom coming to the village and always detailed to duty in the far solitudes of coconina preserve so that the advent of a lively and companionable youngster would be in the nature of a treat the stage bumped down over the last rocky steps of the ridge and headed into the main street of kanab the four dusty horses trotted along with a briskness that showed they knew they had reached the end of their journey theres a redheaded kid sittin with the driver remarked jim leslie thet cant be ken no kens hair is lightthere he is jimtheres ken hes looking out of the window the horses clattered up and stopped short with a rattle and clink of trappings and a lumbering groan from the old stage somebody let out a ringing yell i saw the driver throw off a mailpouch then a powerful young fellow leaped over the wheel and bounded at me dick leslie he yelled i thought i knew that yellow hair flying up and the keen eyes like flashes of blue fire but before i could be sure of anything he was upon me had me in a bear hug that stopped my breath then i knew it was ken ward oh dick maybe im not glad to see you whereupon he released me which made it possible for me to greet him he interrupted me with eager pleasure handing me a small bundle and some letters from home dick your mother and sister both well when i left and tickled to death that i was going to visit youwhy hello jim williams ken i shore am glad to see you replied jim as he wrung and pumped kens hand but i wouldnt a knowed you why how youve growed an you wasnt no striplin when you trimmed the greaser last summer ken you could lick him now in about a minnit well maybe not quite so quick replied ken laughing jim ive taken on fifteen or twenty pounds since i had that scrap with the greaser and ive had a seasons training under the most famous football and baseball trainers in the world wal now ken youre shore goin to tell me all about thet said jim greatly interested to me ken ward had changed and i studied him with curious interest the added year sat well upon him for there was now no suggestion of callowness the old frank boyish look was the same yet somewhat different ken had worked studied suffered but as to his build it was easy to see the change that promise of magnificent strength and agility which i had seen in him since he was a mere boy had reached its fulfilment lithe and straight as an indian almost tall wide across the shoulders smallwaisted and smallhipped and with muscles rippling at his every move he certainly was the most splendid specimen of young manhood i had ever seen hey kid why dont you come down called ken to the boy on top of the stage heres dick leslie you remember him i looked from the boy to ken its my brother hal responded ken father wanted me to bring him along and hal has been clean mad ever since i was out west last year so dick i had to bring him i expect youll be angry with me but i couldnt have come without him i wanted him along too dick and if its all right with you sure ken its all right i interrupted only hes pretty much of a kid has he got any sand hes all sand replied ken in a lower voice thats the trouble hes got too much sand ken called to his brother again and the youngster reluctantly clambered down evidently the meeting with kens ranger friends was to be an ordeal for hal i seemed to remember his freckled face and red head but not very well then he dropped over the wheel of the stage and came toward me readily holding out his hand hullo dick i remember you all right he said i replied to his greeting and gave the lad a close scrutiny i should say fourteen years would have topped his age he was short sturdy and looked the outdoor boy his expression was one of intense interest as if he lived every moment of his life to its utmost and he had the most singular eyes i ever beheld they were very large of a piercing light gray and they seemed to take everything in with a kind of daring flash altogether i thought here was a lad out of the ordinary one with latent possibilities which gave me a vague alarm wal now so youre kens brother said jim williams i shore am glad to see you ken an me was pretty tolerable pals last summer an i reckon you an me kin be thet too it was plain jim liked the looks of the youngster or else he would never have made that speech hal approached the ranger and shook hands awkwardly he was not timid but backward i saw that he was all eyes and he looked jim over from spurs to broadbrim with the look of one who was comparing the reality with a picture long carried in mind of course ken had told hal all about the texan and what that telling must have been showed plainly in the lads manner manifestly he was satisfied with jims tall form his sunscorched face and hawk eyes the big blue gun jim packed and the high boots and spurs he wore wheres hiram bent asked ken earnestly hirams back on the saddle with his hounds hes waiting for us he told me about them replied ken lion dogs the best in the west hiram said i guess maybe im not aching to see themdick my mustang i forgot him what did you ever do with him you know i left him with you at holston last summer well see if we cant hear something of him i replied evasively as if i wanted ken to meet a disappointment gradually his face fell but he did not say any more about the mustang ken im going to sign you into service as a ranger my helper hiram is gamewarden you know and ive arranged for us to go with him hes specially engaged now in trying to clean out the cougars the critters are thick as hops back on the north rim and weve got a lively summer ahead of us sounds great replied ken say what do you mean by north rim its the north rim of the candashon grand candashon and the wildest ruggedest country on earth oh yes i forgot that coconina takes in the candashon will we get to see much of it ken in a month from now youll be sick of climbing out of that awful gash for answer ken smiled his doubts then leaving jim and hal who appeared to be getting on a friendly footing i took ken over to the office of mr birch the supervisor of coconina forest preserve as a matter of fact this rather superior person had always jarred on me he was inclined to be arrogant and few of the rangers liked him i had to get along with him for being head ranger it was policy for me to keep a civil tongue in my head when i introduced ken and stated my desire to sign him in as my helper the supervisor looked rebellious and said i had all the helpers i needed who is this fellow anyhow leslie he demanded im not going to have any of your eastern friends chasing around the preserve setting fires and killing deer this idea of yours about a helper is only a bluff i dont sign any more rangers understand i bit my tongue to keep from loosing it and while i was trying to think what was best to do ken stepped forward mr supervisor he said blandly ive only come out to have a little vacation and get some practical ideas on forestry please be good enough to look at my credentials ken handed over letters with the washington seal stamped on them and birch stared what was more when he had read the letters his manner changed very considerably and he even looked at me with a shade of surprise oh yes mr ward thatll be all right you see i i only ive got to be particular about rangers and all that now anything i can do for you ill be glad to do kens letters must have been pretty strong and i was secretly pleased to see old birch taken down a bit the upshot of the matter was that ken got a free hand in coconina to roam where he liked and spend what time he wished with the rangers on duty we left the office highly pleased well go over to the corral now and look over some mustangs i said from kens face i knew his thoughts reverted once more to the mustang which had trotted its way into his heart but i said nothing i wanted his surprise to be complete jim and hal joined us and together we walked down the street kanab was only a hamlet of a few stores a church a school and cottages my lodgings were at a cottage just at the end of the street and here back of a barn was the corral when we turned a corner of the barn there was a black mustang all glossy as silk with long mane flying and shiny hoofs lifting as he pranced around he certainly looked proud that i felt sure was because of the thorough currying and brushing i had given him ken stopped stockstill and his eyes began to bulge as for the mustang he actually tried to climb over the bars he knew ken before ken knew him oh dick leslie exclaimed ken then placing both hands on the top bar with one splendid vault he cleared the gate chapter ii wings it did me good to see the way ken ward hugged that little black mustang somehow a ranger gets to have a warm feeling for a horse now kens mustang remembered him or if he did not he surely was a most deceitful bit of horseflesh hes fine and fat in great shape said ken rubbing his hands all over the mustang he hasnt been worked much been down on our winter range for six months i replied i had him brought in this morning and after the blacksmith clipped and shod him i took a hand myself ken i want a mustang sang out hal he sat on the top of the corral fence absorbed in the appearance and action of kens mount now kid keep your shirt on said ken youll get one its just half an hour since you arrived thats long enough do you think im going to stand around here and watch you have a pony like that and not have one myself its a mustang not a pony said ken purcell the owner of the cottage and corrals drove up at this juncture and i engaged him in conversation regarding a mount for the boy and the packhorses we would need on our trip wal theres a bunch of mustangs over in the waterin corral some good ones all pretty wild but about packhosses that sort of bumps me said purcell dubiously im due to go to lund after grain an supplies an i need my regular packers ill let you have one an the big bay stallion you dont mean that big brute marc i queried sure hes all right if you handle him easy i dont know as hell stand for a packsaddle any kind of a saddle but you might load somethin on him if thats the best you can do well have to take him i rejoined also i want a good man to take care of the horses for the boys hire the indian hes here now an hes the best man to find grass an water in this desert you mean navvy yes wed be lucky to get him but jim and hiram bent they both hate indians leslie i dont know of any one else in the village its lambin time now an hands are scarce youd better take the indian for hell save you lots of trampin round ill do it purcell well pack early in the morning and get a good start now take the lad over to the corral and get him a mount come on youngster said purcell to hal come on an lets see what kind of an eye you have for a hoss hal leaped off the fence and went with purcell toward the other corrals jim started to go with them but ken detained him fellows said ken before we get any farther i want to tell you about my brother hes simply as wild as a march hare im not sure but i suspect that hes been reading a lot of wild west stuff the folks at home have humored him spoiled him i think father is sort of proud of hal the boy is bright quick as a steel trap and just the finest squarest kid ever but he has a fiendish propensity for making trouble getting into scrapes now that would be bad enough back home wouldnt it and here ive had to bring him out west i shore am glad you fetched him replied jim im glad too jim until i think of hals peculiarities and then im scared that kid can hatch up more impossible neverheardof situations than any other kid on earth hal imagines he can do anything whats worse hes got the nerve to try and to tell you the truth ive never yet discovered anything he couldnt do can he ride a horse i asked ride say he can ride standing on his head now dick and jim i want you to do all you can to look after hal but understand the responsibility for his safety and welfare doesnt rest upon you ill do my best for him the responsibility rests upon me much as i wanted hal with me i advised and coaxed father not to send him but dad thinks the kid can do anything a great deal better than i he told me where i could go hal could go so well make up our minds to have our hearts in our throats all the time on this trip and let it go at that our attention was attracted by a shout from the other corral hyar leslie come over called purcell we crossed over slipped through a couple of gates and edging round a cloud of dust saw hal in the middle of a corral holding a beautiful mustang by the mane leslie the youngster has picked out wings the worst pinto that ever came off buckskin mountain declared purcell an he says he dont want an wont have any other mustang here sure what did i tell you dick this is where the toboggan starts ha ha yelled ken whats wrong purcell that pinto looks fine and dandy i said he is a dandy returned purcell hes a climber an he can beat any hoss on the range but he cant be rid except when he wants to be rid theres no tellin when hes liable to make up his mind to rare its not buckin so much hes no bronch but he just runs wild when it pleases him an then it takes a navajo to ride him i say hes no mount for a tenderfoot during this speech of purcells i watched hal closely and saw that however he occupied himself with wings glossy mane he heard every word and when he glanced up i believed that what purcell said had absolutely decided him the lad looked keen to me and deep as the sea but he was not fresh or forward and despite my uneasiness i began to like him kid will you take my mustang asked ken nix answered hal im going to ride wings and beat the life out of you and your mustang i sent purcell for a saddle and he fetched one presently and put it on wings youngster seein as you are set on the pinto alll right said purcell as he fastened the cinch then hal looked straight at the rancher mr purcell ive had ponies at home and i could ride them he said but thisll be new to me will you give me a few tips that pleased me immensely whatever hal was he was not a fool i noticed jim williams wore an expression as near akin to excitement as it was possible for that cool texas ranger to wear perhaps in jims mind as in mine the lad was being measured purcell too appeared to like the boys frankness i dont know as i kin give you many tips he said fact of the matter is you must try to stick on thats all just keep your toes in the stirrups so you can git them out quick then squeeze him with your knees for all youre worthwait make sure where youre goingthere hal sat firmly in the saddle wings champed the bit and turned his head then shook it and suddenly lifting his hind hoofs he kicked viciously we scattered and climbed the corral fence when we turned round the pinto had come down on all fours and squared himself with head down humping his back he proceeded to buck with startling quickness and tossed hal like a feather the boy hit the ground with a thud and slowly got up considerably shaken then he went up to the mustang now standing quietly quite a little crowd of villagers mostly boys had collected to see the fun and some of the latter were inclined to make remarks at hals expense one of them a boy i knew to be a rascal poked his head between the bars of a gate and yelled derisively at hal to the immense delight of the other lads hal eyed him a moment but he did not say anything this made the fellow all the bolder for he climbed the fence from which he directed more remarks mr purcell said hal to the rancher i hadnt got ready that time i wasnt expecting it now how must i treat him my way at home was to coax a pony be decent to him itll pay best in the end to be decent to a hoss replied purcell be kind but firm an use your spurs i havent any spurs i never used any youll need them out here hal mounted the pinto again wings wheeled about pranced stood up pawing the air snorted and then dropping down he began to run round the corral he zigzagged against the fence and slowing down he took short jumps kicking at the same time then he squared himself again and lowered his head look out kid yelled ken we all shouted warnings hal was prepared and for the space of a few seconds while the bucking pinto pounded a dusty circle in the corral he kept his seat but a new move a sort of sidestepping buck flung him against the fence and he fell all in a heap it was a hard fall but the boy got up a lump began to show on his chin and blood his knuckles too were bloody lookie here redhead called out the smart youngster who was amusing his comrades by making fun of hal cant you ride no bettern that haw haw you cant ride or nothin redhead redhead say johnny can you ride him asked hal coolly yep you bet come down and let me see you do it i dont believe you johnny eyed hal rather doubtfully hal looked very much interested very friendly but his eyes were cold and hard the western lad hesitated and finally driven to it by the bantering of the other lads he dropped off the fence vaulting into the saddle he rode wings round the corral kept his seat easily while the pinto went through his tricks and altogether gave an exhibition of riding which would have made most any eastern lad green with envy you did ride him i was wrong i thought you couldnt said hal walking slowly up to johnny as he dismounted youre a crack horseman suddenly hal leaped at the fellow and at the same moment ken yelled and tumbled off the fence i was too amazed to move jim williamss mouth gaped and he stared in speechless delight hal had the youngster jammed against the fence and was banging him you called me redhead and tenderfoot and sloppy rider cried hal swinging his fists then ken reached them pulled hal away and rescued the already bewildered and bloodynosed lad dick i knew it i knew it said ken leading the lad out at the gate the minute hal asked that boy to ride the mustang i knew what was up i couldnt say a word hal always makes me speechless williams was shaking so that he rattled the top bar of the corral and purcell roared if it had not been for the shame and distress in kens face i would have yelled myself for that bantering youngster had long ago earned my dislike and i was glad to see him get a little of his just deserts then i saw hal look through the fence at all the strange lads he was certainly the coolest piece of audacity i ever saw i wasnt born in a saddle see he said at that ill bet in a month i can ride with any of you but theres one thing i can do right now so dont any of you call me redhead again hal shut up and come out of there called ken not on your life replied hal promptly im going to ride this ironjawed mustang or or hal did not complete the sentence but his look was expressive enough jim williams leisurely dropped off the fence into the corral while removing his spurs he looked up at ken and his eyes twinkled see here ken youre doin a powerful lot of fussin about this kid brother you leave him to me that from williams occasioned me immeasurable relief and though ken still looked doubtful there was much gladness and gratitude in his surprised glance jim sauntered over toward the center of the corral swinging his spurs kid i reckon you an me had better strike up a pardnership in ridin pintoes an all sich little matters appertainin to the range jim changed the strap lengths on his spurs and handed them to hal put these on he said i reckon theyre too long for you an mebbe trip you up when you walk but theyre what you need on horseback hal adjusted the spurs and took a few awkward steps digging up the ground with the big rowels theyll be as hard on me as on the pony he said jim captured wings and tightened saddlegirths shortened stirrups and slipping off the bridle let the pinto go now kid listen these western hosses an mustangs can size up a man an take advantage of him youve got to be half hoss yourself to know all their tricks the trouble with you jest now was thet wings seen you was scared of him you mustnt let a hoss see that you must be natural easy an firm you must be master take the bridle an go up to wings on the left side never again try to straddle a hoss from the right side dont coax him an dont yell at him if you say anythin mean bizness when you get him in a corner go right up not too quick or too slow an reach out to put on the bridle as if youd done it all your life when you get it on draw the reins back over his head reasonable tight an hold them with your left hand at the same time takin a good grip on his mane turn the stirrup an slip your left toe in grab the pommel with right hand an swing up start him off then an let him know whos boss if he wants to go one way make him go the other dont be afraid to stick the spurs into him youre too gentle with a hoss thetll never do in this country these sagebrush hosses aint eastern hosses make up your mind to ride him now hell see it an if he bucks soak him with the spurs till he stops or throws you an if he throws you get up an go after him again all right replied hal soberly and picking up the bridle he went toward wings the pinto squared around and eyed hal as curiously as if he had actually heard the advice tendered by the texan probably he heard the clinking spurs and knew what they meant with a snort he jumped and began to run round the corral hal slowly closed in on him and at length got him in a corner and here hal showed that he could obey coaching as readily as ken walking directly up to the pinto he bridled him and with quick decisive action leaped astride then he spurred wings the pinto bolted and in his plunging scattered dust and gravel not liking the spurs he settled into a run hal was now more at ease in the saddle it was not so much confidence as desperation perhaps the shortened stirrups helped him to a firmer leghold at any rate he rode gracefully and appeared to good advantage he pulled wings and when the fiery pinto snorted and tossed his head and preferred his own way a touch of spur made him turn round in this manner hal ran wings along the corral fence across the open space to and fro successfully turning him at will then as he let up the pinto wheeled and spread his legs and tried to get his head down hold him up yelled purcell nows the time kid added jim williams soak him with the spurs hal could not keep the pinto from getting his head down or from beginning to buck but he managed to use the long spurs that made a difference it broke wings action he did not seem to be able to get to going he had to break and bolt then square himself again and try to buck stick on hal i yelled if you stay with him now youll have him beat we all yelled and ken ward danced around in great danger of being ridden down by the furious pinto like a burr hal stuck on there were moments when he wabbled in the saddle lurched one way and then another and again bounced high once we made sure it was to be a victory for the pinto but hal luckily and wonderfully regained his seat and after that by degrees he appeared to get a surer easier swing while wings grew tired of bucking and more tired of being spurred purcell jumped into the corral and began to throw down the bars of the gate kid run him out now shouted jim drive him good an hard make him see whos boss wings did not want to leave the corral and hal in pulling him lifted him off his forefeet another touch of spurs sent the pinto through the gate hal spurred him down the road we watched wings going faster and faster gradually settling into an even gait till he was on a dead run thet pinto has wings all right remarked jim purcell named him some ways near right an between us the kids no slouch in the saddle he wont have thet little fireeatin hoss broke all in a minnit but hell be able to ride him an thetll let us hit the trail chapter iii off for coconina the navajo indian whom i had engaged through purcell did not show up till we were packing next morning he was a copperskinned ravenhaired beadyeyed desert savage when ken and hal had finished breakfast i called them out of the cottage to meet him here boys shake hands with navvy here navvy shake with heap big brother heap little brother me savvy said the indian extending his hand to ken how then he turned to hal how hal following ken gingerly shook hands with navvy from the look of the lad he was all at sea and plainly disappointed no doubt in his mind dwelt images and fancies of picturesque plumed indians such as he had evolved from western tales indeed navvy would have been a disappointment to a most unromantic boy let alone one as imaginative and full of wild ideas as hal was navvys slouch hat and torn shirt and blue jeans some white mans castoff apparel were the things that disillusioned hal and i saw that he turned once more to his pinto a new saddle and bridle spurs chaps lasso canteen quirt a rifle and a scabbard and a slicker these with spirited wings were allsatisfying and gave him back his enchantment wherell the indian ride asked purcell why he can climb on the stallion i replied purcells stallion marc was a magnificent bay very heavy and bigboned we had strapped a blanket on him and roped some sacks of oats over that the other packhorses were loaded with all they could carry he can climb on i reckon but hell darn soon git off remarked purcell dryly then hell have to walk i rejoined thatll be best said purcell much relieved leslie have a care of marc youll strike some allfired bad trails in the candashon where many a hoss has slipped an gone over dont drive marc or pull him just coax him a little all right purcell well be carefulnow boys were late starting and its thirty miles to the first water i led the train driving our pack horses before me navvy came next leading marc ken was third and jim with a watchful eye on hal and the pinto brought up the rear the few miles of good road between kanab and fredonia another little hamlet we made at a jog trot doing the distance in something over an hour outside of fredonia we hit the trail and went down and down into the red washes and over the sage speckled flats it grew dusty and hot about noon we reached the first slow roll of rising ridge and from there on it was climb more than once i looked back and more than once i saw hal having trouble with his pinto once wings as if he really had wings flew off across a flat and spilled hal into the sage navvy got tired walking and climbed up on the grainsacks on marc but he did not stay there very long then my pack horse made trouble for me by shying at a rattlesnake and getting off the trail the time passed swiftly as it always passed when we were on the move and we reached the first cedars about three oclock here i saw that our train was stretched out over a mile in length navvy was having a little ride on marc but ken limped along before his mustang and hal changed from side to side from leg to leg in his saddle the boys were beginning to show soreness from riding the sun had set when we made the head of nail gulch here a spring and a cabin awaited us also a little browse for the horses ive got a lame knee all right remarked ken thought i was in good shape no matter how hard you are itll take three days or more to break you in i said hal came straggling along behind jim he fell off his pinto and just flopped over against a cedar gee but aint it great ken look at those cliffs wait a couple of days hal then ill show you some cliffs i said it took jim and me only a little time to unpack build a fire in the cabin bake biscuits and get a good supper navvy led the horses to water hobbled them and turned them loose then we had our meal ken and hal were supremely happy but too tired to be jolly darkness found them both asleep and hal threshed about as if he were having wild dreams at daybreak navvy awakened me coming in with the horses it began to appear that the indian would be a welcome addition to our party finding the horses in the morning was work for me and sometimes long and arduous work and jim rolling out of his blanket and blinking his eyes drawled wal pretty fair for an injun pretty fair the boys heard us and roused themselves bright and eager though so stiff they could scarcely stand erect in an hour we had breakfasted packed and were in the saddle this morning wings did not seem to be so frisky boys today will be a drill and no mistake i told them ride as long as you can stand it then walk a bithere look over the far side of the gulch see that long blackfringed line with the patches of snow thats buckskin mountain tonight well camp under the pines and ken therere pinetrees on buckskin that dwarf those in penetier we struck out into the trail and then began a long tedious uninteresting ride nail gulch was narrow and shut in the view low bare stone walls and cedar slopes extended for miles and miles it was a gradual ascent all the way but this did not grow perceptible until about noon i laughed to see ken and hal fall off their saddles hobble along for a while then wearily mount again presently to repeat the performance the air grew cooler making gloves comfortable about three oclock the gulch began to lose its walls and we reached the first pines they were not large and straggled over the widening gulch but as we climbed the trail they grew more numerous the early shades of night enveloped us as we rode out of the gulch into the level forest here and there patches of snow gleamed through the gloom this solved the question of water and we made camp at once a blazing fire soon warmed us we had a hearty supper of bacon hot biscuits coffee and canned vegetables ken and hal were so tired and sore that they could scarcely move but that did not affect their appetites then we sat around the campfire by this time the forest was black and the wind roared through the pines it was not new to ken but hal showed what it meant to him i fancied him even more sensitive to impressions than ken but he was not so apt to express his feelings in fact hal seemed a silent lad or else he had not yet found his tongue wonderful thoughts i knew were teeming in his mind his big eyes glowed he watched the campfire and looked out into the dark gloom of the forest and then back at jim then at the impassive navajo he listened to the wind and to the bells on the horses wheres our tent he asked suddenly we dont use no tents replied jim we spread a tarp whats that why a tarpaulin you know a big piece of canvas wal we spread one of them on the ground roll in our blankets an pull the other end of the tarp up over then a little while afterward hal broke silence again i hear something what is it he asked breathlessly starting up we all listened while the fire sputtered a lull came in the roar of the wind through the pines and then from far off in the forest a wild highpitched yelp kid thats a coyote replied ken slapping hal on the knee dont you remember i told you about coyoteslisten hal said no more that evening yet when i was sleepy and ready to turn in he still sat up alert watchful intent on the strangeness and wildness of the forest it was a treat to see him when navvy rolled in a blanket with feet to the fire sleepie me said the indian that was his goodnight to us ken shared my blankets and tarpaulin that night and slept without turning once when the gray dawn came i was up lighting a fire jim yawned out of his bed and both boys slept on the morning was cold a white frost silvered the scant grass presently i heard bells far off they grew louder and quickened soon the horses appeared with the navajo riding one and they trooped into camp with thudding hoofs and jangling bells that woke the boys rustle now kid said jim to hal youll miss somethin if you aint lively oh im all stove up exclaimed ken whew but thats cold air how about you hal i feel great rejoined his brother we all saw that hal could hardly get out of bed that when he did get out it was a desperate task for him to draw on his boots wheres some water to wash in he asked tackle the snowdrift there i meant for hal to get a pan of snow and melt it at the fire but he misunderstood me he tackled the snow barehanded it had a frozen crust which he could not break through so he kicked a hole in it and then digging out a double handful he proceeded to wash that operation was one which required fortitude hal never murmured but he hurried to the fire in a way to make jim wink slyly at me when the sun rose we were on the trail we passed the zone of silver spruces rode through a long aspen hollow and then out among the brown aisles of great pines of buckskin forest oh ken i never saw a woods before was hals tribute boys keep your eyes peeled for deer and coyotes i said it was my intention to lead ken and hal to the rim of the grand candashon without warning i wanted the great spectacle to burst upon them unexpectedly as it had upon me so i said nothing about it ken was in a dream perhaps living over again his adventures in penetier hal was suffering from his raw legs and sore joints but he was in an ecstasy over the huge gnarled pines and the wild glades both boys had forgotten the candashon so i rode on pleased at the thought of what it all was to them the sun thawed the frost letting the bluebells peep out of the grass theres a black squirrel with a white tail shouted hal kid dont ever yell in the forest unless its a yelling matter said ken we flushed blue grouse in some of the hollows but saw no sign of deer it was easy going and we made fast time about noon i called into requisition a little ruse i had planned to attract the attention of the boys from the trail ahead i told them to look sharp for deer on both sides in this way leaving the trail and keeping behind the thicker clumps of pines i approached the candashon without their suspecting its nearness then rounding a thicket of juniper within twenty yards of the rim i called out boys look chapter iv through buckskin forest strong men when suddenly confronted with the spectacle of the grand candashon have been known to cry out in joy or fear to weep to fall upon their knees or to be petrified into silence seriousminded men have been known to laugh immoderately sight of the candashon affects no two persons alike but there are none whom it does not affect powerfully i paid my own moments tribute of solemn awe and then i glanced at the boys ken looked stunned and white his throat swelling with emotion hals face shone with a radiant glow of wild joy and for a moment he stuttered then as ken burst into an exclamation he lapsed into stony silence wonderful beautiful its its that was all ken could say it shore is replied jim then i told the boys that the grand candashon of arizona was over two hundred miles long twelve to twenty wide and a mile and a half deep it was a titanic gorge in which mountains tablelands chasms and cliffs lay buried in purple haze a thing of wonder and mystery beyond any other a place to grip the heart of a man it had the strange power to make him at once meek and then to unleash his daring spirit the worlds split exclaimed hal what made this this awful hole well talk of that and study it after you have seen something of its heights and depths i replied at our feet yawned a blue gulf with faint tracings of cedared slope and shining cliff visible through the noonday haze farther out a darkpurple candashon wended its irregular ragged way to vanish in space still farther out rose bare peaks and domes and mesas all asleep in the sunshine beyond these towered a gigantic plateau rugged and bold in outline its granite walls gold in the sun its forest covering a strip of fringed black it stood aloof from the towers and escarpments detached from the world of rock haunting in its isolation and wild promise boys theres the plateau where the cougars are i said you see way down to the left under the wall where a dip of ground connects the plateau to the mainland thats the saddle hiram bent is there with his hounds waiting for us how on earth will we ever get there queried ken there are two trails one leads down over the rim here the other round through the forest well take the forest trail for the lower one is not safe for you boys till you get broken in come now we can make the saddle before dark if we plug along with that i led off into the forest and what with finding the seldomused trail and keeping the packhorses in it i had no time to see how the boys fared or what they did i knew that both were finding riding most painful and yet were enjoying themselves hugely it was a long roundabout way to get to the saddle for the most part the trail led up and down the heads of many hollows so steep were the slopes that we had to zigzag down and up then the thickets of pricklythorn and scruboak and blacksage were obstacles to swift traveling one thing i discovered and it was that the stallion marc was the best horse i had ever seen on a trail he would not carry the indian but he led the way for us and made a path through the thickets the sun was yet an hour above the southwest rim when i reached the head of the hollow where the trail turned down to the saddle from a shallow ravine with grassy and thicketed slopes it deepened and widened till it was a candashon itself with looming yellow walls it became deeper and deeper and then turning to the left it opened out into a wide space under the magnificent wall of the plateau here i smelled fire and presently saw the gleam of a white tent and then a column of blue smoke the short sharp bark of a hound rang out i stopped and waited for ken to catch up with me he came along on foot limping and leading his mustang cheer up ken i said were almost there im cheerful dick im supremely happy but im all in and as for hal why jim and i had to lift him in his saddle more times than i can remember dick whatre you doing to us anyway youll be fine in a couple of days i wanted to get on the ground theres hal come along hal youre doing well were almost there dick i hear a hound said ken eagerly hurry up theres smoke tooah i see hiram the first sight of the old bear hunter feeding his hounds under a tree was a joy to ken ward i saw it in his sparkling eyes and heard it in his exultant voice soon we rode through the last thicket of brush into camp the hounds barked furiously until quieted by hiram ken despite his crippled condition got to the hunter in quick time and there was a warm greeting between them youngster the lord is good i hevnt been so glad about anythin in years as i am about seein youwal you have improved a heap hal came forward with the same searching luminous gaze which he had turned upon the navajo this time however the boy did not meet with disappointment any lad would have been fascinated with the splendid presence of the old hunter and hal was more than fascinated plain it was that hirams great stature the flashing gray eyes and the stern weatherbeaten face his buckskin shirt and all about him realized the idea hal had formed in his boyish thoughts wal doggone my buttons said hiram offering an enormous hand to hal kens brother ive heard of you now dont you forget thet im mighty glad to meet you the shadow of the plateau crept out to us and shaded the camp the sun was setting we were down a thousand feet under the rim so that we looked up at the plateau and also at the peaks and towers and escarpments to the west these were capped with pink and gold and red and every moment the colors changed while i was unpacking i heard hiram ask jim why on earth we had fetched that tarnal redskin with us and jims reply was one that left no doubt about his idea of indians both hiram and jim carried somewhere about in their anatomies leaden bullets which sometimes painfully reminded them that they had a grudge against indians after sunset darkness settled quickly below the candashon rim and it was night long before we were through with supper then came the quiet cheerful hour around the campfire which i foresaw was to be a source of unalloyed bliss to ken and hal hiram did not appear to be in any hurry to talk about cougars but he was keenly interested in kens year at college and especially in kens making the varsity baseball team he asked innumerable questions and he was delighted to learn of kens success and that he had been elected captain then he went off into reminiscences and talked of kens adventures in penetier the summer before finally when he had satisfied his fancy he called up the hounds one by one and playfully though seriously he introduced them to the boys hyars prince the best lionhound i ever trained bar none he has a nose thets perfect hes fast an savage an if ever a dog had brains its prince the great hound looked the truth of hirams claim he was powerful in build lean of loin and long of limb tawnycolored and he had a noble head with great somber eyes hyars curley whos a slow trailer an he always bays both fine qualities in a hound prince goes too swift an saves his breath but then its not his fault if i dont keep close to him in a chase an hyars muxmux whos no good the ugly blackandwhite hound so designated wagged a stumpy tail and pawed his master and appeared to want to make it plain that he was not so bad as all that wal mux ill take a leetle of thet back youre good at eatin an then i never seen the cougar you was afraid of an thets bad fer youll be killed some day hyars queen the mother of the pups an shes reliable though slow because of her lame leg hyars tan a good hound an this big black feller hes ringer hell be as good as prince some day if i can only save him hiram chained each hound to nearby saplings then lighting his pipe at the campfire he found a comfortable seat wal youngsters its doggone good to see you sittin by my campfire tomorrow well go up on the plateau an make a permanent camp thars grass an snow in the hollers an deer an wild hosses an mustangs any mountainlions cougars asked ken intensely i was comin to them wal i never in my born days seen such a network of cougars tracks as is on thet plateau an at thet ive only been on one end im reckonin well round up the biggest den of cougars in the west you see no one ever hunted thet plateau but navajos an they wouldnt kill a cougar why a cougar is one of their gods wal as i was sayin mebbe well strike a whole cat tribe up thar an youngsters what do you say to ketchin em alive great exclaimed ken hiram switched his look of inquiry to hal the lads large eyes startlingly bright dilated and burned how he asked and his voice rang like a bell lasso em tie em up replied hiram deceit could not have lived in his kindly clear glance then ken didnt lie after all blurted out hal my brother never believed i helped you lasso a bear and that we intended to do the same with cougars out here exclaimed ken its straight goods youngster added hiram now whar do you stand most youngsters like to shoot things mebbe youd find it fun to chase cougars up trees an then shoot em but thars a leetle more chance fer excitement when you pull em out with a rope it keeps a feller movin around tolerable lively which would you like best then shootin or ketchin id like best to catch them alive replied hal his voice very low wal now im glad you see its not the excitement im lookin fer though i aint sayin i dont like to rope things but the fact is i get ten dollars for cougar skins an three hundred dollars for live cougars so you youngsters will have the fun an ill be makin money an at the same time well be riddin coconina preserve of bad critters lets roll in now fer youre tired an we must be stirrin early chapter v the plateau hiram routed us all in the morning while the shadows were still gray there was a bustling about camp when we were packed and mounted ready for the ascent of the plateau the pines and slopes were still shrouded in the gray gloom hiram led us along a trail overgrown by brush presently we began climbing such a steep slope that we had to hang to the pommels the saddle was a narrow ridge sloping up to the plateau and the trail zigzagged its crest to the right a sweep of thicketed hollow led out into wide space where peaks and mesas began to show to the left was the great abyss filled with creamy mist it was not possible to see a rod down toward the depths still i had a sure sense of the presence of the candashon the climb was a hard task for the horses the trail being one made by deer but in less than an hour we were up on the rim at that moment the sun burst out showing through rifts in rolling clouds of mist then we saw behind and above us the long bold black line of buckskin hiram took a course straight back from the rim through a magnificent forest of pines perhaps a couple of miles back the old hunter circled and appeared to be searching for a particular place presently he halted in a beautiful glade above a hollow where lay a heavy bank of snow on the slopes the grass was yet thin but in the glade it was thick here with the snow and the grass our problem was solved as to water and feed for the horses hyar we are called out hiram cheerily well throw our camp in this glade jest out of reach of them pines on the northwest side sometimes a heavy wind blows one over we had all gotten busy at our tasks of unpacking when suddenly we were attracted by a heavy pounding on the turf hold the hosses yelled hiram everybody grab a hoss we all made a dive among our snorting and plunging steeds youngsters look sharp dont miss nothin thars a sight called hiram the sound of pounding hoofs appeared to be coming right into camp i saw a string of wild horses thundering by a black stallion led them and as he ran with splendid stride he curved his fine head backward to look at us and whistled a wild challenge soon he and his band were lost in the blackness of the forest the finest sight i ever saw in my life ejaculated ken hal wasnt that simply grand no matter what comes off now im paid for the trouble of getting here replied hal it was only a few minutes afterward that the indian manifested excitement and pointed up the hollow a herd of large whitetailed deer trooped down toward us and stopped within a hundred yards then they stood motionless with long ears erect shoot shoot exclaimed navvy nary a shoot navvy replied hiram the indian looked dumbfounded and gazed from the rifles to us and then to the deer oh cried hal theyre tame deer what beautiful large creatures i couldnt shoot them no youngster theyre not tame deer theyre so wild thet they arent afraid theyve never been shot at thet bunch an youngster these deer here are mule deer an must hey some elk in them thet accounts fer their big size now aint they jest pretty the hounds saw the herd and burst into wild clamor that frightened the deer and they bounded off with the long springy leaps characteristic of them look like they jump on rubber stilts commented hal all hands now to throw camp fust thing well pitch my tent i tell you youngsters thet tent may come in right useful if we hey a storm an at this altitude were up over seven thousand feet we may git a snowsquall any day it was not long before we had a comfortable and attractive camp at the far side of the glade stood a clump of small sapling pines in regard to which ken said he would have to practice a little forestry the saplings were meager and had foliage only at the top ken declared he would thin out that clump wal thets a fine idee remarked hiram thin em out an leave about a dozen saplins each ten feet apart theyll be jest what i want to chain our cougars to at that speech the faces of both boys were studies in expression hal especially looked as if he were dreaming a most wild and real adventure when work was finished the boys threw themselves down upon the brown pineneedle mats and indulged in rest hiram did not allow them much indulgence saddle up youngsters he called out onless youre too tired to go with us thereupon the boys became as animated as their aching bones and sore muscles would permit leslie leave the injun in camp to look after things an well git the lay of the land hell eat us outen house an home growled jim williams i shore dont see why we fetched him anyhow all the afternoon we were riding the plateau we were completely bewildered with its impressiveness and surprised at the abundance of wild horses and mustangs deer coyotes foxes grouse and birds and overjoyed to find innumerable lion trails when we returned to camp i drew a rough map which hiram laid flat on the ground and called us around him now youngsters lets get our heads together in shape the plateau resembled the ace of clubs the center and side wings were high and well wooded with heavy pine the middle wing was longest sloped west had no pine but a dense growth of cedar numerous ridges and candashons cut up this central wing middle candashon the longest and deepest bisected the plateau headed near camp and ran parallel with two smaller ones which we named right and left candashons these three were lion runways and hundreds of deer carcasses lined the thickets north hollow was the only depression as well as runway on the northwest rim west point formed the extreme western cape of the plateau to the left of west point was a deep cutin of the rimwall called the bay the three important candashons opened into it from the bay the south rim was regular and impassable all the way round to the narrow saddle which connected it to the mainland wal said hiram see the advantage we can git on the tarnal critters the plateau is tolerable nigh ten miles long an six wide at the widest we cant git lost for very long thets a big thing in our favor we know whar cougars go over the rim an well head em off make shortcut chases thet i calkilate is a new one in cougarchasin cept whar we climbed up the saddle cougars cant git over the second wall of rock the first rim i oughter told you is mebbe a thousand feet down with breaks in places then comes a long cedar an pindashon slope weatherin slides broken cliffs an crags an then the second wall now regardin cougar sign wal i hardly believe the evidence of my own eyes the plateau is virgin ground weve stumbled on the breedinground of the hundreds of cougars thet infest the north rim hiram struck his huge fist into the palm of his hand he looked at jim and me and then at the boys it did not take a very observing person to see that the old bear hunter was actually excited jim ran his hand into his hair and scratched his head a familiar action with him when his mind was working unusually we hey corraled them shore as youre born the flash in hirams clear eyes changed to an anxious glance that ranged from ken and hal to our horses i reckon some common sense an care will make it safe for the youngsters he said but some of the hosses an some of the dogs are goin to git hurt mebbe killed more than anything else that remark from such a man thrilled me with its subtle suggestion he loved horses and hounds he saw danger ahead for them youngsters listen he went on soberly were in fer some chases i want you to think first of the risk to yourselves an then to the hosses you ride dont fly often the handle be cool let your hosses pick the goin keep sharp eyes peeled fer the snags on the trees an fer bad rocks an places ken you keep close behind leslie as you can an hal you stick close to jim course well lose each other an the hounds an hey trouble findin each other again but the idee is keep cool and go slow when you see it aint safe to go fast during supper we talked a good deal and afterward around the campfire hal was the only one who kept silent and he was too absorbed in what he heard to find his own voice but during a lull in the conversation he asked suddenly i want to know why our horses carried on so this morning when that stallion ran through the woods with his band simple enough hal i replied they wanted to break loose and run off with the wild horses theyll do it too before we leave here we rangers have trouble keeping our horses the mountain is overrun with mustangs and such wild bands as you saw today and if we lose a horse its almost impossible to catch him again twilight descended with the shadows sweeping under the pines the night wind rose and began its moan shore theres a scent on the wind said jim lighting his pipe with a red ember see how uneasy prince is the hound raised his dark head pointing his nose into the cool breeze and he walked to and fro as if on guard for his pack muxmux ground his teeth on a bone and growled at one of the pups curley was asleep ringer watched prince with suspicious eyes the other hounds lay stretched before the fire wal prince we aint lookin fer trails tonight said hiram ken itll be part of your duty around camp to help me with the pack chain em up now an well go to bed chapter vi trails when i awakened next morning the crack of hirams axe rang out sharply and the light from the campfire played on kens face as he lay asleep i saw old mux get up and stretch himself a jangle of bells from the forest told me we would not have to wait for the horses the injuns all right i heard hiram say all rustle for breakfast called jim kenhal then the boys rolled out freshfaced and brighteyed but still stiff and lame gee ken listen to the horses coming said hal howd navvy ever find them its hardly daylight thats a secret i expect every ranger would like to know replied ken i like that indian bettern at first went on hal we ate in the semidarkness with the gray shadow lifting among the trees as we saddled our horses dawn lightened the pups ran to and fro on their chains scenting the air the older hounds stood quiet waiting come navvy come chase cougie said hiram the indian made a remarkable gesture of dislike or fear i could not divine which let him keep camp i suggested hell shore eat all our grub said jim climb up youngsters ordered hiram an remember all i said about bein carefulwal hey i got all my trappins rope chains collars wire nippers allright hyar you lazy hounds out of this take the lead that prince we rode abreast through the forest and i could not help seeing the pleasure in kens face and the wild spirit in hals eyes the hounds followed prince at an orderly trot we struck out of the pines at halfpast five floating mists hid the lower end of the plateau but cedartrees began to show green against the soft gray of sage the morning had a cool touch though there was no frost jogging along we had crossed middle candashon and were nearing the dark line of cedar forest when hiram who led held up his hand in a warning check oh ken look at prince whispered hal to his brother the hound stood stiff head well up nose working and hair on his back bristling all the other hounds whined and kept close to him prince has a scent said hiram thars been a cougar round hyar i never knowed prince to be fooled the scents in the wind hunt em up prince spread out thar you dogs the pack commenced to work back and forth along the ridge we neared a hollow where prince barked eagerly curley answered and likewise queen muxs short angry bowwow showed that he was in line ringers gone shouted jim he was farthest ahead shore hes struck a trail likely enough replied hiram but ringer doesnt baythars prince workin over look sharp youngsters an be ready fer some ridin were close the hounds went tearing through the sage working harder and harder calling and answering one another all the time getting down into the hollow suddenly prince began to yelp like a yellow dart he shot into the cedars running head up curley howled his deep full bay and led the rest of the pack up the slope in angry clamor thar off yelled hiram spurring his big horse stay with me kid shouted jim over his shoulder to hal the lads pinto leaped into quick action they were out of sight in the cedars in less than a moment i heard ken close behind me and yelled to him to come along crashings among the cedars ahead thud of hoofs and yells kept me going in one direction the fiery burst of the hounds had surprised me such hunting was as new to me as to the boys and from the tingling in my veins i began to feel that it was just as exciting i remembered that jim had said hiram and his charger might keep the pack in sight but the rest of us could not my horse was carrying me at a fast pace on the trail of some one and he seemed to know that by keeping in this trail part of the work of breaking through the brush was already done for him kens horse thundered in my rear the sharp cedar branches struck and stung me and i heard them hitting ken we climbed a ridge found the cedars thinning out and then there were open patches as we faced a slope of sage i saw hiram on his big horse ride now boy i yelled to ken ill hang to you cut loose he shouted in reply we hurdled the bunches of sage and went over the brush rocks and gullies at breakneck speed i heard nothing but the wind singing in my ears hirams trail plain in the yellow ground showed me the way upon entering the cedars again we lost it i stopped my horse and checked ken then i called i heard the baying of the hounds but no answer to my signal dont say weve lost them cried ken come on the hounds are close we burst through thickets threaded the mazes of cedars and galloped over sage flats till a signal cry sharp to our right turned us i answered and an exchange of signals led us into an open glade where we found hiram jim and hal but no sign of a hound hyar you are said hiram now hold up an listen fer the hounds with the labored breathing of the horses filling our ears we could hear no other sound dismounting i went aside a little way and turned my ear to the breeze i hear prince i cried instantly which way both men asked west strange said hiram shore the hounds wouldnt split asked jim prince leave thet hot trail not much but hes runnin queer this mornin there now listen i put in there are prince and another hound with a deep bay thets curley i hear em now theyre runnin to us an hot we might see a cougar any minnit keep a tight rein youngsters mind a hoss is scan to death of a cougar the baying came closer and closer our horses threw up their ears hals pinto stood up and snorted the lad handled him well then at a quick cry from jim we saw prince cross the lower end of the flat there was no need to spur our mounts the lifting of bridles served and away we raced prince disappeared in a trice then curley mux and queen broke out of the cedars in full cry they too were soon out of sight hounds runnin wild yelled hiram the onslaught of the hunter and his charger stirred a fear in me that checked admiration i saw the green of a low cedartree shake and split to let in the huge gaunt horse with rider doubled over the saddle then came the crash of breaking brush and pounding of hoofs from the direction the hounds had taken we strung out in the lane hiram left and hung low over the pommels and though we had his trail and followed it at only half his speed yet the tearing and whipping we got from the cedar spikes were hard enough indeed a hundred rods within the forest we unexpectedly came upon hiram dismounted searching the ground mux and curley were with him apparently at fault suddenly mux left the little glade and with a sullen quick bark disappeared under the trees curley sat on his haunches and yelped shore somethins wrong said jim tumbling out of his saddle hiram i see a lion track here fellows i see one and its not where youre looking i added now what do you think im lookin fer if it aint tracks queried hiram hyars one cougar track an thars another jump off youngsters an git a good look at em hyars the trail we were on an thars the other crossin at right angles both are fresh one aint many minnits old prince an queen hey split one way an mux another curley wise old hound hung fire an waited fer me whar on earth is ringer it aint like him to be lost when thars doins like this what next asked jim mounting ill put curley on the fresher trail replied hiram an you all ought to be able to keep within hearin of himthar curleyhi hi curley dashed off on the trail mux had taken then began some hard riding hal and the pinto were directly in front of me and i saw that the lad was having the ride of his life sometimes he ducked the cedar branches and again he was not quick enough there were times when i thought he would be swept from his saddle but he hung on while the pinto made a hole in the brush more than once hal lost his stirrupfooting all the time that i watched him and turned to see if ken was all right i was getting a thrashing from the cedars but i felt only the severest lashes from time to time hiram yelled we managed to keep within earshot of curley and presently reached a candashon which judging by depth must have been middle candashon at that point it was a barrier to our progress but fortunately curley did not climb the opposite slope so we followed the rim and gained on the hound soon we heard mux curley had caught up with him we came to a point where the candashon was not so deep and wider and the slopes were less rugged curley bayed incessantly mux uttered harsh howls and both hounds in plain sight began working in a circle hiram reined in his horse and leaped off while the rest of us came to a halt off now youngsters said hiram sharply tie your hosses tight the cougars gone up somewhat run along the slope an look sharp in every cedar an pindashon an in every crevice of the cliffs hal jumped off but did not tie his pinto and he was white with excitement and panting heavily ken left his mustang and hurried along the ledge ahead of me every few steps he would stop to peer cautiously around as if he had been struck he suddenly straightened and his voice pealed out the lion the lion here he is i see himoh hurry hal i ran toward ken but could not see the lion then i stopped to watch mux he ran to the edge of a low wall of stone across the candashon he looked over and barked fiercely when i saw him slide down a steep slope make for the bottom of the stone wall and jump into the branches of a cedar i knew where to look for the lion then i espied a round yellow ball cunningly curled up in a mass of branches probably the lion had leaped into the tree from the wall treed treed i yelled mux has found him hiram appeared crashing down a weathered slope hyar everybody he bawled hustle down an make a racket we dont want him to jump chapter vii two lions hiram and jim rolled down and fairly cracked the stones in their descent i shouted for the boys to come on hal never moved a muscle and ken seemed chained to the spot hiram turned and saw them ho youngsters are you scared shouted he yes but im coming replied ken still he showed a strange vacillation overcome then by shame or anger he plunged down the slope and did not halt till he was under the snarling lion back ken back youre too close warned hiram he might jump an if he does dont run but drop flat hes a tom a twoyearold an hes sassy dont care whether he jumps or not panted ken bouncing about ive got to be cured of this this whatever ken had to be cured of he did not say but i had no doubt that it was dread i myself did not feel perfectly cool by some dozens of degrees the flaming eyes of the lion his open mouth with its white fangs his steady hissing growls the rippling of muscles as if it was his intention to leap at the hounds were matters certainly not conducive to calmness will you look at mux shouted ken the old hound had already climbed a third of the distance up to the lion hyar mux you rascal coonchaser yelled hiram out of thar he threw stones and sticks at the hound mux replied with his surly bark and steadily climbed on ill hey to pull him out or thartll be a dead hound in about a minnit said hiram watch close jim an tell me if the cougar starts down i cant see through the thick branches hell git mighty nervous jest before he starts when hiram mounted into the first branches of the cedar tom emitted an ominous growl and bunched himself into a ball trembling all over shore hes comin yelled jim the lion snarling viciously started to descend and hiram warily backed down it was a ticklish moment for all of us particularly hiram and as for me what with keeping an eye on the lion and watching the boys i had enough to do hals actions were singular he would run down the slope then run back wave his arms and let out an indian yell his brother kept dodging to and fro as if he were on hot bricks never before had i seen such eyes as blazed in ken wards face the lion went hack up the cedar mux climbed laboriously on and hiram followed fellars mebbe hes bluffin said hiram lets try him out now all of you grab sticks an holler an run at the tree as if you was goin to kill him the thrashing yelling din we made under that cedar might have alarmed even an african lion tom shook all over showed his white fangs and climbed so far up that the branches he clung to swayed alarmingly here punch mux out said jim handing up a long pole the old hound hung to the tree making it difficult to dislodge him but at length hiram punched him off he fell heavily whereupon venting his thick battlecry he essayed to climb again you old gladiator git down protested hiram what in the tarnal dickens can we do with sich a dog tie him up somebody jim seized mux and made him fast to the lasso with which curley had already been secured wal fellers i cant reach him hyar im goin farther up said the hunter rustle now yelled jim i saw that hiram evidently had that in mind he climbed quickly it was enough to make even a man catch his breath to watch him and i heard ken gasping hiram reached the middle fork of the cedar stood erect and extended the noose of his lasso on the point of his pole tom with a hiss and a snap savagely struck at it a second trial tempted the lion to seize the rope with his teeth in a flash hiram withdrew the pole and lifted a loop of the slack noose over the lions ears the other end of the lasso he threw down to jim pull he yelled jim threw all his weight into action pulling the lion out with a crash and giving the cedar such a tremendous shake that hiram lost his footing grasping at branches and failing to hold he fell apparently right upon the lion a whirling cloud of dust arose out of which hiram made prodigious leaps look out he bawled his actions without words would have been electrifying enough as i ran to one side the lion just missed hiram then with a spring that sent the stones rattling he made at ken the lad dove straight downhill into a thicket when the furious lion turned on jim that worthy dropped the lasso and made tracks here the quickwitted hiram seized the free end of the trailing lasso and tied it to a sapling then the wrestling lion disappeared in a thick cloud of dust dod gast the luck yelled hiram picking up jims lasso i didnt mean for you to pull him out of the tree hell kill himself now or git loose when the dust cleared away i discovered our prize stretched out at full length frothing at the mouth as hiram approached swinging the other lasso the lion began a series of evolutions that made him resemble a wheel of yellow fur and dust then came a thud and he lay inert hiram pounced upon him and loosened the lasso round his neck im afraid hes done fer but mebbe not theyre hardlived critters hes breathin yet hyar leslie help me tie his paws togetherbe watchful as i came up the lion stirred and raised his head hiram ran the loop of the second lasso round the two hind paws and stretched tom out while in this helpless position with no strength and scarcely any breath he was easy to handle with jim and me attending strictly to orders hiram clipped the sharp claws tied the four paws together took off the neck lasso and substituted a collar and chain let him breathe a little hes comin round all right said hiram but were lucky jim never pull another cougar clear out of a tree pull him off over a limb an hang him thar while some one below ropes his hind paws thets the only way an if we dont stick to it somebodyll git chewed up ken appeared all scratched and torn from his header into the thorny brake as he gazed at our captive he whooped for hal the lad edged down the slope and approached us eagerly he was absolutely unconscious that we were laughing at him his face was in a flush with brow moist and his telltale eyes protruding whatever the few thrilling moments had been to us they must have been tame compared to what they had been to hal wal youngster whar were you when it came off inquired hiram with a smile have we got him really whispered hal shore kid hes a good cougar now answered jim come along an watch me put on his muzzle said hiram hirams method of performing this part of his work was the most hazardous of all he thrust a stick between toms open jaws and when the lion crushed it into splinters he tried another and yet another till he found one that did not break then while tom bit on it hiram placed a wire loop over the animals nose slowly tightening it till the stick would not slip forward of the great canine teeth thar thets one ready to pack to camp well leave him hyar an hunt up prince an queen theyve treed the other cougar by this time when jim untied mux and curley it was remarkable to see what little interest they had in the now helpless lion mux growled then followed curley up the slope we all climbed out and mounted our horses hear thet yelled hiram thars prince yelpin hi hi hi from the cedars across the ridge rang a thrilling chorus of bays hiram spurred his horse and we fell in behind him at a gallop we leveled a lane of sage in that short race and when hiram leaped off at the edge of the impenetrable cedar forest we were close at his heels he disappeared and jim and ken followed him i heard them smashing the dead wood and soon a deep yell mingled with shouts and the yelps of the hounds i waited to tie kens mustang and i had to perform a like office for hal whose hands trembled so he could not do it he jerked his rifle out of his scabbard no no hal you wont want that put it back you might shoot somebody in the excitement come on keep your wits you can climb or dodge as well as i then i dragged him into the gloomy clump of cedars whence came the uproar first i saw ken in a tree climbing fast then mux in another and under him the other hounds with noses skyward and last up in the dead topmost branches a big tawny lion whoop the yell leaped past my lips quiet jim was yelling ken was splitting the air and hiram let out from his cavernous chest a booming roar that almost crowned ours i lifted and shoved hal into a cedar and then turned to the grim business of the moment hirams first move was to pull mux out of the tree hyar leslie grab him hes strongern a hoss if mux had been only a little stronger he would have broken away from me jim ran a rope under the collar of all the hounds there both of us pulled them from under the lion its got to be a slipknot said jim as we fumbled with the rope shore if the cougar jumps we want to be able to free the hounds quick then while hiram climbed jim and i waited i saw ken in the top of a cedar on a level with the lion hal hugged a branch and strained his gaze and judging from the look of him his heart was in his throat hirams gray hat went pushing up between the dead snags then his burly shoulders the quivering muscles of the lion grew tense and his lithe body crouched low he was about to jump his dripping jaws his wild eyes roving for some means of escape his tufted tail swinging against the twigs and breaking them manifested his terror and extremity the hunter climbed on with a rope between his teeth and a long stick in his hand git ropes ready down thar yelled hiram my rope was new and bothersome to handle when i got it right with a noose ready i heard a cracking of branches looking up i saw the lion biting hard at a rope which circled his neck jim ran directly under the tree with a spread noose in his hands then hiram pulled and pulled but the lion held firmly whereupon hiram threw his end of the rope down to me thar leslie lend a hand we both pulled with might and main still the lion was too strong suddenly the branch broke letting the lion fall kicking frantically with all four paws jim grasped one of the lower paws and dexterously left the noose fast on it but only by a hairs breadth did he dodge the other whipping paw let go leslie yelled hiram i complied and the rope hiram and i had held flew up over the branches as the lion fell and then it dropped to the ground hiram plunging out of the tree made a flying snatch for the rope got it and held fast stretch him out jim roared hiram an leslie stand ready to put another rope on the action had been fast but it was slow to what then began it appeared impossible for two strong men one of them a giant to straighten out that wrestling lion the dust flew the sticks snapped the gravel pattered against the cedars jim went to his knees and hirams huge bulk bowed under the strain then jim plowed the ground flat on his stomach i ran to his assistance and took the rope which he now held by only one hand he got up and together we lent our efforts getting in a strong haul on the lion short as that moment was it enabled hiram to make his lasso fast to a cedar the three of us then stretched the beast from tree to tree after which hiram put a third lasso on the front paws a whoppin female said hiram as our captive lay helpless with swelling sides and blazing eyes shes nearly eight feet from tip to tip but not extra heavy females never git fat hand me another rope with four lassoes in position to suit hiram the lioness could not move then he proceeded to tie her paws clip her claws muzzle and chain her i reckon you squirrels can come down now remarked hiram dryly to the brothers see hyar one of these days when we git split tharll be mebbe no one to help me but one of you youngsters what then to hal and ken who had dropped out of their perches the old hunters speech evidently suggested something at once frightful and enthralling shore as youre born thets goin to happen added jim as he wiped the sweat and dust from his face i never felt so before in my life said hal tremulously my whole insides went like a crazy clock when you break a springthen i froze scared stiff his naive confession strengthened any already favorable impression ken laughed kid didnt i say it was coming to you hal did not reply to this he had shifted his attention to the hounds jim was loosing them from the rope they had ceased yelping and i was curious to know how they would regard our captive prince walked within three feet of the lioness disdaining to notice her at all and lay down curley wagged his tail queen began to lick her sore foot tan wearily stretched himself for a nap only mux the incorrigible retained antipathy for our bound captive and he growled once low and deep and rolled his bloodshot eyes at her as if to remind her it was he who had brought her to such a pass and on the instant ringer lame and dusty from travel trotted into the glade and looking at the lioness he gave one disgusted grunt and flopped down chapter viii in camp how should we get our captives to camp this was the task which we faced next we sent ken back for the packhorses he was absent a long while and when at length he hove in sight on the sage flat it was plain that we were in for trouble marc the bay stallion was on the rampage why didnt he fetch the injun growled hiram who lost his temper only when things went wrong with the horses spread out boys an head him off we managed to surround the stallion and hiram succeeded in getting a halter on him kens face was red his hair damp and he looked as if he had spent an hour or two of trying responsibility i didnt want the bay he explained but i couldnt drive the others without him and what do you think of this when i told the indian that we had two lions he ran off into the woods say maybe i havent had some bother with that stallion i think riding him will be the only way to get him anywhere thats what im going to do next time wal first thing when we get to camp ill scalp the redskin said jim youngster you neednt be so flustrated put in hiram i reckon you did well to git marc hyar at all as they talked they were standing on the open ridge at the entrance to the thick cedar forest the two lions lay just within the shade hiram and jim using a pole had carried our first captive whom we had named tom up from the candashon to where we had tied the lioness ken as directed had brought a packsaddle and two long canvas sacks when hiram tried to lead the horse that carried these the animal began to tremble and pull back somebody unbuckle the straps yelled hiram it was good luck that i got the sacks and saddle off for in three jumps the horse broke from hiram and plunged away across the sage flat shore hell belong to the band of wild bosses commented jim i led up another horse and endeavored to hold him while jim and hiram got the packsaddle on it would have taken all three of us to hold him they smell the lions said hiram i was afraid they would consarn the luck never had hut one nag thet would pack lions try the sorrel i suggested he looks amiable for the first time in a serviceable life according to hiram the sorrel broke his halter and kicked like a plantation mule shore theyre scared said jim marc aint afraid try him hiram gazed at jim as if he had not heard aright go ahead hiram try the stallion i added i like the way he looks pack cougars on thet hoss exclaimed the astounded hiram shore replied jim the big stallion looked a king of horses just what he would have been if purcell had not taken him when a colt from his wild desert brothers he scented the lions for he held his proud head up his ears erect and his lame dark eyes shone like fire ill try to lead him in an let him see the cougars we cant fool him said hiram marc showed no hesitation nor indeed anything we expected he stood stifflegged before the lions and looked as if he wanted to fight shore hell pack them declared jim the packsaddle being strapped on and the sacks hooked to the horns hiram and jim while i held the stallion lifted tom and shoved him down into the left sack a madder lion than tom never lived it was hard enough to be lassoed and disgrace enough to be hogtied as jim put it but to be thrust down into a bag and packed on a horse was more than any selfrespecting lion could stand tom frothed at the mouth and seemed like a fizzing torpedo about to explode the lioness being considerably larger was with difficulty gotten into the other sack and her head and paws hung out i look to see marc bolt over the rim said hiram an i promised purcell to hey a care of this hoss hirams anxiety clouded his judgment for he was wrong marc packed the lions to camp in short order and as jim said without turnin a hair we saw the navajos head protruding from behind a tree here navvy i called hiram and jim yelled derisively whereupon the black head vanished and did not reappear then they unhooked one of the sacks and dumped out the lioness hiram fastened her chain to a small pinetree and as she lay powerless he pulled out the stick back of her canines this let the wire muzzle fall off she welcomed so much freedom with a roar the last action in releasing her from the bonds hiram performed with much dexterity he slipped the loop fastening one paw which loosened the rope and in a twinkling let her work the other paws free up she sprang mouth wide ears flat and eyes ablaze before the men lowered tom from the packsaddle i stepped closer and put my lace within six inches of his he promptly spat at me i wanted to see the eyes of a wild lion at close range they were beautiful great halfglobes of tawny amber streaked with delicate lines of black surrounded pupils of purple fire boys come here i called to ken and hal dont miss this chance bend close to the lion and look into his eyes both boys jerked back as tom spat and hissed but presently they steeled their nerves and got close enough therewhat do you see pictures exclaimed ken i want to let him go free replied hal instantly it pleased me that the brothers saw in the eyes of the lion much the same that i had seen pictures shone there and faded in the amber light the shaggytipped plateau the dark pines and smoky candashons the yellow cliffs and crags deep in these live pupils changing quickening with a thousand vibrations quivered the soul of this savage beast the wildest of all wild nature unquenchable love of life and freedom and flame of defiance and hate hiram disposed of tom in the same manner he had the lioness chaining him to an adjoining small pine where he leaped and wrestled dick look there comes jim with navvy said ken i saw jim leading and dragging the indian into camp i la sorry for navvy for i believed that his fear was not so much physical as spiritual the lion being a navajo god was an object of reverence to the indian and it seemed no wonder that navvy hung back from the sacrilegious treatment of his god forced along by jim the navajo dragged his feet and held his face sidewise jim drew him within fifteen feet and there held him while hiram tried to show and tell the poor fellow that the lions would not hurt him navvy stared and muttered to himself jim seemed to have some deviltry in mind for he edged up closer but just then hiram pointed to the loose horses and said to the indian chineago feed but no sooner had jim released navvy than he bolted and the yells sent after him made him run only the faster hell come back when he gits hungry said hiram ken you drive the hosses down in the holler whar thars good browse with an agile leap ken swung up on the broad back of the stallion hyar youngster pile off thar called hiram wal doggone me it appeared that our great stallion had laid aside his noble disposition and was his old self once more before ken had fairly gotten astride marc dropped his head humped his shoulders brought his feet together and began to buck it looked to me as if marc was a tougher bucking proposition than the wildest broncho that ever romped the desert for marc was unusually robust and heavy yet exceedingly active i hac seen him roll over in the dust three times each way and do it easily something i had never seer equaled by another horse ken began to bounce he twisted his strong hands in the mane of the stallion and held on it was plain that kens blood was up and all of us seeing that it was now safer for him to keep his seat began to give encouragement shore youre doin fine yelled jim but i fancied that jim did not mean ken was really doing well hirams concern changed to mirth and he roared it was as funny to see hal as it was to see ken the younger lad was beside himself with excitement and glee he ran around marc and his shrill yells pealed out stay with him kenstick onhug him tightget a new holdlook out then marc became a demon he plowed the ground apparently he bucked five feet straight up before ken had bounced now he began to shoot up into the air but the lad was powerful and his hold did not break easily higher and higher he rose and then the last time his heels went over his head he went up to the full extent of his arms and when he came down heavily his hold broke he spun around on the broad back of the stallion and went hurtling to the ground the soft pineneedle mat saved him from injury and he sat up jiminy he exclaimed no wonder navvy didnt ride him when we recovered from our mirth jim drawled out ken thet was the best buckin i ever seen a hoss do shore marc could buck off a cinched saddle ken i reckon youll hey to knuckle to marc said hiram an you better ride your own hoss dont worry replied ken i know when i have got enough he mounted his mustang and drove marc and the other horses down into the hollow when he returned we all saw navvy sneaking into camp behind him the indian stopped at a nearby pine but seeing that we appeared not to be concerned about him he presently approached we all busied ourselves with campfire tasks and i helped ken feed the hounds to feed ordinary dogs is a matter of throwing them a few bones our dogs however were not ordinary it took time to feed them and a prodigious amount of meat we had packed a quantity of wildhorse meat which had been cut into small pieces and strung on the branches of a scruboak prince had to be fed by hand i heard hiram say the hound would have starved if the meat had been thrown indiscriminately to the pack curley asserted his rights and preferred large portions at a time queen begged with solemn eyes but for all her gentleness she could eat more than her share tan needed watching and ringer because of imperfectly developed teeth had to have his portion cut into small pieces as for muxmux well great dogs have their faults he never got enough meat he would fight poor crippled queen and steal even from the pups and when he had gotten all that ken would give him and all he could snatch he would waddle away with bulging sides looking like an old dutch manofwar will our lions eat asked hal not for days replied hiram mebbe we can tempt them to eat fresh rabbits in a week or so but theyll drink tonight we made a hearty meal and afterward hiram and ken and i walked through the woods toward the rim a yellow promontory huge and glistening invited us westward and after a detour of half a mile we reached it the points of the rim stretching out into the immense void always drew me irresistibly we found the view from this rock one of startling splendor the corrugated rimwall of the middle wing extended to the west and at this moment apparently reached into the setting sun the golden light flashing from the millions of facets of chiseled stone created color and brilliance too glorious and intense for the gaze of men and looking downward was like looking into the placid blue bottomless depths of the pacific here help me push off this stone i said we heaved on a huge round stone and were encouraged to feel it move fortunately we had a little slope the boulder groaned rocked and began to slide just as it toppled over i glanced at the secondhand of my watch then with eyes over the rim we waited the silence was the silence of the candashon dead and vast intensified by our breathless earstrain ten long palpitating seconds and no sound i gave up the distance was too great for sound to reach us fifteen seconds seventeen eighteen with that a puff of air seemed to rise bringing a deafening peal of thunder it rolled up and widened deadened to burst out and roll louder then slowly like mountains on wheels rumbled under the rimwalls passing on and on to roar back in echo from the cliffs of the mesas roar and rumble roar and rumble for two long moments the dull and hollow echoes rolled at us slowly to die away at the last in the fardistant candashons thets a mighty deep hole commented hiram twilight stole upon us idling there silent content to watch the red glow pass away from the buttes and peaks the color deepening downward to meet the ebon shades of night creeping up like a dark tide on turning toward camp we tried a short cut which brought us to a deep hollow with stony walls it seemed better to go around it the hollow however was quite long and we decided presently to cross it we had descended a little way when suddenly the old hunter held me back with his big arm listen he whispered it was quiet in the woods only a faint breeze stirred the pineneedles and the weird gray darkness seemed approaching under the trees i heard the patter of light hard hoofs on the scaly sides of the hollow deer i asked in a low voice yes see he replied pointing ahead jest under thet broken wall of rock right thar on this side theyre goin down i descried gray objects the color of the rock moving down like shadows have they scented us hardly the breeze is against us mebbe they heerd us break a twig theyve stopped but are not lookin our way wal i wonder suddenly there was a rattle of stones followed by an indistinct thud as from the impact of soft heavy bodies and then the sound of a struggle in the hollow lion jumped a deer yelled hiram right under our eyes come on ken pull your gun on the critter thar he goes hi hi hi hiram ran down the incline yelling all the way and i kept close to him toward the bottom the thicket barred our progress so that we had to smash through but ken distanced us his yell pealed out and then crack crack went his sixshooter i saw a gray swiftly bounding object too long and too low for a deer hurriedly drawing my revolver i worked the trigger as fast as i could ken also was shooting and the reports blended in a roar that echoed from the cliff but for all our shots the cougar got away come here this way hurry called ken hiram and i crashed out of the brush and in another moment were bending over a gray mass huddled at kens feet it was a deer gasping and choking a yearlin doe said hiram look hyar low down on her neck whar the tarnal cat bit in hear thet wheeze thets blood in her throat ken if you hey another shot put her out of pain but neither ken nor i had an extra cartridge about us nor did hiram have his clasp knife and we had to stand there silent until the doe quivered and died then a signal cry rang down the slope thets jim said hiram it didnt take him long to git to us there was a crashing of brush quick thud of flying feet and jim loomed up through the gathering darkness he carried a rifle in each hand and he moved so assuredly and looked so formidable in the dusk that i thought of what such a reinforcement would mean at a time of real peril jim ive lived to see many strange happenins saw hiram but this was the first time i ever seen a cougar jump a deer shore you did enough shootin to make me think somethin had come off replied jim we soon returned to camp the richer by a quantity of fresh venison hal was sitting close to the fire and looked rather white i observed that he had his rifle he did not speak a word till ken told of our little adventure just before all the yells and shots i happened to be watching prince said hal he was uneasy he wouldnt lie down he sniffed the wind and growled i thought there must be a lion about wal i shore wish ken had plugged him said jim i believed jims wish found an echo in all our hearts at any rate to hear him and hiram express regret over the death of the doe justified in some degree my own feelings the tragedy we had all but interrupted occurred every night perhaps often in the day and likely at different points at the same time hiram told how he had found fourteen piles of bleached bones and dried hair in the thickets of less than a mile of the hollow on which we were encamped well rope the danged cats boys or by george well kill them wal its blowin cold hey navvy coco coco the indian carefully laying aside his cigarette kicked up the fire and threw on more wood discass cold he said to ken coco weyno fire good ken replied me savvy yes sleepie he asked moocha returned ken while we carried on a sort of novel conversation full of navajo english spanish and gestures absolute darkness settled down upon us i saw the stars disappear the wind changing to the north grew colder and carried a breath of snow i liked a north wind best from under the warm blankets because of the roar and lull and lull and roar in the pines crawling into bed presently i lay there and listened to the rising stormwind for a long time sometimes it swelled and crashed like the sound of a breaker on the beach but mostly from a low incessant moan it rose and filled to a mighty rush then suddenly lulled and this lull was conducive to sleep chapter ix a visit from rangers the navajo awoke us with his singing ken peeped lazily from under the blankets and then covered himself again the air was cold and flakes of white drifted through our windbreak of pine boughs snow exclaimed ken by all thats lucky i replied hiram wants snow more than anything why queried ken so we can track lions also have plenty of snowwater roll out now ken ohhh but im sore groaned ken as he laboriously got up and began to pull on his boots baseball training isnt one two six to this work stay off bucking horses i replied we walked to a roaring campfire the others were all astir even hal being up and busy hirams biscuits well browned and of generous size had just been dumped into the middle of our tarpaulin tablecloth the coffeepot steamed fragrantly and a huge skillet sizzled with a quantity of sliced venison youngster did you hear the injun asked hiram as he poked red coals in a heap round the skillet his singing woke me answered ken it wasnt a song thets the navajos mornin prayer a chant wal growls and snarls from the lions interrupted him i looked up to see hal fooling round our captives they were wet dirty bedraggled hiram had cut down a small pine and made shelters for the lions but they did not seem disposed to keep out of the snow let em alone youngster said hiram to hal they wont be drove mebbe theyll git in out of the wet arter a whilewere havin good luck an bad snows what we want but now we cant git the trail of the lion thet killed the doe chineago called jim who like the rest of us had begun to assimilate a little of the navajo language whereupon we fell to eating with appetites unknown to any save hunters somehow the indian gravitated to hal at mealtimes and now he sat crosslegged beside him holding out a plate and looking as hungry as mux at the first he always asked for what happened to be on hals plate and when that became empty he gave up imitation and asked for anything he could get the navajo had a marvelous appetite he liked sweet things sugar best of all it was a fatal error to let him get his hands on a can of fruit although he inspired hiram with disgust and jim with worse he was a source of unfailing pleasure to the boys whats on for today queried ken wal we may as well hang round camp an rest the hounds replied hiram i intended to go after the lion thet killed the deer but this snow has taken away the scent shore itll stop snowin soon said jim the falling snow had thinned out and looked like flying powder the leaden clouds rolling close to the treetops grew brighter and brighter bits of azure sky shone through rifts navvy had tramped off to find the horses and not long after his departure we heard the jangle of bells then he appeared riding hals mustang and racing the others toward camp ken and i set to work building a shack for the hounds and when we finished it there was no need of it for that time at least because all the snow had gone the sun was shining warmly and the forest was as brown and almost as dry as on the day before wal its a good idee to hey a day of rest onct in a while said hiram in answer to kens impatient desire to be on the hunt youngster youll git all you want but i tell you it might be useful fer us to prowl round an explore some of these hollers well need to know all about em places to cross whar they head an sich as thet now you an dick go north an jim an mell go south hal can keep camp with navvy so ken and i started off on foot we found the hollows extremely interesting they began where the forest of pines merged on the sage flats some were shallow and some deep vshaped cuts too steep for us to go straight down the thickets of scruboak lined the slope and thickets of aspen covered the bottom every hollow had its welldefined deer and lion trail and every thicket its grisly heap of bones and hide we jumped deer and flushed grouse and out of one hollow we chased the wild stallion and his band ken was delighted at the sight of them after several hours of leisurely exploring we returned toward camp dick i see strange horses said ken as we drew near sure enough there were horses in camp that did not belong to our party and presently i saw men who were not hiram or jim we had visitors perhaps theyre some mormon wildhorse hunters i replied i hope so for id like you to meet some of those fellows and go on a hunt with themno theyre rangers now ken i dont like this for a cent as we walked into camp neither hal nor the indian was in sight three rangers lolled about under the pines one of them i did not know the others had worked with me and did not like me any better than i liked them which was not much then a fourth fellow appeared from somewhere in the shade and when i recognized him i was divided between anger and distrust at this invasion of our camp this fourth individual belden by name had been a ranger and as he had been worthless and a hindrance to other rangers i got his discharge it had been an object of worry to me that after his discharge he still remained on the preserve in fact all these men were mormons and they resented the advent of hiram jim and myself the bone of contention was that the forest department had put us over them and the hard feelings had been shared even by the forest supervisor who was strongly in sympathy with native rangers to me the present situation looked as if these men had been sent to spy on us or they had undertaken that on their own account hello fellows i said what are you doing out here thought you were building a cabin at quakingasp were jest pokin around replied one a man named sells and he was the best of the lot we want to see how you trap them cougars said another belden laughed loudly an me im sort of scouting around too leslie ive got a new job with the forest service i queried yep what kind of a job im keepin tab on all the rangers the supervisor says itll go hard with any ranger ketched with fresh venison belden looked meaningly at me i thought the fellow was lying about a new job still i could not be certain as to that but there was no doubt about the gleam in his eyes meaning that he had caught me breaking the law belden weve got fresh venison in camp but we didnt kill it haw haw haw he guffawed it was hard for me to keep my temper on the moment i was glad to see hiram and jim approaching hiram stopped near where the lions were chained and i heard him mutter wal what in the tarnal dickens is the matter with thet lion from where i stood i could not see either of our captives jim lounged into camp and as he glanced with keen eyes from our visitors to me his genial smile faded shore weve got company he drawled i would have replied in no cordial acknowledgment of the fact but just then hal came out of the tent and sight of him cut short my speech hal wore a broad red mark across his cheek and any one could have seen that it was a mark made by a blow moreover he trembled either with excitement or anger and on closer view i saw that under his tan he was pale hal exclaimed ken sharply whats the matter with you nothing im all right thats not so id know from the look of you without that red welt on your face who hit you hal you couldnt have gotten in a scrap with navvy nope never mind how i got the welt i got it and thats enough replied hal where hal got that mark did not appear any great mystery to me i would have staked my horse that belden had given the blow sells i demanded which one of you struck the lad sells removed his pipe and puffed a cloud of smoke he did not seem in any hurry to reply speak up man who hit the lad belden wasnt it this time the ranger nodded what for what did he dohavent you a tongue talk i want to know i felt ken wards hand on my arm and i hesitated he took one long step forward this boy is my brother he said do i understand you to mean one of you hit him again sells nodded which one of you added ken sells pointed to the grinning belden ken made a quick passionate movement and took another long step that seemed involuntary then he wheeled to his brother hal what have you done this time you promised me youd behave if i brought you out west i declare im ashamed of you ill never cheese it shut up cried hal hotly youre always blaming me how do you know i deserved getting slapped do i always deserve the worst of everything nearly always hal im sorry to say returned ken gravely well this is one of the few times when i dont then said hal sullenly what did you do demanded ken i called that fellow every name i could lay tongue to retorted hal pointing a quivering finger at belden i called him a liar and a coward then he hit me why did you call him names he saw the deer meat hanging there on the tree and he kept saying we shot the deer but i held my temper then he got to teasing tom and trying to hold him with a forked stick he said we caught the lion in a trap and he was looking for trapmarks tom batted him one scratching him a little then he took up a club at this juncture hiram bent strode into the circle and he roared who clubbed thet lion if the injun the old hunter was angry clear through hold on hiram i interrupted were getting at the thing hal was just telling us go on lad look here hal spoke up ken in great earnestness tell the absolute truth dont stretch give me your word then ill believe you and if i do so will hiram and dick and jim hal repeated precisely what he had told us before hirams interruption and then he went on belden took up a club and beat tom over the head beat him till i was sure tom was dead then i couldnt stand it longer so i called belden a brute a coward a liar everything i could think of so he hit me knocked me down and kicked me leslie the youngsters tellin it straight said hiram thet cougar is all bunged up an any sneak who would beat a chained animal would hit a boy the old hunter then turned to belden that worthy had ceased to grin i looked closely at him to see if he had been drinking but it was not that he was surely sober enough belden afore i say anythin else id like to know what you mean by carryin on this way went on hiram mebbe you think beatin up chained cougars an boys as are keepin camp aint serious wal i reckon youll change your idee bent id change no idees of mine rejoined belden an one idea i got is then you trapped them cougars an another idee is thet i ketched you killin deer an thets agin the law im agoin to put you through for it for answer hiram strode to a pinetree some twenty paces from his tent and took down something from a dead snag as he returned i saw it was the head and neck of the yearling doe he showed it to belden and pointed out the laceration made by the teeth of the lion belden did not speak then hiram showed the wound to the other rangers sells youre a woodsman now what made thet wound a cougar killed thet doe an no mistake admitted sells thar the old hunter threw down the deer head and whirled to face belden i never saw a man any more furious than hiram was holding himself in control i aint carin a tarnal flip what sich as you think of my capturin cougars but fer beatin up a helpless animal i care this much youre wuss than the youngster called you youre the wust dog i ever seen an fer hittin this youngster im goin to pay you back in ken ward caught the old hunters arm the boy was white but he was as cool as ice and his eyes had the dark flash i had once or twice before seen in them he stepped in front of hiram and faced belden belden ill give you a chance to beat me up hey queried belden in stupid surprise hiram and jim appeared too amazed for speech and as for me i saw with a kind of warm thrill what was coming off hey mocked ken what do you think i mean fight belden kept on staring he was a grown man and probably could not conceive the idea of a boy wanting to fight him but i knew ken ward and i saw too that he was nearly as big as belden and when i compared the two and thought of kens wonderful agility and strength i felt the call of battle rise within me then conscience troubling me i made a halfhearted attempt to draw ken back i was too late the lad reached out with his hand his powerful right hand that had acquired much of its strength in gripping baseballs and he seized beldens nose between his fingers it was no wonder he did it beldens nose was long and red an offensive kind of nose the effect was startling like a mad bull belden roared ken pulled him round this way and that then he let go and squared himself bellowing furiously the ranger rushed at ken the lad appeared to step aside and flash into swift forward action at the same instant a sharp thud rang out and belden stopped in his rush and staggered but he did not fall then ken began to dance around the ranger any fight always roused me to a high pitch of excitement and this one gripped me so intensely that i could scarcely see it but then ken ward was so swift in action that even in a calm moment it would not have been easy to follow his motions i saw enough to know that the fight he had made with the greaser when i was bound fast was as nothing to this one ken appeared to be on all sides of belden at once he seemed to have as many arms as a centipede has legs beldens wildly swinging fists hit the air the way his head jerked up showed the way ken was hitting and the sound of his blows rang out like rapid pistolshots beldens swarthy face grew red and swollen all at once i seemed to hear mingled yells from hiram and jim and that made me conscious that i was yelling myself kens gray form flashed around belden and the rain of scientific blows went on suddenly ken stepped back and swung heavily belden went to his knees staggered up only to be met with a stunning shock that laid him flat he stirred laboriously groaned and cursed tried to sit up and fell back he was bloody his nose looked like a red cauliflower one eye was nearly closed ken stood erect panting hard still flamingeyed still unsatisfied his face showed a few marks of conflict hiram bent looked down at belden doggone it you did git a tarnal good lickinhey this goodhumored query from the lately furious hiram brought the rest of us to our senses chapter x hal presently belden got to his feet he did not look at ken or any of us and went directly for his horses he saddled and packed with hurried hands it showed what the humiliation meant to him as well as what kind of a fellow he was that he rode away without a word to his companions they were disposed to make a joke of it and were not above praising ken soon afterward they put up a tent and began preparations for supper i certainly had no desire for their company but neither had i any right to ask them to move on so i thought it was just as well that we should try to be friendly if you all dont mind we want to see you ketch a cougar said sells sartinly glad to show you replied hiram and shortly we were laughing and talking around the campfire just as if there had not been any unpleasantness i noticed however that hal did not speak a word to any of our visitors and indeed he was uncivil enough not to reply to questions they put this gave me the idea that hal had not told all of what had been done to him during our absence certainly he was not the kind of a boy to blab things from the light in his big gray eyes i fancied that he was cherishing a righteous anger against these invaders i made a note too of how intently he listened to all they said look ahere bent sells was asking is there any danger of them cougars gittin loose wal sometimes they break a collar or chain i lose probably one out of ten thet way but i cant tie them up any tighter for theyd choke themselves to death durn me if i like to sleep so close to cougars as this went on sells i allus wus scared of em jest cant stand fer cats any kind nohow nother am i powerful enraptured at the idee remarked one of his companions then why did you throw up the tent so close to them demanded sells nary danger fellers put in hiram my cougars wont hurt you onless you git in their way then i reckon youd git a swipe we talked and smoked around the camp fire for an hour or more then the north wind rose roaring in the pines and the night air grew cold soon we all sought our blankets i quickly dropped off to sleep sooner or later after that i was awakened by a terrible sound sitting up with a violent start i felt kens hands clasping me like a vise i heard his voice hut could not distinguish what he said for the uproar in the camp made hearing anything else impossible bloodcurdling shrieks yells and curses mingled with sounds of conflict they all came from the rangers tent by the pale moonlight i saw the tent wavering and shaking then followed the shrill rending of canvas hiram emerged from the gloom and bounded forward i jumped up eager to help but ignorant of what to do i held back then bang bang bang went a revolver and bullets whistled about lay low roared hiram above the tumult in the tent promptly i pulled ken with me behind a pine and peeped forth to make the din worse all the hounds began to bark furiously suddenly there came a violent shock from a heavy body plunging against the inside of the tent it waved this way and that then collapsed from the agitated canvas came hoarse smothered bellows if i had not been so nonplussed i would have given up to laughter but something was terribly wrong with the rangers i saw a dark form roll from under the tent rise and flee into the forest then another emerged from the other side the yells ceased now to be followed by loud cries of some one in pain with this hiram ran forward i saw him bend over and then was astounded to see him straighten up and begin to haul away on something but a gray hounding object explained the mystery hiram was dragging one of the cougars back from the demolished tent by george ken one of the lions got loose i exclaimed and it must have run right into the rangers tent great replied ken ward i jumped up and ran to help hiram but he had the cougar tied when i got to him even in the excitement i noticed that he was untying a lasso from the end of the chain i looked at hiram and he looked at me dont say nothin he whispered somebody tied this rope in the chain then pulled the cougar over to the rangers tent i found the lasso tied to the tentstake whew whats come off i ejaculated who did it how on earth he did it i cant reckon but ill bet it was thet tarnal boy halimpossible hiram wal i reckon there aint much thets impossible fer ken wards brothercome on somebodys hurt we can figure it out afterward jim appeared and then two men emerged from the dark shadow of pines one was sells little was said on the moment we lifted the tent and underneath we found the other ranger if he had been as badly hurt as he was frightened i thought surely we would presently have a dead ranger on our hands it turned out however that when we washed the blood from his face we found he had been badly scratched but not seriously injured and as neither sells nor the other ranger had been hurt the tension of the moment lessened and hiram particularly appeared greatly relieved i woke up said sells an seen thet durned cougar jump right in the tent he was quickern lightnin an he began to leap at me i dodged him an yellin like mad i tried to git out but every time i got near the tent door the cougar made at me an i hed to dodge then he got us all goin an there was no chance to do anythin but roll over an jump an duck pell throwed his gun an begin to shoot an if the tent hednt fallen in hed plugged one of usi jest knowed one of them cougars would rustle us last night plain it was that sells had no suspicion of a trick this relieved me i glanced round for hal but he was not in sight and i supposed he had not rolled out of his blankets presently all was quiet again in camp except that the lions were restless and clanked their chains sells and his companions had moved away some distance under the pines before i went to sleep again i told ken what hiram had said about hal and ken replied oh yes i knew whatever it was hal did it but jim must have had a hand in it i declared how could hal drag the lion even if he had the nerve dick that boy could drag a rhinoceros around if by it he could get even with somebody who had mistreated him you take my word those rangers did something to hal more than we know well whatever they did to him hes square with them did you ever hear such yelling they were scared wild reminds me of the time greaser and herkyjerky got mixed up with my bearcub in the old cabin on penetier only this was worse we soon slept again and owing to the break in our slumbers did not awaken until rather late sells and his rangers had decided they did not care so much after all to see hiram tie up a lion and with the rising of the sun they had departed shore its good riddance declared jim wheres hal asked ken his question acquainted me with the fact that hal was missing at once ken appeared troubled dont worry youngster assured hiram your brother will turn up presently have you seen him this morning nary a hair of him replied hiram have you jim i shore hevnt an whats more he wasnt in bed when i got rustled out last night by thet infernal racket an he didnt come back wal now thets new on me said hiram getting serious ken began to pace up and down before the campfire if anything happens to hal how can i ever lace my lather again see hyar youngster i reckon your father is a sensible man rejoined hiram he knowed things was goin to happen to thet wild kid an thets why he sent him with you hal will get his eye teeth cut out hyar i calkilate itll be wise fer you to jest stop worryin an let things happen shore shore added jim earnestly theres a good deal of sense in what hiram says i said no doubt hal is hiding somewhere and hell come in as soon as he finds out the rangers have gonejim werent you in that trick last night i shore wasnt replied jim complacently i knew then that it would be impossible ever to find out whether or not he had really aided hal hiram would it have been possible for hal to pull off that lion stunt all by himself i inquired the old hunter looked thoughtful wal it does seem onreasonable but i aint doubtin it the youngster is strong an a daredevil then he has watched me handlin the cougars hes a wonder on imitation thet boy its a fact thet a young cougar arter hes been tied up fer a day or so will be kinder sluggish fer a little on bein dragged round agin hell hang back an not begin to jump an pull an fight till hes waked up thoroughly its quite possible i reckon thet hal sneaked up to the tree loosed the chain an tied a rope to it then he dragged the cougar over to the rangers tent tied the rope to the tentstake an then wal im balked how did he git the cougar into thet tent hell hey to tell us its a wonder no one was killed said ken it shore is replied jim i wish hed come in went on ken only whatll he do next we got breakfast ate it and still hal did not put in appearance the navajo came in however and that made us wonder how far he had been from the camp jim was of the opinion that navvy had been so scared by the uproar that he had run till he dropped i observed pineneedles thick in navvys black hair and knew he had slept somewhere under a pine hiram went to feed the hounds and almost instantly i heard him exclaim wal ill be doggoned whats the matter hiram the pups gone too he didnt break away hes been untied thats sartin fer i was pertickler to fasten him tight hes been crazy to run off an trail somethin the youngster hes took him ken marched over to where hal kept his saddle and outfit he left his rifle and all the rest of his trappings a sudden thought made me grow cold hiram mightnt sells have fooled us pretended he didnt know the trick and then got hold of halthose mormons wouldnt think much of dropping him over the rim oh no cried ken ward following that we all fell silent and instinctively looked to the old hunter for help or assurance but hiram appeared much disturbed in mind all at once a little shock went over his tall form making him suddenly rigid listen he said i complied with all my ears but heard nothing except the wind in the pines and the hammering of a flicker on a dead branch shore began jim hiram held up a finger in warning listen with the puffs of wind then followed a long listening silence after what seemed an age i heard a faint yelp of a hound it was so low that it was almost indistinguishable jim heard it too and at last ken as i could tell by their faces we all remained silent still held by hirams uplifted finger its the pup said hiram finally hes way over to the west i reckon hes arter a coyote or else hes yelpin because somethins happened to now fellers ill make a beeline fer whar i think he is if i let out a string of yells you all come arunnin with dogs an guns if i yell onct head me off to your left if twice head me off to your right with that he took up a rifle and strode rapidly off into the forest jim had nothing to say and i did not look at ken for from hirams unfinished speech it looked as if he feared an accident had befallen hal we waited moments and moments once ken imagined he heard a shout and then jim turned a doubtful ear to the west but i assured them they were mistaken presently we were electrified by rapid yells far off in the forest yet clear and ringing on the wind jim unchained the hounds and strung a rope through their collars while ken and i gathered up guns and ropes the navajo was as excited as we were and he followed us out of camp but soon lagged behind we ran across the level glades and through the brown aisles and up and down the hollows jim called a halt and pealed out a signal to hiram the answer came and again we ran the hounds had become excited by this unusual proceeding they barked and plunged to get away from jim ken distanced us and jim yelled for him to wait when we caught up with him once more jim sent out a cry this time hirams answer proved we were traveling off to the right so we sheered round and hurried on openings in the greenblack wall of pines showed me that we were nearing the rim the hollows grew deeper and had to be headed which change of direction threw us out of line jims next signal drew a stentorian blast from the old hunter and that caused us to run with all we had left in us then at the end of a long aisle we saw hiram waving to us and we had a mad race that ken won by several rods i stopped panting for breath and surveyed the glade with quick eyes at the same moment the pack of hounds burst into wild clamor theres hal shouted ken in a glad voice i saw the lost lad sitting composedly on a log next i saw the pup he was quite beside himself yelping leaping and his nose pointed straight upward following the direction thus indicated i looked up in a short dead pinetree to see a snarling lion chapter xi hiram calls on ken the full wild chorus of the hounds mingled with our yells of exultation prince stood on his hind legs and pawed the air in his eagerness to get to the lion muxmux the old wardog had as usual lost his reason when we had calmed down somewhat hiram said its another twoyearold an fairsized fellars thets the best tree fer our ropin purposes i ever seen a cougar in spread out now an surround him an keep lively an noisy when hiram swung himself on the first stubby branch of the pine the lion some fifteen feet above leaped to another limb and the one he had left cracked swayed and broke it fell directly upon hiram the blunt end striking his head and knocking him out of the tree fortunately he landed on his feet otherwise there would surely have been bones broken he appeared stunned and reeled so that jim caught him the blood poured from a wound in his head this sudden shock sobered us instantly on examination we found a long jagged cut in hirams scalp we bathed it with water from my canteen and with snow jim procured from a nearby hollow eventually stopping the bleeding i insisted on hiram coming to camp to have the wound properly dressed and he insisted on having it bound with a bandanna i reckon it doesnt amount to much said hiram but im a little dizzy an better not climb any morewal youngster hyars whar i call on you he directed this last remark toward ken what what stammered ken i want you to go up an slip the rope over the cougars head well do the rest kens face went first red then white he gave a kind of eager gasp and a wild start at once he stared at the old hunter and it was a full moment before his natural color returned you want me to rope him sartinly you are supple an quick an with me to tell you what to do the job can be done bettern if i went up arter him dont be scared now ken if he gits sassy up thar ill warn you in plenty of time without a word ken took the lasso and began to climb the pine hal ward stood as if petrified only his eyes seemed alive and they were wonderful to behold i appreciated what the situation meant to the boy he had not believed kens stories of an old hunter roping wild beasts and here was ken himself about to perform the miracle not so fast youngster called hiram dont crowd him its hard to tell what move hell make next an thars the danger the cougar changed his position growled spat clawed the twigs and kept the treetrunk between him and ken wait hes too close to the tree said hiram youve got to chase him out on a limb itll be best for you to git a little above him ken try an scare him break off a branch an throw at him ken was eighteen feet below the cougar on the opposite side of the tree he broke off a snag and thrashed and pounded then throwing it he hit the beast square in the side there was an explosion of spits and snarls and hisses thets the way yelled hiram make him think youre goin to kill him go on up now hurry dont hesitate hell back out on thet thick branch it surely must have tried kens nerve to obey the hunter i thought that ken could have been excused if he had not obeyed but he climbed on and slowly the cougar backed out on the limb shore ken youre more at home in thet tree than the critter himself cried jim and so it really appeared for kens movements were rapid and certain his lithe powerful form seemed to glide up between the branches without effort and the lion was awkward and slow plainly showing he feared he might fall thar ken thetll do shouted hiram as ken reached a point a little above the cougar now youre right make a noose not too big an sort of pitch ittry again youngster an be deliberate youre nervous youre perfectly safe cause if he gits a notion to start fer you jest climb up farther hell never foller you uptharyou ketched him thet time whoop we all whooped and i thought jim williams would stand on his head he had come to exhibit the most extraordinary delight in the achievements of the lads draw the noose tightjest pull easylike fer hes bitin at the rope an if you jerk too hard youll thar i could hey done no better myself come down nowno dont climb down slide down on the rope ken had not spoken a word since he had gone up the pine and now he turned his tense white face down to us and looked as if he had not heard aright slide down the rope yelled hiram itll hold with that ken gave the lasso a strong pull and the lion braced himself then ken stepped off the limb and slid down the lasso hand over hand while the lion held his weight with apparent ease ken was breathing hard and he had the expression of a man whom strong thrilling excitement had carried through a deed the reality of which he scarcely appreciated make your noose ready yelled hiram to jim i had dropped my rope to help them pull the animal from his perch the branches broke in a shower then the lion hissing snarling whirling plunged down he nearly jerked the rope out of our hands but we lowered him and then hiram noosed his hind paws in a flash make fast your rope shouted he thar thets good now let him down easy as soon as the lion touched ground we let go the lasso which whipped up and over the branch he became a round yellow rapidly moving ball jim was the first to catch the loose lasso and he checked the rolling cougar hiram leaped to assist him and the two of them straightened out the struggling animal while i swung another noose on the second throw i caught a front paw pull hard stretch her out yelled hiram he grasped up a stout piece of wood and pushed it at the lion he caught it in his mouth making the splinters fly hiram shoved the head of the beast back on the ground and pressed his brawny knee on the bar of wood the collar the collar quick he called i threw the chain and collar to him which in a moment he had buckled on thar weve got him he said its only a short way over to camp so well drag him without muzzlin as he rose the lion lurched and reaching for him fastened its fangs in his leg hiram roared jim and i yelled and ken though frightened was so obsessed with the idea of getting a picture that he began to fumble with the shutter of his camera grab the chain pull him off bawled hiram i ran in and took up the chain with both hands and tugged with all my might jim too had all his weight on a lasso between the two of us we choked the hold of the lion loose but he tore hirams leather legging then i dropped the chain and jumped hyar hyar exploded hiram to ken do you think more of a picture than savin my life having expressed this not unreasonable protest he untied the lasso that jim had made fast to a small sapling then we three men forming points of a triangle around an animated center began a march through the forest that for variety of action and uproar beat any show i ever saw so rare was it that the navajo came out of hiding and straightway forgetting his reverence and fear began to execute a ghost dance or war dance or at any rate some kind of an indian dance along the side lines there were moments when the lion had jim and me on the ground and hiram wobbling others when he ran on his bound legs and chased the two in front and dragged the one behind others when he came within an ace of getting his teeth into somebody we had caught a tartar we dared not let him go and though hiram evidently ordered it no one made his rope fast to a tree there was no chance the lion was in the air three parts of the time and the fourth he was invisible in dust the lassos were each thirty feet long but even with that we could just barely keep out of reach then came the climax as it always comes in a lion hunt unexpectedly and with lightning swiftness we were nearing the bottom of the second hollow well spread out lassos taut facing one another i stumbled and the lion leaped the weight of both brought jim over sliding and slipping with his rope slackening the leap of the lion carried him within reach of hiram and as he raised himself the cougar reached a big paw for him just as jim threw all his strength and bulk on his lasso the seat of hirams trousers came away with the claws of the lion then he fell backward overcome by jims desperate lunge hiram sprang up with the velocity of an arab tumbler and his scarlet face working spasmodically and his moving lips showed how utterly unable he was to give expression to his rage i had a stitch in my side that nearly killed me but laugh i would if i died for it but it was no laughing matter for hiram he volleyed and thundered at us all the while however we had been running from the lion which brought us before we realized it right into camp our captive lions cut up fearfully at the hubbub and the horses stampeded in terror whoa yelled hiram whether to us or the struggling cougar no one knew but navvy thought hiram addressed the cougar whoa repeated navvy no savvy whoa no savvy whoa which proved conclusively that the navajo had understanding as well as wit soon we had another captive safely chained and growling away in tune with the others i went back to untie the hounds to find them sulky and out of sorts from being so unceremoniously treated they noisily trailed the lion into camp where finding him chained they gave up in disgust hiram soon recovered from his anger and laughed loud and long at what he considered the most disgraceful trick he had ever had played on him by a cougar then as we sat in the shade resting well content with ourselves hiram and jim and ken began to fire questions at hal the lad was as usual not inclined to talk but the old hunters admiration and jim williams persuasive questions at length proved too much for hal his story of getting the lion to the tent of the rangers tallied precisely with the manner in which hiram had explained it wal i reckoned on thet said hiram but youngster how did you ever git the lion inside the rangers tent thet stumps me hal appeared surprised why i didnt put the lion in the tent and the lion didnt go in the tent when i tied the lasso to the tentstake tom began to wake up and buck he lunged back near the door of the tent and began to roar and spit just then i guess sells woke up and began to bawl i crawled away and got behind a tree then i watched it looked to me as if the rangers just got up and ran here and there with the tent over them gee but didnt they howl but i know positively that the lion was not in the tent at all how on earth did that ranger get all scratched up i asked peared to me them scratches were sorter unlike cougar scratches remarked hiram thet fellar scratched himself wrastlin round shore then thet story of sells was a big yarn why the way he talked youd thought the tent was full of cougars said jim i reckon sells lied but he believed what he said probably he waked up an seein the cougar between the flaps of the tent he was so scared thet he imagined all the rest an of course his yellin thet way was enough to scare the other rangers into fits why i was scared myself we had a good laugh at the expense of sells and his companions and our conviction was that they had paid dearly for their spying visit wal then what did you do went on hiram i untied one of the hounds the first i got my hands on replied hal i wanted to go off in the woods because i thought the rangers would find out i put up the job on them and i wanted company so i took the dog i sat up awhile and then fell asleep when i awoke the woods were getting gray it was near daylight the pup had left me and presently i heard him barking way off in the woods i went after him and when i found him he had the lion treed thats all oh thats all eh inquired ken with a queer look at his brother well i hope it holds you for a while youngster i cant find the heart to scold you now said hiram soberly but you was careless of yourself an the feelins of others shore kid you was plumb bad added jim as it turned out thet lion stunt tickled me most to death it shore did but mebbe the luck of it was accident dont pull off no more tricks like thet i added my advice to that of the others but i observed that hal though he appeared contrite and subdued did not make any rash promise as to future behavior chapter xii navvys waterloo that night we were sitting around the campfire and hiram was puffing at his pipe in a way that seemed rather favorable for the telling of a story he had long promised the boys it was an unusually cool night so cool that we all hugged the fire except hal he hung back in the shadow this action i would scarcely have noted particularly had he not made elaborate efforts to attract attention to some real or pretended task i had come to regard hal with considerable doubt and felt safer to watch him from a distance navvy sat right upon the fire stolid as usual with his bright black eyes fixed upon the red embers from time to time he puffed at a cigarette ken had a seat back of the indian just out of the severest heat and he left it occasionally to stir and rake some coals over a potato he was baking its shore fine round the campfire remarked jim spreading his hands to the blaze thars snow in the wind said hiram it reminds me just then ken poked the embers again startling as a flash of lightning the campfire blew up in a blinding flare it burst into a huge light and exploded with a boom into millions of sparks pieces of burning wood flew every way red embers and hot ashes and showers of sparks covered us i heard the indian yell and ken yelled still louder then came black darkness we were all threshing about scared out of our wits and trying to beat the fire from our burning clothes that was a pretty lively moment when the excitement quieted down a little i heard jims wrathful voice hiram was so astounded he could not be angry doggone me he ejaculated what in the tarnal dickens was thet youngster was thet a potato you was bakin or a dinnamite bomb by george declared ken breathing hard youve got one on me ive no idea what happened make a light im burned alive it developed presently when hiram got a fire blazing some yards distant from the dangerous campfire site that ken had been pretty severely burned his face was black with charcoal it took several moments for us to put out the burning holes in his shirt and trousers kens hands trembled and when he washed the black from his face we saw that he was pale he had been badly frightened but fortunately had escaped serious injury for a little while we all talked at once so that i could hardly grasp anything we said the indian came warily out of the darkness and this was the first we had seen of him since the explosion we had forgotten all about him he had been sitting near the fire but though apparently more frightened than ken he had not been so badly burned hey hal where are you called ken here came a response from the woodpile are you all right sure never touched me replied hal scared you though ill bet itd take more than a busting log of firewood to scare me ken was silent we were all silent revolving hals cool explanation of the explosion ohh it would finally exclaimed ken and there was a world of meaning in his peculiar tone of voice hiram growled low and deep jim was shaking in silent mirth and the navajo was staring from one to the other of us as if he did not know what to make of such company he kept feeling his shirt and this action led me to the discovery that his shirt was wet not only was it wet but hot hiram the indians shirt is all wet and mighty hot too i said did you have a pot of water on the fire it might have tipped and caused the blowup it was plain from the fact that hiram did not trust his memory and went to look over his outfit of pans and pots that he was much disturbed in mind mebbe mebbe he said as he fumbled among them doggone it no hyar they all are an nary one wet jim can you smell powder i asked no thet shore must have been a bustin log replied jim that was a steam explosion my man i replied somebody put a sealed fruitcan in the fire or buried a jar of water in the ashes no more was said on the moment but later when hal and jim were tying up the dogs ken broke out emphatically another job of the kids whatever it was it certainly got me i was never so scared in my life hiram isnt there any way we can scare hal its got to be done wal youngster ill think on it lets play a trick on hal give him a dose of his own medicine hiram its a wonder to me he hasnt done something to you and dick he will yet wal youngster i reckon youll find leslie an me accomplices in any reasonable trick on thet thar lad itll be greatbut what hell do to us if he ever finds it out will be aplenty by this time ken seemed obsessed with his idea yet all the while he showed a strange halfreluctance as if he bore in mind hals remarkable powers of retaliation but how he asked can we coax jim into the scheme leave that to me ken i said jim would fall victim to any fun now well get jim to fire hal out of his bed and well all refuse to take him in ours on some pretext or other then the navajo will naturally gravitate to hal and well find some way to scare him next morning i found a favorable opportunity wherein i approached jim with my proposition and won him over easily he had weakness of that sort we hunted that day and at supper jim groaned and took as much trouble in sitting down as if his leg was in splints whats wrong with you inquired hiram with extraordinary sympathy its my leg wal you know i told you its thet place where hal has been kickin me every night in his sleep wha at stammered hal his eyes opened wide lad im sorry to hey to hurt your feelins replied jim gently but ive shore stood it as long as i could youre one of them nightmare sleepers an when you git after anythin or anythin gits after you then you kick i never seen a broncho thet could hold a candle to you no matter how you lay on your side or back or belly you can kick an allus in the same place i was throwed from a horse once an hurt this leg an right theres where youve been kickin me hal looked as if he wanted to cry he seemed unmistakably genuinely ashamed of himself oh jim i know i have crazy dreams and thrash about in my sleep why why didnt you kick back kick me out of bed shore lad you neednt feel bad about it i aint blamin you i realize were havin some pretty warm times after these cougars enough to make any feller hey nightmares i wont trouble you again that way said hal earnestly ill sleep somewhere elsehiram can i come in your tent way over on one side far from you youngster i wish you hednt asked me replied hiram in apparent distress fer ive got to refuse im gittin old hal an i must hey my rest youd keep me awake pride and mortification held hal back from further appeal he finished his supper without another word then he took the axe and cutting down some small pines began to make a shack navvy got so interested that he offered to help and to our great delight when the shack was completed hal pointed to it and asked the indian to share it with him the next day we had some strenuous chases the hounds split on fresh trails and we were separated from one another one by one we got back to camp and it was a mooted question which were the most worn out hunters or hounds it was about dark when jim came riding in fellers you shore missed the windup he said throwing the skin of a cougar on the ground wal doggone it you hed to kill one exclaimed hiram shore curley and tan treed thet one an i yelled fer you till i lost my voice he started down finally an as i was afraid hed kill a dog i hed to kill him when i got the skin i started to work up to the place i left my hoss its bad climbin i got on a side of a cliff an saw where i could work out if i could climb a smooth place so i tried there was little cracks an ridges for my hands an feet all to once just above i heard a low growl lookin up i saw a big lion biggern any weve chased an he was pokin his head out of a hole an shore tellin me to come no farther i couldnt let go with either hand to reach my gun because id have fallen so i yelled at him with all my might he spit at me an then walked out of the hole over the bench as proud as a lord an jumped down where i couldnt see him no more i climbed out all right but hed gone an i tell you for a minute he shore made me sweat that night hiram whispered to ken and jim and me to stay up till hal and navvy had gone to bed we did not need to wait long and soon navvys snores and hals deep breathing assured us we might safely talk of our plan youngster you slip up an steal hals gun whispered hiram i wouldnt be easy in mind monkeyin with thet kid if he hed a gun handy ken got down on his hands and knees and crawled noiselessly toward the shack he did not return for some time at last he appeared carrying hals weapons and we all breathed easier thet kid shore has us all buffaloed remarked jim then we got our heads together it was not strange for ken to be eager to pay hal back in his own coin and perhaps i was still young enough to feel the fun of a good welldeserved trick but it did seem strange for hiram bent and jim williams to outdo us in eagerness hiram was excited and jim was bursting with suppressed glee see hyar youngster ive planned it all said hiram now you take this lasso thars a noose on each end an jest wrap it once round thet little saplin thar an then slip a noose over hals foot an one over navvys youve planned and i must execute protested ken by george hiram cant dick help me ill take one end of the lasso i replied that will make it easier for us to wrap the middle of the lasso round the sapling well both walk round it once come on the sapling in question was about fifteen feet from hals shack and quite in the open ken and i got the lasso round it and then dropping on all fours we crawled stealthily toward the shack you take the indian i suggested in a whisper good whispered ken id rather try to rope geronimo than my kid brother like snails we crept on as tense and silent as if there were real danger we reached the shack and lay low a moment hal had wrapped himself in his blanket but the navajo lay partially uncovered it turned out that i had gotten the worse of the choice for ken soon slipped his noose over navvys uncovered foot and i had carefully to remove the blanket from hal before i could get the lasso over his foot hal kicked but he did not awaken i returned to the other conspirators to find ken already there what next i demanded wal its my turn now whispered hiram an if you fellers dont see some fun then im an old fool what are you going to do asked ken youngster i never seen the sleepin injun thet i couldnt scare out of his skin an you jest listen an watch hiram got down flat on the ground and began to squirm like a snake with a perfectly noiseless motion he went out of sight toward the shack we waited holding fast to each other straining eyes and listening with all our might the silence was unusual there being only a faint moan of wind in the pines suddenly a hideous earsplitting sound rose on the night air it was neither yell nor roar nor bawl like a prolonged superhuman shriek it pierced us transfixed us to the spot it bore some faint resemblance to a terrible loud coarse whistle the shack flew up and tumbled to pieces out of which bounded the navajo his screech of terror rose above hirams unearthly cry navvy leaped and then like a ninepin down he went hal jumped up and yelling ran the other way and down he went both sprang up and leaped away again only to go tumbling down quick as thought navvy rose and started to run hal doing the same ran into the indians arms then hiram stopped his unearthly noise the frightened dogs burst into an uproar everything happened so quickly that i could scarcely keep track of it down went navvy and hal all in a heap suddenly hiram roared out hyar you carnal redskin stop thet we rushed up to find navvy sitting astride hal and pommeling him at a great rate it was only the work of a moment to rescue poor hal after which he roared as loudly as hiram but our roaring was laughter we had not thought that navvy would suspect hal and that had made our little trick thrice successful how much does it take to scare you hal choked ken hiram added his say hal i was jest wonderin what your pa would hey thought if he hed seen you we did not see any more of hal till next day as that was to be a day of rest particularly for the hounds we lounged in the shade hiram however who was seldom idle spent his time in making buckskin moccasins for the hounds more or less we all bantered hal with our several opinions of what it took to scare him like a waiting volcano with a cold exterior hal endured our sallies in silence indeed he did not appear to hold resentment hal was not that sort of a boy but all the same his brain was busy and we all shivered in our boots whatever hals feelings were toward us he did not reveal but he watched the indian steadily and thoughtfully by that we knew hal had designs on navvy and we awaited developments with some relief and much interest toward sunset we were interrupted by yells from the navajo off in the woods the brushing of branches and pounding of hoofs preceded his appearance in some remarkable manner he had got a bridle on marc and from the way the big stallion hurled his huge bulk over logs and through thickets it appeared evident he meant to usurp jims ambition and kill the navajo hearing hiram yell the indian turned marc toward camp the horse slowed down when he neared the glade and tried to buck but navvy kept his head up with that marc seemed to give way to ungovernable rage and plunged right through camp he knocked over the dogshelter and thundered down the ridge now the navajo with a bridle in his hands was thoroughly at home he was getting his revenge on marc and he would have kept his seat on a wild mustang but marc swerved suddenly under a low branch of pine sweeping the indian off when navvy did not rise we began to fear he had been seriously hurt perhaps killed and we ran to where he lay face downward hands outstretched with no movement of body or muscle he certainly appeared dead badly hurt said hiram probably back broken ive seen it afore from jest sich accidents oh no i cried and i felt so deeply i could not speak jim who always wanted navvy to be a dead indian looked profoundly sorry hes a dead injun all right replied hiram we rose from our stooping postures and stood around uncertain and deeply grieved till a mournful groan from navvy afforded us much relief thets your dead indian exclaimed jim hiram stooped and felt the indians back and got in reward another mournful groan its his back said hiram and true to his ruling passion forever to minister to the needs of horses and men and things he began to rub the indian and called for the liniment hal went to fetch it while i who still believed navvy to be dangerously hurt knelt by him and pulled up his shirt exposing the hollow of his brown back here you are said hal returning on the run with a bottle pour some on replied hiram hal removed the cork and soused the liniment all over the indians back dont waste it remonstrated hiram starting to rub navvy then occurred a most extraordinary thing a convulsion seemed to quiver through the indians body he rose at a single leap and uttering a wild piercing yell broke into a run i never saw an indian or anybody else run so fleetly yell after yell pealed back at us absolutely dumfounded we all gazed at each other thets your dead indian ejaculated jim doggone me exclaimed hiram look here i cried picking up the bottle see dont you smell it jim fell face downward and began to shake what shouted hiram turpentine you idiots turpentine hal brought the wrong bottle chapter xiii the cabdquoon and its discoverers hal however was not always making trouble like ken he had a thoughtful turn of mind and when in this mood he was not slow to seek information what made this candashon he asked and i undertook to tell him well hal i dont see how any one could look at this candashon without wondering how it was made i said it seems to me the forces of nature were no more wonderful here than elsewhere but here you can see so much of whats been done and that makes you curious ages ago you know the whole face of the earth was covered by water and as the crust began to cool and shrink and crumple up the first land began to rise above the water in this part of the country the rockies were the first points of land to appear as the earths crust kept on crumpling these mountains kept rising above the water as they rose they began to weather and dust sand silt and rock washed back into the ocean and formed layers on the bottom this went on for thousands and thousands of years all this time the earth was lifting itself out of the sea and finally a continent was formed but it wasnt much like the continent of today florida and the southern states were still under water there was a great inland sea north of this plateau region and as the uplift continued this inland sea began to flow out cutting a river into the plateau this river was the colorado probably it rained much harder and longer in those early days and the river with its tributaries had greater power and there was a greater erosion the colorado cut its way through to the gulf of california as time went on and the uplift of land continued the river cut deeper and deeper and erosion by rain and wind and frost widened the channel into a candashon the different layers of rock raised up were of different degrees of hardness and softness some readily wore away others were durable these layers were the deposit of silt into the ocean bed where they had been burned or cemented into rock strata there have been fifteen thousand feet three miles of strata washed off from the earth here where we sit now then the uplift increased or there was a second and quicker uplift of the plateau it was greater here where we are than southward thats why the north rim is so much higher the whole plateau has a tilt to the north this second uplift gave the river a greater impetus toward the sea and that of course gave it greater cutting power the narrow inner candashon was thus formed this drained the inland sea the river is small now to what it was then but the same washing grinding of sand on rock is going on down there and up above the same eroding and weathering of rims gee whiz exclaimed hal its easy to understand the way you put it then these differentcolored cliffs the yellow and red and white theyre made out of the sand and silt once washed into the sea and petrified into the layers the strata you called it and then uplifted to be washed away again it takes my breath yes and from these layers we can determine when life first appeared in the sea for we find shells and bones of a low order of life imbedded in this rock who discovered the candashon anyhow asked hal if the fellow rode out of the cedars right upon the rim without being prepared ill bet he thought hed come to the jumpingoff place ken can tell you that better than i i replied its worth knowing hal said ken look here who were the first white people in america anyway the jamestown virginia colony in hal answered triumphantly and the plymouth colony in ken laughed well said hal rather sulkily of course there are all the stories of norsemen dropping in any old time all the way from newfoundland to long island sound but they certain didnt amount to much as settlers no we wont count the norsemen said ken but hal just think of this the grand candashon away out here in this wilderness was discovered in sixtyseven years before the jamestown colony landed and eighty years before the mayflower dropped anchor at plymouth hal whistled that makes plymouth rock look young he said who found the candashon it was discovered by a spaniard his name was don lopez de cardenas he was a lieutenant of the great spanish explorer coronado who sent him out from his camp near the socalled seven cities of cibola usually identified as the pueblos of zuni cardenas with a handful of men traveled into northern arizona and finally reached the gorge now known as the grand candashon he must have traversed the southerly edge of the colorado plateau and passed through the coconina forests i dont understand said hal these were spanish warriors in helmets and breasts plates like the men with cortez in mexico and pizarro in south america what brought them to such an outoftheway place as this its a romance replied ken earnestly but its a true one and it goes back to the search for a way to the treasures of the far east which led to columbus discovery of cat or san salvador island in the west indies and then to the spanish occupancy of cuba and to the goldhunts of de soto in our south and pizarro in south america i dont see the connection grumbled hal you will in a minute you see when the spaniards were settled in cuba in the early sixteenth century they kept on looking for two things gold and a water route to cathay or china and the spice islands of the east now in a spanish expedition under narvaez came to grief in florida a few survivors made their way across the gulf of mexico and finally four who were left were captured by the indians a little west of the mouth of the mississippi for years they were captives among the indians of eastern texas and western louisiana they made many long journeys and their leader alvar nunez cabeza de vaca gained some favors by acting as medicine man but at last they escaped they traveled across texas and northern mexico and in succeeded in reaching the northern outpost of spain in mexico at culiacan in sinaloa that must have been the first time a white man crossed this continent broke in hal yes alvar nundashez cabeza de vaca was the first to cross the continent he was the first white man to see the buffalo and another thing he did was to bring hack stories of wonderful towns filled with riches of which the indians had told him stories like this had reached the spaniards before within three years a priest fray marcos de niza taking one of alvar nunez cabeza de vacas followers started north to find the seven cities of cibola he probably did find the pueblos of zuni but he brought back exaggerated stories such stories especially one of quivira an indian treasure city led mendoza the viceroy of mexico to organize a search expedition which was commanded by coronado the governor of new galicia he started north in with over three hundred soldiers and over a thousand indian allies and indian and negro servants he captured zuni although he didnt find any gold he wintered there and sent out exploring parties and one of them to come back to my startingpoint found the grand candashon did the spaniards get down into the grand candashon asked hal they tried to some of the men with cardenas climbed down a long way with indian guides they said that some rocks on the sides of the cliffs which seemed the size of a man from above proved to be larger than the great tower at seville when they reached them but they could not go on to the bottom they estimated the width of the candashon at the top at three or four leagues but said hal didnt the spaniards ever reach the river itself i should say they did replied ken listen in some ships commanded by don francisco de ulloa evidently reached the mouth of the river when coronado started the next year the viceroy sent out another fleet commanded by don fernando de alarcon this fleet was to go north along the mexican coast and as they knew nothing of the geography of the region they thought coronado and alarcon would not be far apart and could keep in touch alarcon not only reached the mouth of the colorado but he ascended the river in boats for eightyfive leagues and called it the rio de buena guia also melchior diaz who led an exploring party sent out by coronado went across arizona to the gulf of california crossing the colorado river where did you get all this asked dick abruptly and then as ken held up a small book oh youve been reading up but my histories never told me this what is that that said ken is castandashedas relations or journal and castandasheda was an educated private soldier with coronado who was the historian of the journey in order that there might be a full report for the viceroy of mexico and the emperorking of spain it has been translated and explained by mr g p winship and other scholars like bandelier have helped to make the spanish explorations known cabeza de vaca wrote a full account of his wanderings like many other adventurous spaniards oh what became of coronado finally asked hal his expedition journeyed from zuni eastward entered kansas and probably reached the northeasterly part of the state how about the golden quivira asked hal the only quivira they found was a wretched little village probably of the wichita indians in kansas but here is a dramatic thing while coronado was up there in kansas with his fine expedition poor de soto who had fought his way from florida to the mississippi had crossed the river and was distant only a journey of a few days for an indian runner in fact it is related that coronado heard of some white men there in the heart of this strange country and sent a messenger to find them who failed now heres the thing that strikes me at that early day in the summer of two spanish expeditions one starting from florida and one from mexico practically traversed the breadth of our continent and nearly met in eastern kansas we always hear of the jamestown colony and the pilgrims but think of the spaniards crossing the continent twice in the first half of the century before jamestown its a great story said hal i hope coronado got some reward not much ken snapped out first he fe from his horse and was badly hurt secondly he had found no gold that was the important thing so he reached the city of mexico in the spring of very sad and very weary completely worn out and shamefaced didnt he get any credit for his discoveries not a particle yet he had made known to europeans a vast territory extending from the mouth of the colorado river to the grand candashon and stretching east nearly to the mississippi and north to nebraska what became of him he was so coldly received by the viceroy answered ken that he resigned as governor of new galicia and retired to his estate in spain where he died its a wonderful story said hal theres nothing better in the exploration of this country ken agreed but hal ive talked myself out and its time to do something else chapter xiv hiram bents story how old hiram bent was no one knew and he probably did not know himself but his life of western adventure had included indianfighting and buffalohunting in the early days and once in a while he could be persuaded to talk of wild life on the plains something that he said made us demand a story and at last he began youngsters this narrer escape i had happened way down in the northwest corner of texas jim must know jest about whar it was i was tryin to overhaul a shifty herd of buffalo an had rid mebbe forty or fifty mile thet day as i was climbin a slope i saw columns of dust risin beyond the ridge an they told me the direction the herd was takin when i got on top i made out far ahead a lone sentinel of the herd standin out sharp an black against the sky line when the wary old buffalo disappeared i hed cause to grumble for there wasnt much chance of me overhaulin the herd still i kept spurrin my hoss he plunged down the ridge with a weakenin stride an i knew he was most done but he was game an kept on presently i saw the flyin buffalo a black movin mass half hid by clouds of whitish dust they were a mile or more ahead an i thought if i could git out of the rough ground i might head them jest below me were piles of yellow rock an clumps of dwarf trees an green thet i reckoned was cottonwoods my hoss ran down into a low hollow an afore i knowed what was up all about me was movin objects red an brown an black i pulled up my snortin hoss right in the midst of a band of comanches one glance showed me halfnaked redskins slippin from tree to tree springin up all around with halfleveled rifles i felt the blood rush to my heart an leave my body all cold an heavy there wasnt much chance them days of escapin from comanches but my mind worked fast i hed one chance mebbe half a chance but it was so hopeless thet even as i thought of it i hed a gloomy feelin clamp down on me i leaped off my hoss threw the bridle over my arm an with bearin as natural as if my comin was intended i went toward the injuns the halfleveled rifles dropped an the strung bows slowly straightened an deep grunts told of the surprise of the comanches me talk big chief i said wavin my hand as if i was not one to talk to braves one redskin pointed with a long arm then the line opened an let me through with my hoss it was a large camp of huntin comanches buffalo meat and robes were dryin in the sun swarms of buzzin flies showed the fresh kill covered fires gave vent to thin wisps of smoke worn rifles gleamed in the sun an bows smooth an oily from use littered the grass but there were no wigwams or squaws i went forward watched by many cunnin eyes an made straight for a cottonwoodtree whar a long trailin headdress of blackbarred eagle feathers hung from a branch the chief was there restin i was expectin an dreadin to see a short square injun an old chief i knew an who had reason to know me but instead i saw a splendid young redskin tall an muscular an of sullen look how i said how he replied then we locked eyes i was cold an quiet hidin my fear an hope an the injun showed in his piercin glance suspicion thet would hey been astonishment in any one save a redskin thet injun hed a pair of eyes that showed the very soul of lifelong hatred ugh he exclaimed white man buffalokiller lose trail me know white man i would have liked to deny my reputation but thet would hey been the worst thing for me no lose trail come swap pony i said heap lie he replied in scorn big chief brave now i taunted an swept my arm round the camp i knew the injun nature the chief lifted his head with a motion that said no the comanche cared for nothin but courage an endurance he was faced in his home by a defenseless hunter no doubt he felt the call of his blood it was his law that he couldnt tomahawk me or order me shot an scalped till he hed made me show fear an thar was my hope the comanche hed to see fear in me or sense it before he could kill me i looked as if i didnt know what fear was i jest made myself stone in this was all the little hope i hed of life the redskin hed to be made believe i had rid into his camp feelin no fear of death recognizin no cause for it an holdin myself safe now the redskin believed in the supernatural in the unseen force of nature leaguin itself with the brave an givin man a godlike spirit years of bloody warfare had driven the redskin back from the frontiers made him a savage whar once no doubt he was noble but fire an strife an blood couldnt stamp out thet belief swap pony i said again an showed silver i would include in the trade how much he asked heap much i answered he held out a brown lean hand for the silver an threw it straight back in my face the hard silver cut an bruised me blood flowed from cuts but i didnt move a muscle an kept a cool gaze level with the dark hot eyes of the redskin thet flingin of the silver was a young chiefs undignified passion toward a prisoner who hed become prisoner without effort or risk for any warrior no honor was thar in me no glory in insult to me i caught my advantage an became cooler an stonier than ever an put a little contempt in my looks a sudden yell from him brought his band runnin an leapin they grunted an let out deep savage cries a circle formed round us a circle of bronzed scarred warriors an i felt my time was near they all knew me not so much because i hed fought them but because i was a great buffalokiller an they hated me for thet more than any other hunter i made meat scarce at their campfires their meanin eyes roved from chief to me spellin sentences of iron an torture an death the comanche took from one of his braves a long black bow as tall as himself an a long feathered an barbed arrow he leaned toward me an his look was so keen thet i felt it would read my soul white hunter lie no want swap pony hunt buffalo no smell indian smoke i kept silence an never let my gaze flicker from his thet was all i could do no word no move could help me now i summoned all i had left of courage an tried in a flash to think of all the tight places i hed been in before white hunter lie repeated the comanche then with slow an deliberate motion never lowerin his burnin gaze he fitted the arrow to the bow an slowly stretchin his arms he shot the arrow at my foot i felt it graze me and heard the light thud as it entered the ground i twitched inwardly an a chill crept up from my foot but i made no outward motion not a flick of an eyelash white hunter lie thet was the redskins stumblinblock he couldnt believe that any white hunter much less me would dare to come before him an all his braves an ask to swap ponies his crafty mind told him it couldnt be true an every beat of his heart throbbed to make me show it selectin another arrow he set the feathered notch against the rawhide cord an twangthe sharp point bit into the leather of my boot an buried itself half length thet comanches gaze became the hardest thing i ever stood he looked clear through me for signs of weakenin i saw the cold gleam of somethin hangin in the balance an i matched white courage against red cunnin his eyelids shut down till they was mere slits over black blazes an the veins over his temples swelled an beat still he had command of himself an his movements were as slow as the torture he promised again he reached for an arrow notched it drew it paused while he called me liar then shot it a knifeblade couldnt hey been wedged between thet arrow an my foot then one after another slow an cruel he shot twelve arrows an penned my foot in a little circle of feathered shafts with thet he stopped to eye me for a little suddenly as quick as he hed been slow he shot an arrow straight through my boot pinnin my foot to the ground it burned like a redhot bar of iron heap lie he yelled in a voice of thunder again he leaned forward to search my face for a shade of fear but the pain upheld me an he couldnt scare me then he sprang erect to straighten the long bow in line with his eye he lifted the bow so that the murderous arrowhead of flint pointed at my heart an his eye pierced me slow slow as a fiend he began to bend the bow it was thick an heavy an hed been seasoned an strung when firearms were unknown to the redskins it was such a bow as only a great chief could own an one thet only a powerful arm could bend an this chief bent it slowly more an more every second till makin a perfect curve it quivered an vibrated with the strain the circle of injuns parted from behind me once loosened thet arrow would never have stopped in my body i knew either the injun or i must soon give way under thet ordeal but it was my life at stake an he began to weaken first he began to tremble swap pony lie he said somehow i hed it in me then to laugh the comanche kept his look of pride an hatred then raisin the bow he shot the arrow in a wonderful flight out of sight over the ridge waugh waugh he cried in disgust an threw down the bow he couldnt frighten me therefore he wouldnt kill me brave lie a kind of light seemed to clear his angry face he waved his long arm toward the ridge an the east an then turnin his back on me went among the cottonwoods the other warriors went after him leavin my way open thet was how even the comanches honored courage i pulled the arrows from the ground an last the one thet held my foot like a redhot spike leadin my hoss i limped out of camp an climbed the ridge when i got out of sight i took off my boot to see how bad i was hurt thet thar arrow went between my toes jest grazin them an hardly drawin blood i hed been so scared i thought my foot was shot half offbut all the same thet was the narrerest escape hiram bent ever had chapter xv wild mustangs one morning navvy came in with the horses and reported that wings had broken his hobbles and gone off with a band of wild mustangs we were considerably put out about it especially as hal took the loss much to heart hiram asked the navajo whether the marauding band were really mustangs or the wild horses we had seen on the plateau and navvy grinned at the idea of his making a mistake over tracks shore thought there wasnt no mustangs up here commented jim thar wasnt when we come up replied hiram they jest trotted down off buckskin climbed up hyar an coaxed wings off wild mustangs do thet a lot an so do wild hosses fer thet matter the mountains full of them were all the time havin trouble with our hosses now a hoss thets well broke an tame an even used to haulin a wagon will git crazy the minnit he smells them wild hosses an hell git like a fox an hell hide in the cedars when you track him an doggone me if i dont believe hell try to hide his tracks isnt there any way to catch wings inquired ken i reckon well never git a bridle on him agin but we might round up the band an catch a couple of mustangs what do you say to takin the trail of them mustangs ken and hal yelled their desire for that and it seemed to suit jim pretty well and i was like him rather pleased to undertake whatever pleased the brothers whatll i ride asked hal suddenly you an navvy can both saddle a packhoss replied hiram you shore aint goin to take the injun inquired jim wal i reckon so hes a navajo aint he an while i dont like to hurt your texas feelins jim thar never was the white feller on earth thet could hold a candle to a navajo when it comes to hosses shore youre right declared jim with wonderful good nature an fellers went on hiram stuff some biscuits in your pockets an throw a blanket on your hoss before saddlin mebbe we wont git back tonight ken give the hounds a good feed an see theyre tied proper itll be a rest for them an they need it shall i take my rifle asked ken wal youd better thars no tellin what well strike down thar in the brakes its my idee them mustangs will take to thet wide plateau down below lookin fer rich browse an thets jest what id like to see down thar wed hey a chance to corner them an if they go up in buckskin thar wont be no use trackin them the hounds howled dismally as we rode away from camp and the last time i turned i saw prince standing up the length of his chain and wild to go with us in a hollow perhaps a halfmile from camp navvy picked up the mustang trail and he followed it through the forest without getting off his horse boys can you see tracks i asked ken and hal ken laughed his inability and hal said nix wal i cant see any myself added hiram it was remarkable how the navajo trailed that band of mustangs over the soft pineneedle mats try as i might i could not see the slightest sign of a track however when we got to the dusty trail at the head of the saddle tracks were exceedingly plain to us we rode down in single file and were glad to find the mustangs had turned to the left toward the plateau that hiram had called the brakes we passed the spring and hirams camp where i had brought the boys to meet him and then went on past the gulch where we had come down before us spread a plateau a thousand feet under the great rimwall above it widened and widened till the walls of rock were ten miles apart and the end of this wild brake was fully thirty miles away it was an exceedingly wild and rough place the horses had to go slowly scruboak only breasthigh and as thick as a hedge and as spiked as a barbedwire fence made progress tedious and painful ken youd hardly think you were down in the candashon would you i asked its hard to know what to think down in this awful hole where are we anyhow theres no name for this bench that i ever heard its only a line on the maps weve just got beyond the end of powells plateau buckskin of course rises on our right to the left the real candashon deepens and straight ahead that yellow rim with the black border is what they call siwatts its spur of the mountain the outlook from where we rode was level only at a distance as we went on we were continually riding up and down ridges heading candashons and gullies and crossing brooks we jumped deer and foxes and coyotes out of every brake the scruboak gave way to manzanita a redbarked greenleaved species of brush that was almost impenetrable and when we did get through that it was to enter a cedar forest where the ground was red and bare and soft the mustang tracks were now plain to the eye and quite fresh other tracks were of great variety hiram halted us all round an enormous cougar track the marks had evidently been made some time before and during wet weather the cougar was so heavy he had sunk in half a foot and his track was bigger around than that of any horse we had i reckon hes the captain remarked hiram ken dismounted once to pick up some arrowheads one was a perfect point over six inches long of dark blue flint and sharp as a blade thets pretty old youngster said hiram the navajos used to come here for their buckskin thets why the mountain was called buckskin hal fired at a coyote and the sleepy packhorse he rode woke and nearly left the boy hanging on the spikes of a cedar hyar called hiram dont shoot fer nothin hal we dont want to scare the mustangs the trail led across the cedar forest out into open ground again and began to go down bench by bench step by step it was hot down there but presently the sun was hidden behind stormclouds and the air grew cooler i heard jim grumbling that he never trailed any horses that did not stop to graze and hiram replied that this particular band evidently was making for some especial place presently we came out upon the edge of a step with another step some hundreds of feet below the scene was so rugged and beautiful and wonderful that i had to look many times before i made any special note of ground near at hand but finally i saw a triangular promontory perhaps a mile or more in length on each side and this was green with rich grass and willow except out on the extreme point where it was bare and white deep candashons bounded this promontory on three sides git back out of sight said hiram if the mustangs are down thar we dont want them to see us we all dismounted and led our horses back into a clump of cedars well wait hyar an let navajo go look thet place over added hiram the indian understood without being told and he stole off among the jumbles of rocks hal was the other one who did not rest and he got on the trail of some animal and went off among the cedars toward a seamed and cracked cliff we heard him throwing stones and presently he yelled for ken youngster hurry up an sit on thet thar kid or hell spoil our mustang hunt said hiram navvy returned and announced that he had seen the mustangs browsing then hiram went off with him to get sight of the band and the lay of the ground meanwhile the sky grew darker and darker and there was a cool touch of rain or snow in the air hiram was gone nearly an hour and in that time jim and i saw or heard nothing of the boys its goin to snow said hiram an weve got to throw a camp quick say them mustangs are down war on wet kiteshaped shelf an doggone me if thar aint only one trail leadin down an its narrer an steep we can drive them an ketch all we can handle whar are the youngsters shore we dont know theyre chasin somethin shores youre born said jim who fetched an axe asked hiram i was never caught out without my small handaxe and with this we set about cutting cedar branches and brush to make shelters a big black cloud swooped down on us bringing a flurry of snow at that juncture ken and hal stalked into camp each carrying a struggling snapping little fox both boys were bleeding from bites or cuts which they minded not at all been ropin foxes eh asked hiram wal let em go an pitch in hyar an help weve got the mustangs rounded up an with good weather well hey more fun an hard work than you youngsters hey seen yet it was noticeable that ken released his capture while hal tied his to a cedar with a cord both lads lent their aid and it was not long before we had a big leanto on the windward side it was not finished any too soon for the snow began to fall a snowstorm like this one was as bad as rain and as good as rain too for it was heavy thick and wet when the storm passed six inches of snow lay upon everything the sun still hid behind clouds but the air was warm and the snow melted fast fellars its gittin late anyhow said hiram an we couldnt do much in this snow well wait till tomorrer ill fence up thet narrer trail so the mustangs cant give us the slip we lounged around our camp made a meal on biscuits and snowballs and rolled in our blankets to sleep soundly hiram awakened us early we ate what little we had left and as the sun rose red and warm we were eager to begin the days adventure lets all take a look at the mustangs suggested hiram there were patches of snow left in shady places and the ground was soft and soggy we followed hiram out of the cedars thorough brush and round huge boulders and finally crawled to a point on the edge of the bluff look at thet jest look whispered hiram hoarsely the bare promontory glistened in the morning sunlight and right in the middle of it was the band of wild mustangs there were whites and blacks and bays theres wings burst out hal sssh not so loud thar said hiram what are they doing asked ken in eager interest the snows melted an theyre drinkin out of the little pockets in the rock well its great replied ken i shared his delight to my mind there could not have been a more beautiful sight than the mustangs drinking on that promontory the mustangs looked wild they were shaggy long manes waved in the breeze the leader of the band a fine keenlooking white stood on guard his attitude showed pride as well as suspicion he held his head up and he was looking our way beyond the promontory yawned the blue shadow of an abyss and beyond that lifted a bold red bluff and farther on loomed a great dome and all around to left and right were the ragged ridges of rock and the dark clefts between the cliffs it was a wild background for these wild rangers of the wilderness thet white fellers winded us i do believe said hiram wal i reckon it doesnt make no difference to us he cant git out hiram may i take a picture of that bunch asked ken shore but you must go down through the crack in the rocks thar an then crawl as close as you can ken slipped away and soon returned to us enthusiastic over his picture and more than enthusiastic over the beauty of some of the mustangs why hal my mustang is nowhere for looks and wings hes like a dub compared to some of the ponies in that band wal it aint goin to be an allfired job to ketch a couple of mustangs said hiram but whatll we do with them shore lets wait till we ketch some replied jim wisely hiram we can turn them over to the indian i suggested thets so hell drag them up on the plateau an break them for us how are we going to catch them i asked dick weve got a place made to order you all can hide behind an above thet crack whar the trail comes up ill go down an drive the mustangs up an you fellers can rope em as they come out shore itll be lively round here chuckled jim youngsters youd better both lay for wings an rope him said hiram jim an dick can each rope a mustang thetll be enough wont it i want to rope one for myself replied hal i dont care whether we get wings or not id like to pick one out too added ken wal im sure i dont keer if you rope half a dozen every man for hisself then only youngsters id advise you to put on your gloves an tighten your belts an git ready for a warm time itll be easy to drop a noose over a mustangs head but holdin him mebbell be another story git your lassoes ready now jim and the brothers took up a position on the side of the gully where we expected the mustangs to come up and navvy and i took ours on the opposite side hiram rattled down over the stones of the trail with a last word to the boys to make ready for some real sport as i had asked for the loan of wings from my friend in kanab it fell to me as a duty to catch the mustang if i could we waited for quite a while and excitement began to verge on strain when we heard hirams stentorian yell following that was a sound like low thunder then a sharp clattering and then the clear ringing of hard hoofs on stone shore theyre comin called jim i had expected to see the mustangs run out of that crack in single file but they burst out it seemed three or four abreast in a cloud of dust and a thundering din i saw jims noose whip over a mustangs head then the dusty air appeared full of flying lassoes the mustangs ran their heads right into the loops i watched for wings but did not see him in a twinkling the band had cleared the crack and were half across the cedar bench i heard a confusion of yells and pounding hoofs and crashings in the brush but i could not see for dust and had to run to one side out of the thick cloud jim had a white mustang down and navvy had a bay well under control then i saw ken in an instant he was actually dodging the plunges of a vicious pinto ken had roped one of the band but now he did not know what to do except hold on that he was doing valiantly at the risk of his life the pinto reared and like a furious deer struck with his fore hoofs ken dodged and ran to the extent of his rope and hauled away with all his strength his quarry began to leap and pull and drag ken through the brush hold hard thar youngster yelled hiram he came running out of the crack in the rocks and quickly laid his powerful grasp on kens rope wheres hal i yelled no one heard me all were too busy i turned this way and that finally way off on the bench at least a hundred yards i saw a mustang jumping and shaking his head then i saw a tight lasso round his neck i did not wait to see hal but started to run with all my might the mustang a beautiful slate color with white tail and mane kept plunging through the brush and i knew he was dragging hal then i saw the boy he was down but trying to get up and holding to the lasso as if he would die before he let go hang on hal i cried hes a beauty youve got a prize hang on hal regained his feet the mustang renewed his fight for freedom and then began a race he dragged hal so fast for a little while i scarcely gained at all but hal tripped and fell and as he would not give up of course his weight held the mustang back i gained ground reached hal and grasped the tight lasso one jerk sent that savage mustang to his knees and took away some of his breath and fire he thrashed about and wrestled a few more moments and then squared away fore hoofs braced and refusing to budge watched me with wild eyes promptly i tied the lasso to a stout bush again he began to rear and jump and as the rope did not give an inch he choked himself pretty thoroughly and at length fell flat i hurried up and loosened the noose and tied a knot that would not slip hes ours hal where are you i yelled it was a sorrylooking lad i found half sitting up in the brush dustcovered scratched and bloody with his clothes in tatters hal ward was a sight im all right except my wrists theyre all skinned from the rope he said gee what a pony say dick is he hurt he breathes so hard hes just winded and scared well leave him here till we find out what to do with him lets go back we returned to camp where hal was greeted with solicitude and then when it became known that he had not been hurt there was uproarious mirth at his appearance i dont care i got the blueribbon winner of that bunch retorted hal so indeed it turned out hals mustang was a beauty one and all agreeing that he was about the wildest and raciest and most beautiful little horse we had ever seen wal i aint noticed thet any of you ketched wings said hiram for that matter not one of us had even seen the mustang hiram said that it was rather strange and he went back down to the promontory upon his return he told us that wings was down there and could be readily caught he turned back i reckon went on hiram an now fellers lets figure things weve had a right smart bit of luck but we cant take all these wild mustangs up on the plateau with us lets put them down on thet bench an close up this crack so theyll be corralled then we can git them on our way back to kanab that appeared to be a wise solution to our problem for the present wild mustangs are apt to be white elephants on hunters hands so while hiram and jim went down to catch wings the navajo half led and half dragged our captured mustangs down through the crack to the promontory i reckoned said hiram upon his return with wings thet itd be best to leave the lassoes trailin on the mustangs we dont run much risk of one chokin an we can ketch them easy when we come back now to build thet corral gate everybody rustle for big branches of cedar an hour of hard work saw the task completed and it gave us much satisfaction then we mounted and took our own backtrail toward the saddle and the plateau camp chapter xvi split trails when we trooped out of the pines next morning the sun rising gloriously bright had already taken off the keen edge of the frosty air the ridges glistened in their white dress and the bunches of sage and the cedars tipped with snow were like trees laden with blossoms we rode swiftly to the mouth of left candashon into which jim had trailed three lions on the way the snow as we had expected began to thin out and it failed altogether under the cedars though there was enough on the branches to give us a drenching jim reined in on the verge of a narrow gorge and told us that a lions cave was below hiram looked the ground over and said jim had better take the hounds down while the rest of us waited above ready for whatever might happen jim went down on foot calling the hounds and holding them close we listened eagerly for his call or the outbreak of the pack but there was no sound in less than half an hour he came climbing out with the information that the lions had left the cave probably the evening after he had chased them there well then said hiram lets split the pack an hunt round the rims of these candashons we can signal to each other if necessary so we arranged for jim and hal to take ranger and the pup across left candashon hiram to try middle candashon with tan and mux and ken and i were to perform a like office in right candashon with prince and queen hiram rode back with us leaving us where we crossed middle candashon ken and i skirted a mile of our candashon and worked out almost to the west end of the bay without finding so much as a single track then we started back the sun was now hot the snow all gone the ground dry as if it had never been damp and we complained that our morning was a failure we reached the ragged mouth of right candashon where it opened into the deep wide bay and rode close to the rim because we hoped to hear our companions across the candashon the hounds began to bark on a cliff but as we could find no tracks in the dust we called them off queen obeyed reluctantly but prince wanted to get down over the wall they scent a lion i declared lets put them over the wall once permitted to go the hounds needed no assistance they ran up and down the rim till they found a crack which would admit them hardly had they vanished when we heard them yelping we rushed to the rim and looked over the first step was short a crumbled section of wall and from it led down a long slope dotted here and there with cedars both hounds were baying furiously i looked the candashon over carefully and decided that it was a bad place to venture into ken its hard to tell which way the hounds run in these candashons i think queen is heading up anyway ill go that way and you go down here well get separated but dont forget the signal yell with that i proceeded along the rim to the left making sure i heard a hound in that direction it was rough hard going and in the excitement of it i forgot how much ground i was covering i came to a place presently where i determined to go down and leaving spurs chaps gun coat and hat on the rim i started down carrying only my lasso the slope was steep a long incline of scaly rotting rock growing rougher toward the bottom i heard the baying of a hound to my right and turned in that direction soon i was among huge rocks and windfalls of cedar through this it was impossible to keep a straight line i turned and twisted but as i continued to hear the baying of the hound i thought i could not be going wrong in this way time passed yet still i did not seem to get any closer to the dog and though i yelled for ken i got no response working more to the left of the dense jumble of weathered rock and thicket of dead cedars i made better progress all the time though i appeared to be in the bottom of a candashon i was descending rapidly then the louder baying of the hound and yells from ken spurred me forward another shout guided me to the right and running through a clump of cedars i came out upon the edge of a deep narrow cleft up on the opposite slope i saw queen with her paws on a cedar and above her clung a lion so close that she could nearly reach him prince was nowhere in sight nor was ken ho ken i yelled hi hi dick his reply came down the candashon and both yells blended in a roar that banged back and forth in echo from the cliffs i ran up the candashon a little way to find my passage blocked unless i chose to go far around then i hurried back only to see that i could not get across below in my excitement i thought of leaping across and searched for the narrowest place but the split was quite twenty feet wide and i dared not risk it ken im on the wrong side of the candashon i yelled go back head it he replied heres the lion treed its too far back that way it would take an hour to climb round no help for it then i climbed up a little so as to be on a level with the lion the cedar that held him was perhaps fifty paces away ken came down and there we were a few feet apart in easy talking distance yet widely separated in so far as any help to each other was concerned wheres prince look out for him i hear him below this lion wont stay treed long shouted ken i too heard prince a cedartree obstructed my view and i moved aside a few hundred feet farther down the hound bayed under a tall pindashon high in the branches i saw a great mass of yellow how i yelled then a second glance showed two lions close together two more two more look look i screamed to ken hi hi hi he joined his yell to mine and for a moment we made the candashon bellow when we stopped for breath the echoes bayed at us from the opposite walls waahoo hirams signal faint far away soaring but unmistakable floated down to us across the jutting capes separating the mouths of these candashons high above them on the rimwall of the opposite side of the bay stood a giant white horse bearing hirams dark figure silhouetted against the white sky they made a brave picture one most welcome to us we yelled in chorus three lions treed three lions treed come down hurry a crash of rolling stones made us wheel queens lion had jumped he ran straight down drawing prince from his guard queen went tearing alter them what on earth will we do now cried ken keep the other lions treed if you can i replied running along the candashon till i neared the pindashon tree ken clambered over the rocks on his side we kept yelling for hiram presently ken was under the pindashon and i at a point opposite we were now some thirty rods apart but i was utterly useless to ken except in the way of advice and encouragement so for minutes we caught our breath and waited gee two big fellows and they look as scared as i am called ken thats good keep them scaredi hear hiram cominghi hi this way hiramken just listen to hiram rolling the rocks hes coming like an avalanche bits of weathered rock clattered down the slope and the old hunter was at their heels whar are the hounds he yelled gone down after the third lion i replied theyve treed him down there wal thats good now you fellers keep these cougars treed itll be easy bark at em like dogs an if one starts down grab a club and run at him as if you was goin to kill him bang on the tree beat the branches an yell you can keep em up thar till i git back with the hounds with that hiram like a giant with sevenleague boots disappeared down the slope it had all happened so quickly that i could scarcely realize it the yelping of the hounds the clattering of stones grew fainter telling me that prince and queen and hiram too were going to the bottom of the bay ken have you got your gun i called no i left everything but my rope he replied then the two snarling lions brought me to a keen sense of the reality ken had a job on his hands two almost fullgrown lions to be kept treed without hounds without a gun without help from a companion say this is funny yelled ken dick im scared sick but i hate to quitill stick ill do what hiram told me to it occurred to me then that hiram probably had not noticed ken was without his gun or that i was separated from him by the narrow deep chasm ken began to bark like a dog at the lions about this moment i heard hounds but could not tell their direction i called and called presently a faint chorus of bays and a yell from hiram told that his lion had surely treed waahoo rolled down from above far up behind me on the yellow cracked rim stood jim williams where can i git down i surveyed the walls cliff on cliff slide on slide jumble crag and ruin baffled my gaze but finally i picked out a place to the left to the left i yelled he passed on with one of the hounds at his heels there let the dog down on a rope and then yourself i watched him swing the hound which i recognized as ringer down a wall and pull the slip noose free this doesnt seem so bad called ken who evidently was recovering his nerve then he saw jim above hi jim wheres hal jim put both hands around his mouth and formed a trumpet hals lost somewhere he an the pup split trails ken its going to be a great day for all of us i shouted dont worry and stay with your lions then i watched ringer slide to the edge of a slope trot to the right and left of crags and turn down in the direction of the baying hounds he passed along the verge of precipices that made me tremble for him but surefooted as a goat he went on safely to disappear far to my right i saw jim with his leg wrapped in his lasso sliding down the first step of the rim the rope doubled to reach round a cedar above was too short to extend to the landing below jim dropped raising a cloud of dust and starting the stones pulling his lasso after him he gathered it in a coil on his arm and faced forward on the trail of the hound in the clear light against that wild redandyellow background with the stones and gravel roaring down streaming over the walls like waterfalls he seemed another giant striding on in sevenleague boots i would have called him to come down to help ken but it was impossible for him to get to us from time to time he sent up a yell of encouragement that wound down the candashon to be answered by hiram and the baying hounds and then the strange clapping echoes at last he passed out of sight and still i heard him going down down till the sounds were only faint and hollow ken was now practically alone with his two treed lions and i knew that no hunter was ever so delighted he had entirely recovered from his first panicky feeling i sat there in the sun watching him he stood on the slope just under the edge of the pindashon branches and he had a long club in his hand the situation was so singular that i could have laughed but for the peril the idea of ken keeping those big cougars treed with a club was almost too ridiculous to consider yet all the same it was true for a long time the cougars were quiet listening however as the baying of the hounds diminished in volume and occurrence and then ceased altogether kens quarry became restless it was then that he began to bark like a dog whereupon the lions grew quiet once more thats the way ken youre the best hound in the pack youve got a fine bark there keep it up i shouted as long as ken barked or bayed or yelped the cougars remained comparatively quiet ken however began to weaken in voice and finally lost it dick youll have to bark some he said and i could scarcely hear him at that i willingly began to imitate prince and ringer and muxmux it was easy at first but soon it became a task i bayed for an hour my voice grew hoarser and hoarser and finally failed in my throat in order to get out a few bays i had to rest for a moment soon i was compelled to stop the cougars immediately grew restless and then active ken youve got to do something i called in strained weak tones the lower lion hissed and spat and growled at ken and made many attempts to start down ken frustrated these by hitting the cougar with stones every time ken threw he struck his mark even this punishment however did not long intimidate the beast and he grew bolder and bolder at length he made a more determined effort and stepped from branch to branch ken dashed down the incline with a stone in one hand and a long club in the other i tried to shout advice but i doubt if ken heard he aimed deliberately at the lion threw the stone and hit him squarely in the ribs that brought a roar which raised my hair then directly under him ken wielded his club pounding on the tree thrashing at the branches go back go back yelled ken dont you dare come down ill crack your old head the cougar came almost within reach of kens club i wondered at the way the boy held his post many as were the daring achievements ken ward had executed before my eyes this one eclipsed them all i was chilled with fear i was in distress because i could not raise my hand to help him ken must have been in an unreasoning frenzy he ran round the pindashon keeping directly under the cougar and intercepting him at every turn more than once the beast crouched as if to spring and was only deterred from that by kens savage attacks finally he had luck enough to give the cougar a ringing blow on the head this for the moment stopped the descent for the big cat climbed back to his perch beside his mate in the momentary lull of battle i heard the faint yelp of a hound listen ken i cried i listened too it came again faint but clearer i looked up at the lions they too heard for they were very still i saw their heads raised and tense i backed a little way up the slope then the faint yelp floated up again in the dead strange silence i saw the lions quiver and it seemed as if i heard their hearts thump the yelp was wafted up again closer this time i recognized it it belonged to prince the great hound was on the backtrail of the other lion coming to kens rescue its prince its prince its prince i cried its all up now what feelings stirred me then gladness and relief for ken dominated me pity for those lions i felt also big tawny cruel fellows as they were they shivered with fright their sides trembled but pity did not hold me long princes yelp now growing clear and sharp brought back the savage instinct of the hunter a fulltoned bay attracted my attention from the lions to the downward slope i saw a yellow form moving under the trees and climbing fast it was prince hi hi old boy i yelled up he came like a shot and sprang against the pindashon his deep bay ringing defiance to the lions it was very comfortable but i felt it necessary to sit down just then chapter xvii strenuous work come down now you cougars yelled ken defiantly shaking his broken club i dare you now old prince is here you cant catch that hound and you cant get away from him ken had evidently contracted hirams habit of talking to cougars as if they were human oh ken ward it was tough on you i said and tough on me too but were all right now moments passed i was just on the point of deciding to go down to hurry up our comrades when i heard the other hounds coming yelp on yelp bay on bay made welcome music to my ears then a blackandyellow swiftly flying string of hounds bore into sight down the slope streamed up and circled the pindashon hiram who at last showed his tall stooping form on the steep of the ascent seemed as long in coming as the hounds had been swift did you get the lion wheres jim i asked in eagerness lion tied all fast replied the panting hiram left jim to guard him what are we to do now asked ken wait till i git my breath we cant git both lions out of one tree all right ken replied after a moments thought ill tie curley and mux you go up the tree that first lion will jump sure hes almost ready now the other hounds will tree him again pretty soon if he runs up the candashon well and good wal thets a good idee said hiram hyar leslie whatre you doin over thar i couldnt get across i replied hey you been thar all the time leavin the youngster hyar alone with these critters hiram it couldnt be helped i was unable to do a blamed thing but ken made a grand job of it wait till i can tell you wal doggone me exclaimed the old hunter he pounded ken with his big hand then he began coiling his rope ken you go ahead and tie up curley and mux you leslie git ready to run up the candashon an keep track of this cougar thets goin to jump he began the ascent of the pindashon the branches were not too close affording him easy climbing before he looked for even a move on the part of the lions the lower one began stepping down ken yelled a warning but hiram did not have time to take advantage of it he had half turned meaning to swing out and drop when the lion planted both fore paws upon his back hiram went sprawling down with the lion almost on him prince had his teeth in the lion before he touched the ground and when he did strike the rest of the hounds were on him a cloud of dust rolled down the slope the lion broke loose and with great springy bounds ran up the candashon prince and his followers hotfooting it after him mux and curley broke the dead sapling to which ken had tied them and dragging it behind them endeavored in frenzied action to join the chase ken drew them back loosening the rope so in case the other lion jumped he could free them quickly hiram calmly gathered himself up rearranged his lasso took his long stick and proceeded to mount the pindashon again i waited till i saw him slip the noose over the lions head then i ran up the slope i passed perilously near the precipice and then began to climb the baying of the hounds directed me in the box of yellow walls the chorus seemed to come from a hundred dogs when i found them close to a low cliff baying the lion in a thick dark pindashon ringer leaped into my arms and next prince stood up against me with his paws on my shoulders these were strange actions and though i marked it at the moment i had ceased to wonder at our hounds i took one look at the lion in the dark shade and then climbed to the low cliff and sat down i called prince to me and held him in case our quarry leaped upon the cliff i wanted a hound to put quickly on his trail another hour passed it must have been a dark hour for the lion he looked as if it were and one of impatience for the baying hounds but for me it was an hour of enjoyment alone with the hounds and a lion walled in by wildcolored cliffs with the dry sweet smell of cedar and pindashon i asked no more only that i wished ken had been there curley and mux yelping as they came were forerunners of hiram i saw his gray locks waving in the breeze and shouted to him to take his time as he reached me the lion jumped and ran up the candashon this suited me for i knew he would take to a tree soon and the farther up he went the less distance we would have to pack him from the cliff i saw him run up a slope pass a big cedar cunningly turn on his trail and then climb into the tree and hide in its thickest part prince passed him got off the trail and ran at fault the others so used to his leadership were also baffled but queen crippled and slow brought up the rear and she did not go a yard beyond where the lion turned she opened up her deep call under the cedar and in a moment the howling pack were around her hiram and i toiled laboriously upward he had brought my lasso and he handed it to me with the significant remark that i would soon have need of it the cedar was bushy and overhung a yellow bare slope which made hiram shake his head he climbed the tree lassoed the spitting lion and then leaped down to my side by united and determined efforts we pulled the lion off the limb and let him down the hounds began to leap at him we both roared in rage at them but to no avail hold on thar shouted hiram leaving me with the lasso while he sprang forward the weight of the animal dragged me forward and had i not taken a halfhitch round a snag would have lifted me off my feet or pulled the lasso from my hands as it was the choking lion now within reach of the furious leaping hounds swung to and fro before my face his frantic lunges narrowly missed me hiram grasped prince by the hind legs and pitched him down the slope prince rolled a hundred feet before he caught himself then hiram threw old mux and ringer and curley but he let queen alone before the hounds could climb the slope hiram roped the lion again and made fast his lasso to a tree let go he yelled to me the lion fell hiram grasped the lasso i had held and then called to me to stop the hounds by the time i had checked them he had the lion securely tied this beast was the bold fellow which had given ken such a battle he lay now his sides heaving glaring and spitting at us leslie im all in panted hiram climbin them awful slopes ketches me in the heart i cant go down agin thars jim guardin the first cougar ken is watchin the second the one i fastened with chain an lasso to a swingin branch an hyars the third three cougarswal i never beat thet in my life an i want the day to be a great success fer kens sake hiram when youve rested go after the packhorses bring them all and the packs and navvy too you take the hounds with you and leave them in camp ken and i will tie up the second lion then well call jim up and pack the two lions up here to this one you meet us here mind you thet second cougars loose except fer collar an chain his claws hevnt been clipped hell fight an itll be a job to pack em up hyar but i cant climb no more find your horse and hustle for camp i replied hiram wearily climbed the slope followed by the hounds and i took the backtrail down into the candashon i noted now that i was calm what a long distance we had covered i made fast time however and soon found ken standing guard over his captive this lion had been tied to an overhanging branch which swung violently with every move he made say did you get the third one asked ken you bet we did now what well ill go down until i can make jim hear ill call him to come up with his lion you stay here till i get hack it was another long tramp down to the edge of that slope but i reached it and yelled for jim he answered and then i told him to come up with his cougar i sat down to wait for him thinking he would be glad of a little help an hour and a half passed before i heard the sliding of stones below which told me jim was coming he appeared on the lower slope carrying the lion head downward manifestly he was having toilsome work he could climb only a few steps without lowering his burden and resting i ran down to meet him he was red of face wringing wet with sweat and almost out of breath and patience shore im most tuck ered out he said we secured a stout pole and slipping this between the paws of the lion below where they were tied we managed to carry him fairly well but he was heavy the slope was steep the sliding stones treacherous and the task nearly exhausted us we climbed by the shortest way and so passed to the right of ken at last we toiled up to where i had parted from hiram jim fell in the shade and breathed hard leslie i might git down there to ken but id never git back im used to ridin a hoss so i had to go again alone and discovered ken sitting guard faithfully over his charge wasnt i gone a long while i asked couldnt help it ken it didnt seem long to me replied ken that was the difference in time as seen through the eyes of fiery youth and enthusiasm now to tie that rascal i said its coming to us ken hiram didnt pay compliments to this particular cougar well cut a piece off each lasso and unravel them so as to leave enough strings i wish hiram hadnt tied the lasso to that swinging branch ill go up and untie it replied ken acting upon this he climbed the pindashon and started out on the branch hold on i warned im afraid youd better stop how on earth did hiram tie that rope there anyway he bent the branch down well its bending now and that darned cougar might reach you i dont like his looks but despite this ken slipped out a couple of yards farther and had almost gotten to the knotted lasso when the branch swayed and bent alarmingly the cougar sprang from his niche between the treetrunk and a rock and crouched under ken snarling and hissing with every intention of leaping jump jump i shouted i cant jump out of his reach cried ken he raised his legs and began to slide himself back up the branch the cougar leaped missing him but scattering twigs and hark then the beast beside himself with fury half leaped half stood up and reached for ken i saw his hooked claws fasten in kens leather wristband the lad yelled shrilly i dashed forward grasped the lion by the tail and with one powerful swing i tore him loose and flung him down the slope to the full extent of the rope quick as thought ken jumped down and we both sought a safer locality whew whistled ken holding out his hand its a nasty scratch i said binding my handkerchief round his wrist the leather saved your hand from being torn off hes an ugly brute well tie him or or ken declared without finishing his speech ken lets each take a lasso and worry him till we both get hold of a paw hiram did a fiendish thing when he tied that lion to the swinging branch it was almost worse than having him entirely free he had a circle about twenty feet in diameter in which he could run and leap at will he seemed to be in the air all the time he sprang first at ken then at me mouth agape eyes wild claws spread we caught him with our nooses but they would not hold he tore each noose off before we could draw it tight once i got a precarious hold on one hind paw and straightened my lasso hold him tight but dont lift him called ken he held his noose ready waiting for a favorable chance the lion crouched low his body tense his long tail lashing back and forth across my lasso ken threw the loop in front of the spread paws now half sunk into the dust ease up ease up said he ill tease him to jump into the noose i let my rope sag ken poked a stick at the lion all at once i saw the slack in the lasso which was tied to the chain before i could yell to warn my comrade the beast leaped my rope burned as it slipped through my hands the lion sailed into the air his paws widespread like wings and one of them struck ken on the head and rolled him down the slope i jerked back on my rope to find it had slipped its hold he slugged me one remarked ken rising and picking up his hat did he break the skin no but he tore your hatband off i replied lets keep at him for a few moments or an hour no one will ever know how long we ran around him raising the dust scattering stones breaking the branches as we dodged his onslaughts he leaped at us to the full length of his tether sailing right into our faces a fierce uncowable tigerish beast if it had not been for the collar and swivel he would have choked himself a hundred times quick as a cat supple powerful tireless he kept on the go whirling bounding leaping rolling till it seemed we would never catch him if anything breaks hell get one of us cried ken i felt his breath that time lord how i wish we had some of those fellows here who say lions are rank cowards i exclaimed in one of his sweeping side swings the lion struck the rock and hung there on its flat surface with his tail hanging over attract his attention i shouted but dont get too close dont make him jump while ken slowly manoeuvered in front of the lion i slipped behind the rock lunged for the long tail and got a good hold of it then with a whoop i ran around the rock carrying the kicking squalling lion clear of the ground nows your chance i yelled rope a hind foot i can hold him in a second ken had a noose fast on both hind paws and then passed his rope to me while i held the lion he again climbed the tree untied the knot that had caused so much trouble and shortly we had our obstinate captive stretched out between two trees after which we took a muchneeded breathing spell not very scientific i said by way of apologizing for our crude work but we had to get him some way dick do you know i believe hiram put up a job on us said ken well maybe he did we had the job all right but well make short work of him now while ken held the chain i muzzled the lion with a stick and strands of lasso now for the hardest part of it said i packing him up we toiled painfully upward resting every few yards wet with sweat burning with heat parching for water we slipped and fell got up to slip and fall again the dust choked us unheedingly we risked our lives on the brinks of precipices we had no thought save to get the lion up we had to climb partly sidewise with the pole in the hollow of our elbows the lion dragged head downward catching in the brush and on the stones our rests became more frequent i had the downward end of the pole and therefore thrice the weight and i whistled when i drew breath half the time i saw red mist before my eyes how i hated the sliding stones wait i panted once youre younger than i wait at last we dropped our burden in the shade of a cedar where the other lions lay and we stretched ourselves for a long sweet rest wonder where jim is i said then i heard the lions wheezing coughing ken look the lions are choking theyre choking of thirst theyll die if we dont get waterthats where jim is hunting water water in this dry place where will we find it implored ken after all our efforts and wonderful good luck the thought of losing those beautiful cougars for lack of a little water was almost sickening ken i cant do another lick im played out you must find water dont hope and wait for jim go yourself it snowed yesterday then into my mind flashed a picture of the many little pockets beaten by rains into the shelves and promontories of the candashon rim when i told ken he leaped up and ran like a startled deer i watched him with curious pride and faith what an athlete he was he swung up over boulders he drew himself up by grasping branches he walked straight up steep slides the roar of a starting avalanche came from under his heels then he reached the rim and disappeared for what seemed a long time he remained out of my sight then he appeared carrying his cap in both hands he had found water he began the downward journey like a tightrope performer he balanced himself on crumbling stones he stepped with the skill of a goat he zigzagged weathered slopes he leaped fissures and ran along yellow slides the farther down he got the faster he came until it seemed as if he had wings places that in an ordinary moment would have seemed impassable he sailed over with the light touch of sure feet then he bore down upon me with an indian yell of triumph ken old boy youre a wonder i exclaimed he grasped a lion by the ears and held his head up i saturated my handkerchief and squeezed the water into his mouth he wheezed coughed choked but to our joy he swallowed he had to swallow one after another we served them so seeing with unmistakable relief the sure signs of recovery their eyes cleared and brightened the dry coughing that distressed us so ceased the froth came no more spitfire as we had christened the savage brute which had fought us to a standstill raised his head the gold in his beautiful eyes glowed like fire and he growled in token of returning life and defiance ken and i sank back in unutterable relief waahoo hirams yell came breaking the warm quiet of the slope our comrade appeared riding down the voice of the indian calling to marc mingled with the ringing of ironshod hoofs on the stones then jim stooping under the cedars appeared from the opposite direction hello shore ive been huntin water an couldnt find none hevnt you seen the need of it suddenly he grasped the situation and his red face relaxed and beamed hiram surveyed the small level spot in the shade of the cedars he gazed from the lions to us and his dry laugh split the air doggone me if you didnt do it chapter xviii hals lesson it was a strange procession that soon emerged from left candashon stranger to us than the lion heads bobbing out of the sacks was the sight of navvy riding in front of the lions i kept well in the rear for if anything happened which i thought more than likely i wanted to see it before we had reached the outskirts of the pines i observed that the piece of lasso round spitfires nose had worked loose i was about to speak when the lion opened a corner of his mouth and fastened his teeth in the navajos overalls he did not catch the flesh for when navvy turned he wore only the expression of curiosity but when he saw spitfire chewing at him he uttered a shrill scream and fell sidewise off his horse then there were two difficulties to catch the frightened horse and to persuade the indian he had not been bitten we failed in the latter navvy gave us and the lions a wide berth and walked to camp hal was waiting for us and said he had chased a lion south along the rim till the hound got away from him spitfire having already been chained was the first lion we endeavored to introduce to our family of captives he raised such a fearful row that we had to take him quite a little distance from the others we hey two dog chains said hiram but not a collar or a swivel in camp we cant chain the lions without swivels theyd choke themselves in two minutes once more for the hundredth time he came to the rescue with his inventive and mechanical skill he took the largest pair of hobbles we had and with an axe a knife and wire nippers fashioned two collars with swivels that in strength and serviceability were an improvement on those we had bought darkness was enveloping the forest when we finished supper i fell into my bed and despite the throbbing and burning of my body soon relapsed into slumber and i crawled out next morning late for breakfast stiff worn out crippled the boys too were crippled but happy six lions roaring in concert were enough to bring contentment hiram engaged himself upon a new pair of trousers which he contrived to produce from two of our empty mealbags the lower half of his overalls had gone to decorate the cedar spikes and brush and these new bagleg trousers while somewhat remarkable for design answered the purpose well enough his coat was somewhere along the candashon rim his shoes were full of holes his shirt in strips and his trousers in rags jim looked like a scarecrow ken looked as if he had been fired from a cannon but fortunately for him he had an extra suit hal spent the afternoon with the lions photographing them listening to their spitting and growling and watching them fight their chains and roll up like balls of fur from different parts of the forest he tried to creep unsuspected upon them but always when he peeped out from behind a tree or log every pair of ears would be erect every pair of eyes gleaming and suspicious spitfire afforded more amusement than all the others he had indeed the temper of a king he had been born for sovereignty not slavery he tried in every way to frighten hal and failing he always ended with a spring to the length of his chain this means was always effective hal simply could not stand still when the lion leaped and in turn he tried every artifice he could think of to make him back away and take refuge behind his tree he ran at him with a club as if he were going to kill him spitfire waited crouching and could not be budged finally hal bethought himself of a red flannel hood that hiram had given him saying he might have use for it on cold nights it was a weird flaming headgear falling cloaklike down over hals shoulders hal started to crawl on all fours toward spitfire this was too much for the cougar in his astonishment he forgot to spit and growl and he backed behind the little pine from which he regarded hal with growing perplexity youngster i hey been watchin you fer the last hour or so remarked hiram an i want to give you a piece of advice thars sech a thing as bein foolhardy brave you dont seem to reckon that them critters are cougars wild cougars an not pets but im not afraid replied hal boldly wal i noticed thet mebbe you dont know what danger is let me tell you a story i read thar was a time onct in the old country when officers of the great french army was reviewin the troops as they marched out to battle presently a big corporal strutted by bold an important swaggerin himself an lookin fight all over thets a brave soldier said one of the officers to napoleon the emperor shook his head an said no arter a while a little drummer boy marched by he was drummin away fer dear life as if by drummin hard he could keep up his courage but he was white as a sheet an his eyes stuck out an he was sweatin an every step he took seemed to be with leaden feet thars a brave soldier said napoleon he knows the danger hirams story did not appear to have any great effect on hal for a while the lad left the lions alone but presently he was back tormenting them he was not at all mean or vicious in his teasing it was simply that they fascinated him and he could not let them alone finally when hal slipped in one of his escapes just eluding spitfire by the narrowest margin hiram ordered him to keep away from them altogether whereupon hal strode off in anger i never seen sich a youngster explained hiram shore he needs a lesson an hes goin to git it said jim if the boy only hes the temper cooled in him an not broke outright hell be fine ken gave one of his short laughs that kid is powder brimstone dynamite and chainlightning all mixed with a compound concentrated solution of deviltry why he has positively been good so far on this trip hiram groaned ken a few years ago you were almost exactly the same kid that hal is now i said with a smile i was not declared ken hotly youngster pears to me you did some tall scrappin fer this same bad kid brother remarked hiram thats different i can fight for hal and still condemn his trickiness cant i the afternoon passed then sunset and the shades spread darkly under the pines suppertime went by darkness came on the campfire blazed and still hal ward did not come back we were not especially worried on this score but when bedtime rolled around and no hal then both ken and hiram showed anxiety morning dawned without his return we had a late breakfast purposely as we expected him to be in by the time navvy drove up the horses but there was no sign of hal something has happened to him sure ken said both jim and i took a different view agreeing that the lad had slept out for fun perhaps to cause us concern and that he would not come in until he was hungry hiram had no comment to make but it was plain that he did not like the possibilities ken showed no desire for lionhunting so we did not go out that day when night came again and hal had not returned we were at our wits end but knowing his singular propensity for tricks and believing that he would do almost anything in the way of mischief we still remained in camp hoping that he would get as tired of the joke as we were and return next morning hiram routed us out early fellars i think weve been good an wrong fer hangin around here waitin fer the youngster tricks or no tricks its been growin on me thet somethin onusual hes come off we could hey follered his tracks yesterday a tarnal sight better than today leslie you an ken rim the plateauwall look fer tracks an keep signalin jim an mell search the pine an the cedar thickets an the hollers what are you going to search the thickets and hollows for demanded ken with wide eyes of misgiving when hiram had no answer for him ken grew greatly perturbed hiram you dont think it possible a cougar could have jumped the boy possible sartinly its possible its not likely though but ive knowed more than one feller to be attacked by a hungry cougar ive hed one foller me more than onctnow youngster dont look sick thet way thet boy hed to hey somethin happen to him somethin serious it was jest plain as the nose on his face i hope an believe of course thet well find him safe but youd better prepare yourself fer a jar the expression of kens face made me almost sick too and what little hope i had oozed out leslie youd better see if any hosses hey come up or gone down the trail at the saddle called hiram as ken and i rode off i tell you dick im afraid hiram takes a bad meaning from hals absence said ken he meant by what he said to you that those rangers belden and sells might have got hold of hal i hope they have because then wed get only a scare and hal wouldnt be hurt muchwell go slow now ken and keep up hope we separated at the rim and took different directions it was high noon when we met again on the other side of the plateau neither of us had found a trace of hal we turned for camp hoping against hope that hiram and jim would have a different story they were both in camp when we arrived and they ran out under the pines to meet us it was plain that they hoped to receive the news from us which we had hoped to hear from them it was a gloomy meeting i failed to foller hals tracks an jim he failed too an jim aint no slouch on follerin tracks it would take an injun the same thought came to us and we all shouted put navvy on hals trail hiram called the navajo and began to try to tell him by signs and speech that hal was lost and that we wanted his trail followed me savvy said the indian he threw the bridle of kens mustang over his arm and then bending over the faint imprints of hals boots he slowly walked into the forest leading the mustang dont foller him let him alone said hiram as ken and i pressed forward the navajos snaillike progress was intolerable to watch yet it was hopeful too for it meant that he was able to pick out hals trail a long hour passed before navvy disappeared in the forest another passed still longer and a third went by that seemed interminable wal them desert navajos hev the sharpest eyes in the world fer a trailyoungster hell find your brother suddenly i saw a black streak darting in the forest look it shot across an open space disappeared came in sight again it was a horse wild hoss im afeard said hiram no its the mustang said jim i guess mebbe i hevnt often seen a redskin pushin a mustang to his limit oh its navvy exclaimed ken look at him come youngster now youre seein some real ridin said hiram the beautiful black mustang swept toward camp at the speed of the wind he ran on a straight line sailing over logs splitting through the bunch of juniper with flying mane and tail the dark indian crouched low and rode as if he were part of the mustang there was something wild in that fleet approach something thrilling and full of hope the navajo gained the camp circle pulled up the mustang until he slid on his haunches and leaped from the saddle we crowded toward him he said a few words in navajo which none of us could translate there was no telling anything from his dark impassive face then he made motions with his hands and his meaning became at once clear hal had fallen over the rim oh oh cried ken ward covering his face with his hands it was a black moment for all of us i hiram and jim glanced compassionately at ken but i could not bear to look at him as i turned away i saw the indian pick up two lassoes and a canteen tohodena tohodena hurry hurry said the navajo that put new life into us look ken the indians grabbed up canteen and ropes that means hal is alive kens face seemed transfigured he darted for hals mustang which was with our other horses threw on a saddle and buckled it with nervous haste we were mounted as soon as ken navvy swung his quirt and the race was on it was a race and a mad one to keep the indian in sight our lion chases were tame beside this wild ride the pines blurred all about me the brown sward seemed to shoot backwards under me the wind howled in my ears i kept close at the heels of hirams thundering roan the indian with marvelous skill held to a straight line logs and thickets and hollows even deep gulches did not make him swerve once i got a good look ahead and there was ken riding wings almost a rod ahead of jim who had a lead over hiram i thought at the moment how proud hal would have been of wings but fast as ken was driving him the pinto could not catch the mustang the pines thinned out and clumps of cedar appeared with patches of sage the navajo reined in leaped off and waited till we raced up in a twinkling we were oil ready to follow he carried the lassoes and the canteen we were directly above a cape of crumbling rim rock to me the great abyss with its purple clefts and gold domes and red walls had never appeared so sinister and menacing the indian led down a short slope of sage and then went out upon a jutting section of wall this cape appeared to be cut up into crags and castles and columns of yellow stone one crumbling mass resembled a ruined pipeorgan of grand proportions we wound in and out always dangerously near the precipice following the rimwall of this cape the indian halted upon the edge of a kind of cove a cutin some fifty yards across at the widest where it opened out into the chasm i saw that the wall on the opposite side was perpendicular and almost forty feet high navvy dropped to his knees and leaned over the rim we followed suit i found myself looking down at a straight wall then a narrow shelf of debris and below that a small grassy plot of ground which sloped to the main rimwall ken ward let out a bursting yell of joy then i saw hal lying on one side of the plot there was a bloody wound on the side of his cheek and temple ah there he said faintly and he smiled a smile that was as feeble as his voice i could not tell what the greeting was we shouted down to him for the reason that we all shouted at once then we leaped up from the rim ready for action the first thing ken ward did was to give the navajo such a hug that i made sure he would crush the indians ribs navvy smiled at this rough treatment as if he knew what it meant to lose and find a brother cool down now youngster said hiram an let me engineer this bizness jim was more agitated than i had ever seen him he kept peeping over the rim hiram he shore aint moved a hand or foot since we got here whispered jim mebbe hes too weak replied hiram the old hunter carefully tied up two lassoes then two more and putting these together he made a double rope more than fifty feet long ken well let you down he said running a noose under kens arms with hiram and jim holding the rope ken slipped over the rim and soon reached the shelf below hal old boy are you hurt very much asked ken as he knelt by his brother water water whispered hal pitch me the canteen quick called ken hiram took it from navvy and carefully poised it make sure youngster it might hit a rock an bounce down the slope pitch it cried ken in scornful distraction have i played ball all these years for nothing pitch it thar called hiram and he pitched the canteen ken caught it with steel like clutch and then he was kneeling by hal holding up the boys head and helping him to drink from the length of that drink hal must have been pretty thirsty hal tell me now where are you hurt asked ken the boy whispered something that only ken heard and we saw that ken began to feel for broken bones and search for injuries hiram all i can find is the bruise on his face and a bad ankle its black and blue and swollen out of shape im afraid its broken he can move all over so his spine cant be hurt good now youngster you take off your coat an put it round hal under his arms whar the rope goesthar thets right now you lift him an git him straight under ussteady nowhelp me lift him jim an leslie you stand ready to grab him when we git him up in less than two minutes we had hal lying on the rim above i hardly recognized his face it was pallid except for the bloody bruise and his eyes were deepset with a strained expression of pain and his lips were drawn he had changed terribly oh im all here he whispered but it was only a faint likeness of his old spirit say throw me the rope yelled ken hiram threw it over and while he and i held firmly ken came up hand over hand leslie you lead back an break a trail through the brush directed i hiram as he carefully lifted hal in his arms we were not long in getting to the horses here hiram placed hal astride his roan and walked with an arm steadying the lad while jim rode alongside and helped this procession was very slow in reaching camp when we arrived there hiram made a thorough examination of the boy and to our great relief announced that there were no serious injuries hes got a knock on the side of his head an a sprained ankle an mebbe hes sufferin from shock but hell be around in a few days we washed the blood from hals face and bathed his ankle in hot water his face was so painful and his lips so swollen that it was difficult for him to eat but after he had forced down some potato soup and a few mouthfuls of coffee he appeared to gather a little strength we were so overjoyed to have him back alive and comparatively well that all thought of his delinquencies had been forgotten but evidently hal had not forgotten for he looked wistfully at ken and hiram it appeared to me that hal wanted to be helped out in his confession none of us however asked him a question ken he said finally and his voice was strangely weak i ran off bullheaded mad but i didnt stay away for spite i chased some kind of a young animal a young coyote i think and i fell over the rim forget it replied ken cheerfully i yelled and yelled went on hal then i knew you wouldnt be hunting for me because youd all figure i was playing a trick trying to scare you so i stopped yelling the pain wasnt so bad i could have stood that but the thought of you not hunting for me for a long time that hurt it made me sick then after the first night and the next day i got thirsty i had a fever i guess for i was flighty pretty soon i believed youd never find me then then he never completed that sentence but his look was eloquent hal ward had been face to face with his first real tragedy in life the lesson that jim had prophesied had been a terrible one ken he said after a long silence i broke my promise to you one thing i did promise you know that was to be careful its all right kid replied ken jim he went on after another silence i guess you wont let me rustle with you any more shore i will shore replied jim hurriedly as he fumbled aimlessly with his pipe then there was a third silence this one the longest hiram said hal do you remember you called me a young injun once and then i heard you say the only good injun was a dead one wal lad what about it asked hiram kindly when i lay down in that dark hole at night with the stars shining in my lace i never slept a wink i thought of what you had said of your advice and i made up my mind if i ever got out alive id fool you about being a good injunim goin to be one amen cried ken ward fervently chapter xix ken and prince next morning hiram was out bright and early yelling to navvy to hurry with the horses calling to the hounds and lions and routing us from warm blankets navvy had come into his own he received his full meed of praise from all of us even jim reluctantly feeling the place in his hip where he carried a pellet of indian lead acknowledged that navvy had been invaluable shore hes the only good redskin i ever seen an i guess ill hey to change my mind about liftin his scalp tohodena said navvy mimicking hiram perhaps we all contrasted this jocular use of the word with the grim meaning he had given to it the day before as we sat down to breakfast he loped off into the forest and before we got up the bells of the horses were jingling in the hollow shore its goin to be cloudy said jim if its just the same to you fellows ill keep camp remarked hal wal lad i reckon so was hirams reply indeed we carried hal out of hirams tent and propped him up with blankets it would probably be several days before he could use his injured ankle he was haggard and the bruise had grown blacker but the terrible strained shadow of pain in his eyes had given place to something brighter and softer shore im goin to keep camp with you drawled jim presently that will be fine but ken and hiram and dick will need you they can need an be darned im tired climbin out of them gashes my heart aint right yet after luggin thet cougar eleven miles or less straight up in the air wal youngster said hiram to ken it was strange and incomprehensible why he called hal lad and ken youngster but so it was i reckon weve got more sassy cougars right now than we can pack off this plateau packin them out tharll be some fun everything yet has been fun except some of my stunts replied hal after breakfast we made a comfortable lounging place for hal and left him in care of jim then ken hiram and i rode down the ridge to the left of middle candashon all the way we had trouble with the hounds first they ran foul of a coyote which was the one and only beast they could not resist spreading out to head them off we separated i cut into a hollow and rode to its end and there i went up i heard the hounds and presently saw a big white coyote making fast time through the forest glades it looked as if he would cross close to me so i dismounted and knelt with my rifle ready the coyote saw me and shied off i sent several singing zipping bullets after him which only served to make him run the faster remounting i turned toward my companions now hallooing from a ridge below the pack lost some time on old trails but we reached the cedars about eight oclock and as the sky was overcast with low duncolored clouds and the air cool we were sure it was not too late soon we were in the thick of dense cedars there with but a single bark to warn us prince got out of sight and hearing while we separated to look for him the remainder of the pack hit a trail and then they were off i kept them in hearing for some time meanwhile hiram and ken might as well have vanished off the globe for all i could see or hear of them occasionally i halted to let out a signal waahoo away on the dry air pealed the cry piercing the cedar forest splitting sharp in the walled candashons and clapping back and forth from wall to wall rolling on to lose power to die away in mocking silence i rode to and fro up this gully and down that one i rimmed what seemed a thousand candashons and yelled till i was out of breath but i could not find a trace or hear a sound that belonged to my companions or the hounds so i turned my horse toward camp and it was noon when i got there about three oclock curley came in footsore and weary next was queen and she could scarcely touch her crippled foot to the ground an hour after her arrival ringer came in he was worn out dusty and panting with thirst and heat shore everybody was huntin fer himself today remarked jim at five oclock hirams gaunt charger snapped the dead wood in the hollow the tall hunter got off and untied two cougar skins from the back of his saddle whar were you an the youngster he demanded thets what i want to know i lost you both and couldnt hit your trail again i replied wal the hounds got up cougar chases fer themselves today prince lit out an thet settled it i lost em all but mux an tan as he spoke the two hounds limped into camp i reckon ken is sittin under a cedar holdin prince an yellin fer us to come an help him git his cougarits been another queer huntin day doggone it this plateau is a curious splitup place an no wonder we cant do nuthin i hed to kill the two cougars i treed arter i waited hours fer you an kenwal ill rest a little an then git supper gee hiram i hope kens all right exclaimed hal anxiously dont you worry lad hell be ridin in soon hiram had just taken the steaming supper off the fire when the barking of the hounds announced kens appearance he rode wearily under the pines and prince trotted wearily behind jest in time youngster called the old hunter cheerily ken fell rather than dismounted and he slipped to the ground and stretched out so slowly so painfully so gratefully that it was easy to see what he had been through his clothes were in tatters and he was white and spent to our solicitations he whispered wait and he lay there for full five minutes before he crawled to the suppercloth we were all curious and hal was wild to hear kens adventure there was something about ken ward before a time of stress or after hard action that thrilled one with its significance when supper was over and we sat in a circle round the ruddy campfire with the cool wind singing in the pines and the shadows of night darkening hiram said wal youngster i reckon we want to hyar about it ken was still silent and there was a brooding grimness about his thoughtful face as we waited for ken to take his time prince edged nearer the fire for the air was chill and when the great hound laid his splendid head on kens knee and looked up with somber eyes the boy seemed to burst out involuntarily prince saved my life he did breathed hal his shining eyes full on his brother tell me everything ken settled back and began his story sometime this morning i lost hiram and the hounds i found myself in a dark gloomy forest after a while this forest got all but impenetrable dead cedars lay in windfalls live cedars branches touching the ground grew close together i lost my bearings i turned and turned crossed my own backtrail which i followed coming out of the cedars at a deep candashon here i fired my revolver but no answering shot came there was nothing for me to do but wander along in the hope of finding hiram or dick i was riding on when i saw prince come trotting to me hello old boy i said prince seemed to be as glad to see me as i was to see him he flopped down and panted with a dripping tongue jerking out of his mouth he was covered with dust and flecked with froth all in prince i asked well rest awhile then i discovered blood on his ear and found the ear slit he had been pushing a cougar too hard that morning i filled my hat with water from my canteen and gave prince a drink four times he emptied the hat before he was satisfied then he laid his head against me and rested prince got up finally of his own accord and with a wag of his tail set of westward i kept my mustang as close to prince as the rough going permitted we came out in the notch of the great curve we had named the bay i was just about to shout for you when i saw prince with his hair bristling he took a dozen jumps then yelping broke down the steep gorge and disappeared i found a fresh track of the big lion that we have chased so often and decided to follow prince i tied my mustang and took off my coat and spurs and chaps and fastened a red bandana to the top of a dead cedar to show me where to come up on my way back i went down about five hundred feet until a precipice stopped me from it i heard prince baying and almost instantly saw a lion in a treetop that roused me and i yelled hi hi hi to encourage prince i thought it would be wise to look before i leaped the bay lay under me a mile wide where it opened into the big smoky candashon it seemed like an awful bottomless pit i tell you for a moment the sight shook my nerve but i had to go after prince i ran along to the left and came to where the cliff ended in a weathered slope once started in dead earnest it was like playing a game that had to be won my boots struck fire from the rocks i slid and hung on and let go to slide again i started avalanches of weathered rock and then outfooted them but soon i had to go slower and climb over things prince bayed once in a while and i yelled to him to let him know i was coming a white bank of decayed limestone led down to a runway where i made up time here princes bay kept me going flying down this to a clump of cedars i ran in among them and saw prince standing with fore paws against a big cedar i saw a lion moving down then the crash and rattle of stones told me he had jumped prince ran after him i dashed down dodged under cedars and threaded openings in the rocks to come to a ravine with a bare waterworn floor patches of sand showed the tracks of prince and the lion those of the lion were so large they made my blood run cold they were twice the size of any tracks i had seen before running down this dry streambed was the easiest going yet every rod or so the streambed dropped from four to ten feet often more and these places i slid down the cougar didnt appear to tree any more i feared every moment to hear the sounds of a fight for i remembered that hiram had said an old cougar would get tired running and stop to kill the hound down down down i went i saw that we were almost to the real jumpoff the great wide main candashon and i wondered what would happen when we reached it suddenly i came upon prince baying wildly under a pindashon on the brink of a deep cove looking up i had the fright of my life the cougar was immense and so old that his color was almost gray his head was huge his paws short and round he did not spit nor snarl nor growl he did not look at prince but kept his halfshut eyes on me before i had time to move he left his perch and hit the ground with a thud at first i made sure he intended to attack me and i jerked out my revolver but he walked slowly past prince and without a moments hesitation leaped down into the cove a rattling crash of sliding stones came up with a cloud of dust then i saw him leisurely picking his way among the rough stones prince came whining to me and together we went along the cove till we found a place where we could get down we crawled and jumped and fell till we reached the bottom and again prince took the trail almost before i knew what i was about i stood on the second wall of the candashon with nothing but thin air under me i tell you it made me gasp princes bark came to me and i turned round a corner of cliff wall and saw him on a narrow shelf he was coming and when he got to me he faced about and barked fiercely the hair on his neck stuck up come on prince i called that was the only time i ever knew of prince hesitating to chase a lion i had to coax him for he didnt like that narrow shelf but once started he wouldnt let me lead the shelf was twenty feet wide and close to the wall were lion tracks in the dust a jutting corner of cliff wall hid my view i peeped round it on the other side the shelf narrowed and it climbed a little by broken steps prince passed the corner looked back to see if i was coming and went on he looked back four times and once he waited for me to come up with him im with you prince i kept calling the shelf narrowed till it was scarcely three feet wide prince stopped barking then looked back for me a protruding corner shut me from sight of what lay beyond prince slipped round i had to go sidewise and my fingers bit into the wall to my surprise i found myself on the floor of a shallow windcave the lion trail led straight across it and on prince went slower and slower i rounded the next point and crossed another shallow cave and slipped by another corner to come upon a wonderful scene the trail ended there in the center of a wide shelf sat the great lion on his haunches with his long tail lashing out over the precipice when he saw us he turned round and walked the whole length of the shelf with his head bent over he was looking for a place to jump then he stopped and bent his head so far over the abyss that i thought he would fall all at once i thought of my camera and at the same time forgot all about hirams telling me never to take my eye off a cougar when al close quarters i got my camera opened it and focused for about twentyfive feet then a wild yelp from prince and a roar from the cougar brought me to my senses the cat leaped ten feet and stood snarling horribly almost in my face his lashing tail knocked little stones off the shelf i pulled out my revolver and aimed once twice but was afraid to shoot if i wounded him he would knock us off the shelf it was then i got scared and began to shake so i could scarcely keep my knees from sinking under me but good old prince was braver than i and he had more sense he faced the lion and bayed at him hold him prince hold him i yelled and i took a backward step the cougar put forward one big paw his eyes were now purple blazes i backed again and he stepped forward prince gave ground slowly once the lion flashed a yellow paw at him it was frightful to see the widespread claws in the terror of the moment i let the lion back me clear across the front of the windcave where i saw the moment it was too late i should have taken advantage of more space to shoot him the cougar was master of the situation i kept backing step by step and i saw the shelf narrowing under my feet when i remembered the place where it would be impossible for me to back around i almost fainted i stopped stock still and almost tottered over the precipice somehow princes bravery gave me a kind of desperate strength at the last the lion taking slow catlike steps backed prince against my knees the great brute was within his own length of me so close that i smelt him his eyes fascinated me hugging the wall with my body i brought up the revolver shortarmed and straining every nerve i aimed between those eyes and pulled the trigger the cougars left eye seemed to vanish with the bellow of the revolver and the smell of powder he uttered a hoarse howl and rose straight up towering over me beating the wall heavily with his paws i stood there helpless with terror forgetting my weapon fearing only that the beast would fall over on me and brush me off the shelf but in his death agony he bounded out from the wall turned over and over and went down out of sight i had to sit down then i was all in the relief made me sick i sat there with princes head on my knees and slowly got back my strength finally when i tried to rise my legs were still shaky and i felt as weak as if i were just up from a long sickness three times i tried to go round the narrow place on the fourth i braced up and went around and soon reached the turn of the wall i was six hours in climbing outand i guess ive had enough cougar chasing to do me for a while chapter xx around the campfire wal youngster began the old hunter after a long silence i allus reckoned thet prince was a great hound an its only when a feller gits out alone with a dog an gits in lonesome or dangerous places thet he really knows how human a dog is oh it was grand of prince to stay between ken and the lion exclaimed hal shore its a shame thet houndll hey to be killed by a cougar some day remarked jim i reckon now thet dayll never come replied hiram why shore you always said so prince shall never put his nose to another cougar trail an hes goin back to pennsylvania with the youngster hiram do you really mean to give him to me asked ken in glad surprise wal i reckon so ill miss him but ringer is comin on an will lead the pack hiram its good of you ill ken left off and hugged prince by way of reply and the hound licked his face for once hal did not look jealous over kens possession of something that he could not hope to rival for himself ken if you have enough cougar hunting what next i asked the rest of my time here ill put in studying forestry and i want you to help me i declare ive completely forgotten my work but ill make it up im a fine ranger eh wal youngster a rangers duties are many replied hiram now if the chief was to ask you about cougars same as he asked you about forestfires last summer you could tell him a few things i guess i could declared ken your time hasnt been wasted an now thet nobody has been hurt bad or any hosses or hounds killed i feel pretty happy about the hunt from now on while im hyar on the plateau ill tree cougars an kill em fer ive orders to clear the preserve of them you know meantime you will be addin to your knowledge of trees an hal will be gittin well i calkilate he ought not to ride down these trails fer two weeks thet will be long enough for his ankle to git strong then well pack our cougars out to kanab an weve got to stop down in the brakes at our corral an ketch our wild mustangs weve most forgot them itll be some fun thet job ken are you going back to college this fall i asked yes but i intend to get ahead of my term and take some time off about january and february to go south i want to see the tropics to study the jungle timber and vegetation shore youll look up some trouble down there said jim ive been in mexican jungles along the rio grande millions of things to shoot ken im going with you declared hal youre going to start in college said ken severely do you suppose id be any good in college with you somewhere in the jungle wait till i see father hell let me go youd have a fine chance ever getting to go to any wild place again if i told him how you jumped over the rim of the grand candashon just to scare your brother and friends i didnt i didnt denied hal vehemently i fell over and i knocked some sense into me toobut ken youll never tell the governor will you lad i reckon ken wont give you away said hiram fer he an all of us believe thet adventure has taught you the difference between fun an foolhardiness id trust you now an if i would surely your brother wouldnow leslie you spring your little surprise on the boys i turned to ken and hal then hesitated hiram i said are you sure the indian cant understand english i dont want even a word of this to get to any ears but ours ken ward leaned forward with his eyes suddenly flashing dark and hal sat up in glowing curiosity hiram sent the navajo off to bunch the horses well boys its this i began hiram and jim and i are not going to sign contracts with the forest service for next year we think weve got something a little better weve found traces of gold down in the candashon and we believe theres enough gold to pay us to go after it and there are chances we may strike it richso next summer we want you both to come out and go with us after gold ken ward uttered his ringing shout and hal looked the wild joy that his speechless tongue could not utter that was their answer wal wal somehow i kinder thought youd like the idee said hiram as he filled his pipe we all want you to come bad tharll be some of the real thing specially if any of them nogood fellers like the one ken licked git wind
