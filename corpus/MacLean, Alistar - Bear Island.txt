 bear island by alistair maclean bear island to even the least sensitive and perceptive beholder the morning rose at this stage of her long and highly chequered career must have seemed illnamed for if ever a vessel could fairly have been said to be approaching if not actually arrived at the sunset of her days it was this one officially designated an arctic steam trawler the morning rose gross tons feet in length in beam and with a draught unladen but fully provisioned with fuel and water of feet had in fact been launched from the jarrow slipways as far back as the year of the general strike the morning rose then was far gone beyond the superannuation watershed she was slow creaking unstable and coming apart at the seams so were captain imrie and mr stokes the morning rose consumed a great deal of fuel in relation to the footpounds of energy produced so did captain imrie and mr stokes malt whisky for captain imrie jamaican rum for mr stokes and that was what they were doing now stoking up on their respective fuels with the steadfast dedication of those who havent attained septuagenarian status through sheer happenstance as far as i could see none of the sparse number of diners at the two long fore and aft tables was stoking up very much on anything there was a reason for this of course the same reason that accounted for the poor attendance at dinner that night it was not because of the food which while it wouldnt cause any sleepless nights in the kitchens of the savoy was adequate enough nor was it because of any aesthetic objections our cargo of creative artists might have entertained towards the dining saloons decor which was by any standards quite superb it was a symphony in teak furniture and winecoloured carpets and curtains not admittedly what one would look to find on the average trawler but then the average trawler when its fishing days are overas the morning roses were deemed to be in doesnt have the good fortune to be reengined and converted to a luxury yacht by of all people a shipping millionaire whose enthusiasm for the sea was matched only by his massive ignorance of all things nautical the trouble tonight lay elsewhere not within the ship but without three hundred miles north of the arctic circle where we at the present moment had the debatable fortune to be the weather conditions can be as beautifully peaceful as any on earth with mirrorsmooth milkywhite seas stretching from horizon to horizon under a canopy of either washedout blue or stars that are less stars than little chips of frozen fire in a black black sky but those days are rare and usually to be found only in that brief period that passes for summer in those high latitudes and whatever summer there had been was long gone we were deep into late october now the period of the classical equinoctial gales and there was a real classical equinoctial beauty blowing up right then moxen and scott the two stewards had prudently drawn the diningsaloon curtains so that we couldnt see quite how classical it was we didnt have to see it we could hear it and we could feel it we could hear the wild threnody of the gale in the rigging a highpitched ululating atonic sound as lonely lost and eerie as a witchs lament we could hear at monotonously regular intervals the flat explosive clap of sound as the bluff bows of the trawler crashed into the troughs of the steepsided waves marching steadily eastwards under the goad of that bitter wind born on the immensity of the greenland icecap all of seven hundred miles away we could hear the constantly altering variation in the depth of the engine note as the propellor surged upwards almost clearing water level then plunged deep down into the sea again and we could feel the storm a fact that most of those present clearly found a great deal more distressing than just listening to it one moment depending upon which side of the fore and aft tables we were sitting we would be leaning sharply to our left or right as the bows lurched and staggered up the side of a wave the next we would be leaning as sharply in the other direction as the stern in turn rode high on the crest of the same wave to compound the steadily increasing level of misery and discomfort the serried ranks of waves beyond the damask drapes were slowly but ominously beginning to break down into confused seas which violently accentuated the morning roses typical fishingboat propensity for rolling continuously in anything short of millpond conditions the two different motions lateral and transverse were now combining to produce an extremely unpleasant corkscrewing effect indeed because id spent most of the past eight years at sea i wasnt experiencing any distressing symptoms myself but i didnt have to be a doctor which my paper qualifications declared me to beto diagnose the symptoms of mal de mer the wan smile the gaze studiously averted from anything that resembled food the air of rapt communication with the inner self all the signs were there in plenty a very mirthprovoking subject seasickness until one suffers from it ones self then it ceases to be funny any more id dispensed enough dramamine to turn them all buttercup yellow but dramamine is about as effective against an arctic gale as aspirin is against cholera i looked round and wondered who would be the first to go antonio i thought that tall willowy exquisite rather precious but oddly likeable roman with the shock of ludicrously blond and curling hair it is a fact that when a person reaches that nadir of nausea which is the inevitable prelude to violent sickness the complexion does assume a hue which can only be described as greenish in antonios case it was more a tinge of applegreen chartreuse an odd coloration that id never seen before but i put it down to his naturally sallow complexion anyway no question but that it was the genuine symptom of the genuine illness another particularly wild lurch and antonio was on his feet and out of the saloon at a dead runor as near a dead run as his landlubber legs could achieve on that swaying deckwithout either farewell or apology such is the power of suggestion that within a very few seconds and on the very next lurch three other passengers two men and a girl hurriedly rose and left and such is the power of suggestion compounded that within two minutes more there were apart from captain imrie mr stokes and myself only two others left mr gerran and mr heissman captain imrie and mr stokes seated at the heads of their respective and now virtually deserted tables observed the hurried departure of the last of the sufferers looked at each other in mild astonishment shook their heads and got on with the business of replenishing their fuel reserves captain imrie a large and splendidly patriarchal figure with piercing blue eyes that werent much good for seeing with had a mane of thick white hair that was brushed straight back to his shoulders and totally obscuring the dinner tie he affected for dinner wear an even more impressively flowing beard that would have been the envy of many a biblical prophet as always he wore a goldbuttoned doublebreasted jacket with the thick white ring of a commodore of the royal navy to which he wasnt entitled and partly concealed by the grandeur of his beard four rows of medal ribbons to which he was now still shaking his head he lifted his bottle of malt scotch from its containernot until that evening had i understood the purpose of that twofoothigh wroughtiron contraption bolted to the saloon deck by the side of his chairfilled his glass almost to the top and added the negligible amount of water required to make it brimming full it was at this precise moment that the morning rose reared unusually high on the crest of a wave hovered for what appeared to be an unconscionably long time then fell both forwards and sideways to plunge with a resounding shuddering crash into the shoulder of the next sea captain imrie didnt spill a drop for any indication he gave to the contrary he might have been in the taproom of the mainbrace in hull which was where id first met him he quaffed half the contents of his glass in one puff and reached for his pipe captain imrie had long mastered the art of dining gracefully at sea mr gerran clearly hadnt he gazed down at his lamb chops brussels sprouts potatoes and glass of hock which werent where they ought to have beenthey were on his napkin and his napkin was on his lapwith a vexed frown on his face this was in its small way a crisis and otto gerran could hardly be said to be at his ineffectual best when faced with crisis of any kind but for young moxen the steward this was routine his own napkin at the ready and bearing a small plastic bucket hed apparently conjured from nowhere he set about effecting running repairs while gerran gazed downwards with an expression of perplexed distaste seated otto gerran apart from his curiously narrow pointed cranium that widened out to broad fleshy jowls looked as if he might have been cast in one of the standard moulds which produce the vast majority of human shapes and forms it was not until he stood up a feat he performed with great difficulty and as infrequently as possible that one appreciated how preposterous this misconception was gerran stood five feet two inches in his elevator shoes weighed two hundred and fortyfive pounds and were it not for his extremely illfitting clothesone would assume that the tailor just gave upwas the nearest thing to a perfect human sphere id ever clapped eyes on he had no neck long slender sensitive hands and the smallest feet ive ever seen for a man of his size the salvage operation over gerran looked up and at imrie his complexion was puce in colour with the purple much more in evidence than the brown this did not mean that he was angry for gerran never showed anger and was widely believed to be incapable of it puce was as standard for him as the peaches and cream of the mythical english rose his coronary was at least fifteen years overdue really captain imrie this is preposterous for a man of his vast bulk gerran had a surprisingly highpitched voice surprisingly that is if you werent a medical practitioner must we keep heading into this dreadful storm storm captain imrie lowered his glass and looked at gerran in genuine disbelief did you say storm a little blow like this he looked across to the table where i was sitting with mr stokes force you would say mr stokes a touch of eight perhaps mr stokes helped himself to some more rum leaned back and deliberated he was as bereft of cranial and facial hair as captain imrie was overendowed with it with his gleaming pate tightly drawn brown face seamed and wrinkled into a thousand fissures and a long thin scrawny neck he looked as aged and as ageless as a galapagos turtle he also moved at about the same speed both he and captain imrie had gone to sea togetherin minesweepers as incredibly far back as world war iand had remained together until they had officially retired ten years previously nobody the legend went had ever heard them refer to each other except as captain imrie and mr stokes some said that in private they used the terms skipper and chief but this was discounted as an unsubstantiated and unworthy rumour which did justice to neither man moments passed then mr stokes having arrived at a measured opinion delivered himself of it seven he said seven captain imrie accepted the judgement as unhesitatingly as if an oracle had spoken and poured himself another drink i thanked whatever gods there be for the infinitely reassuring presence of smithy the mate on the bridge you see mr gerran nothing as gerran was at that moment clinging frantically to a table that was inclined at an angle of thirty degrees he made no reply a storm dearie me dearie me why i remember the very first time that mr stokes and i took the morning rose up to the bear island fishing grounds the very first trawler ever to fish those waters and come back with full holds i think it was mr stokes said captain imrie fixed his bright blue eyes on gerran and johann heissman a small lean pale man with a permanently apprehensive expression heissmans hands were never still now that was a storm we were with a trawler out of aberdeen i forget its name the silver harvest mr stokes said the silver harvest engine failure in a force two hours she was broadside to the seas two hours before we could get a line aboard her skipperher skipper macandrew john macandrew thank you mr stokes broke his neck towed his boatand him with his broken neck in splintsfor thirty hours in a force four of them in a force man you should have seen yon seas i tell you they were mountains just mountains the bows thirty feet up and down up and down rolling over on our beam ends hour after hour every man except mr stokes and myself coughing his insides uphe broke off as heissman rose hurriedly to his feet and ran from the saloon is your friend upset mr gerran couldnt we heave to or whatever it is you do gerran pleaded or run for shelter shelter shelter from what why i remember mr gerran and his company havent spent their lives at sea captain i said true true heave to heaving to wont stop the waves and the nearest shelter is jan mayenand thats three hundred miles to the westinto the weather we could run before the weather surely that would help aye we could do that shed steady up then no doubt about it if thats what you want mr gerran you know what the contract sayscaptain to obey all orders other than those what will endanger the vessel good good right away then you appreciate of course mr gerran that this blow might last another day or so with amelioration of the present sufferings practically at hand gerran permitted himself a slight smile we cannot control the caprices of mother nature captain and that well have to turn almost ninety east in your safe hands captain i dont think you are quite understanding it will cost us two perhaps three days and if we run east the weather north of north cape is usually worse than it is here might have to put into hammerfest for shelter might lose a week maybe more i dont know how many hundred pounds a day it costs you to hire the ship and crew and pay your own camera crew and all those actors and actressesi hear tell that some of those people you call stars can earn a fortune in just no time at all captain imrie broke off and pushed back his chair what am i talking about money will mean nothing to a man like you you will excuse me while i call the bridge wait gerran looked stricken his parsimony was legendary throughout the film world and captain imrie had touched not inadvertently i thought upon his tenderest nerve a week lose a whole week if were lucky captain imrie pulled his chair back up to the table and reached for the malt but ive already lost three days the orkney cliffs the sea the morning rosenot a foot of background yet gerrans hands were out of sight but i wouldnt have been surprised if hed been wringing them and your director and camera crew on their backs for the past four days captain imrie said sympathetically it was impossible to say whether a smile lay behind the obfuscatory luxuriance of moustache and beard the caprices of nature mr gerran three days gerran said again maybe another week a thirtythree day location budget kirkwall to kirkwall otto gerran looked ill clearly both the state of his stomach and his film finances were making very heavy demands upon him how far to bear island captain imrie three hundred miles give or take the usual twentyeight hours if we can keep up our best speed you can keep it up i wasnt thinking about the morning rose it can stand anything its your people mr gerran nothing against them of course but im thinking theyd be more at home with those pedal boats in the paddling ponds yes of course of course you could see that this aspect of the business had just occurred to him dr marlowe you must have treated a great deal of seasickness during your years in the navy he paused but as i didnt deny it he went on how long do people take to recover from sickness of this kind depends how sick they are id never given the matter any thought but it seemed a logical enough answer how long theyve been ill and how badly ninety rough minutes on a crosschannel trip and youre as right as rain in ten minutes four days in an atlantic gale and youll be as long again before youre back on even keel but people dont actually die of seasickness do they ive never known of a case for all his usual indecisiveness and more than occasional bumbling ineptitude which tended to make people laugh at himdiscreetly and behind his back of courseotto i realised for the first time and with some vague feeling of surprise was capable of a determination that might verge on the ruthless something to do with money i supposed not by itself that is but with a person already suffering from a heart condition severe asthma bronchitis ulcerated stomachwell yes it could see him off he was silent for a few moments probably carrying out a rapid mental survey of the physical condition of cast and crew then he said i must admit that im a bit worried about our people i wonder if youd mind having a look over them just a quick check healths a damn sight more important than any profithah profit in those daysthat we might make from the wretched film as a doctor im sure you wholeheartedly agree of course i said right away otto had to have something that had made him the household name that he had become in the past twenty years and one had to admire this massive and wholly inadmirable hypocrisy that was clearly part of it he had me all ways i had said that seasickness alone did not kill so that if i were to state categorically that some member or members of his cast or crew were in no condition to withstand any further punishment from the seas he would insist on proof of the existence of some disease which in conjunction with seasickness might be potentially lethal a proof that in the first place would have been very difficult for me to adduce in light of the limited examination facilities available to me aboard ship and in the second place would have been impossible anyhow for every single member of cast and crew had been subjected to a rigorous insurance medical before leaving britain if i gave a clean bill of health to all then otto would press on with all speed for bear island regardless of the sufferings of our people about whom he professed to be so worried thereby effecting a considerable saving in time and money and in the remote event of any of them inconsiderately dying upon our hands why then as the man who had given the green light i was the one in the dock i drained my glass of inferior brandy that otto had laid on in such meagre quantities and rose youll be here yes most cooperative of you doctor most we never close i said i was beginning to like smithy though i hardly knew him or anything about him i was never to get to know him not well that i should ever get to know him in my professional capacity was unthinkable six feet two in his carpet slippers and certainly nothing short of two hundred pounds smithy was as unlikely a candidate for a doctors surgery as had ever come my way in the firstaid cabinet there smithy nodded towards a cupboard in a corner of the dimly lit wheelhouse captain imries own private elixir for emergency use only i extracted one of half a dozen bottles held in place by feltlined spring clamps and examined it under the chart table lamp my regard for smithy went up another notch in latitude something north and aboard a superannuated trawler however converted one does not look to end otarddupuy vsop what constitutes an emergency i asked thirst i poured some of the otarddupuy into a small glass and offered it to smithy who shook his head and watched me as i sampled the brandy then lowered the glass with suitable reverence to waste this on a thirst i said is a crime against nature captain imrie isnt going to be too happy when he comes up here and finds me knocking back his special reserve captain imrie is a man who lives by fixed rules the most fixed of the lot is that he never appears on the bridge between pm and am oakleyhes the bosunand i take turns during the night believe me that way its safer for everyone all round what brings you to the bridge doctorapart from this sure instinct for locating vsop duty im checking on the weather prior to checking on the health of mr gerrans paid slaves he fears they may start dying off like flies if we continue on this course in those conditions the conditions id noted appeared to be deteriorating for the behaviour of the morning rose especially its degree of roll was now distinctly more uncomfortable than it had been perhaps it was just a factor of the height of the bridge but i didnt think so mr gerran should have left you at home and brought along his palm reader or fortuneteller a very contained man educated and clearly intelligent smithy always seemed to be slightly amused as for the weather the pm forecast was as it usually is for those parts vague and not very encouraging they havent he aided superfluously a great number of weather stations in those parts what do you think its not going to improve he dismissed the weather and smiled im not a great man for the small talk but with the otarddupuy who needs it take the weight off your feet for an hour then go tell mr gerran that all his paid slaves as you call them are holding a square dance on the poop i suspect mr gerran of having a suspicious checking mind however if i may my guest i helped myself again and replaced the bottle in the cabinet smithy as hed warned wasnt very talkative but the silence was companionable enough presently he said navy arent you doc past tense and now this a shameful comedown dont you find it so touche i could dimly see the white of teeth as he smiled in the half dark medical malpractice flogging penicillin to the wogs or just drunk in charge of a surgery nothing so glamorous insubordination is the word they used snap me too a pause this mr gerran of yours is he all right so the insurance doctors say i didnt mean that you cant expect me to speak ill of my employer again there was that dimly seen glimpse of white teeth well thats one way of answering my question but well look the bloke must be loonyor is that an offensive term only to psychiatrists i dont speak to them loonys fine by me but id remind you that mr gerran has a very distinguished record as a loony that too but also as a filmmaker a producer what kind of producer would take a film unit up to bear island with winter coming on mr gerran wants realism mr gerran wants his head examined has he any idea what its like up there at this time of year hes also a man with a dream no place for dreamers in the barents sea how the americans ever managed to put a man on the moon our friend otto isnt an american hes a central european if you want the makers of dreams or the peddlers of dreams theres the place to end themamong the headwaters of the danube and the biggest rogues and confidence men in europe you cant have everything hes a long way from the danube otto had to leave in a great hurry at a time when a large number of people had to leave in a great hurry year before the war that was found his way to americawhere elsethen to hollywoodagain where else say what you like about ottoand im afraid a lot of people do just that you have to admire his recuperative powers hed left a thriving film business behind him in vienna and arrived in california with what he stood up in thats not so little it was then ive seen pictures no greyhound but still about a hundred pounds short of what he is today anyway inside just a few years chiefly im told by switching at the psychologically correct moment from antinazism to anticommunismotto prospered mightily in the american film industry on the strength of a handful of nauseatingly superpatriotic pictures which had the critics in despair and the audiences in raptures in the mids sensing that the cinematic sun was setting over hollywoodyou cant see it but he carries his own builtin radar system with himottos devotion to his adopted country evaporated along with his bank balance and he transferred himself to london where he made a number of avantgarde films that had the critics in rapture the audiences in despair and otto in the red you seem to know your otto smithy said anybody who has read the first five pages of the prospectus for his last film would know his otto ill let you have a copy never mentions the film just otto misses out words like nauseating and despair of course and you have to read between the lines a bit but its all there id like a copy smithy thought some then said if hes in the red wheres the money coming from to make this film i mean your sheltered life a producer is always at his most affluent when the bailiffs are camped outside the studio gatesrented studio of course who when the banks are foreclosing on him and the insurance companies drafting their ultimatums is throwing the party of the year at the savoy our friend the bigtime producer its kind of like the law of nature youd better stick to ships mr smith i added kindly smithy he said absently so whos bankrolling your friend my employer ive no idea very secretive about money matters is otto but someone is backing him i mean must be i put down my glass and stood up thanks for the hospitality even after hes produced a string of losers seems balmy to me fishy at least the film world smithy is full of balmy and fishy people i didnt in fact know whether it was or not but if this shipload was in any way representative of the cinema industry it seemed a pretty fair extrapolation or perhaps hes just got hold of the story to end all stories the screenplay there now you may have a pointbut its one you would have to raise with mr gerran personally apart from heissman who wrote it gerran is the only one whos seen it it hadnt been a factor of the height of the bridge as i stepped out on to the starboard ladder on the lee sidethere were no internal communications between bridge and deck level on those elderly steam trawlers i was left in no doubt that the weather had indeed deteriorated and deteriorated sharply a fact that should have probably been readily apparent to anyone whose concern for the prevailing meteorological conditions hadnt been confronted with the unfair challenge of otarddupuy even on this what should have been the sheltered side of the ship the power of the wind bitter cold was such that i had to cling with both hands to the handrails and with the morning rose now rolling erratically and violently through almost fifty degrees of arcwhich was wicked enough but id once been on a cruiser that had gone through a hundred degrees of arc and still survivedi could have used another pair of arms even on the blackest night and this was incontestably one of the blackest it is never wholly dark at sea it may never be possible precisely to delineate the horizon line where sea and sky meet but one can usually look several vertical degrees above or below the horizon line and say with certainty that here is sky or here is sea for the sea is always darker than the sky tonight it was impossible to say any such thing and this was not because of the violently rolling morning rose made for a very unstable observation platform nor because the big uneven seas bearing down from the cast made for a tumbling amorphous horizon because tonight for the first time not yet dense but enough to obscure vision beyond two miles smoke frost lay on the surface of the sea that peculiar phenomenon which one finds in norway where the glacial land winds pass over the warm fiord waters or as here where the warm atlantic air passed over the arctic waters all i could see and it was enough to see was that the tops were now being torn off the waves whiteveined on their leeward sides and that the seas were breaking clear across the foredeck of the morning rose the white and icy spume hissing into the sea on the starboard a night for carpet slippers and the fireside i turned foreword towards the accommodation door and bumped into someone who was standing behind the ladder and holding on to it for support i couldnt see the persons face for it was totally obscured by windblown hair but i didnt have to there was only one person aboard with those long strawcoloured tresses and that was mary dear given my choice of people to bump into on the morning rose id have picked mary dear any time mary dear not mary dear id given her that name to distinguish her from gerrans continuity girl whose given name was mary darling mary dear was really mary stuart but that wasnt her true name either llona wisniowecki shed been christened but had prudently decided that it wasnt the biggest possible asset she had for making her way in the film world why shed chosen a scots name i didnt know maybe she just liked the sound of it mary dear i said abroad at this late hour and on such a night i reached up and touched her cheek we doctors can get away with murder the skin was icily cold you can carry this fresh air fanatic bit too far come on inside i took her armi was hardly surprised to find she was shivering quite violentlyand she came along docilely enough the accommodation door led straight into the passenger lounge which though fairly narrow ran the full width of the ship at the far end was a builtin bar with the liquor kept behind two glassedin iron grill doors the doors were kept permanently locked and the key was in otto gerrans pocket no need to frogmarch me doctor she habitually spoke in a lowpitched quiet voice enough is enough and i was coming in anyway why were you out there in the first place cant doctors always tell she touched the middle button of her black leather coat and from this i understood that her internal economy wasnt taking too kindly to the rollercoaster antics of the morning rose but i also understood that even had the sea been mirrorsmooth shed still have been out on that freezing upper deck she didnt talk much to the others nor the others to her she pushed the tangled hair back from her face and i could see she was very pale and the skin beneath the brown eyes tinged with the beginnings of exhaustion in her high cheekboned slavonic wayshe was a latvian but i supposed no less a slav for thatshe was very lovely a fact that was freely admitted and slightingly commented upon as being her only asset her last two picturesher only two pictureswere said to have been disasters of the first magnitude she was a silent girl cool and aloofly remote and i liked her which made me a lonely minority of one doctors arent infallible i said at least not this one i peered at her in my best clinical fashion whats a girl like you doing in those parts on this floating museum she hesitated thats a personal question the medical profession are a very personal lot hows your headache your ulcer your bursitis we dont know where to stop i need the money you and me both i smiled at her and she didnt smile back so i left her and went down the companionway to the main deck here was located the morning roses main passenger accommodation two rows of cabins lining the fore and aft central passageway this had been the area of the former fishholds and although the place had been steamwashed fumigated and disinfected at the time of conversion it still stank most powerfully and evilly of cod liver oil that has lain too long in the sun in ordinary circumstances the atmosphere was nauseating enough in those extraordinary ones it was hardly calculated to assist sufferers in a rapid recovery from the effects of seasickness i knocked on the first door on the starboard side and went in johann heissman horizontally immobile on his bunk looked like a cross between a warrior taking his rest and a medieval bishop modelling for the stone effigy which in the fullness of time would adorn the top of his sarcophagus indeed with his thin waxy fingers steepled on his narrow chest his thin waxy nose pointing to the ceiling and his curiously transparent eyelids closed the image of the tomb seemed particularly apposite in this case but it was a deceptive image for a man does not survive twenty years in a soviet hard labour camp in eastern siberia just to turn in his cards from mal de mier how do you feel mr heissman oh god he opened his eyes without looking at me moaned and closed them again how do i feel im sorry but mr gerran is concerned otto gerran is a raving madman i didnt take it as any indication of some sudden upsurge in his physical condition but no question this time his voice was a great deal stronger crackpot a lunatic while privately conceding that heissmans diagnosis lay somewhere along the right lines i refrained from comment and not out of some suitably due deference to my employer otto gerran and johann heissman had been friends much too long for me to risk treading upon the delicate ground that well might lie between them they had known each other as far as i had been able to discover since they had been students together at some obscure danubian gymnasium close on forty years ago and had at the time of the anschluss in been the joint owners of a relatively prosperous film studio in vienna it was at this point in space and time that they had parted company suddenly drastically and it seemed at the time permanently for while gerrans sure instinct had guided his fleeing footsteps to hollywood heissman had unfortunately taken off in the wrong direction altogether and only three years previously to the total disbelief of all who had known him and believed him dead for a quarter of a century had incredibly surfaced from the bitter depths of his long siberian winter he had sought out gerran and now it appeared that their friendship was as close as ever it had been it was assumed that gerran knew about the hows and the whys of heissmans lost years and if this were indeed the case then he was the only man who did so for heissman understandably enough never discussed his past only two things about the men were known for certainthat it was heissman who had a dozen prewar screenplays to his credit who was the moving spirit behind this venture to the arctic and that gerran had taken him into full partnership in his company olympus productions in light of this it behooved me to step warily and keep my comments on heissmans comments strictly to myself if theres anything you require mr heissman i require nothing he opened his transparent eyelids again and this time lookedor glaredat me eyes of washedout grey streaked with blood save your treatment for that cretin gerran treatment brain surgery he lowered his eyelids wearily and went back to being a medieval bishop again so i left him and went next door there were two men in this cabin one clearly suffering quite badly the other equally clearly not suffering in the slightest neal divine the unit director had adopted a deaths door resignation attitude that was strikingly similar to that favoured by heissman and although he wasnt even within hailing distance of deaths door he was plainly very seasick indeed he looked at me forced a pale smile that was half apology half recognition then looked away again i felt sorry for him as he lay there but then id felt sorry for him ever since hed stepped aboard the morning rose a man dedicated to his craft lean hollowchecked nervous and perpetually balanced on what seemed to be the knife edge of agonising decisions he walked softly and talked softly as if he were perpetually afraid that the gods might hear him it could have been a meaningless mannerism but i didnt think so no question he walked in perpetual fear of gerran who was at no pains to conceal the fact that he despised him as a man just as much as he admired him as an artist why gerran a man of indisputably high intelligence should behave in this way i didnt know perhaps he was one of that far from small group of people who harbour such an inexhaustible fund of ill will towards mankind in general that they lose no opportunity to vent some of it on the weak the pliant or those who are in no position to retaliate perhaps it was a personal matter i didnt know either man or their respective backgrounds well enough to form a valid judgement ah tis the good healer a gravelly voice said behind me i turned round without haste and looked at the pyjamaclad figure sitting up in his bunk holding fast with his left hand to a bulkhead strap while with the other he clung equally firmly to the neck of a scotch bottle three parts empty up the ship comes and down the ship goes but naught will come between the kindly shepherd and his mission of mercy to his queasy flock you will join me in a postprandial snifter my good man later lonnie later lonnie gilbert knew and i knew and we both knew that the other knew that later would be too late three inches of scotch in lonnies hands had as much hope as the last meringue at the vicars tea party but the conventions had been observed honour satisfied you werent at dinner so i thought dinner he paused examined the word hed just said for inflexion and intonation decided his delivery had been lacking in a proper contempt and repeated himself dinner not the hogwash itself which i suppose is palatable enough for those who lack my esoteric tastes its the hour at which its served barbaric even attila the hun you mean you no sooner pour your aperitif than the bell goes exactly what does a man do coming from our elderly production manager the question was purely rhetorical despite the babyclear blue eyes and faultless enunciation lonnie hadnt been sober since hed stepped aboard the morning rose it was widely questioned whether hed been sober for years nobody least of all lonnieseemed to care about this but this was not because nobody cared about lonnie nearly all people did in greater or lesser degrees dependent on their own natures lonnie growing old now with all his life in films was possessed of a rare talent that had never bloomed and never would now for he was cursedor blessedwith insufficient drive and ruthlessness to take him to the top and mankind for a not always laudable diversity of reasons tends to cherish its failures and lonnie it was said never spoke ill of others and this too deepened the affection in which he was held except by the minority who habitually spoke ill of everyone its not a problem id care to be faced with myself i said how are you feeling me he inclined his bald pate fortyfive degrees backwards tilted the bottle lowered it and wiped a few drops of the elixir from his grey beard never been ill in my life who ever heard of a pickled onion going sour he cocked his head sideways ah ah what he was listening that i could see but i couldnt hear a damned thing except the crash of bows against seas and the metallic drumming vibration of the ancient steel hull which accompanied each downwards plunge the horns of elfland faintly blowing lonnie said hark the herald angels i harked and this time i heard id heard it many times and with steadily increasing horror since boarding the morning rose a screechingly cacophonous racket that was fit for heralding nothing short of armageddon the three perpetrators of this boilerhouse bedlam of sound josh hendrikss young sound crew assistants might not have been tone stone deaf but their classical musical education could hardly be regarded as complete as not one of them could read a note of music john luke and mark were all cast in the same contemporary mould with flowing shoulderlength hair and wearing clothes that gave rise to the suspicion that they must have broken into a gurus laundry all their spare time was spent with recording equipment guitar drums and xylophone in the foreword recreation room where they rehearsed apparently night and day against the moment of their big breakthrough into the poprecord world where they intended appropriately enough to bill themselves as the three apostles they might have spared the passengers on a night like this i said you underestimate our immortal trio my dear boy the fact that you may be one of the most excruciating musicians in existence does not prevent you from having a heart of gold they have invited the passengers along to hear them perform in the hope that this might alleviate their sufferings he closed his eyes as a raucous bellow overlaid with a highpitched scream as of some animal in pain echoed down the passageway outside the concert seems to have begun you cant fault their psychology i said after that an arctic gale is going to seem like a summer afternoon on the thames you do them an injustice lonnie lowered the level in the bottle by another inch then slid down into his bunk to show that the audience was over go and see for yourself so i went and saw for myself and i had been doing them an injustice the three apostles surrounded by that plethora of microphones amplifiers speakers and arcane electronic equipment without which the latterday troubadors will notand more importantly cannotoperate were performing on a low platform in one corner of the recreation room and maintaining their balance with remarkable ease largely it seemed because their bodily gyrations and contortions as inseparable a part of their art as the electronic aids seemed to synchronise rather well with the pitching and rolling of the morning rose rather conservatively if oddly clad in blue jeans and psychedelic kaftans and bent over their microphones in an attitude of almost acolytic fervour the three young sound assistants were giving of their uninhibited best and from what little could be seen of the ecstatic expressions on faces eighty percent concealed at any given moment by wildly swinging manes of hair it was plain that they thought that their best approximated very closely to the sublime i wondered briefly how angels would look with earplugs then turned my attention to the audience there were fifteen in all ten members of the production crew and five of the cast a round dozen of them very clearly the worse for the wear but their sufferings were being temporarily held in abeyance by the fascination which stopped a long way short of rapture induced by the three apostles who had now reached a musical crescendo accompanied by what seemed to be some advanced form of st vituss dance a hand touched me on the shoulder and i looked sideways at charles conrad conrad was thirty years old and was to be the male lead in the film not yet a bigname star but building up an impressive international reputation he was cheerful ruggedly handsome with a thatch of thick brown hair that kept falling over his eyes he had eyes of the bluest blue and most gleamingly white perfect teethlike his name his ownthat would have transported a dentist into ecstasies or the depths of despair depending upon whether he was primarily interested in the aesthetic or economic aspects of his profession he was invariably friendly courteous and considerate whether by instinct or calculated design it was impossible to say he cupped his hand to my ear nodded towards the performers your contract specifies hair shirts no why does yours solidarity of the working classes he smiled looked at me with an oddly speculative glint in his eyes letting the opera buffs down arent you theyll recover anyway i always tell my patients that a change is as good as a rest the music ceased abruptly and i lowered my voice about fifty decibels mind you this is carrying it too far fact is im on duty mr gerran is a bit concerned about you all he wants his herd delivered to the cattle market in prime condition well i suppose you all represent a pretty considerable investment to him investment ha do you know that that twisted old skinflint of a beer barrel has not only got us at firesale prices but also wont pay us a penny until shootings over no i didnt i paused we live in a democracy mr conrad the land of the free you dont have to sell yourselves in the slave market dont we just what do you know about the film industry nothing obviously its in the most depressed state in its history eighty percent of the technicians and actors unemployed id rather work for pennies than starve he scowled then his natural good humour reasserted itself tell him that his prop and stay that indomitable leading man charles conrad is fit and well not happy mind you just fit and well to be happy id have to see him fall over the side ill tell him all of that i looked around the room the three apostles mercifully were refreshing themselves with ginger ale most of the audience were likewise refreshing themselves though clearly in need of something stronger than ginger ale i said to conrad this little lot will get to market instant mass diagnosis it takes practice it also saves time whos missing well he glanced around theres heissman ive seen him and neal divine and lonnie and mary stuartnot that id expect her to be here anyway our beautiful but snooty young slav eh ill go halfway with that you dont have to be snooty to avoid people i like her too i looked at him id only spoken to him twice briefly i could see he meant what he said he sighed i wish she were my leading lady instead of our resident mata hari you cant be referring to the delectable miss haynes i can and i am he said moodily femmes fatales wear me out youll observe shes not among those present ill bet shes in bed with those two damned floppycared hounds of hers all of them having the vapours and high on smelling salts who else is missing antonio he was smiling again according to the counthes his cabinmateantonio is in extremis and unlikely to see the night out he did leave the dining room in rather a hurry i left conrad and joined the count at his table the count with a lean aquiline face black pencil moustache barstraight black eyebrows and greying hair brushed straight back from his forehead appeared to be in more than tolerable health he held a very large measure of brandy in his hand and i did not have to ask to know that it would be the very best cognac obtainable for the count was a renowned connoisseur of everything from blondes to caviare as precisely demanding a perfectionist in the pursuit of the luxuries of life as he was in the performance of his duties which may have helped to make him what he was the best lighting cameraman in the country and probably in europe nor did i have to wonder where he had obtained the cognac from rumour had it that he had known otto gerran a very long time indeed or at least long enough to bring his own private supplies along with him whenever otto went on safari count tadeusz leszczynskiwhich nobody ever called him because they couldnt pronounce ithad learned a great deal about life since he had parted with his huge polish estates precipitately and forever in midseptember evening count i said at least you look fit enough tadeusz to my peers in robust health im glad to say i take the properly prophylactic precautions he touched the barely perceptible bulge in his jacket you will join me in some prophylaxis your penicillins and aureomycins are but witches brews for the credulous i shook my head duty rounds im afraid mr gerran wants to know just how ill this weather is making people ah our otto himself is fit reasonably one cant have everything conrad tells me that your roommate antonio may require a visit what antonio requires is a gag a strait jacket and a nursemaid in that order rolling around sick all over the floor groaning like some miscreant stretched out on the rack the count wrinkled a fastidious nose most upsetting most i can well imagine it for a man of delicate sensibilities you understand of course i simply had to leave yes ill have a look at him id just pushed my chair back to the limit of its securing chain when michael stryker sat down in a chair beside me stryker a full partner in olympus productions combined the two jobs normally separate of production designer and construction manager gerran never lost the opportunity to economise he was a tall dark and undeniably handsome man with a clipped moustache and could readily have been mistaken for a matinee idol of the mid s were it not for the fashionably long and untidy hair that obscured about ninety percent of the polonecked silk sweater which he habitually affected he looked tough was unquestionably cynical and from what little i had heard of him totally amoral he was also possessed of the dubious distinction of being gerrans soninlaw seldom we see you abroad at this late hour doctor he said he screwed a long black russian cigarette into an onyx holder with all the care of a precision engineer fitting the tappets on a rollsroyce engine then held it up to the light to inspect the results kind of you to join the masses esprit de corps and what have you he lit his cigarette blew a cloud of noxious smoke across the table and looked at me consideringly on second thoughts no youre not the esprit de corps type we more or less have to be you dont i dont think you could too cool too detached too clinical too observantand a loner right its a pretty fair description of a doctor here in an official capacity eh i suppose so ill wager that old goat sent you mr gerran sent me it was becoming increasingly apparent to me that otto gerrans senior associates were unlikely ever to clamour for the privilege of voting him into the hall of fame thats the old goat i mean stryker looked thoughtfully at the count a strange and unwonted solicitude on the part of our otto wouldnt you say tadeusz i wonder what lies behind it the count produced a chased silver flask poured himself another generous measure of cognac smiled and said nothing i said nothing either because id already decided that i knew the answer to that one even later on in retrospect i could not and did not blame myself for i had arrived at a conclusion on the basis of the only facts then available to me i said to stryker miss haynes is not here is she all right no im afraid shes no sailor shes pretty much under the weather but whats a man to do shes pleading for sedatives or sleeping drugs and asking that i send for you but of course i had to say no why my dear chap shes been living on drugs ever since we came aboard this damned hell ship it was as well for his health i thought that captain imrie and mr stokes werent sitting at the same table her own seasick tablets one moment the ones you doled out the next pep pills in between and barbiturates for dessert well you know what would happen if she took sedatives or more drugs on top of that lot no i dont tell me eh does she drink heavily i mean drink no i mean she never touches the stuff i sighed why dont cobblers stick to their own lasts ill leave films to you you leave medicine to me any first year medical student could tell youwell never mind does she know what kind of tablets shes taken today and how manynot that it could have been all that many or shed have been unconscious by now i should imagine so i pushed back my chair shell be asleep in fifteen minutes are you sure i mean which is her room first on the right in the passageway and yours i asked the count first left i nodded rose left knocked on the first door on the right and went inside in response to a barely heard murmur judith haynes was sitting propped up in her bed with as conrad had predicted a dog on either side of hertwo rather beautiful and beautifully groomed cocker spaniels i could not however catch any trace of smelling salts she blinked at me with her rather splendid green eyes and gave me a wan smile at once tremulous and brave my heart stayed where it was it was kind of you to come doctor she had one of those dark molasses voices as effective at close personal quarters as it was in a darkened cinema she was wearing a pink quilted bedjacket which clashed violently with the colour of her hair and high round her deck a green chiffon scarf which didnt her face was alabaster white michael said you couldnt help mr stryker was being overcautious i sat down on the edge of the mattress and took her wrist the cocker spaniel next me growled deep in its throat and bared its teeth if that dog bites me ill clobber it rufus wouldnt harm a fly would you rufus darling it wasnt flies i was worried about but i kept silence and she went on with a sad smile are you allergic to dogs dr marlowe im allergic to dog bites the smile faded until her face was just sad i knew nothing about judith haynes except what id heard at secondhand and as all id heard had been from her colleagues in the industry i heavily discounted about ninety percent of what had been told me the only thing i had so far learnt with any certainty about the film world was that backbiting hypocrisy doubledealing innuendo and character assassination formed so integral a part of its conversational fabric that it was quite impossible to know where the truth ended and falsehood began the only safe guide id discovered was to assume that the truth ended almost immediately miss haynes it was said claimed to be twentyfour and had been on the best authority for the past fourteen years this it was said darkly explained her predilection for chiffon scarves for it was there that the missing years showed equally she may just have liked chiffon scarves with equal authority it was stated that she was a complete bitch her only redeeming quality being her total devotion to her two cocker spaniels and even this backhanded compliment was qualified by the observation that as a human being she had to have something or somebody to love something or somebody to return her affection she had tried cats it was said but that hadnt worked the cats apparently didnt love her back but one thing was indisputable tall slender with wonderful titian hair and classically beautiful in the sculptured greek fashion miss haynes it was universally conceded couldnt act for toffee nonetheless she was a very hot box office attraction indeed the combination of the wistfully regal expression which was her trademark and the startling contrast of her lurid private life saw to that nor was her career in any way noticeably hindered by the facts that she was the daughter of otto gerran whom she was said to despise the wife of michael stryker whom she was said to hate and a full partner in the olympus productions company there was nothing much wrong with her physical condition that i could see i asked her how many tablets of various kinds she had consumed in the course of the day and after dithering about helplessly for a bit and totting up the score with the shapely and tapering forefinger of her right hand on the shapely and tapering fingers of her leftshe was alleged to be able to add up pounds and dollars with the speed and accuracy of an ibm computershe gave me some approximate figures and in return i gave her some tablets with instructions as to how many and when to take them then left i didnt prescribe any sedatives for the dogsthey looked okay to me the cabin occupied by the count and antonio was directly opposite across the passageway i knocked twice without reply went inside and saw why there had been no reply antonio was there all right but i could have knocked until doomsday and antonio would not have heard me for antonio would never hear anything again from the via veneto via mayfair to die so squalidly in the barents sea for the gay and laughing antonio there could never have been a right or proper or suitable place to die for if ever id met a man in love with life it had been antonio and for this cosseted creature of the sybaritic salons of the capitals of europe to die in those bleak and indescribably bitter surroundings was so incongruous as to be shocking so unreal as to momentarily suspend both belief and comprehension but there he was just there lying there at my feet very real very dead the cabin was full of the soursweet smell of sickness and there was physical evidence of that sickness everywhere antonio lay not on his bunk but on the carpeted deck beside it his head arched impossibly far back until it was at right angles to his body there was blood a great deal of blood not yet congealed on his mouth and on the floor by his mouth the body was contorted into an almost impossible position arms and legs outflung at grotesque angles the knuckles showing ivory rolling around the count had said sick a man on the rack and he hadnt been so far out at that for antonio had died as a man on the rack dies in agony surely to god he must have cried out even although his throat would have been blocked most of the time he must have screamed he must have he would have been unable to prevent himself but with the three apostles in full cry his cries would have gone unheeded and then i remembered the scream i had heard when id been talking to lonnie gilbert in his cabin and i could feel the hairs prickling on the back of my neck i should have known the difference between the highpitched yowling of a rock singer and the scream of a man dying in torment i knelt made a cursory examination finding out no more in the process than any layman would have done closed the staring eyes and then with the advent of rigor mortis in mind straightened out the contorted limbs with an ease that i found vaguely surprising then i left the cabin locked the door and hesitated for only a moment before dropping the key in my pocket if the count were possessed of the delicate sensibilities he claimed hed be glad id taken the key with me dead otto gerrans puce complexion had deepened to a shade where i could have sworn it was overlaid with indigo dead did you say thats what i said otto and i were alone in the dining saloon it was ten oclock now and at ninethirty sharp captain imrie and mr stokes invariably left for their cabins where they would remain incommunicado for the next ten hours i lifted from ottos table a bottle of raw firewater on which someone had unblushingly stuck a label claiming that the contents was brandy took it to the stewards pantry returned with a bottle of hine and sat down it said much for ottos unquestioned state of shock that not only had he not appeared to note my brief absence he even stared directly at me unblinkingly and im sure unseeingly as i poured out two fingers for myself he registered no reaction whatsoever only something pretty close to a state of total shock could have held ottos parsimonious nature in check and i wondered what the source of this shock might be true the news of the death of anyone you know can come as a shock but it comes as a numbing shock only when the nearest and dearest are involved and if otto had even a measurable amount of affection for any one far less for the unfortunate antonio he concealed it with great skill perhaps he was as many are superstitious about death at sea perhaps he was concerned with the adverse effect it might have on cast and crew maybe he was bleakly wondering where in the immensity of the barents sea he could lay hands on a makeup artist hairdresser and wardrobe man for otto in the sacred name of economy had combined all three normally separate jobs in the person of one man the late antonio with a visibly conscious effort of will power he looked away from the hine bottle and focussed his eyes on me how can he be dead his hearts stopped his breathings stopped thats how he can be dead thats how anyone can be dead otto reached out for the bottle of hine and splashed some brandy into a glass he didnt pour it he literally splashed it the spreading stain on the white tablecloth as big as my hand his own hand was shaking as badly as that he poured out three fingers as compared to my two which may not sound so very much more but then otto was using a balloon glass whereas mine was a tulip tremblingly he lifted the glass to his mouth and half of its contents disappeared in one gulp most of it down his throat but a fair proportion on his shirt front it occurred to me not for the first time that if ever i found myself in a situation where all seemed lost and the only faint hope of life depended on having one good man and true standing by my right shoulder the name of otto gerran was not one that would leap automatically to my mind how did he die the brandy had done some good ottos voice was low just above a whisper but it was steady in agony i would say if you mean why did he die i dont know you dont know youyoure supposed to be a doctor otto was having the greatest difficulty in remaining in his seat with one hand clutching the brandy glass the other was barely sufficient to anchor his massive weight against the wild plunging of the morning rose i said nothing so he went on was it seasickness could that have done it he was seasick all right but you said a man doesnt die just from that he didnt die just from that an ulcerated stomach you said or heart or asthma he was poisoned otto stared at me for a moment his face registering no comprehension then he set his glass on the table and pushed himself abruptly to his feel no mean accomplishment for a man of his bulk the trawler rolled wickedly i leaned quickly forward snatched up ottos glass just as it began to topple and at the same moment otto lurched to one side and staggered across to the starboardthe leedoor of the saloon leading to the upper deck he flung this open and even above the shrieking of the wind and the crash of the seas i could hear him being violently sick presently he reentered closed the door staggered across the deck and collapsed into his chair his face was ashen i handed him his glass and he drained the contents reached out for the bottle and refilled his glass he drank some more and stared at me poison looked like strychnine had all strychnine strychnine great god strychnine youyoull have to carry out a postmortem anan autopsy dont talk rubbish ill carry out no such thing and for a number of excellent reasons for one thing have you any idea what an autopsy is likeits a very messy business indeed i can assure you i havent the facilities im not a specialist in pathologyand you require one for an autopsy you require the consent of the next of kinand how are you going to get that in the middle of the barents sea you require a coroners orderno coroner besides a coroner only issues an order where theirs a suspicion of foul play no such suspicion exists here nono foul play but you said i said it looked like strychnine i didnt say it was strychnine im sure its not he seemed to show the classical symptoms of having had tetanic spasms and opisthotonosthats when the back arches so violently that the body rests on the head and the heels onlyand his face showed pure terror theres nearly always this conviction of impending death at the onset of strychnine poisoning but when i straightened him out there were no signs of tetanic contractions besides the timing is all wrong strychnine usually shows its first effects within ten minutes and half an hour after taking the stuff youre gone antonio was at least twenty minutes here with us at dinner and there was nothing wrong with him thenwell seasickness thats all and he died only minutes agofar too long besides who on earth would want to do away with a harmless boy like antonio do you have in your employ a raving psycho who kills just for the kicks of it does it make any kind of sense to you no no it doesnt butbut poison you said food poisoning food poisoning but people dont die of food poisoning you mean ptomaine poisoning i mean no such thing for there is no such thing you can eat ptomaines to your hearts content and youll come to no harm but you can get all sorts of food poisoningchemically contaminatedmercury in fish for instanceedible mushrooms that arent edible mushrooms edible mussels that arent edible musselsbut the nasty one is salmonella and that can kill believe me just at the end of the war one variety of it salmonella enteritidis laid low about thirty people in stokeontrent six of them died and theres an even nastier one called clostridium botulinum kind of halfcousin of botulinus a charming substance that is guaranteed to wipe out a city in a nightthe ministry of health makes it this clostridium secretes an exotoxina poisonwhich is probably the most powerful occurring in nature between the wars a party of tourists at loch maree in scotland had a picnic lunchsandwiches filled with potted duck paste eight of them had this all eight died there was no cure then there is no cure now must have been this or something like this that antonio ate i see i see he had some more brandy then looked up at me his eyes round good god dont you see what this means man were all at risk all of us this clostridium or whatever you call it could spread like wildfire rest easy its neither infectious nor contagious but the galley you think that hadnt occurred to me the source of infection cant be there if it were wed all he gonei assume that antoniobefore his appetite deserted him that washad the same as all of us i didnt pay any particular attention but i can find out probably from the people on either side of himim sure they were the count and cecil cecil cecil golightlyyour camera focus assistant or something like that ah the duke for some odd reason cecil a diminutive shrewd and chirpy little cockney sparrow was invariably known as the duke probably because it was so wildly unsuitable that little pig see anything he never lifts his eyes from the table but tadeuszwell now he doesnt miss much ill ask ill also check the galley the food store and the cold room not a chance in ten thousandi think well find that antonio had his own little supply of tinned delicaciesbut ill check anyway do you want me to see captain imrie for you captain imrie i was patient the master must be notified the death must be logged a death certificate must be issuednormally hed do it himself but not with a doctor aboardbut ill have to be authorised and hell have to make preparations for the funeral burial at sea tomorrow morning i should imagine he shuddered yes please please do that of course of course burial at sea i must go and see john at once and tell him about this awful thing by john i assumed he meant john cummings goin production accountant company accountant senior partner in olympus productions and widely recognised as being the financial controllerand so in many ways the virtual controllerof the company and then im going to bed yes yes to bed sounds terrible i know poor antonio lying down there but im dreadfully upset really dreadfully upset i couldnt fault him on that one id rarely seen a man look so unhappy i can bring a sedative to your cabin no no ill he all right unthinkingly almost he picked up the bottle of hine thrust it into one of the capacious pockets of his tentlike jacket and staggered from the saloon as far as insomnia was concerned otto clearly preferred homemade remedies to even the most modern pharmaceutical products i went to the starboard door opened it and looked out when smithy had said that the weather wasnt going to improve hed clearly been hedging his bets conditions were deteriorating and if i were any judge deteriorating quite rapidly the air temperature was now well below freezing and the first thin flakes of snow were driving by overhead almost parallel to the surface of the sea the waves were now no longer waves just moving masses of water capriciously tending it seemed in any and all directions but in the mass still bearing mainly easterly the morning rose was no longer just corkscrewing she was beginning to stagger falling into a bridgehigh trough with an explosive impact more than vaguely reminiscent of flat whiplike crack of a notsodistant naval gun then struggling and straining to right herself only to be struck by a following wall of water that smashed her over on her beam ends again i leaned farther outwards looked upwards and was vaguely puzzled by the dimly seen outline of the madly flapping flag on the foremast puzzled because it wasnt streaming out over the starboard side as it should have been but towards the starboard quarter this meant that the wind was moving round to the northeast and what this could portend i could not even guess i vaguely suspected that it wasnt anything good i went inside yanked the door closed with some effort made a silent prayer for the infinitely reassuring and competent presence of smithy on the bridge made my way to the stewards pantry again and helped myself to a bottle of black label otto having made off with the last of the brandythe drinkable brandy that is i took it across to the captains table sat in the captains chair poured myself a small measure and stuck the bottle in captain imries convenient wroughtiron stand i wondered why i hadnt told otto the truth i was a convincing liar i thought but not a compulsive one probably because otto struck me as being far from a stable character and with several more pegs of brandy inside him in addition to what he had already consumed he seemed less than the ideal confidant antonio hadnt died because hed taken or been given strychnine of that i was quite certain i was equally certain that he hadnt died from clostridium botulinum either the exotoxin from this particular anaerobe was quite as deadly as i had said but fortunately otto had been unaware that the incubation period was seldom less than four hours and in extreme cases had been known to be as long as fortyeightnot that the period of incubation delay made the final results any less fatal it was faintly possible that antonio might have scoffed say a tin of infected truffles or suchlike from his homeland in the course of the afternoon but in that case the symptoms would have been showing at the dinner table and apart from his odd chartreuse hue id observed nothing untoward it had to be some form of systemic poison but there were so many of them and i was a long way from being an expert on the subject nor was there any necessary question of foul play more people die from accidental poisoning than from the machinations of the illdisposed the lee door opened and two people came staggering into the room both young both bespectacled both with faces all but obscured by windblown hair they saw me hesitated looked at each other and made to leave but i waved them in and they came closing the door behind them they staggered across to my table sat down pushed the hair from their faces and i identified them as mary darling our continuity girl and allennobody knew whether he had another name or whether that was his first or second onethe clapperloader he was a very earnest youth who had recently been asked to leave his university he was an intelligent lad but easily bored intelligent but a bit short on wisdomhe regarded filmmaking as the most glamorous job on earth sorry to break in on you like this dr marlowe allen was very apologetic very respectful we had no ideato tell you the truth we were both looking for a place to sit down and now youve found a place im just leaving try some of mr gerrans excellent scotchyou both look as if you could do with a little they did indeed look very pale no thank you dr marlowe we dont drink mary darlingeveryone called her mary darlingwas cast in an even more earnest mould than allen and had a very prim voice to go with it she had very long straight almost platinum hair that fell any old how down her back and that clearly hadnt been submitted to the attentions of a hairdresser for years she must have broken antonios heart she wore a habitually severe expression enormous hornrimmed glasses no makeupnot even lipstickand had about her a businesslike competent nononsense icantakecareof myselfthankyou attitude that was so transparently false that no one had the heart to call her bluff no room at the inn i asked well mary darling said its not very private down in the recreation room is it as for those three youngyoung the three apostles do their best i said mildly surely the lounge was empty it was not allen tried to look disapproving but i thought his eyes crinkled there was a man there in his pyjamas mr gilbert he had a big bunch of keys in his hands mary darling paused pressed her lips together and went on he was trying to open the doors where mr gerran keeps all his bottles that sounds like lonnie i agreed it was none of my business if lonnie found the world so sad and so wanting there was nothing much i or anybody could do about it i just hoped that otto didnt catch him at it i said to mary you could always try your cabin oh no we couldnt do that no i suppose not i tried to think why not but i was too old i took my leave and passed through the stewards pantry into the galley it was small cowpact immaculately clean a minor culinary symphony in stainless steel and white tile at this late hour i had expected it to be deserted but it wasnt haggerty the chief cook with his regulation chefs hat foursquare on his greying clipped hair was bent over some pots on a stove he turned round looked at me in mild surprise evening dr marlowe he smiled carrying out a medical inspection of my kitchen with your permission yes he stopped smiling im afraid i do not understand sir he could be very stiff could haggerty twentyfiveodd years in the royal navy had left their mark im sorry just a formality we seem to have a case of food poisoning aboard im just looking around food poisoning not from this galley i can assure you never had a case in my life haggertys injured professional pride quite overcame any humanitarian concern he might have had about the identity of the victim or how severe his case was twentyseven years as a cook in the andrew dr marlowe last six as chief on a carrier and if im to be told i dont run a hygienic galley nobodys telling you anything of the sort i used to him the tone he used to me anyone can see the place is spotless if the contamination came from this galley it wont be your fault it didnt come from this galley haggerty had a square ruddy face and periwinkle blue eyes the complexion suffused with anger was now two shades deeper and the eyes hostile excuse me im busy he turned his back and started rattling his pots about i do not like people turning their backs on me when i am talking to them and my instinctive reaction was to make him face me again but i reflected that his pride had been wounded justifiably so from his point of view so i contented myself with the use of words working very late mr haggerty dinner for the bridge he said stiffly mr smith and the bosun they change watches at eleven and eat together then lets hope theyre both fit and well by twelve he turned round very slowly whats that supposed to mean i mean that whats happened once can happen again you know you havent expressed the slightest interest in the identity of the person whos been poisoned or how ill that person is i dont know what you mean sir i find it very peculiar especially as the person became violently ill just after eating food prepared in this galley i take orders from captain imrie he said obliquely not from passengers you know where the captain is at this time of night in bed and very very sound asleep its no secret wouldnt you like to come with me and see what youve done to look at this poisoned person it wasnt very nice of me but i didnt see what else i could do to see what ive done he turned away again deliberately placed his pots to one side and removed his chefs hat this had better be good doctor i led the way below to antonios cabin and unlocked the door the smell was revolting antonio lay as i had left him except that he looked a great deal more dead now than he had done before the blood had drained from face and hands leaving them a transparent white i turned to haggerty good enough haggertys face didnt turn white because ruddy faces with a mass of broken red veins dont turn that way but it did become a peculiar muddy brick colour he stared down at the dead man for perhaps ten seconds then turned away and walked quickly up the passage i locked the door and followed staggering from side to side of the passage as the morning rose rolled wickedly in the great troughs i made my erratic way through the dining saloon picked up the black label from captain imries wroughtiron stand smiled pleasantly at mary darling and allencod knows what thoughts were in their minds as i passed throughand returned to the galley haggerty joined me after thirty seconds he was looking ill and i knew he had been ill i had no doubt that he had seen a great deal during his lifetime at sea but there is something peculiarly horrifying about the sight of a man who has died violently from poisoning i poured him three fingers of scotch and he downed it at a gulp he coughed and either the coughing or the scotch brought some colour back to his face what was it his voice was husky whatwhat kind of poison could kill a man like that god ive never seen anything so awful i dont know thats what i want to find out may i look round now christ yes dont rub it in doctorwell i didnt know did i what do you want to see first its ten past eleven i said ten pastmy god id forgotten all about the bridge he prepared the bridge dinner with remarkable speed and efficiencytwo cans of orange juice a tin opener a flask of soup and then the main course in snaplidded metal canteens those he dumped in a wicker basket along with cutlery and two bottles of beer and the whole preparation took just over a minute while he was awaywhich wasnt for more than two minutesi examined what little open food supplies haggerty carried in his galley both on shelves and in a large refrigerator even had i been capable of it which i wasnt id no facilities aboard for analysing food so i had to rely on sight taste and smell there was nothing amiss that i could see as haggerty had said he ran a hygienic galley immaculate food in immaculate containers haggerty returned i said tonights menu again orange juice or pineapple juice oxtail all tinned he nodded lets see some i opened two tins of each six in all and sampled them under haggertys now very apprehensive eye they tasted the way those tinned products usually taste which is to say that they didnt taste of anything very much at all but all perfectly innocuous in their pallid fashion main course i said lamb chops brussels horseradish boiled potatoes right but these things arent kept here he took me to the adjacent cool room where the fruits and vegetables were stored thence below to the cold room where sides of beef and pork and mutton swung eerily from steel hooks in the harsh light of naked bulbs i found precisely what i had expected to find nothing told haggerty that whatever had happened was clearly no fault of his then made my way to the upper deck and along an interior passage till i came to captain imries cabin i tried the handle but it was locked i knocked several times without result i hammered it until my knuckles rebelled then kicked it all with the same result captain imrie had still about nine hours sleep coming up and the relatively feeble noises i was producing had no hope of penetrating to the profound depths of unconsciousness he had now reached i desisted smithy would know what to do i went to the galley now deserted by haggerty and passed through the pantry into the dining saloon mary darling and allen were setting on a bulkhead settee all four hands clasped together palevery palefaces about three inches apart gazing into each others eyes in a kind of mystically miserable enchantment it was axiomatic i knew that shipboard romances flourished more swiftly than those on land but i had thought those phenomena were confined to the bahamas and suchlike balmy climes aboard a trawler in a full gale in the arctic i should have thought that some of the romantically essential prerequisites were wholly absent or at least present in only minimal quantities i took captain imries chair poured myself a small drink and said cheers they straightened and jumped apart as if theyd been connected to electrodes and id just made the switch mary darling said reproachfully you did give us a fright dr marlowe im sorry anyway we were just leaving now im really sorry i looked at allen quite a change from university isnt it he smiled wanly there is a difference what were you studying there chemistry long three years well almost three years again the wan smile it took me all that time to find out i wasnt much good at it and youre now twentyone all the time in the world to find out what you are good at i was thirty three before i qualified as a doctor thirtythree he didnt say it but his face said it for him if he was that old when he qualified what unimaginable burden of years is he carrying now what did you do before then nothing id care to talk about tell me you two were at the captains table for dinner tonight werent you they nodded seated more or less opposite antonio werent you i think so allen said hat was a good start he just thought so hes not well im trying to find out if he ate something that disagreed with him something he may have been allergic to either of you see what he had to eat they looked at each other uncertainly chicken i said encouragingly perhaps some french fries im sorry dr marlowe mary darling said im afraidwell were not very observant no help from this quarter obviously they were so lost in each other that they couldnt even remember what they had eaten or perhaps they just hadnt eaten anything i hadnt noticed i hadnt been very observant myself but then i hadnt been expecting a murder to happen along they were on their feet now clinging to each other for support as the deck tried to vanish from beneath their feel i said if youre going below i wonder if youd ask tadeusz if hed be kind enough to come up and see me here hell be in the recreation room he might be in bed allen said asleep wherever he is i said with certainty hes not in bed tadeusz appeared within a minute reeking powerfully of brandy a vexed expression on his aristocratic features he said without preamble damned annoying most damned annoying do you know where i can find a master key that idiot antonio has gone and locked our cabin door from the inside and he must be hopped to the eyebrows with sedatives simply cant waken him cretin i produced his cabin key he didnt lock the door from the inside i did from the outside the count looked at me for an uncomprehending moment then mechanically reached for his flask as shocked understanding showed in his face not too much shock just a little but i was sure that what little there was was genuine he tilted the flask and two or three drops trickled into his glass he reached for the black label helped himself with a steady but generous hand and drank deeply he couldnt hear me heis beyond hearing im sorry something he ate i cant think what else some killer toxin some powerful quickacting and deadly poison quite dead i nodded quite dead he repeated and i told him to stop making such a grand opera latin fuss and walked away and left a dying man he drank some more scotch and grimaced an expression that was no reflection on johnnie walker there are advantages in being a lapsed catholic dr marlowe rubbish sackcloth and ashes not only dont help theyre simply just not called for here all right so you didnt suspect there was anything wrong with him i saw him at table and i wasnt any cleverer and im supposed to be a doctor and when you left him in the cabin it was too late anyway he was dying then i helped him to some more scotch but left my own glass untouched even one relatively sober mind around might prove to be of some help although just how i couldnt quite see at that moment you sat beside him at dinner can you remember what he ate the usual the count it was clear was more shaken than his aristocratic nature would allow him to admit mather he didnt cat the usual im not in the right frame of mind for riddles tadeusz grapefruit and sunflower seeds that was about what he lived on one of those vegetarian nuts walk softly tadeusz those nuts may yet be your pallbearers the count grimaced again a singularly illchosen remark antonio never ate meat and hed a thing against potatoes so all he had were the sprouts and horseradish i remember particularly well because cecil and i gave him our horseradish to which it seems he was particularly partial the count shuddered a barbarian food fit only for ignorant anglosaxon palates even young cecil has the grace to detest that offal it was noteworthy that the count was the only person in the film unit who did not refer to cecil golightly as the duke perhaps he thought he was being upstaged in the title stakes but more probably as a dyedinthe wool aristocrat himself he objected to people taking frivolous liberties with titles he had fruit juices antonio had his own homemade barley water the count smiled faintly it was his contention that everything that came out of a can had been adulterated before it went into that can very strict on those matters was antonio soup any of that oxtail of course anything else that he ate i mean he didnt even finish his main coursewell his sprouts and radish you may recall that he left very hurriedly i recall was he liable to seasickness i dont know dont forget ive known him no longer than yourself hes been a bit offcolour for the past two days but then who hasnt i was trying to think up another penetrating question when john cummings goin entered his unusual surname hed inherited from a french grandfather in the high savoy where apparently this was not an altogether uncommon name the film crew inevitably referred to him as comin and goin but goin was probably wholly unaware of this he was not the sort of man with whom one took liberties any other person entering the dining saloon from the main deck on a night like that would have presented an appearance that would have varied from the windblown to the dishevelled not one hair of goins black smooth centreparted brushedback hair was out of place had i been told that he eschewed the standard proprietary hairdressing creams in favour of cowhide glue i would have seen no reason to doubt it and the hair style was typical of the maneverything smooth calm unruffled and totally under control in one area only did the comparison fall down the hair style was slick but goin wasnt he was just plain clever he was of medium height plump without being fat with a smooth unlined face he was the only man id ever seen wearing pincenez and that only for the finest of fine print which in goins line of business came his way quite often the pincenez looked so inevitable that it was unthinkable that he should ever wear any other type of reading aid he was above all a civilised man and urbane in the best sense of the word he picked up a glass from a rack timed the wild staggering of the morning rose to walk quickly and surely to the scat on my right picked up the black label and said may l easy come easy go i said ive just stolen it from mr gerrans private supply confession noted he helped himself this makes me an accessory cheers i assume youve just come from mr gerran i said yes hes most upset sad sad about that poor young boy an unfortunate business thatas something else about goin he always got his priorities right the average company accountant confronted with the news of the death of a member of a team would immediately have wondered how the death would affect the project as a whole goin saw the human side of it first or i thought he spoke of it first i knew i was being unfair to him he went on i understand youve so far been unable to establish the cause of death diplomacy inevitably was second nature to goin he could so easily and truthfully have said that i just hadnt a clue so i said it for him i havent a clue youll never get to harley street talking that way poison thats certain but thats all thats certain i carry the usual seagoing medical library around with me but that isnt much help to identify a poison you must be able either to carry out a chemical analysis or observe the poison at work on the victimmost of the major poisons have symptoms peculiar to themselves and follow their own highly idiosyncratic courses but antonio was dead before i got to him and i lack the facilities to do any pathological work assuming i could do it in the first place youre destroying all my faith in the medical profession cyanide impossible antonio took time to die a couple of drops of hydrocyanic prussic acidor even a tiny quantity of pharmacopocial acid and thats only two percent of anhydrous prussic acidand youre dead before your glass hits the floor and cyanide makes it murder it always makes it murder theres no way i know of it can be administered by accident antonios death im certain was an accident goin helped himself to some more scotch what makes you so certain it was an accident what makes me so certain that was a difficult one to answer off the cuff owing to the fact that i was convinced it was no accident at all first there was no opportunity for the administering of poison we know that antonio was alone in his cabin all afternoon right until dinnertime i looked at the count did antonio have any private food supplies with him in his cabin how did you guess the count looked surprised im not guessing im eliminating he had two hampers full of glass jarsi think i mentioned that antonio would never eat anything out of a tinwith all sorts of weird vegetable products inside including dozens of baby food jars with all sorts of purees in them a very finicky eater was poor antonio so im beginning to gather i think our answer will lie there ill have captain imrie impound his supplies and have them analysed on our return to get back to the opportunity factor antonio came up to the dining saloon here had the same as the rest of us no fruit juices no soup no lamb chops no potatoes the count said none of those but what he did have we all had then straight back to his cabin in the second place who would want to kill a harmless person like thatespecially as antonio was a total stranger to all of us and only joined us at wick for the first time and who but a madman would administer a deadly poison in a closed community like this knowing that he couldnt escape and that scotland yard would be leaning over the quay walls in wick just waiting for our return maybe thats the way a madman would figure a sane person would figure goin said what english king was it who died of a surfeit of lampreys the count said if you ask me our unfortunate antonio may well have perished from a surfeit of horseradish like enough i pushed back my chair and made to rise but i didnt get up immediately way back in the dim and lost recesses of my mind the count had triggered off a tiny bell an infinitesimal tinkle so distant and remote that if i hadnt been listening with all my ears id have missed it completely but i had been listening the way people always listen when they know without knowing why that the old man with the scythe is standing there in the wings winding up for the back stroke i knew both men were watching me i sighed decisions decisions antonio has to be attended to with canvas goin said with canvas counts cabin cleaned up death has to be logged death certificate and mr smith will have to make the funeral arrangements mr smith the count was vaguely surprised not our worthy commanding officer captain imrie is in the arms of morpheus i said ive tried you have your deities mixed up goin said bacchus is the one youre after i suppose it is excuse me gentlemen i went directly to my cabin but not to write out any death certificate as id told goin i did carry a medical library of sorts around with me and it was of a fair size i selected several books including glaisterss medical jurisprudence and toxicology th edition dewars textbook of forensic pharmacy and gonzaless vances and helperns legal medicine and toxicology which seemed to be a prewar book i started consulting indices and within five minutes i had it the entry was listed under systemic poisons and was headed aconite bot a poisonous plant of the order ranunculaccae particular reference monkshood and wolfsbane phar aconitum napellus this and aconitine an alkaloid extract of the former is commonly regarded as the most lethal of all poisons yet identified a dose of not more than gm is deadly to man aconite and its alkaloid produce a burning and peculiar tingling and numbing effect where applied later especially with larger doses violent vomiting results followed by paralysis of motion paralysis of sensation and great depression of the heart followed by death from syncope treatment to be successful must be immediate as possible gastric lavage iz gm of tannic acid in two gallons of warm water followed by gm tannic acid in o ml tepid water this should be followed by animal charcoal suspended in water cardiac and respiratory stimulants artificial respiration and oxygen will be necessary as indicated nb the root of aconite has frequently been eaten in mistake for that of horseradish i was still looking at but no longer really reading the article on aconite when it was gradually borne in upon my preoccupation that there was something very far amiss with the morning rose she was still under way her elderly oilfired steam engines throbbing along as dependably as ever but her motion had changed her rolling factor had increased till she was swinging wickedly and dismayingly through an angle of close on seventy degrees the pitching factor had correspondingly decreased and the thudding jarring vibration of the bluff bows smashing into the quartering seas had fallen away to a fraction of what it had previously been i marked the article closed the book then lurched and stumbledi could not be said to have run for it was physically impossiblealong the passageway up the companionway through the lounge and out on to the upper deck it was dark but not so dark as to prevent me from gauging direction by the feel of the gale wind by the spume blowing off the top of the confused seas i shrank back and tightened my grip on a convenient handrail as a great wall of water black and veined and evil reared up on the port side just foreword of the beam it was at least ten feet higher than my head i was certain that the wave with the hundreds of tons of water it contained was going to crash down square on the foredeck of the trawler i couldnt see how it could fail to but fail it did as the wave bore down on us the trough to starboard deepened and the morning rose rolling over to almost forty degrees simply fell into it pressed down by the great weight of water on its exposed port side there came the familiar flat explosive thunderclap of sound the morning rose vibrated and groaned as overstressed plates and rivets adjusted to cope with the sudden shearing strain white icily cold water foamed over the starboard side and swirled around my ankles and then it was gone gurgling through the scuppers as the morning rose rig righted herself and rolled far over on its other side there was no worry about any of this no threat to safety and life this was what arctic trawlers had been built for and the morning rose could continue to absorb this punishment indefinitely but there was cause for worry if such a word can be used to express a desperately acute anxiety that massive wave which had caught the trawler on her port now had knocked her almost twenty degrees off course she was still twenty degrees off course and twenty degrees off course she remained nobody was making any attempt to bring her round another and a smaller sea and then she was lying five more degrees over to the cast and here too she remained i ran for the bridge ladder i bumped into and almost knocked down a person at the precise spot where id bumped into mary dear an hour ago contact this time was much more solid and the person said oof or something of that sort the kind of gasp a winded lady makes is quite different from a mans and instinct and a kind of instantaneous reasoning told me that i had bumped into the same person again judith haynes would be in bed with her spaniels and nary darling was either with allen or in bed dreaming about him neither anyway was the outdoor type i said something that might have been misconstrued as a brusque apology sidestepped and had my foot on the first rung when she caught my arm with both hands somethings wrong i know it is what her voice was calm just loud enough to make itself heard over the highpitched obbligato of the wind in the rigging sure she knew something was wrong the sight of dr marlowe moving at anything above his customary saunter was as good as a police or airraid siren any day i was about to say something to this effect when she added thats why i came on deck which effectively rendered stillborn any cutting remarks id been about to make because shed been aware of trouble before id been but then she hadnt had her thoughts taken up with aconitum napellus the ships not under command theres nobody in charge on the bridge nobody trying to keep a course can i do anything she was wonderful yes theres a hot water electric geyser on the galley bulkhead by the stove bring up a jug of hot water not too hot to drink a mug and salt lots of salt i sensed as much as saw her nod and then she was gone four seconds later i was inside the wheelhouse i could dimly see one figure crumpled against the chart table another apparently sitting straight by the wheel but that was all i could see the two overhead lights were dull yellow glows it took me almost fifteen frantic seconds to locate the instrument panel just foreword of the wheel but only a couple of seconds thereafter to locate the rheostat and twist it to its clockwise maximum i blinked in the hurtfully sudden wash of white light smithy was by the chart table oakley by the wheel the former on his side the latter upright but that i could see didnt mean that oakley was in any better state of health than the first mate it was just that neither appeared capable of moving from the positions they had adopted both had their heads arched towards their knees both had their hands clasped tightly to their midriffs neither of them was making any sound possibly neither was suffering pain and that the contracted positions they had assumed resulted from some wholly involuntary motor mechanism it was equally possible that their vocal cords were paralysed i looked at smithy first one life is as important as the next or so any one of a group of sufferers will think but in this case i was concerned with the greatest good of all concerned and the fact that the all here just coincidentally included me had no bearing on my choice if the morning rose was running into trouble and i had a strange fey conviction that it was smithy was the man i wanted around smithys eyes were open and the look in them intelligent among other things the aconite article had stated that full intelligence is maintained to the very end could this be the end paralysis of motion the article had said and paralysis of motion we undoubtedly had here then paralysis of sensationmaybe thats why they werent crying out in agony it could have been that they had been screaming their heads off up on the bridge here with no one around to hear them but now they werent feeling anything any more i saw and vaguely recorded the fact that there were two metal canteens lying close together on the floor both of them very nearly emptied of food both of them i would have thought were in extremis but for one very odd factor there was no sign of the violent vomiting of which the article had spoken i wished to god that somewhere sometime i had taken the trouble to learn something about poisons their causes their effects their symptoms and aberrant symptoms which we seemed to have hereif any mary stuart came in her clothes were soaking and her hair was in a terrible mess but shed been very quick and shed got what id asked her toincluding a spoon which id forgotten i said a mug of hot water six spoons of salt quick stir it well gastric lavage the book had said but as far as the availability of tannic acid and animal charcoal was concerned i might as well have been on the moon the best and indeed the only hope lay in a powerful and quickacting emetic alum and zinc sulphate was what the old boy in my medical school had preferred but id never come across anything better than sodium chloridecommon salt i hoped desperately that aconitine absorption into the bloodstream hadnt progressed too farand that it was aconitine i didnt for a moment doubt coincidence is coincidence but to introduce some such fancy concoction as curare at this stage would be stretching things a bit i levered smithy into a sitting position and was just getting my hands under his armpits when a darkhaired young seaman cladin that bitter weatherin only jersey and jeans came hurrying into the wheelhouse it was allison the senior of the two quartermasters he lookednot staredat the two men on the deck he was very much a seaman cast in smithys mould whats wrong doctor food poisoning had to be something like that i was asleep something woke me i knew something was wrong that we werent under command i believed him all experienced seamen have this inbuilt capacity to sense trouble even in their sleep id come across it before he moved quickly to the chart table then glanced at the compass fifty degrees off course to the east weve got all the barents sea to rattle about in i said give me a hand with mr smith will you we took an arm each and dragged him towards the port door mary dear stopped stirring the contents of the metal mug she held in her hand and looked at us in some perplexity where are you going with mr smith taking him out on the wing what did she think we were going to do with him throw him over the side all that fresh air its very therapeutic but its snowing out there and bitterly cold hes alsoi hopegoing to be very very sick better outside than in how does that concoction taste she sipped a little salt and water from her spoon and screwed up her face its awful can you swallow it she tried and shuddered just another three spoonswe dragged smithy outside and propped him in a sitting position the canvas winddodger gave him some protection but not much his eyes were open and following our actions and he seemed aware of what was going on i put the emetic to his lips and tilted the mug but the fluid just trickled down his chin i forced his head back and poured some of the emetic into his mouth clearly all sensation wasnt lost for his face contorted into an involuntary grimace of distaste more importantly his adams apple bobbed up and down and i knew hed swallowed some of it encouraged i poured in twice as much and this time he swallowed it all not ten seconds later he was as violently ill as ever ive seen a man be over marys protests and in spite of allisons very evident apprehension i forced some more of the salt and water on him when he started coughing blood i turned my attention to oakley within fifteen minutes we had two still very ill men on our hands clearly suffering violent abdominal pains and weak to the point of exhaustion but more importantly we had two men who werent going to go the same way as the unfortunate antonio had gone allison was at the wheel with the morning rose back on course mary dear her strawcoloured hair now matted with snow crouched beside a very groggy oakley smithy was now sufficiently recovered to sit on the storm sill of the wheelhouse though he still required my arm to brace him against the staggering of the morning rose he was beginning to recover the use of his voice although only to a minimal extent brandy he croaked i shook my head contraindicated thats what the textbooks say otarddupuy he insisted at least his mind was clear enough i rose and got him a bottle from captain imries private reserve after what his stomach had just been through nothing short of carbolic acid was going to damage it any more he put the bottle to his head swallowed and was immediately sick again maybe i should have given you cognac in the first place i said salt water comes cheaper though he tried to smile a brief and painful effort and tilted the bottle again this time the cognac stayed down he must have had a stomach lined with steel or asbestos i took the bottle from him and offered it to oakley who winced and shook his head whos got the wheel smithys voice was a hoarse and strained whisper as if it hurt him to speak which it almost certainly did allison he nodded satisfied damn boat he said damn sea damn sea im seasick me seasick youre sick all right nothing to do with the sea this damn boat wallowing about in this damn sea was all that saved you a flat calm and smithy was among the immortals i tried to think why anyone who was not completely unhinged should want smithy and oakley among the immortals but the idea was so preposterous that i abandoned it almost the moment it occurred to me food poisoning and i was lucky i got here in time he nodded but kept quiet it probably hurt him too much to talk mary dear said mr oakleys hands and face are freezing and hes shaking with the cold so am i for that matter and so i realised was i i helped smithy to a bolted chair beyond the wheel then went to assist mary dear who was trying to get a jellykneed oakley to his feel wed just got oakley approximately upright no easy task for he was practically a dead weight and we required one hand for him and one for ourselves when goin and the count appeared at the top of the ladder thank god at last goin was slightly out of breath but not one hair was out of place weve been looking for you everywhat on earthis that man drunk hes sick the same sickness as antonio had only hes been lucky whats the panic the same sicknessyou must come at once marlowe my god this is turning into a regular epidemic a moment i helped oakley inside and lowered him into as comfortable a position as possible atop some kapok life jackets another casualty i take it yes otto gerran maybe i lifted an eyebrow i forget i do know i felt no particular surprise it seemed to me that anyone who had been within sniffing distance of that damned aconite was liable to keel over at any moment i called at his cabin ten minutes ago there was no reply and i went in and there he was rolling about the carpet the irreverent thought came to me that with his almost perfectly spherical shape no one had ever been better equipped for rolling about a carpet than otto was it seemed unlikely that otto was seeing the humorous side of it at that moment i said to allison can you get anyone up here to help you no trouble the quartermaster nodded at the small exchange in the corner ive only to phone the mess deck no need it was the count ill stay thats very kind i nodded at smithy and oakley in turn theyre not fit to go below yet if they try to theyll like as not end up over the side could you get them some blankets of course he hesitated my cabin is locked mines not there are blankets on the bed and extra ones at the foot of the hanging locker the count left and i turned to allison short of dynamiting his door open how do i attract the captains attention he seems to be a sound sleeper allison smiled and again indicated the corner exchange the bridge phone hangs just above his head theres a resistance in the circuit i can make the callup sound like the qe s foghorn tell him to come along to mr gerrans room and tell him its urgent well allison was uncertain captain imrie doesnt much like being woken up in the middle of the night not without an awfully good reason that is and now that the mate and bosun are all right again like tell him antonio is dead at least otto wasnt dead even above the sound of the wind and the sound of the sea the creakings and groanings as the elderly trawler slammed her way into the arctic gale ottos voice could be distinctly heard at least a dozen feet from his cabin door what he was saying however was far from distinct the tearing gasps and agonised groans boded ill for what we would see when we opened the door otto gerran looked as he sounded not quite in extremis but rapidly heading that way as goin had said he was indeed rolling about the floor both hands clutching his throat as if he was trying to throttle himself his normally puce complexion had deepened to a dark and dangerous looking purple his eyes were bloodshot and a purplish foam at his mouth had stained his lips to almost the same colour as his face or maybe his lips were purplish anyway like a man with cyanosis as far as i could see he hadnt a single symptom in common with smithy and oakley so much for the toxicological experts and their learned textbooks i said to goin lets get him on his feet and along to the bathroom as a statement of intent it was clear and simple enough but its execution was far from simple it was impossible the task of hoisting lbs of uncooperative jellyfish to the vertical proved to be quite beyond us i was just about to abandon the attempt and administer what would certainly be a very messy first aid on the spot when captain imrie and mr stokes entered the cabin my surprise at the remarkable promptness with which they had put in an appearance was as nothing compared to my initial astonishment at observing that both men were fully dressed it was not until i noticed the horizontal creases in their trousers that i realised that they had gone to sleep with all their clothes on i made a brief prayer for smithys swift and complete recovery what in the name of god goes on whatever condition captain imrie had been in an hour or so ago he was completely sober now allison says that italian fellows dead and he stopped abruptly as goin and i moved sufficiently apart to let him have his first glimpse of the prostrate moaning gerran jesus wept he moved forward and stared down what the devilan epileptic fit poison the same poison that killed antonio and nearly killed the mate and oakley come on give us a hand to get him along to the bathroom poison he looked at mr stokes as if to hear from him confirmation that it couldnt possibly be poison but mr stokes wasnt in the mood for confirming anything he just stared with a kind of numbed fascination at the writhing man on the floor poison on my ship what poison where did they get it who gave it to them why should im a doctor not a detective i dont know anything about who where when why what all i know is that a mans dying while were talking it took the four of us less than thirty seconds to get otto gerran along to the bathroom it was a pretty rough piece of manhandling but it was a fair assumption that he would rather be otto gerran bruised but alive than otto gerran unmarked but dead the emetic worked just as swiftly and effectively as it had with smithy and oakley and within three minutes we had him back in his bunk under a mound of blankets he was still moaning incoherently and shivering so violently that his teeth chattered uncontrollably but the deep purple had begun to recede from his cheeks and the foam had dried on his lips i think hes ok now but please keep an eye on him will you i said to goin ill be back in five minutes captain imrie stopped me at the door if you please dr marlowe a word with you later now as master of this vessel i put a hand on his shoulder and he became silent i felt like saying that as master of this vessel hed been awash in scotch and snoring in his bunk when people were all around dropping like flies but it would have been less than fair i was irritable because unpleasant things were happening that should not have been happening and i didnt know why or who was responsible otto gerran will live i said hell live because he was lucky enough to have mr goin here stop by his cabin how many other people are lying on their cabin floors who havent been lucky enough to have someone stop by people so far gone that they cant even reach their doors four casualties so far whos to say there isnt a dozen a dozen aye aye of course if i was out of my depth captain imrie was submerged well come with you i can manage like you managed with mr gerran here we made our way directly to the recreation room there were ten people there all men mostly silent mostly unhappy it is not easy to be talkative and cheerful when youre hanging on to your scat with one hand and your drink with the other the three apostles whether because of exhaustion or popular demand had laid the tools of their trade aside and were having a drink with their boss josh hendriks a small thin stern and middleaged anglodutchman with a perpetual worried frown even when offduty he was festooned with a mass of straphung electronic and recording equipment word had it that he slept so accoutred stryker who appeared far from overcome by concern for his ailing wife sat at a table in a corner talking to conrad and two other actors gunther jungbeck and jon heyter at a third table john halliday the stills photographer and sandy the props man made up the company no one as far as i could judge was suffering from anything that couldnt be accounted for by the big dipper antics of the morning rose one or two glances of mildly speculative curiosity came our way but i volunteered no explanation for our unaccustomed visit there explanations take time but the effects of aconitine as was being relentlessly borne in upon me waited for no man allen and mary darling we found in the otherwise deserted lounge more greenfaced than ever but clasping hands and gazing at each other with the rapt intensity of those who know there will be no tomorrow their noses were so close together that they must have been crosseyed from their attempts to focus for the first time since id met her mary darling had removed her enormous spectaclesmisted lenses due to allens heavy breathing i had no doubtand without them she really was a very pretty young girl with none of that rather naked and defenceless look that so often characterises the habitual wearer of glasses when those are removed one thing was for sure there was nothing wrong with allens eyesight i glanced at the liquor cupboard in the corner the glassfronted doors were intact from which i assumed that lonnie gilberts bunch of keys were capable of opening most things had they failed here i would have looked for signs of the use of some other instrument not perhaps the berserk wielding of a fire axe but at least the discreet employment of a wood chisel but there were no such signs heissman was asleep in his cabin uneasily restlessly asleep but clearly not ill next door neal divine his bedboard raised so high that he was barely visible looked more like a medieval bishop than ever but a happily unconscious one this time lonnie was sitting upright in his bunk his arms folded across his ample midriff and from the fact that his right hand was out of sight under the coverlet almost certainly and lovingly wrapped round the neck of a bottle of purloined scotch and the further fact that he wore a beatific smile it was clear that his plethora of keys could be put to a very catholic variety of uses i passed up judith hayness cabinshed had no dinnerand went into what i knew to be at that moment the last occupied cabin the units chief electrician a large fat redfaced and chubbychecked individual rejoicing in the name of frederick crispin harbottle was propped on an elbow and moodily eating an apple appearances to the contrary he was an invincibly morose and wholly pessimistic man for reasons i had been unable to discover he was known to all as eddie rumour had it that he had been heard to speak in the same breath of himself and that other rather betterknown electrician thomas edison sorry i said weve got some cases of food poisoning youre not one of them obviously i nodded towards the recumbent occupant of the other bed who was lying curled up with his back to us hows the duke alive eddie spoke in a tone of philosophical resignation moaning and groaning about his bellyache before he dropped off moans and groans nearly every night come to that you know what the dukes like he just cant help himself we all knew what he was like if it is possible for a person to become a legend within the space of four days then cecil golightly had become just that his unbridled gluttony lay just within the bounds of credibility and when otto less than an hour previously had referred to him as a little pie who never lifted his eyes from the table he had spoken no more than the truth the dukes voracious capacity for food was as abnormal as his obviously practically defunct metabolic system for he resembled nothing so much as a man newly emerged from a long stay in a concentration camp more out of habit than anything i bent over to give him a cursory glance and i was glad i did for what i saw were wideopen paindulled eyes moving wildly and purposelessly from side to side ashen lips working soundlessly in an ashen face and the hooked fingers of both hands digging deep into his stomach as if he were trying to tear it open id told goin that id be back in ottos cabin in five minutes i was back in fortyfive the duke because he had been so very much longer without treatment than smithy oakley or gerran had gone very very close to the edge indeed to the extent that i had on one occasion almost given up his case as being intractably hopeless but the duke was a great deal more stubborn than i was and that skeletal frame harboured an iron constitution even so without almost continuous artificial respiration a heart stimulant injection and the copious use of oxygen he would surely have died now he would as surely live is this the end of it then is this the end otto gerran spoke in a weakly querulous voice and on the face of it i had to admit that he had every right to sound both weak and querulous he hadnt as yet regained his normal colour he looked as haggard as a heavily jowled man ever can and it was clear that his recent experience had left him pretty exhausted and with this outbreak of poisoning coming on top of the continuously hostile weather that had prevented him from shooting even a foot of background film otto had reason to believe that the fates were not on his side i should think so i said in view of the fact that be bad aboard some illdisposed person who was clearly a dab hand with some of the more esoteric poisons this was as unwarrantedly optimistic a statement as i could remember making but i had to say something any other victims would have shown the symptoms before now and ive checked everyone have you now captain imrie asked how about my crew they eat the same food as you do i hadnt thought of that and i hadnt because of some mental block or simply because of lack of thought id assumed wholly without reason that the effects would be confined to the film unit people captain imrie was probably thinking that i regarded his men as secondrate citizens who when measured against ottos valuable and expensive cast and crew hardly merited serious consideration i went on what i mean is i didnt know that that they ate the same food should have been obvious if youll just show me with mr stokes in lugubrious attendance captain imrie led me round the crew quarters those consisted of five separate cabinstwo for the deck staff one for the engineroom staff one for the two cooks and the last for the two stewards it was the last one that we visited first we opened the door and just stood there for what then seemed like an unconscionably long time but was probably only a few seconds mindless creatures bereft of will and speech and power of motion i was the first to recover and stepped inside the stench was so nauseating that i came close to being sick for the first time that night and the cabin itself was in a state of indescribable confusion chairs knocked over clothes strewn everywhere and both bunks completely denuded of sheets and blankets which were scattered in a tom and tangled mess over the deck the first and overwhelming impression was that there had been a fight to the death but both moxen and scott the latter almost covered in a shredded sheet looked curiously peaceful as they lay there and neither bore any marks of violence i say we go back i say we return now captain imrie wedged himself more deeply into his chair as if establishing both a physical and argumentatively commanding position you gentlemen will bear in mind that i am the master of this vessel that i have responsibilities towards both passengers and crew he lifted his bottle from the wroughtiron stand and helped himself lavishly and i observed automatically and with little surprise that his hand was not quite steady if id typhoid or cholera aboard id sail at once for quarantine in the nearest port where medical assistance is available three dead and four seriously ill i dont see that cholera or typhoid could be any worse than we have here on the morning pose whos going to be the next to die he looked at me almost accusingly imrie seemed to be adopting the understandable attitude that as a doctor it was my duty to preserve life and that as i wasnt making a very good job of it what was happening was largely my fault dr marlowe here admits that he is at a loss to understand the reasons for thisthis lethal outbreak surely to god that itself is reason enough to call this off its a long long way back to wick smithy said like goin seated beside him smithy was swathed in a couple of blankets and like otto he still looked very much under the weather a lot can happen in that time wick mr smith i wasnt thinking of wick i can be in hammerfest in twentyfour hours less said mr stokes he sipped his rum deliberated and made his pronouncement with the wind and the sea on the port quarter and a little assistance from me in the engine room twenty hours he went over his homework and found it faultless yes twenty hours you see imrie transferred his piercing blue gaze from myself to otto twenty hours when wed established that there had been no more casualties among the crew captain imrie in what was for him a very peremptory fashion had summoned otto to the saloon and otto in turn had sent for his three fellow directors goin heissman and stryker the other director miss haynes was stryker had reported very deeply asleep which was less than surprising in view of the sedatives id prescribed for her the count had joined the meeting without invitation but everyone appeared to accept his presence there as natural to say that there was an air of panic in the saloon would have been exaggeration albeit a forgivable one but to say that there was a marked degree of apprehension concern and uncertainty would have erred on the side of understatement otto gerran perhaps was more upset than any other person present and understandably so for otto had a great deal more to lose than any other person present i appreciate the reasons for your anxiety otto said and your concern for us all does you the greatest credit but i think this concern is making you overcautious dr marlowe says that thisahepidemic is definitely over we are going to look very foolish indeed if we turn and run now and then nothing more happens captain imrie said im too old mr gerran to care what i look like if its a choice between looking a fool and having another dead man on my hands then fd rather look a fool any time i agree with mr gerran heissman said he still looked sick and he sounded sick to throw it all away when were so nearjust over a day to bear island drop us off there and then go to hammerfestjust as in the original plan that meanswell youd be in hammerfest in say sixty hours instead of twentyfour whats going to happen in that extra thirtysix hours thats not going to happen in the next twentyfour lose everything for thirtysix hours just because youre running scared i am not running scared as you say there was something impressive about imries quiet dignity my first i wasnt referring to you personally heissman said my first concern is for the people under my charge and they are under my charge i am the person responsible i must make the decision granted captain granted goin was his usual imperturbable self a calm and reasonable man but one has to strike a balance in those matters dont you think against what dr marlowe now regards as being a very remote possibility of another outbreak of food poisoning occurring theres the near certaintyno i would go further and say that theres the inevitabilitythat if we go directly to hammerfest well be put in quarantine for god knows how long a week maybe two weeks before the port medical authorities give us clearance and then itll be too late wed just have to abandon all ideas about making the film at all and go home less than a couple of hours previously i recalled heissman had been making most disparaging remarks about ottos mental capacities but hed backed him up against captain imrie and now here was goin doing the same thing both men knew which side of their bread required butter the losses to olympus productions will be enormous dont be telling me that mr goin imrie said mat you mean is that the losses to the insurance companyor companieswill be enormous wrong stryker said and from his tone and attitude it was clear that directorial solidarity on the board of olympus productions was complete severally and personally all members of the cast and crew are insured the film projecta guarantee as to its successful conclusionwas uninsurable at least in terms of the premiums demanded we and we alone bear the lossand i would add that for mr gerran who is by far and away the biggest shareholder the effects would be ruinous i am very sorry about that captain imrie seemed genuinely sympathetic but he didnt for a moment sound like a man who was preparing to abandon his position but thats your concern im afraid and i would remind you mr gerran of what you yourself said earlier on this evening health you said is a damned sight more important than any profit we might make from this film wouldnt you say this is a case in point thats nonsense to say that goin said equably he had the rare gift of being able to make potentially offensive statements in a quietly rational voice that somehow robbed them of all offence profit you say was the word mr gerran used certainly mr gerran would willingly pass up any potential profit if the need arose and that need wouldnt have to be very pressing or demanding hes done it before this was at variance with the impression id formed of otto but then goin had known him many more years than i had days even without profit we could still make our way by breaking even which is as much as most film companies can hope for these days but youre not talkingwere not talkingabout lack of profit were talking about a total and nonrecoverable loss a loss that would run into six figures and break us entirely weve put our collective shirt on this one captain imrie yet youre talking airily of liquidating our company putting dozens of techniciansand their familieson the breadline and damaging very likely beyond repair the careers of some very promising actors and actresses and all of this for what the remote chanceaccording to dr marlowe the very remote chancethat someone may fall ill again havent you got things just a little bit out of proportion captain imrie if he had captain imrie wasnt saying so he wasnt saying anything he didnt exactly have the look of a man who was thinking and thinking hard mr goin puts it very succinctly otto said very succinctly indeed and theres a major point that seems to have escaped you captain imrie you have reminded me of something i said earlier may i remind you of something you said earlier may i remind you and may i interrupt mr gerran i said i knew damn well what he was going to say and the last thing i wanted was to hear him say it please a peace formula if you wish you want to continue so does mr goin so does mr heissman so do iif only because my reputation as a doctor seems to depend on it tadeusz no question said the count bear island and of course it would be unfair to ask either mr smith or mr stokes so i propose this isnt parliament dr marlowe imrie said not even a local town council decisions aboard a vessel at sea are not arrived at by popular vote ive no intention that they should be i suggest we draw up a document i suggest we note captain imries proposals and considered opinions i suggest if more illness occurs we run immediately for hammerfest even though we are at the time only one hour distant from bear island i suggest it be recorded that captain imrie be protected and absolved from any accusation of hazarding the health of his crew and passengers in light of the medical officers affidavitwhich i will write out and signthat no such hazard exists the only charge the captain has to worry about at any time is the physical hazarding of his vessel and that doesnt exist here then we will state that the captain is absolved from all blame and responsibility for any consequences arising from our decision the navigation and handling of the vessel remains of course his sole responsibility then all five of us sign it captain imrie agreed there is a time to be prompt and captain imrie clearly regarded this as such a time at best the proposal was a lame compromise but one he was glad to accept now if you gentlemen will excuse me i have to be up betimes am to be precise i wondered when he had last risen at that unearthly hournot probably since his fishing days had ended but the illness of mate and bosan made for exceptional circumstances he looked at me i will have that document at breakfast at breakfast i wonder captain if on your way to bed you could ask haggerty to come to see me id ask him personally but hes a bit touchy about civilians like myself a lifetime in the royal navy is not forgotten overnight now say ten minutes in the galley still pursuing your enquiries is that it its not your fault dr marlowe if it wasnt my fault i thought i wished theyd all stop making me feel it was instead i thanked him and said good night and he said good night to us and left accompanied by smithy and mr stokes otto steepled his fingers and regarded me in his best chairmanoftheboard fashion we owe you our thanks dr marlowe that was well done an excellent facesaving proposal he smiled i am not accustomed to suffering interruption lightly but in this case it was justified if i hadnt interrupted wed all be on our way to hammerfest now you were about to remind him of that part of your contract with him which states that he will obey all your orders other than those that actually endanger the vessel you were about to point out that as no such physical danger exists he was technically in breach of contract and so would be legally liable to the forfeiture of the entire contract fee which would certainly have ruined him but for a man like that money ranks a long long way behind pride and captain imrie is a very proud man hed have told you to go to hell and turned his ship for hammerfest id say that our worthy physicians assessment is a hundred percent accurate the count had found some brandy and now helped himself freely you came close there otto my boy if the company chairman felt annoyance at being thus familiarly addressed by his cameraman he showed no evidence of it he said i agree we are in your debt dr marlowe a free seat at the premiere i said and all debts discharged i left the board to its deliberations and weaved my unsteady way down to the passenger accommodation allen and mary darling were still in the same place in the lounge only now she had her head on his shoulder and seemed to be asleep i gave him a casually acknowledging wave of my hand and he answered in kind he seemed to be becoming accustomed to my peripatetic presence i entered the dukes cabin without knocking lest there was someone there asleep there was eddie the electrician was very sound indeed and snoring heavily the sight of his cabinmates close brush with the reaper hadnt unnerved him any that i could see cecil golightly was awake and looking understandably very pale and drawn but not noticeably suffering largely it seemed very likely because mary stuart who was just as pale as he was was sitting by his bedside and holding his far from reluctant hand i was beginning to think that perhaps she had more friends than either she or i thought she had good lord i said you still here didnt you expect me to be you asked me to stay and keep an eye on him or had you forgotten certainly not i lied didnt expect you to remain so long thats all youve been very kind i looked down upon the recumbent duke feeling a bit better lots doctor lots better with his voice not much more than a strained whisper he didnt sound it but then after what hed been through in the past hour i didnt expect him to id like to have a little talk with you i said just a couple of minutes feel up to it he nodded mary dear said ill leave you then and made to rise but i put a restraining hand on her shoulder no need the duke and i share no secrets i gave him what i hoped would be translated as a thoughtful look its just possible though that the duke might be concealing a secret from me me aa secret cecil was genuinely puzzled tell me when did the pains start the pains halfpast nine ten something like that i cant be sure temporarily bereft of his quick wit and chirpy humour the duke was a very woebegone cockney sparrow indeed when this thing hit me i wasnt feeling much like looking at watches im sure you werent i said sympathetically and dinner was the last bite you had tonight the last bite his voice even sounded firm not even another teenyweeny snack you see cecil im puzzled miss stuart has told you that others have been ill too he nodded well the odd thing is that the others began to be ill almost at once after eating but it took well over an hour in your case i find it very strange youre absolutely sure youd nothing doctor he wheezed a bit you know me yes thats why im asking mary dear was looking at me with coolly appraising and rather reproachful brown eyes any moment now and she was going to say didnt i know cecil was a sick man you see i know that the others who were sick were suffering from some kind of food poisoning that they picked up at dinner and i know how to treat them but your illness must have had another cause ive no idea what it was or how to treat it and until i can make some sort of diagnosis i cant afford to take chances youre going to be very hungry tomorrow morning and for some time after that but i have to give your system time to settle down i dont want you to eat anything that might provoke a reaction so violent that i mightnt be able to cope with it this time time will give the all clear i dont understand doctor tea and toast for the next three days the duke didnt turn any paler than he was because that was impossible he just looked stricken tea and toast his voice was a weak croak for three days for your own good cecil i patted him sympathetically on the shoulder and straightened preparing to leave we just want to see you on your feet again i was feeling peckish like the duke explained with some pathos when just before nine just beforehalf an hour after dinner thats when i feel the most peckish i nipped up into the galley see and there was this casserole on a hot plate but id only time for one spoonful when i heard two people coming so i jumped into the cool room and waited i had to wait the duke sounded almost virtuous if id opened the door even a crack theyd have seen me so they didnt see you which means they left then theyd scoffed the bleedin lot the duke said bitterly lucky you lucky moxen and scott wasnt it the stewards howhow did you know they saved your life duke they what they ate what you were going to cat so youre alive theyre both dead allen and mary darling had obviously given up their midnight vigil for the lounge was deserted id five minutes before i met haggerty in the galley five minutes in which to collect my thoughts the trouble was that i had to find them first before i could collect them and then i realised i was not even going to have the time to find them for there were footsteps on the companionway trying with very little success to cope with the wild staggering of the morning rose mary stuart made her unsteady way towards an armchair opposite me and collapsed into rather than sat in it insofar as it was possible for such an extraordinarily goodlooking young woman to look haggard then she looked haggard her face was grey i should have felt annoyed with her for interrupting my train of thought assuming that was that i ever managed to get the train under way but i could feel no such emotion i was beginning to realise though only vaguely that i was incapable of entertaining towards this latvian girl any feeling that remotely bordered on the hostile besides she had clearly come to talk to me and if she did she wanted some help or reassuring or understanding and it would come very hardly indeed for so proud so remote so aloof a girl to ask for any of those in all conscience i couldnt make things difficult for her been sick i asked as a conversational gambit it lacked something but doctors arent supposed to have manners she nodded she was clasping her hands so tightly that i could see the faint ivory gleam of knuckles i thought you were a good sailor the light touch it is not the sea that makes me ill i abandoned the light touch mary dear why dont you lie down and try to sleep i see you tell me that two more men have been poisoned and died and then i am supposed to drop off to sleep and have happy dreams is that it i said nothing and she went on wryly youre not very good at breaking bad news are you professional callousness you didnt come here just to reproach me with my tactlessness what is it mary dear why do you call me mary dear it offends you oh no not when you say it from any other woman the words would have carried coquettish overtones but there were none such here it was meant as a statement of fact no more very well then i dont know what i meant by very well then it just made me feel obscurely clever tell me im afraid she said simply so she was afraid she was tired overwrought shed tended four very very sick men whod been poisoned shed learnt that three others whom she knew had died of poison and the violence of the arctic gale raging outside was sufficient to give pause to even the most intrepid but i said none of those things to her were all afraid at times mary you too me too are you afraid now no whats there to be afraid of death sickness and death i have to live with death mary i detest it of course i do but i dont fear it if i did id be no good as a doctor would i now i do not express myself well death i can accept but not when it strikes out blindly and you know that it is not blind as it is here it strikes out carelessly recklessly without cause or reason but you know there is cause and reason do youdo you know what i mean i knew perfectly well what she meant i said even at my brightest and best metaphysics are hardly my forte maybe the old man with the scythe does show discrimination in his indiscrimination but im too tired im not talking about metaphysics she made an almost angry little gesture with her clasped hands theres something terribly far wrong aboard this ship dr marlowe terribly far wrong heaven only knew that i couldnt have agreed with her more what should be wrong mary dear she said gravely you would not patronise me dr marlowe you would not humour a silly female i had to answer at once so i said obliquely but deliberately i would not insult you mary dear i like you too much for that do you really she smiled faintly whether amused by me or pleased at what id said i couldnt guess do you like all the others too do iim sorry dont you find something odd something very strange about the people about the atmosphere they create i was on safer ground here i said frankly id have to have been born deaf and blind not to notice it one is warding off barely expressed hostilities elbowing aside tensions wading through undercurrents the whole of the livelong day and at the same time if youll forgive the mixing of the metaphors trying to shield ones eyes from the constant shower of sparks given off by everyone trying to grind their own axes at the same time everyone is so frighteningly friendly to everyone else until the moment comes of course that everyone else is so misguided as to turn his or her back our esteemed employer otto gerran cannot speak too highly of his fellow directors heissman stryker goin and his dear daughter all of whom he vilifies most fearfully the moment they are out of earshot all of which would be wholly unforgivable were it not for the fact that heissman goin stryker and his dear daughter each behave in the same fashion to otto and their codirectors you get the same petty jealousies the same patently false sincerities the same smilers with the knives beneath the cloaks on the lower film unit crew levelnot that they and probably rightly would regard themselves as being any lower than otto and his chumsi use the word chums you understand without regard to the strict meaning of the word and just to complicate matters we have this charming interplay between the first and second divisions the duke eddie harbottle halliday the stills man hendriks and sandy all cordially detest what we might call the management a sentiment that is strongly reciprocated by the management themselves and everybody seems to have a down on the unfortunate director neal divine sure ive noticed all of this id have to be a zombie not to have but i disregard ninetyodd percent and just put it down to the normally healthy backbiting bitchery inseparable from the cinema world you get fakes cheats liars mountebanks sycophants hypocrites the world over its just that the moviemaking milieu appears to act as a grossly distorting magnifying glass that selects and highlights all the more undesirable qualities while ignoring or at best diminishing the more desirable onesone has to assume that there are some you dont think a great deal of us do you whatever gave you that impression she ignored that and were all bad not all not you not the other mary or young allenbut maybe thats because theyre too young yet or too new in this business to have come to terms with the standard norms of behaviour and im pretty sure that charles conrad is on the side of the angels again the little smile you mean he thinks along the same lines as you yes do you know him at all we say good morning you should get to know him better hed like to know you better he likes youhe said so and no we werent discussing youyour name cropped up among a dozen others flatterer her tone was neutral i didnt know whether she was referring with pleasure to conrad or with irony to myself so you agree with me there is something very strange in the atmosphere here by normal standards yes by any standards there was a curious certainty about her distrust suspicion jealousy one looks to find those things in our unpleasant little world but one does not look to find them on the scale that we have here do not forget that i know about those things i was born in a communist country i was brought up in a communist country you understand yes when did you get away two years ago just two years how please others may wish to use the same way and im in the pay of the kremlin as you wish you are offended i shook my head distrust suspicion jealousy dr marlowe but there is more here much more there is hate and there is fear ii can smell it cant you you have a point to make mary dear and youre leading up to it in a very tortuous fashion i wish you would come to it i looked at my watch i do not wish to be rude to you but neither do i wish to be rude to the person who is waiting to see me if people hate and fear each other enough terrible things can happen this didnt seem to require even an affirmative so i kept silent and she went on you say that those illnesses those deaths are the result of accidental food poisoning are they dr marlowe are they so this is what has taken you all this long time to lead up to you thinkyou think it may have been deliberate have been engineered by someone thats what you think i hoped it was clear to her that the idea had just occurred to me for the first time i dont know what to think but yesyes thats what i think who who she looked at me in what appeared to be genuine astonishment how should i know who anybody i suppose youd be a sensation as a prosecuting counsel then if not who why she hesitated looked away glanced briefly back at me then looked at the deck i dont know why either so youve no basis for this incredible suggestion other than your communisttrained instincts ive put it very badly havent i youd nothing to put mary just examine the facts and see how ridiculous your suggestion is seven disparate people affected and all struck down completely at randomor can you give me a reason why so wildly diverse a group as a film producer a hairdresser a camera focus assistant a mate a bosan and two stewards should he the victims can you tell me why some lived why some died can you tell me why two of the victims assimilated this poison from food served at the saloon table two from food consumed in the galley and one the duke who may have been poisoned in either the galley or the saloon can you mary she shook her head the strawcoloured hair fell over her eyes and she let it stay there maybe she didnt want to look at me maybe she didnt want me to look at her after today i said ive been left standing ive been widely given to understand among the ruins of my professional reputation but ill wager whats left of it together with anything else you care to name that this wholesale poisoning is completely accidental and that no person aboard the morning rose wished to hoped to or intended to poison those seven men which was a different thing entirely from claiming that there was no one aboard the morning rose who was responsible for the tragedy not unless we have a madman aboard and you can say what you likeyouve already said itabout our highlyahindividualistic shipboard companions none of them is unhinged not that is criminally unhinged she hadnt looked at me once when i was speaking and even when id finished continued to present me with a view of the crown of her head i rose lurched across to the armchair where she was sitting braced myself with one hand on the back of her chair and placed a finger of the other under her chin she straightened and brushed back the hair from her eyes brown eyes large and still and full of fear i smiled at her and she smiled back and the smile didnt touch her eyes i turned and left the lounge i was quite ten minutes late for my appointment in the galley and as haggerty had already made abundantly clear to me that he was a stickler for the proprieties i expected to find him in a mood anywhere between stiff outrage and cool disapproval haggertys attention however was occupied with more immediate and pressing matters for as i approached the galley through the stewards pantry i could hear the sound of a loud and very angry altercation at least haggerty was being loud and angry it wasnt so much an altercation as a monologue and it was haggerty his red face crimson now with anger and his periwinkle blue eyes popping who was conducting it sandy our props man was the unfortunate party on the other side of this very onesided argument and his silent acceptance of the abuse that was being heaped upon him stemmed less from the want of something to say than from the want of air i thought at first that haggerty had his very large red hand clamped round sandys scrawny neck but then realised that he had the two lapels of sandys jacket crushed together in one hand the effect however was about the same and as sandy was only about half the cooks size there was very little he could do about it i tapped haggerty on the shoulder youre choking this man i said mildly haggerty glanced at me briefly and got back to his choking i went on just as mildly this isnt a naval vessel and im not a masteratarms so i cant order you about but i am what the courts would accept as an expert witness and i dont think theyd question my testimony when youre being sued for assault and battery could cost you your lifes savings you know haggerty looked at me again and this time he didnt look away reluctantly he removed his hand from the little mans collar and just stood there glaring and breathing heavily momentarily it seemed at a loss for words sandy wasnt after hed massaged his throat a bit to see if it were still intact he addressed a considerable amount of unprintable invective to haggerty then continued shouting you see you heard you great big ugly baboon its the courts for you assault and battery mate and itll cost you shut up i said wearily i didnt see a thing and he didnt lay a finger on you be happy youre still breathing i looked at sandy consideringly i didnt really know him i knew next to nothing about him i wasnt even sure whether i liked him or not like allen and the late antonio if sandy had another name no one seemed to know what it was fie claimed to be a scot but had a powerful liverpool accent he was a strange undersized wizened leprechaun of a man with a wrinkled walnut brown face and headhis pate was gleamingly baldand stringy white hair that started about earlobe level and cascaded in uncombed disarray over his thin shoulders he had quickmoving and almost weasellike eves but maybe that was unfair to him it may have been the effect of the steellegged rimless glasses that he affected he was given to claiming when under the influence of gin which was as often as not that he not only didnt know his birthday he didnt even know the year in which he had been born but put it around or the consensus of informed shipboard opinion put the date not cruelly at or slightly earlier i noticed for the first time that there were some tins of sardines and pilchards on the deck and a larger one of corned beef aha i said the midnight skulker strikes again what was that haggerty said suspiciously you couldnt have given our friend here a big enough helping for dinner i said it wasnt for myself sandy under stress had a highpitched squeak of a voice i swear it wasnt you see i ought to throw the little runt over the side little sneaking robbing bastard that he is down here up to his thieves tricks the minute my backs turned and whos blamed for the theft eh tell me that whos blamed for the theft whos got to account to the captain for the missing supplies whos got to make the loss good from his own pocket and whos going to get his pay docked for not locking the galley door haggertys blood pressure as he contemplated the injustices of life was clearly rising again to think he said bitterly that ive always trusted my fellow man i ought to break his bloody neck well you cant do that now i said reasonably you cant expect me as a professional man to perjure myself in the witness box besides theres no harm done nothing stolen youve no losses to pay for so why get in bad with captain imrie i looked at sandy then at the tins on the floor was that all you stole i swear to god oh do be quiet i said to haggerty where was he what was he doing when you came in hed his bloody great long nose stuck in the big fridge there that was what he was doing caught him red handed i did i opened the refrigerator door inside it was packed with a large number of items of very restricted varietybutter cheeses longlife milk bacon and tinned meats that was all i said to sandy come here i want to look through your clothes you want to look through my clothes sandy had taken heart from his providential deliverance from the threat of physical violence and the knowledge that he would not now be reported to those in authority and who do you think you are then a bleedin cop the cid eh just a doctor a doctor whos trying to find out why three people died tonight sandy stared at me his eyes widening behind his rimless glasses and his lower jaw fell down didnt you know that moxen and scott were dead the two stewards aye id heard he ran his tongue over his lips whats that got to do with me im not sure not yet you cant pin that on me what are you talking about sandys brief moment of truculence was vanished as if it had never been ive nothing to do three men died and four almost did they died or nearly died from food poisoning food comes from the galley im interested in people who make unauthorised visits to the galley i looked at haggerty i think wed better have captain imrie along here no christ no sandy was close to panic mr gerran would kill me come here he came to me the last resistance gone i went through his pockets but there was no trace of the only instrument he could have used to infect foodstuffs in the refrigerator a hypodermic syringe i said what were you going to do with those tins they werent for me i told you what would i want with them i dont eat enough to keep a mouse alive ask anyone theyll tell you i didnt have to ask anyone what he said was perfectly true sandy like lonnie gilbert depended almost exclusively upon the distillers ltd to maintain his calorific quota but he could still have been using those tins of meat as an insurance as a red herring if hed been caught out as he had been who were the tins for then the duke cecil ive just been to his cabin he said he was hungry no he didnt he said he was going to be hungry cos youd put him on tea and toast for three days i thought back to my interview with the duke id only used the tea and toast threat to extract information from him and it wasnt until now that i recalled that i had forgotten to withdraw the threat this much of sandys story had to be true the duke asked you to get some supplies for him no you told him you were going to get them no i wanted to surprise him i wanted to see his face when i turned up with the tins impasse he could be telling the truth he could equally well be using the story as a cloak for other and more sinister activities i couldnt tell and probably would never know i said you better go and tell your friend the duke that hell be back on a normal diet as from breakfast you meani can go if mr haggerty doesnt wish to press a charge i wouldnt lower myself haggerty clamped his big hand round the back of sandys neck with a grip tight enough to make the little man squeal in pain if i ever catch you within sniffing distance of my galley again i wont just squeeze your neck ill break the bloody thing haggerty marched him to the door literally threw him out and returned got off far too easy if you ask me sir hes not worth your ire mr haggerty hes probably telling the truth not that that makes him any less a sneak thief moxen and scott ate here tonight after the passengers had dinner every night waiting staff usually cat before the gueststhey preferred it the other way round with the departure of sandy haggerty was looking a very troubled and upset man the loss of two stewards had clearly shaken him badly and was almost certainly responsible for the violence of his reaction towards sandy i think ive traced the source of the poison i believe the horseradish was contaminated with a very unpleasant organism called clostridium botulinum a sporing anaerobe found most commonly in garden soil id never heard of such a case of contamination but that didnt make it impossible no possible reflection on youits totally undetectable before during and after cooking were there any leftovers tonight some i made a casserole for moxen and scott and put the rest away away for throwing there wasnt enough to reuse for anything so its gone another door locked on a night like this no fear the gash is scaled in polythene bags then theyre punctured and go over the sidein the morning the door had opened again you mean its still here of course he nodded towards a rectangular plastic box secured to the bulkhead by butterfly nuts there i crossed to the box and lifted the lid haggerty said youll be going to analyse it is that it thats what i intended rather to keep it for analysis i dropped the lid that wont be possible now the bins empty empty over the sidein this weather haggerty came and unnecessarily checked the bin for himself bloody funny and against regulations perhaps your assistant charlie that boneidle layabout not him besides hes offduty tonight haggerty scratched the grey bristle of his hair lord knows why they did it but it must have been moxen or scott yes i said it must have been i was so tired that i could think of nothing other than my cabin and my bunk i was so tired that it wasnt until i had arrived at my cabin and looked on the bare bunk that i recalled that all my blankets had been taken away for smithy and oakley i glanced idly at the small table where id left the toxicological books that i had been consulting and my tiredness very suddenly left me the volume on medical jurisprudence that had provided me with the information on the aconitine was lying with its base pressed hard against the far fiddle of the table thrown there of course by one of the violent lurches of the morning rose the silken bookmark ribbon attached to the head of the book stretched out most of its length on the table which was an unremarkable thing in itself were it not for my clear and distinct recollection that id carefully used the bookmark to mark the passage id been reading i wondered who it was who knew id been reading the article on aconitine i suddenly didnt fancy my cabin very much any more not that was as a place to sleep in the eccentric shipping millionaire whod had the morning rose completely stripped and fitted for passenger accommodation had had a powerful aversion to locks on cabin doors and having had the means and the opportunity to do so had translated his theories into practice it may have been just a phobia or it may have stemmed from his assertion that many people had unnecessarily lost their lives at sea through being trapped in locked cabins as their ships went downwhich in fact i knew to be true however it was it was impossible to lock a cabin door in the morning rose from the inside it didnt even have a sliding bolt the saloon i decided was the place for me it had as i recalled a very comfortable corner bulkhead settee where i could wedge myself and more importantly protect my back the lockers below the settee seats had a splendid assortment of fleecy steamer rugs another legacy like the lockless doors from the previous owner best of all it was a brightly lit and public place a place where people were liable to come and go even at that late hour a place where no one could sneak up on you unawares not that any of this would offer any bar to anyone so illdisposed as to take a pot shot at me through the saloons plateglass windows it was i supposed some little consolation that the person or persons bent on mayhem had not so far chosen to resort to overt violence but that hardly constituted a guarantee that they wouldnt why the hell couldnt the publishers of reference books emulate the prestigious encyclopaedia britannica and do away with bookmarks altogether it was then that i recalled that id left the board of olympus productions in full plenary session up in the saloon how long ago was that twenty minutes not more another twenty minutes perhaps and the coast would be clear it wasnt that i harboured any particular suspicion towards any of the four they might just consider it very odd if i were to elect to sleep up there for the night lien id a perfectly comfortable cabin down below partly on impulse partly to kill some of the intervening time i decided to have a look at the duke to check on his condition to ensure him a restful night by promising hed be back on full rations come breakfast time and to find out if sandy had been telling the truth his was the third door to the left the second to the right was wide open the door stayed back at ninety degrees it was mary stuarts cabin and she was inside but not asleep she sat in a chair wedged between table and bunk her eyes wide open her hands in her lap whats this then i said you look like someone taking part in a wake im not sleepy and the door open expecting company i hope not i cant lock the door you havent been able to lock the door since you came aboard it doesnt have a lock i know it didnt matter not till tonight youyoure not thinking that someone might sneak up and do you in while youre sleeping i said in a tone of a person who could never conceive of such a thing happening to himself i dont know what to think im all right please afraid still i shook my head fie on you think of your namesake young mary darling shes not scared to sleep alone shes not sleeping alone she isnt ah well we live in a permissive age shes with allen in the recreation room ah then why dont you join them if its safety you wrongly imagine you need why then theres safety in numbers i do not like to playwhat do you saygooseberry h fiddlesticks i said and went to see the duke he had colour not much but enough in his cheeks and was plainly on the mend i asked him how he was rotten said the duke he rubbed his stomach still pretty sore hunger pains he said nothing tonight tomorrow youre back on the strengthforget the tea and toast by the way that wasnt very clever of you to send sandy up to raid the galley haggerty nabbed him in the act sandy in the galley the surprise was genuine i didnt send him up surely he told you he was going there not a word look doc you cant pin nobodys pinning anything on anybody i must have taken him up wrong maybe he just wanted to surprise youhe said something about you feeling peckish i said that all right but honest to god its all right no harm done good night i retraced my steps passing mary stuarts open door again she looked at me but said nothing so i did the same back in my cabin i looked at my watch five minutes only had elapsed fifteen to go i was damned if i was going to wait so long i was feeling tired again tired enough to drop off to sleep at any moment but i had to have a reason to go up there for the first time i devoted some of my rapidly waning powers of thought to the problem and i had the answer in seconds i opened my medical bag and extracted three of the most essential items it containeddeath certificates for some odd reason i checked the number that was leftten all told thirteen i was glad i wasnt superstitious the certificates and a few sheets of rather splendidly headed ships note paperthe previous owner hadnt been a man to do things by halfwent into my briefcase i opened the cabin door wide so as to have some light to see by checked that the passage was empty and swiftly unscrewed the deckhead lamp this i dropped on the deck from gradually increasing heights starting with about a foot or so until a shake of the lamp dose by my car let me hear the unmistakable tinkle of a broken filament i screwed the now useless lamp back into its holder took up my briefcase closed the door and made for the bridge the weather i observed during my very hurried passage across the upper deck and up the bridge ladder hadnt improved in the slightest i had the vague impression that the seas were moderating slightly but that may have been because of the fact that i was feeling so tired that i was no longer capable of registering impressions accurately but one aspect of the weather was beyond question the almost horizontally driving snow had increased to the extent that the masthead light was no more than an intermittent glow in the gloom above allison was at the wheel spending more time looking at the radarscope than at the compass and visibility being what it was i could see his point i said do you know where the captain keeps his crew lists in his cabin no he glanced over his shoulder in the charthouse there he hesitated why would you want those dr marlowe i pulled a death certificate from the briefcase and held it close to the binnacle light allison compressed his lips top drawer port locker i found the lists entered up the name address age place of birth religion and next of kin of each of the three dead men replaced the book and made my way down to the saloon half an hour had elapsed since id left gerran his three codirectors and the count sitting there and there all five still were seated round a table and studying cardboard covered folders spread on the table before them a pile of those lay on the table some more were scattered on the floor where the rolling of the ship had obviously precipitated them the count looked at me over the rim of his glass his capacity for brandy was phenomenal still abroad my dear fellow you do labour on our behalf much more of this and i suggest that you be coopted as one of our directors heress one cobbler that sticks to his last i looked at gerran sorry to interrupt but ive some forms to fill up if im interrupting some private session nothing private going on here i assure you it was goin who answered merely studying our shooting script for the next fortnight all the cast and crew will have one tomorrow like a copy thank you after ive finished this afraid my cabin light has gone on the blink and im not much good at writing by the light of matches were just leaving otto was still looking grey and very tired but he was mentally tough enough to keep going long after his body had told him to stop i think we could all do with a good nights sleep its what i would prescribe you could postpone your departure for five minutes if necessary of course weve promised captain imrie a guarantee or affidavit or what will you exonerating him from all blame if we have any further outbreaks of mysterious illness he wants it on his breakfast table and he wants it signed and as captain imrie will be up at am and i suspect his breakfast will be correspondingly early i suggest it would be more convenient if you all signed it now they nodded agreement i sat at a nearby table and in my best handwriting which was pretty bad and best legal jargon which was awful i drafted a statement of responsibility which i thought would meet the case the others apparently thought so too or were too tired to care for they signed with only a cursory glance at what i had written the count signed too and i didnt as much as raise an eyebrow it had never even crossed my mind that the count belonged to those elevated directorial ranks i had thought that the more highly regarded cameramen of which the count was undoubtedly one were invariably freelance and therefore ineligible for election to any film company board but at least it helped to explain his lack of proper respect for otto and now to bed goin eased back his chair you too doctor after ive filled out the death certificates an unpleasant duty goin handed me a folder this might help amuse you afterwards i took it from him and gerran heaved himself upright with the usual massive effort those funerals dr marlowe the burials at sea what time do they take place first light is customary otto closed his eyes in suffering after what youve been through mr gerran id advise you to give it a miss rest as long as possible tomorrow you really think so i nodded and otto removed his mask of suffering you will stand in for me john of course goin said good night doctor thank you for your cooperation yes yes thank you thank you otto said they trooped off unsteadily and i fished out my death certificate forms and filled them out i put those in one sealed envelope the signed affidavit i just in time remembered to add my own signaturein another addressed them to captain imrie and took them up to the bridge to ask allison to hand them over to the captain when he came on watch at four in the morning allison wasnt there instead smithy heavily clad and muffled almost to the eyebrows was sitting on a high stool before the wheel he wasnt touching the wheel which periodically spun clockwise and counterclockwise as of its own accord and hed turned up the rheostat he looked pale and had dark circles under his eyes but he didnt have a sick look about him any more his recuperative powers were quite remarkable automatic pilot he explained almost cheerfully and all the lights of home who needs night sight in zero visibility you ought to be in bed i said shortly ive just come from there and im just going there first officer smith is not yet his old self and he knows it just come up to check position and give allison a break for coffee also i thought i might find you here you werent in your cabin im here now what did you want to see me about otarddupuy he said how does that sound it sounds fine smithy slid off his stool and headed for the cupboard where captain imrie kept his private store of restoratives but you werent hunting the ship to offer me a brandy no tell you the truth ive been trying to figure out some things no dice with the figuring if i was bright enough for that id be too bright to be where i am now thought you could help me he handed me a glass we should make a great team i said he smiled briefly three dead and four half dead food poisoning what poisoning i told him the story about the sporing anaerobes the one id given haggerty but smithy wasnt haggerty mighty selective poison isnt it clobbers a and kills him passes up b clobbers c and doesnt kill him passes up d and so on and we all had the same food to cat poisons are notoriously unpredictable six people at a picnic can cat the same infected food three can land in hospital while the others dont feel a twinge so some people get tummy aches and some dont but thats a bit different from saying that a poison that is deadly enough to kill and to kill violently and quickly is going to leave others entirely unaffected pm no doctor but i flat out dont believe it i find it a bit odd myself you have something in mind yes the poisoning was deliberate deliberate i sipped some more of the otarddupuy while i wondered how far to go with smithy not too far i thought not yet i said of course it was deliberate and so easily done take our poisoner he has this little bag of poison also he has this little magic wand he waves it and turns himself invisible and then flits around the dining tables a pinch for otto none for me a pinch for you a pinch for oakley no pinches for say heissman and stryker a double pinch for antonio none for the girls a pinch for the duke two each for moxen and scott and so on a wayward and capricious lad our invisible friend or would you call it being selective i dont know what id call it smithy said soberly but i know what id call youdevious offputting sidetracking and altogether protesting too much without offence of course of course i wouldnt rate you as anybodys fool you cant tell me that you havent had some thoughts along those lines i had but because ive been thinking about it a lot longer than you ive dismissed them motive opportunity meansimpossible to find any dont you know that the first thing a doctor does when hes called in to a case of accidental poisoning is to suspect that its not accidental so youre satisfied as can be i see he paused do you know we have a transmitter in the radio office that can reach just about any place in the northern hemisphere ive got a feeling were going to have to use it soon what on earth for help help yes you know the thing you require when youre in trouble i think we need help now any more funny little accidents and ill be damn certain we need help im sorry i said youre way beyond me besides britains a long long way away from us now the nato atlantic forces arent theyre carrying out fleet exercises somewhere off the north cape youre well informed i said it pays to be well informed when im talking to someone who claims to be as satisfied as can be over three very mysterious deaths when im certain that someone would never rest and could never be satisfied until he knew exactly how those three people had died ive admitted im not very bright but dont completely underestimate what little intelligence i have i dont and dont overestimate mine thanks for the otarddupuy i went to the starboard screen door the morning rose was still rolling and pitching and shaking and shuddering as she battered her way northwards through the wild seas but it was no longer possible to see the windtorn waters below we were in a world now that was almost completely opaque a blind and bitter world of driving white a world of snowy darkness that began and ended at scarcely an armslength distance i looked down at the wing bridge deck and in the pale light of wash from the wheelhouse i could see footprints in the snow there was only one set of them sharp and clearly limned as if they had been made only seconds previously somebody had been there for a moment i was certain that someone had been there listening to smith and myself talking then i realised there was only one set the set i had made myself and they hadnt been filled in or even blurred because the blizzard driving horizontally across the winddodger was clearing the deck at my feel sleep i thought and sleep now for with that lack of sleep the tiring events of the past few hours the sheer physical exhaustion induced by the violent weather and smithys dark forebodings i was beginning to imagine things i realised that smithy was at my shoulder you levelling with me dr marlowe of course or do you think fin the invisible borgia whos flitting around a little pinch here a little pinch there no i dont i dont think youre levelling with me either his voice was sombre maybe someday you are going to wish you were someday i was going to wish i had for then i wouldnt have had to leave smithy behind in bear island back in the saloon i picked up the booklet goin had given me went to the corner settee found myself a steamer blanket decided i didnt require it yet and wedged myself into the corner my feet comfortably on a swivel chair belonging to the nearest table i picked up without much interest the cardboard file and was debating whether to open it when the lee door opened and mary stuart came in there was snow on the tangled corncoloured hair and she was wearing a heavy tweed coat so this is where you are she banged the door shut and looked at me almost accusingly this i acknowledged is where i am you werent in your cabin and your lights gone do you know that i know that id some writing to do thats why i came here is there something wrong she lurched across the saloon and sat heavily on the settee opposite me nothing more than has been wrong she and smithy should meet up theyd get on famously do you mind if i stay here i could have said that it didnt matter whether i minded or not that the saloon was as much hers as mine but as she seemed to be a touchy sort of creature i just smiled and said i would take it as an insult if you left she smiled back at me just an acknowledging flicker and settled as best she could in her seat drawing the tweed coat around her and bracing herself against the violent movements of the morning rose she closed her eyes and with the long dark lashes lying along pale wet cheeks her high cheekbones were more pronounced than ever her slavonic ancestry unmistakable it was no great hardship to look upon mary stuart but i still felt an increasing irritation as i watched her it wasnt so much her fey imaginings and need for company that made me uneasy it was the obvious discomfort she was experiencing in trying to keep her seated balance while i was wedged so very comfortably in my own place there is nothing more uncomfortable than being comfortable ones self and watching another in acute discomfort not unless of course one has a feeling of very powerful antagonism towards the other party in which case a very comfortable feeling can be induced but i had no such antagonism towards the girl opposite to compound my feeling of guilt she began to shiver involuntarily here i said youd be more comfortable in my scat and theres a rug here you can have she opened her eyes no thank you there are plenty more rugs i said in something like exasperation nothing brings out the worst in me more quickly than sweetly smiling suffering i picked up the rug did my customarv twostep across the heaving deck and draped the rug over her she looked at me gravely and said nothing back in my corner i picked up the booklet again but instead of reading it got to wondering about my cabin and those who might visit it during my absence mary stuart had visited it but then shed told me she had and the fact that she was here now confirmed the reason for her visit at least it seemed to confirm it she was scared she said she was lonely and so she naturally wanted company why my company why not that of say charles conrad who was a whole lot younger nicer and better looking than i was or even his other two fellow actors gunther jungbeck and ion heyter both very personable characters indeed maybe she wanted to be with me for all the wrong reasons maybe she was watching me maybe she was virtually guarding me maybe she was giving someone the opportunity to visit my cabin whilei was suddenly very acutely aware that there were things in my cabin that id rather not be seen by others i put the book down and headed for the lee door she opened her eyes and lifted her head where are you going out im sorry i justare you coming back im sorry too im not rude i lied just tired below back in a minute she nodded her eyes following me until i closed the door behind me once outside i remained still for twenty seconds or so ignoring the vagrant flurries of snow that even here on the lee side seemed bent on getting down my collar and up the trouser cuffs then walked quickly foreword i peered through the plateglass window and she was sitting as id left her only now she had her elbows on her knees and her face in her hands shaking her head slowly from side to side ten years ago id have been back in that saloon pretty rapidly arms round her and telling her that all her troubles were over that was ten years ago now i just looked at her wondered if she had been expecting me to take a peck at her then made my way foreword and down to the passenger accommodation it was after midnight but not yet closing hours in the lounge bar for lonnie gilbert with a heroically foolhardy disregard for what would surely be ottos fearful wrath when the crime was discovered had both glass doors swung open and latched in position while he himself was ensconced in some state behind the bar itself a bottle of malt whisky in one hand a soda syphon in the other he beamed paternally at me as i passed through and as it seemed late in the day to point out to lonnie that the better class malts stood in no need of the anaemic assistance of soda i just nodded and went below if anybody had been in my cabin and gone through my belongings hed done it in a very circumspect way as far as i could recall everything was as i had left it and nothing had been disturbed but then a practised searcher rarely left any trace of his passing both my cases had elasticised linen pockets in the lids and in each pocket in each lid holding the lids as nearly horizontal as possible i placed a small goin just at the entrance to the pocket then i locked the cases in spite of the trawlers wildly erratic behaviour those coins would remain where they were held in place by the pressure of the clothes inside but as soon as the lid was opened the pressure released and the lid then lifted even partway towards the vertical the coins would slide down to the feet of the pockets i then locked my medical bagit was considerably larger and heavier than the average medical bag but then it held a considerably greater amount of equipment and put it out in the passage i closed the door behind me carefully wedging a spent book match between the foot of the door and the sill that door would have to open only a crack and the match would drop clear lonnie unsurprisingly was still at his station in the lounge when i reached there aha he regarded his empty glass with an air of surprise then reached out with an unerring hand the kindly healer with his bag of tricks hotfoot to the succour of suffering mankind a new and dreadful epidemic is it your old uncle lonnie is proud of you boy proud of you this hippocratic spirit he broke off only to resume almost at once now that we have touched inadvertently chanced upon as one might say this topicspirit the blushful hippocrenei wonder if by any chance you would care to join me in a thimbleful of the elixir i have here thank you lonnie no why dont you get to bed if you keep it up like this you wont be able to get up tomorrow and that my dear boy is the whole point of the exercise i dont want to get up tomorrow the day after tomorrow well yes if i must ill face the day after tomorrow i dont want to mind you for tomorrows we found are always distressingly similar to todays the only good thing you can say about a today is that at any given moment such and such a portion of it is already irrevocably pasthe paused to admire his speech controlirrevocably past as i say and with the passing of every moment so much less of it to come but all of tomorrow is still to come think of it all of itthe livelong day he lifted his recharged glass others drink to forget the past but some of usvery very few and it would not be right of me to say that were gifted with a prescience and understanding and intelligence far beyond the normal ken so ill just say were different some of us i say drink to forget the future how you will ask can one forget the future well for one thing it takes practice and of course a little assistance he drank half his malt in one gulp and intoned tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow creeps in this petty pace from day to day to the last syllable lonnie i said i dont think youre the least little bit like macbeth and there you have it in a nutshell im not a tragic figure a sad man fated and laden with doom now me im not like that at all we gilberts have the indomitable spirit the unconquerable soul your shakespeares are all very well but walter de la mare is my boy he lifted his glass and squinted myopically at it against the light look your last on all things lovely every hour i dont think he quite meant it in that way lonnie anyway doctors orders and do me a favourget to hell out of here otto will have you drawn and quartered if he finds you here otto do you know something lonnie leaned forward confidentially ottos really a very kindly man i like otto hes always been good to me otto has most people are good my dear chap dont you know that most people are kind lots of them very kind but none so kind as otto why i remember he broke off as i went round the back of the bar replaced the bottles locked the doors placed the keys in his dressinggown pocket and took his arm im not trying to deprive you of the necessities of life i explained neither am i being heavyhanded and moralistic but i have a sensitive nature and i dont want to be around when you find out that your assessment of otto is a hundred percent wrong lonnie came without a single murmur of protest clearly he had his emergency supplies cached in his cabin on our stumbling descent of the companionway he said you think im headed for the next world with my gas pedal flat on the floor dont you as long as you dont hit anybody its none of my business how you drive lonnie he stumbled into his cabin sat heavily on his bed then moved with remarkable swiftness to one side i could only conclude that hed inadvertently sat on a bottle of scotch he looked at me pondering then said tell me my boy do you think they have bars in heaven im afraid i have no information on that one lonnie quite quite it makes a gratifying change to find a doctor who is not the source of all wisdom you may leave me now my good fellow i looked at neal divine now quietly asleep and at lonnie impatiently and for obvious reasons awaiting my departure and left them both mary stuart was sitting where id left her arms straight out on either side and fingers splayed to counteract the now noticeably heavier pitching of the morning pose the rolling effect on the other hand was considerably less so i assumed that the wind was still veering in a northerly direction she looked at me with the normally big brown eyes now preternaturally huge in a dreadfully tired face then looked away again im sorry i found myself apologising ive been discussing classics and theology with our production manager i made for my corner seat and sat down gratefully do you know him at all everybody knows lonnie she tried to smile we worked together in the last picture i made again she essayed a smile did you see it no id heard about it though enough to make me walk five miles out of my way to avoid it it was awful i was awful i cant imagine why they gave me another chance youre a very beautiful girl i said you dont have to be able to act performance detracts from appearance anyway you may be an excellent actress i wouldnt know about lonnie yes he was there so was mr gerran and mr heissman i said nothing so she went on this is the third picture weve all made together the third since mr heissmanwell since he i know mr heissman was away for quite a bit lonnies such a nice man hes so helpful and kind and i think hes a very wise man but hes a funny man you know that lonnie likes to take a drink one day after twelve hours on the set and all of us dead tired when we got back to the hotel i asked for a double gin and he became very angry with me why should he be like that because hes a funny man so you like him how could i not like him he likes everybody so everybody just likes him back even mr gerran likes himtheyre very close but then theyve known each other for years and years i didnt know that has lonnie a family is he married i dont know i think he was maybe hes divorced why do you ask so many questions about him because fin a typically knowing prying sawbones and i like to know as much as possible about people who are or may be my patients for instance i know enough about lonnie now never to give him a brandy if he were in need of a restorative for it wouldnt have the slightest effect she smiled and closed her eyes conversation over i took another steamer rug from under my seat wrapped it around methe temperature in the saloon was noticeably droppingand picked up the folder that goin had given me i turned to page which apart from being titled bear island started off without any preamble it is widely maintained it read that olympus productions is approaching the making of this its latest production in conditions so restrictive as to amount to an aura of almost total secrecy allegations to this effect have subsequently made their appearance in popular and trade presses and in light of the absence of production office denials to the contrary those uncorroborated assertions have achieved a considerable degree of substance and credence which one might regard in the circumstances as being a psychological inevitability i read through this rubbish again a travesty of the queens english fit only for the columns of the more learned sunday papers and then i got it they were making a hushhush picture and didnt care who knew and very good publicity it was for the film too i thought but no i was doing the boys an injustice or so the boys said the article continued other cinematic productionsi assumed he meant filmshave been approached and on occasion even executed under conditions of similar secrecy but those other and one is afraid spurious sub rosa ventures have had for their calculated aim nothing less regrettably than the extraction of the maximum free publicity this we insist and with some pride is not the objective of olympus productions good old olympus this i had to see a cinema company who didnt want free publicity next thing wed have the bank of england turning its nose up at the sound of the word money our frankly cabalistic approach to this production which has given rise to so much intrigued and largely illinformed speculation has in fact been imposed upon us by considerations of the highest importance the handling of this a story which in the wrong hands might well generate potentially and dangerously explosive international repercussions calls for the utmost in delicacy and finesse essential qualities for the creation of what we confidently expect will be hailed as a cinematic masterpiece but qualities which even we feelnay are certainwould not be able to overcome the immense damage done byand we are certain of thisthe worldwide furore that would immediately and automatically follow the premature leaking of the story we intend to film we are confident however that whenthere is no ifthis production is made in our own way in our own time and under the very strictest security conditionsthis is why we have gone to the quite extraordinary lengths of obtaining notarised oaths of secrecy from every member of the cast and crew of the film project under discussion including the managing director and his codirectorswe will have upon our hands when this production is presented to a public which will have been geared by that time to the highest degree of expectancy a tour de force of so unparalleled an order that the justification for mary stuart sneezed and i blessed her twice once for her health and once for the heavensent interruption of the reading of this modestly phrased manifesto i glanced at her again just as she sneezed again she was sitting in a curiously huddled fashion hands clasped tightly together her face white and pinched i laid down the olympus manifesto unwrapped my rug crossed the saloon in a zigzag totter which resulted from the now very pronounced pitching of the morning rose sat beside her and took her hands in mine they were icily cold youre freezing i said somewhat unnecessarily im all right im just a bit tired why dont you go below to your cabin its at least twenty degrees warmer down there and youll never sleep up here if you have to keep bracing yourself all the time from falling off your seat no i dont sleep down there either ive hardly slept since she broke off and i dont feel nearly soso queasy up here please i dont give up easily i said then at least take my corner scat youll be much more comfortable there she took her hands away please just leave me i gave up i left her i took three wavering steps in the direction of my scat halted in irritation turned back to her and hauled her none too gently to her feel she looked at me not speaking in tired surprise and continued to say nothing and to offer no resistance as i led her across to my corner brought out another two steamer rugs cocooned her in those lifted her feet onto the settee and sat beside her she looked up at me for a few seconds her gaze transferring itself from my right eye to my left and back again then she turned her face to me closed her eyes and slid one of her icy hands under my jacket during all this performance she didnt speak once or permit any expression to appear on her face and i would have been deeply moved by this touching trust in me were it not for the reflection that if it were her purpose or instructions to keep as close an eye as possible on me she could hardly even in her most optimistic moments have hoped to arrive at a situation where she could keep an eye within half an inch of my shirt front i couldnt even take a deep breath without her knowing all about it on the other hand if she were as innocent as the driven snow that had now completely obscured the plate glass not six inches from my head then it was less than likely that any illdisposed citizen or citizens would contemplate taking action of a violent and permanent nature against me as long as i had mary stuart practically sitting on my lap it was i thought a pretty even trade i looked down at the halfhidden lovely face and reflected that i was possibly having a shade the better of the deal i reached for my own rug draped it round my shoulders in navaho style picked up the olympus manifesto again and continued to read the next two pages were largely a hyperbolic expansion of what had gone before with the writeri assumed it was heissmanharping on at nauseating length on the twin themes of the supreme artistic merit of the production and the necessity for absolute secrecy after this selfadulatory exercise the writer got down to facts after long consideration and the close examination and subsequent rejection of a very considerable number of possible alternatives we finally decided upon bear island as the location for this project we are aware that all of you and this includes the entire crew of the morning rose from captain imrie downwards believed that we were heading for a destination in the neighbourhood of the lofoten islands off northern norway and it was not exactly shall we say through fortuitous circumstance that this rumour was gaining some currency in certain quarters in london immediately prior to our departure we make no apologies for what may superficially appear to be an unwarranted deception for it was essential to our purposes and the maintenance of secrecy that this subterfuge be adopted for the following brief description of bear island we are indebted to the royal geographical society of oslo who have also furnished us with a translation that was a relief just as long as the translator wasnt heissman i might be able to get it on the first reading this information it is perhaps superfluous to add was obtained for us through the good offices of a third party entirely unconnected with olympus productions a noted ornithologist who must remain entirely incognito it may be mentioned in the passing that the norwegian government has given us permission to film on the island we understand that it is their understanding that we propose to make a wild life documentary such an understanding far less a commitment was not obtained from us i wondered about the last bitnot the cleverer thanthou smugness of it that was clearly inseparable from everything heissman wrotebut the fact that he should say it at all heissman clearly was not a man much given to hiding his own brilliancethe phrase low cunning would not have occurred to himunder a bushel but equally he wasnt a man who would permit this particular type of self gratification to lead him into danger almost certainly if the norwegians did find out they had been deluded there would be nothing in international law they could do about itolympus wouldnt have overlooked anything so obviousother than ban the completed film from their country and as norway could hardly be regarded as a major market this would cause few sleepless nights on the other hand it would be effective in stilling any qualms of consciencetrue this was a world of the cinema but heissman would be unlikely to overlook even the most remote possibilitythat might have arisen had the project been denied even this superficial official blessing and the very fact that they were being made privy to the secret inner workings of olympus would tend to bind both cast and crew closer to the company for it is an almost universal law of nature that mankind which is still in the painful process of growing up dearly loves its little closed andor secret societies whether those be the most remote masonic lodge in saskatchewan or whites of st jamess and tend to form an intense personal attachment and loyalty to other members of that group while presenting a united front to the world of the unfortunates beyond their doors i did not overlook the possibility that there might be another and conceivably sinister interpretation of heissmans confidential frankness but as it was now into the early hours of the morning i didnt particularly feel like seeking it out bear island the resume began one of the svalbard group of which spitzbergen is much the largest this group remained neutral and unclaimed until the beginning of the th century when because of its very considerable investments in the exploitation of mineral resources and the establishment of whaling operation norway requested sovereignty of the area placing her petition before the conferencethey didnt specify what conferenceat christiana in and again in on each occasion russian objections prevented ratification of the proposals however in the allied supreme council granted norway sovereignty formal possession being taken on august having established the ownership beyond all doubt the report proceeded the island w e lies some miles nnw of north cape norway and some miles south of spitzbergen and may be regarded as the meeting point of the norwegian greenland and barents seas in terms of distance from its nearest neighbours this is the most isolated island in the arctic there followed a long and for me highly uninteresting account of the islands history which seemed to consist mainly of interminable squabbles between norwegians germans and russians over whaling and mining rightsalthough i was mildly intrigued to learn that as recently as the s there had been as many as a hundred and eighty norwegians working the coal mines at tunheim in the northeast of the islandi would have imagined that even the polar bears after whom the island was named would have given this desolation as wide a berth as possible the mines it seemed had been closed down following a geological survey which showed that the purity and thickness of the seams were not sufficient to make it a profitable proposition the island however was not entirely uninhabited even today it appeared that the norwegian government maintained a meteorological and radio station at tunheim then came articles on the natural resources vegetation and animal life all of which i took as read the references to the climate however which might be expected to concern us all i found much more intriguing and highly discouraging the meeting of the gulf stream and the polar drift it read makes for extremely poor weather conditions with large rainfall and dense fogs the average summer temperature rises to not more than five degrees above freezing not until midjuly do the lakes become icefree and the snow melts the midnight sun lasts for days from april th to august th the sun remains below the horizon from november th to february th this last item made our presence there this late in the year very odd indeed as otto couldnt expect more than a few hours of daylight at the most perhaps the script called for the whole story to be shot in darkness physical and geological it went on bear island is triangular in shape with its apex to the south being approximately twelve miles long on its northsouth axis and in width varying from ten miles in the north to two miles in the south at the point where the southernmost peninsula begins generally speaking the north and west consist of a fairly flat plateau at an elevation of about a hundred feel while the south and cast is mountainous the two main complexes being the misery fell group in the east and the antaretiefjell and its associated mountains the alfredfjcil hambergfiell and fuglefiell in the extreme southeast there are no glaciers the entire area is covered with a network of shallow lakes none more than a few yards in depth those account for about onetenth of the total area of the island the remainder of the interior of the island consists largely of icy swamps and loose scree which makes it extremely difficult to traverse the coastline of bear island is regarded as perhaps the most inhospitably bleak in the world this is especially true in the south where the island ends in vertical cliffs the streams entering the sea by waterfalls a characteristic feature of this area is the detached pillars of rock that stand in the sea close to the foot of the cliffs remnants from that distant period when the island was considerably larger than it is now the melting of the snows and ice in junejuly the powerful tidal streams and the massive erosion undermining those coastal hills so that large masses of rock are constantly falling into the sea the great dolomite cliffs of hambergfjcil drop sheer for over feet at their base projecting from the seas are sharp needles of rock as much as feet high while the fuglefiell cliffs are almost as high and have at their most southerly point a remarkable series of high stacks pinnacles and arches to the east of this point between kapp bull and kapp kolthoff is a bay surrounded on three sides by vertical cliffs which are nowhere less than feethigh those cliffs are the finest bird breeding grounds in the northern hemisphere it was all very fine for the birds i supposed that was the end of the geographical societys reportor as much of it as the writer had chosen to includeand i was bracing myself for a return to heissmans limpid prose when the lee door opened and john halliday staggered in halliday the units highly competent stills photographer was a dark swarthy taciturn and unsmiling american even by his normal cheerless standards halliday looked uncommonly glum he caught sight of us and stood there uncertainly holding the door open im sorry he made as if to go i didnt know enter enter i said things are not as they seem what you see before you is a strictly doctorpatient relationship he closed the door and sat down morosely on the settee that mary stuart had so lately occupied insomnia i asked a touch of the mal demier insomnia he chewed dispiritedly on the wad of black tobacco that never seemed to leave his mouth the mal de mers all sandys sandy i knew was his cabinmate true sandy hadnt been looking very bright when last id seen him in the galley but id attributed this to haggertys yearning to eviscerate him at least it explained why he hadnt called in to see the duke after hed left us bit under the weather is he very much under the weather kind of a funny green colour and sick all over the damned carpet halliday wrinkled his nose the smell mary i shook her gently and she opened sleepdulled eyes sorry ive got to go for a moment she said nothing as i halfhelped her to a sitting position just glanced incuriously at halliday and closed her eyes again i dont think hes all that bad halliday said not poisoning or anything like that i mean im sure of it no harm to take a look i said halliday was probably right on the other hand sandy had had the freedom of the galley before haggerty had caught him and with sandys prehensile and sticky fingers anything was conceivable including the possibility that his appetite was not quite as birdlike as he claimed i picked up my medical bag and left as halliday had said sandy was of a rather peculiar greenish shade and hed obviously been very sick indeed he was sitting propped up in his bunk with both forearms wrapped round his middle he glared at me balefully as i entered christ im dying he wheezed he swore briefly pungently and indiscriminately at life in general and otto in particular why that crazy bastard wants to drag us aboard this bloody old stinking hell ship i gave him some sleeping sedatives and left i was beginning to find sandy a rather less than sympathetic character more importantly sufferers from aconitine poisoning couldnt speak far less indulge in the fluent billingsgate in which sandy was clearly so proficient swaying from side to side and again with her arms stretched out to support herself mary stuart still had her eyes shut halliday dejectedly chewing his wad of tobacco looked up at me in lackadaisical halfenquiry as if he didnt much care whether sandy was alive or dead youre right i said just the weather i sat down a little way from mary stuart and not as much as by a flicker of a closed eyelid did she acknowledge my presence i shivered involuntarily and drew the steamer rug around me i said its getting a bit nippy in this saloon why dont you take one of these and kip down here no thanks id no idea it would be so damn cold here my blankets and pillow and its me for the lounge he smiled faintly just as long as lonnie doesnt trample all over me with his hobnailed boots in the middle watch it was apparently common knowledge that the liquor in the lounge drew lonnie like a lodestone halliday chewed some more then nodded at the bottle in captain imries wroughtiron stand youre a whisky man doe thats the stuff to warm you up agreed but im a very choosy whisky man what is it halliday peered black label none better but im a malt man myself youre cold you try some its on the house stole it from otto im not much of a one for scotch now bourbon corrodes the digestive tract i speak as a medical man now one sip of that stuff there and youll swear off those lethal kentucky brews forever go on try it halliday looked at the bottle as if uncertainly i said to mary stuart how about you just a little youve no idea how it warms the cockles she opened her eyes and gave me that oddly expressionless look no thank you i hardly ever drink she closed her eyes again the flaw that makes for perfection i said absently because my mind was on other things halliday wouldnt drink from that bottle mary stuart wouldnt drink from that bottle but halliday seemed to think it was a good idea that i should had they both remained in their seats during my absence or had they been busy little bees one keeping guard against my premature return while the other altered the character of the black label with ingredients not necessarily made in scotland why else had halliday come up to the saloon if not to lure me away why hadnt he gone direct to the lounge with blankets and pillow instead of wandering aimlessly up here to the saloon where he must have known from mealtimes that the temperature was considerably colder than it was down below because of course before mary stuart had made her presence known to me here shed seen me through the outer windows and had reported to halliday that a certain problem had arisen that could only be solved by bringing about my temporary absence from the saloon sandys sickness had been a convenient coincidenceif it had been a coincidence i suddenly thought if halliday was the person or was in cahoots with the person who was so handy with poisons then the introduction of some mildly emetic potion into sandys drink would have involved no more problem than that of opportunity it all added up i became aware that halliday was on his feet and was lurching unsteadily in my direction bottle in one hand and glass in the other the bottle i noticed almost mechanically was about one third full he halted swaying in front of me and poured a generous measure into the glass bowed slightly offered me the glass and smiled maybe were both on the hidebound and conservative side doe in the words of the song i will if you will so will i i smiled back your willingness to experiment does you credit but no thanks i told you i just dont like the stuff ive tried it have you no but i well how can you tell then i dont think you were going to try it anyway go on drink it mary stuart opened her eyes do you always make people drink against their will is this what doctors doforce alcohol on those who dont want it i felt like scowling and saying why dont you shut up but instead i smiled and said teetotal objections overruled so whats the harm halliday said he had the glass to his lips i stared at him until i remembered i shouldnt be staring which was all of a fraction of a second smiled indulgently glanced at mary stuart whose ever so slightly compressed lips registered no more than a trace of prudish disapproval then looked back in time to see halliday lowering his half empty glass not bad he pronounced not bad at all kind of a funny taste though you could be arrested in scotland for saying that i said mechanically the villain had nonchalantly quaffed the hemlock while his accomplice had looked on with indifference i felt very considerably diminished a complete and utter idiot as a detective my inductive and deductive powers added up to zero i even felt like apologising to them except that they wouldnt know what i was talking about you may in fact be right doe one could even get to like this stuff halliday topped up his glass drank again took the bottle across to its wroughtiron rest and resumed his former scat he sat there silently for perhaps half a minute finished off the scotch with a couple of swallows and rose abruptly to his feet with that lot inside me i can even ignore lonnies hobnails good night all he hurried from the saloon i looked at the doorway through which he had vanished my mind thoughtful my face not i still didnt understand why he had come to the saloon in the first place and what thought had so suddenly occurred to him to precipitate so abrupt a departure an unprofitable line of thinking to pursue i couldnt even find a starting point to begin theorising i looked at mary stuart and felt very guilty indeed murderesses i knew came in all shapes sizes and guises but if they came in this particular guise then i could never trust my judgement again i wondered what on earth could have led me to entertain so ludicrous a suspicion i must be even more tired than i thought as if conscious of my gaze she opened her eyes and looked at me she had this extraordinary ability to assume this still and wholly expressionless face but beneath this remoteness this distance this aloofness lay i thought a marked degree of vulnerability wishful thinking on my part it was possible but i was oddly certain it wasnt still without speaking still without altering her expression or lack of it she halfrose hobbled awkwardly in her cocoon of steamer rugs and sat close beside me in my best avuncular fashion i put my arm round her shoulders but it didnt stay there for long for she took hold of my wrist and deliberately and without haste lifted my arm over the top of her head and pushed it clear of her just to show that doctors are superhuman and incapable of being offended by patients who arent really responsible for their own behaviour i smiled at her she smiled back at me and her eyes i saw with an astonishment that i knew was not reflected in my face were filled with unshed tears almost as if she were aware of those tears and wished to hide them she suddenly swung her legs up on the settee turned towards me and got back to the shortrange examination of my shirt front only this time she put both her arms around me as far as freedom of mobility was concerned i was as good as handcuffed which was doubtless what she wanted anyway that she harboured no lethal intent towards me i was sure i was equally sure that she was determined not to let me out of her sight and that this was the most effective way she knew of doing just that how much it cost that proud and lonely person to behave like this i couldnt guess even less could i imagine what made her do it at all i sat there and tried to mull things over in my now thoroughly befogged mind and predictably made no progress whatsoever besides my tired eyes were being almost hypnotised by the behaviour of the scotch inside the black label bottle with the almost metronomic regularity with which the liquid ascended and descended the opposite sides of the bottle in l response to the regular pitching of the morning rose one thing led to another and i said mary dear yes she didnt turn her face up to look at me and i didnt have to be told why the area around the level of my fourth shirt button was becoming noticeably damp i dont want to disturb you but its time for my nightcap whisky ah two hearts that beat as one no she tightened her arms no i hate the smell of whisky im glad i said sotto voce im not married to you what was that i said yes mary dear five more minutes passed and i realised that my mind had closed down for the night idly i picked up the olympus manifesto read some rubbish about the sole completed copy of the screenplay being deposited in the vault of a london bank and put it down again mary stuart was breathing quietly and evenly and seemed to be asleep i bent and blew lightly on the left eyelid which was about the only part of her face that i could see it didnt quiver she was asleep i shifted my position experimentally not much and her arms automatically tightened round me shed clearly left a note to her subconscious before turning in for the night i resigned myself to remaining where i was it wasnt a form of imprisonment that was likely to scar me permanently i wondered vaguely whether the idea behind this silken incarceration was to prevent me from doing things or from chancing upon some other devilry that might well be afoot i was too tired to care i made up my mind just to sit there and keep a sleepless vigil until the morning came i was asleep within not more than two minutes mary stuart was not and didnt look as if she was built along the lines of a coalheaver but she wasnt stuffed with swansdown either for when i woke my left arm was asleep wholly numb and almost useless a realization that was brought home to me when i had to reach across my right hand to lift up my left wrist to see what time the luminous hands of my watch said it was they said it was it says much for my mental acuity that at least ten seconds elapsed before it occurred to me why it had been necessary for me to consult the luminous hands because it was dark of course but why was the saloon dark every light had been on when id gone to sleep and what had wakened me something had i knew without knowing why that i hadnt wakened naturally but that there had been some external cause what and where was the cause a sound or a physical contact it couldnt be anything else and whoever was responsible for whatever it had been was still with me he had to be insufficient time had elapsed since id waked for him to have left the saloon more importantly the hairs on the back of my neck told me there was another and inimical presence in the saloon with me gently i took hold of mary stuarts wrists to ease her arms away again the resistance was automatic hers was not a subconscious to go to sleep on the job but i was in no mood to be baulked by any subconscious i prised her arms free slid along the settee lowered her carefully to the horizontal rose and moved out towards the middle of the saloon i stood quite still my hands grasping the edge of a table to brace my self my breathing almost stopped as i listened intently i could have spared myself the trouble i was sure that the weather had moderated not a great deal but enough to be just noticeable since id gone to sleep but it hadnt moderated to the extent where any stealthy movementsand i could expect none othercould possibly be heard above the sound of the wind and the seas the metallic creakings and groanings of the ancient plates and rivets of the morning rose the nearest set of light switchesthere was a duplicate set by the stewards pantrywas by the lee door i took one step in the remembered direction then stopped did the presence in the room know that i was awake and on my feet were his eyes more attuned to the darkness than my newly opened ones could he dimly discern my figure would he guess that my first move would be towards the switches and was he preparing to block my way if he were how would he block my way would he be carrying a weapon and what kind of weaponi was acutely aware that all i had were two hands the left one still a fairly useless lump of tingling pins and needles i stopped irresolute i heard the metallic click of a door handle and a gust of icy air struck me the presence was leaving by the lee door i reached the door in four steps stepped outside on to the deck flung up an instinctively protective right forearm as a bright light abruptly struck my eyes and immediately wished i had used my left forearm instead for then it might have offered me some measure of protection against something hard heavy and very solid that connected forcibly and painfully with the left side of my neck i clung to the outside edge of the door to support myself but i didnt seem to have much strength left in my hands and i seemed to have none at all in my legs for although i remained quite conscious i sank to the deck as if my legs had been filleted by the time the momentary paralysis had passed and i was able to use the support of the door to drag myself shakily to my feel i was alone on the deck i had no idea where my assailant had gone and the matter was one of only academic interest my legs could barely cope with supporting my weight in a static go position even the thought of running or negotiating ladders and companionways at speed was preposterous still clinging to whatever support was at hand i stepped back into the saloon fumbled the lights on and pulled the lee door closed behind me mary stuart was propped on an elbow the heel of one palm rubbing an eye while the lid of the other was halfopen in the fashion of a person just rousing from a very deep or drugged sleep i looked away stumbled towards captain imries table and sat down heavily in his chair i lifted the bottle of black label from its stand it was halffull for what seemed quite a long time but could have been no more than seconds i stared at this bottle not seeing it then looked away to locate the glass that halliday had been using it was nowhere to be seen it could have fallen and rolled out of sight in a dozen different directions i selected another glass from the table rack splashed some scotch into it drank it and made my way back to my seat my neck felt awful one good shake of my head and it would fall off dont breathe through your nose i said and youll hardly smell the demon drink at all i propped her up to a sitting position rearranged her rugs and forestalled her by for a change putting my arms around her i said there now what was it what happened her voice was low and had a shake to it just the door wind blew it open had to close it thats all but the lights were off i put them off just after youd gone to sleep she wriggled an arm free from the blankets and gently touched the side of my neck its colouring already she whispered its going to be a huge ugly bruise and its bleeding i reached up with my handkerchief and she wasnt making any mistake i stuffed my handkerchief into my collar and left it there she went on in the same little voice flow did it happen one of those stupid things i slipped on the snow and struck my neck on the storm sill of the door does ache a bit i must say she didnt answer she freed her other arm caught me by both lapels stared at me with a face full of misery and put her forehead on my shoulder now it was my collars turn to become damp it was the most extraordinary behaviour for a wardressthat her function was to keep tabs on and effectively immobilise me i was increasingly surebut then she was the most extraordinary wardress id ever come across and the nicest dr marlowe i said the lady is in distress and you are but human i let my suspicions take five and stroked the tangled yellow hair id been led to believe i forgot by what or by whom that nothing was as conducive to the calming of upset feminine feelings as that soothing gesture only seconds later i was wondering where id picked up this piece of obviously blatant misinformation for she suddenly pushed herself upright and struck me twice on the shoulder with the base of her clenched left fist i was more than ever convinced that she wasnt made of swansdown dont do that she said dont do that all right i said agreeably i wont do that im sorry no no please im sorry i dont know what made mei really she stopped speaking although her lips kept on moving and stared at me with tearfilled eyes the no longer beautiful face defenceless and defeated and full of despair it made me feel acutely uncomfortable for i do not like to see proud and selfcontained people thus reduced there was a quick indrawing of breath then astonishingly she had her arms wound round my neck and so tightly that it would appear that she was bent upon my instant asphyxiation she wept in silence her shoulders shaking splendidly done i thought approvingly quite splendidly done irrespective of for whose benefit it might beand then i despised myself for my cynicism quite apart from the fact that her acknowledged limitations as an actress put such a performance out of the question i was convinced without knowing why i was convinced that what i was seeing was genuine uninhibited emotion and what on earth had she to gain by pretending to lower her defences in front of me for whom then the tears not for me of that i was certain why in the world for me i scarcely knew her she scarcely knew me i was only a shoulder to cry on likely enough i was only a doctors shoulder to cry on people have the oddest misconceptions about doctors and maybe their shoulders are regarded as being more reliable and comforting than the average or more absorbent nor were the tears for herself i was equally certain of that to survive intact the kind of upbringing shed hinted shed had one had to be possessed of an unusual degree of selfreliance and mental toughness that almost automatically excluded considerations of selfpity so for whom then the tears i didnt know and at that moment i hardly cared in normal circumstances and with no other matter so significantly important as to engage my attention so lovely a girl in such obvious distress would have had my complete and undivided concern but the circumstances were abnormal and my thoughts were elsewhere engaged with an intensity that made mary stuarts odd behaviour seem relatively unimportant i couldnt keep my eyes from the bottle of scotch by the captains table when halliday had had at my insistence as i now bitterly recalled his first drink the bottle had been about a third full after his second drink it had been about a quarter full and now it was half full the quiet and violent man who had so recently switched off the lights and moved through the saloon had switched bottles and for good measure had removed the glass that halliday had used mary stuart said something her voice so muffled and indistinct that i couldnt make it out what with salt tears and salt blood this nights work was going to cost me a new shirt i said what she moved her head enough to enable her to speak more clearly but not enough to let me see her face im sorry im sorry i was such a fool will you forgive me i squeezed her shoulder in what was more or less an automatic gesture my eyes and my thoughts were still on that bottle but she seemed to take it as sufficient answer she said hesitantly are you going to sleep again she hadnt stopped being as foolish as she thought or perhaps she wasnt being foolish at all no mary dear im not going to sleep again whatever tone of firm resolution my tone carried it was superfluous the throbbing pain in my neck was sufficient guarantee of my wakefulness well thats all right then i didnt ask what this cryptic remark was intended to convey physically we couldnt have been closer but mentally i was no longer with her i was with halliday the man whom i had thought had come to kill me the man id practically forced to have a drink the man whod drunk what had been intended for me i knew i would never see him again not alive dawn in those high latitudes and at that time of year did not come until halfpast ten in the morning and it was then that we buried the three dead men antonio and moxen and scott and surely their shades would have forgiven us for the almost indecent dispatch with which their funerals were carried out for that driving blizzard was still at its height the wind was full of razored knives and struck through both clothes and flesh and laid its icy fingers on the marrow captain imrie a large and brassbound bible in his mittened hands read swiftly through the burial service or at least i assumed he did he could have been reading the sermon on the mount for all i could tell the wind just plucked the inaudible words from his mouth and carried them out over the greywhite desolation of waters three times a canvaswrapped bundle slid smoothly out from beneath the morning boses only union flag three times a bundle vanished soundlessly beneath the surface of the sea we could see the splashes but not hear them for our cars were full of the high and lonely lament of the winds requiem in the frozen rigging on land mourners customarily find it difficult to tear themselves away from a newly filled grave but here there was no grave there was nothing to look at and the bitter cold was sufficient to drive from every mind any thought other than that of immediate shelter and warmth besides captain imrie had said that it was an old fishermans custom to drink a toast to the dead whether it was or not i had no idea it could well have been a custom that imrie had invented himself and certainly the deceased had been no fisherman but whatever its origin im sure that it made its contributory effect towards the extremely rapid clearing of the decks i remained where i was i felt inhibited from joining the others not because i found captain imries proposal distasteful or ethically objectionableonly the most hypocritical could find in the christian ethic a bar to wishing bon voyage to the departedbut because in crowded surroundings it could be very difficult to see who was filling my glass and what he was filling it with moreover id had no more than three hours sleep the previous night my mind was tired and a bit fuzzy round the edges and it was my hope that the admittedly heroic treatment of exposure to an arctic blizzard might help to blow some of the cobwebs away i took a firm hold on one of the numerous lifelines that were rigged on deck edged my way out to the largest of one of the numerous deck cargoes we were carrying took what illusory shelter was offered in its lee and waited for the cobwebs to fly away halliday was dead i hadnt found his body id searched casually and unobtrusively every likely and most of the unlikely places of concealment on the morning rose he had vanished and left no trace halliday i knew was lying in the black depths of the barents sea how hed got there i didnt know and it didnt seem to be important it could be that someone had helped him over the side but it was even more probable that he had required no assistance hed left the saloon as abruptly as he had because the poison in his scotchmy scotchhad been as fast acting as it had been deadly he had felt the urgent need to be sick and the obvious place to be sick was over the side a slip on the snow or ice one of the hundreds of troughseeking lurches that the trawler had experienced during the night and in what must have been by that time his ill weakened and dazed state he would have been quite unable to prevent himself from pitching over the low guardrails the only consolation if consolation it was was that he had probably succumbed from poison before his lungs had filled with water i did not subscribe to the popular belief that death from drowning was a relatively easy and painless way to go if for no other reason than that it was a theory that in the nature of things lacked positive documentation i was as certain as could be that hallidays absence had so far gone unnoticed by everyone except myself and the person responsible for his death and there was not even certainty about that last point it was quite possible that he knew nothing of hallidays brief visit to the saloon true halliday had not appeared for breakfast but as a few others had done the same and those who had come had done so intermittently over the best part of a couple of hours his absence had gone unremarked his cabinmate sandy was still feeling under the weather to the extent that hallidays presence or absence was a matter of total indifference to him and as halliday had been very much a solitary there was no one who would be sufficiently concerned to enquire anxiously as to his whereabouts i hoped that his absence remained undiscovered as long as possible although the signed guarantee given to captain imrie that morning had contained no specific reference as to the action to be taken in the event of someone going missing he was quite capable of seizing upon this as a pretext to abandon the trip and make with all speed for hammerfest the match id left jammed between the foot of my cabin door and the sill had no longer been in position when id returned to my cabin early in the morning the coins id left in the linen pockets of the lids of my suitcases had shifted position from the front to the back of the pockets sure evidence that my cases had been opened in my absence it says much for my frame of mind that the discovery occasioned me no particular surprisewhich was in itself surprising for although someone aboard was aware that the good doctor had been boning up on aconitine and so had more than a fair idea that the poisoning had not been accidental that in itself was hardly reason to start examining the doctors hand luggage more than ever it behooved me to watch my back i heard a sound behind my back my instinctive reaction was to take a couple of rapid steps forward who knew what hard or sharp implement might be coming at my occiput or shoulder blades then whirl round but a simultaneous reasoning told me that it was unlikely that anyone would propose to do me in on the upper deck in daylight under the interested gaze of watchers on the bridge so i turned round leisurely and saw charles conrad moving into what little shelter was offered in the lee of the bulk deck cargo whats this then i said the morning constitutional at all costs or dont you fancy captain imries scotch neither he smiled curiosity is all he tapped the tarpaulin covered bulk beside us it was close on ten feetin height semicylindricalthe base was flatand was lashed in position by at least a dozen steel cables do you know what this is is this a clever question yes prefabricated arcticised buts or so the word went in wick six of them designed to fit one inside the other for ease of transportation thats it made of bonded ply kapok insulation asbestos and aluminium he pointed to another bulky item of deck cargo immediately foreword of the one behind which we were sheltering this peculiarly shaped object appeared to be roughly oval along its length perhaps six feet high and this another clever question of course and my answer will be wrong again if you still believe what you were told in wick yes those arent huts because we dont need huts were heading for an area called the sorhamnathe south havenwhere there already are huts and perfectly usable ones bloke called lerner came there seventy years ago prospecting for coalwhich he found by the way a bit of an oddball who painted the rocks on the shore in the german national colours to indicate that this was private property he built hutshe even built a road across the headland to the nearest bay the kvalross bukta or walrus bay after him a german fishing company based themselves hereand they built huts more importantly a norwegian scientific expedition spent nine months here during the most recent international geophysical year and they built huts whatever else is lacking at south haven its not accommodation youre very well informed i dont forget something that i finished reading only half an hour ago comin and goins been making the rounds this morning handing out copies of the prospectus of whats going to be the greatest film ever made didnt you get one from him yes he forgot to give me a dictionary though a dictionary would have helped he tapped the tarpaulin beside us this is a mockup of the central section of a submarinejust a shell nothing inside it when i say its a mockup i dont mean its made of cardboardits made of steel and weighs ten tons including four tons of iron ballast that other item in front is a conning tower which is to be bolted onto this once its in the water ah i said because i couldnt think of any other comment and those alleged tractors and drums of fuel on the afterdecktheyll be tanks and antiaircraft guns tractors and fuel as stated he paused do you know theres only one copy of the screenplay for this film and that thats locked up in the bank of england or some such i went to sleep about that bit they havent even got a shooting script for the scenes to be shot on the island just a series of unrelated incidents which taken together make no sense at all sure there must be connecting links to make sense of it all but theyre all in the vaults in threadneedle street or wherever this damned bank is no part of it makes sense maybe its not meant to make sense i was conscious that my feet were slowly turning into blocks of ice not at this stage there may be excellent reasons for the secretiveness besides dont some producers encourage directors who play it off the cuff who improvise as they go along and as the mood takes them not neal divine hes never shot an offthecuff scene in his life not much of conrads forehead was to be seen beneath the thick brown hair that the snow and wind had brought down almost to eyebrow level but what little was visible was very heavily corrugated indeed if a divine shooting script calls for you to be wearing a bowler hat and doing the cancan in scene then youre doing a bowlerhatted cancan in as for otto he never moves until everythings calculated out to the last matchstick and the last penny especially the last penny he has the reputation for being a little careful careful conrad shivered doesnt the whole setup strike you as being crazy the entire film world i said candidly strikes me as being crazy but as an ordinary human being being exposed to it for the first time i wouldnt know whether this current particular brand of craziness differs from the norm or not what do your fellow actors think of it what fellow actors conrad said glumly judith haynes is still closeted with those two pooches of hers mary stuart is writing letters in her cabin at least she says its letters its probably her last will and testament and if gunther jungbeck and jon heyter have any opinion on everything theyre carefully keeping it to themselves anyway they are a couple of oddballs themselves even for actors touche he smiled but he wasnt trying too hard sea burials bring out the misanthrope in me no its just that they know so little about the elm world at least the british film world understandable enough i suppose heyters done all his acting in california jungbeck in germany theyre not odd really its just that we have nothing in common to talk about no points of reference but you must know of them not even that but thats not surprising i like acting but the film world bores me to tears and i dont mix socially that makes me an oddball too but otto vouches for themin fact he speaks pretty highly of them and thats good enough for me theyll both probably act me off the screen when it comes to the bit he shivered again conrads curiosity remains unsatisfied but conrad has had enough as a doctor wouldnt you prescribe some of this scotch which old imrie is supposed to be dispensing so liberally we found captain imrie dispensing the scotch with so heavy a hand that plainly it came from his own private supplies and not from ottos for otto heavily wrapped in a coloured blanket and with his puce complexion still a pale shadow of its former self was sitting in his accustomed dining chair and raising no objections that i could see there must have been at least twenty people present ships crew and passengers and they were very far indeed from being a merry throng i was surprised to see judith haynes there with her husband michael stryker hovering attentively over her i was surprised to see mary darling there her sense of duty or what was the done thing must have been greater than her aversion to alcohol and was even more surprised to note that she had so abandoned all sense of the priorities as to be holding young allen by the arm in a positively proprietorial fashion i was not surprised to see that mary stuart was absent so were heissman and sandy the two actors with whom conrad claimed to have so little in common jungbeck and heyter were together in one corner and for the first time i looked at them with some degree of real interest they looked like actors no question of that or more accurately they looked like what i thought actors ought to look like heyter was tall fair goodlooking young and twenty years ago would have been referred to as cleancut he had a mobile expressive animated face jungbeck was at least fifteen years his senior a thickset man with heavy shoulders a five oclock shadow and dark curling hair just beginning to grey he had a ready engaging smile he was cast i knew as the villain in the forthcoming production and despite the appropriate build and blue jowls didnt look the least bit like one the almost complete silence in the saloon i soon realised didnt stem entirely from the solemnity of the occasion although that element must have been there captain imrie had been holding the floor and had only broken off to acknowledge our entrance and to take the opportunity of dispensing some more liquor which i refused and now it was clear captain imrie was taking up where he had left off aye he said heavily tis fitting tis fitting they have gone today sadly tragically gone three of britains sonsi was almost glad for the moment that antonio was no longer aroundbut it comes to us all sooner or later the hour strikes and if they must rest where better to lie than in those honoured waters of bear island where ten thousand of their countrymen sleep i wondered uncharitably what hour struck when captain imrie poured himself his first restorative of the morning but then recalled that as he had been up since am he was no doubt now rightly regarding the day as being pretty far advanced a supposition which he proceeded to prove correct by replenishing his glass without however interrupting the smooth flow of his monologue his audience i noted with regret had about them the look of men and women who wished themselves elsewhere i wonder what bear island means to you people he went on nothing i suppose why should it its just a name bear island just a name like the isle of wight or whats yon place in america coney island just a name but for people like mr stokes here and myself and thousands of others its a wee bit more than that it was a kind of turning point a dividing point in our lives what those geography or geology fellows would call a watershed when we came to know the name we knew that no name had ever meant so much to us beforeand no name would ever mean so much again and we knew that nothing would ever be the same again bear island was the place where boys grew up just over the night as it were bear island was the place where middleaged men like myself grew old this was a different captain imrie speaking now quietly reminiscent sad without bitterness and the captive audience was now voluntarily so no longer glancing longingly at the saloon exits we called it the gate he went on the gate to the barents sea and the white sea and those places in russia where we took those convoys through all the long years of the war all those long years ago if you passed the gate and came back again you were a lucky man if you did it halfadozen times youd used up all your luck for a lifetime how many times did we pass the gate mr stokes twentytwo times for once mr stokes had no need for deliberation twentytwo times i am not saying it because i was there but people on those convoys to murmansk suffered more terribly than people have ever suffered in war before or will ever suffer in war again and it was here in those waters at the gate that they suffered most of all for it was here that the enemy waited by night and by day and it was here that the enemy struck us down the fine ships and the fine boys our boys and the german boys more of them lie in those waters than anywhere in the world but the waters run clean now and the blood is washed away but not in our minds not in our minds thirty years have passed now and i cannot hear the words bear island not even when i say them myself but my blood runs cold the graveyard of the arctic and we hope they are at peace now but still my blood runs cold he shivered as if he felt a physical chill then smiled slightly the old talk too much a blether talks too much so you know now how terrible it is to have an old blether stand before you all id really meant to say is that our shipmates are in good company he raised his glass bon voyage bon voyage but not the last goodbve not the last time we would be saying goodbye i felt it deep in my bones and i knew that captain imrie felt it also i knew that it was some sort of foreknowledge or premonition that had made him talk as he had done that had been responsible for a rambling reminiscence as uncalled for as it was irrelevantor appeared to be i wondered if captain imrie was even dimly aware of this thought transference process of the substitution of the fearful things the dreadful things of long ago for the unrealised awareness that such things were not confined to the actions of overt warfare that violent death acknowledged no restrictions in time and space that the bleak and barren waters of the barents sea were its habitat and its home i wondered how many others of those present felt this atavistic fear this oddly nameless dread so often encountered in the loneliest and most desolate places on earth a dread that reaches back over the aeons to primitive man who as yet knew not fire to those unthinkably distant ancestors who crouched in terror in their lightless caves while the forces of evil and darkness walked abroad in the night a fear that here and now was all too readily reinforced and compounded by the sudden violent and inexplicable deaths of three of their company the previous night it was hard to tell i thought just who was feeling affected by such primeval stirrings of foreboding for mankind does not readily acknowledge even to itself far less show or discuss the existence of such irrationally childlike superstitions captain imrie and mr stokes without a doubt they had gone into a corner by themselves and were staring down unseeingly i was sure and certainly without speaking at the glasses in their hands and as the two of them rarely if ever sat together without discussing at great length matters of the gravest import this was highly significant in itself neal divine more hollowchecked than ever but apparently slightly recovered from his very low state of the previous evening sat by himself continuously twirling the empty glass in his hand his usual nervous preoccupied self but whether he was preoccupied with mal de nter the thought that he was about to begin his directorial duties and so consequently be exposed to the lash of gerrans tongue or whether he too was feeling fingers from the dead past reach deep into him was impossible to say comin and goin was seated by otto at the head of the table and they too were silent i wondered just what the relationship between the two men was they seemed to he on cordial enough terms but they only sought each other out i had observed when questions of business were to be discussed it could well have been that personally they had little in common but the fact that comin and goin had recently been made vicepresident and heirapparent to olympus productions seemed to speak highly enough of ottos regard for him and as they were together now and not talking i assumed that they were pondering over matters similar to those that were engaging the attention of imrie and myself the three apostles werent talking but that meant nothing when they were deprived of their instruments their music magazines and their garishly primarycoloured comics the presence of all of which they had probably deemed as being inappropriate in the present circumstances they were habitually bereft of speech stryker still in solicitously close attendance upon his wife was talking quietly to the count while the duke was conspicuously not talking to his cabinmate eddie but as they were rarely on speaking terms anyway this was hardly significant i became aware that lonnie gilbert was at my elbow and i wondered what degree if any of the underlying significance of captain imries words had penetrated his befuddled mind lonnie was clutching a glass of scotch both container and contents of genuine family size a marked contrast to the relatively small portions hed been pouring himself in the lounge bar about midnight i could only assume that somewhere in the remoter recesses of lonnies mind there lurked some vestigial traces of conscience which permitted him only modest amounts of hooch not honestly come by envy and calumny and hate and pain and that unrest which men miscall delight shall touch them not and torture not again lonnie intoned he tilted his glass lowered the liquid level by two fingers and smacked his lips from the contagion lonnie i nodded at the glass when did you start this morning start my dear fellow i never stopped a sleepless night from the contagion of the worlds slow stain they are secure and now can never mourn the heart grown cold the head grown grey aware that he had lost his audience lonnie broke off and followed my line of sight mary darling and allen proprieties observed were leaving mary hesitated stopped in front of judith hayness chair smiled and said good morning miss haynes i hope youre feeling better today judith haynes smiled a fractionally glimpsed set of perfect teeth then looked away a false smile meant to be seen and understood as a false smile followed by a complete and contemptuous dismissal i saw colour stain mary darlings cheeks and she made as if to speak but allen his lips tight took her arm and urged her gently towards the lee door well well i said i wonder what all that was about a clearly offended miss haynes but i cant conceive of our little mary giving offence to anybody but she has done my boy she has done our judith is one of those sad and unfortunate females who cant abide any other female who is younger better looking or more intelligent than she is our little mary offends on at least two of those counts you disappoint me i said here i was manfully trying to discount or at least ignorewhat appears to be the universally held opinion that judith haynes is a complete and utter bitch and now and you were right lonnie regarded his empty glass with an expression of faint astonishment she isnt a bitch at least she doesnt make a career out of it except inadvertently to those who offer no threat or competition little children or pets she is capable of generous impulses even affection but that apart a poor poor creature incapable of loving or inspiring love in others to wit and in short a loveless soul perverse but pitiable a person who having once seen herself and not liking what she has seen turns away from reality and takes refuge in misanthropic fantasy lonnie executed a swift sideways scuttle in the direction of an unattended scotch bottle replenished his glass with the speed and expertise born of a lifetime of practice returned happily and warmed to his theme sick sick sick and it is the sick not the whole who require our help and sympathy lonnie could on occasion sound very pontifical indeed shes one of the hapless band of the worlds willing walking wounded hows that four ws and never a stutterwho take a positive delight in being hurt in being affronted and if the hurt is not really there why then all the better they can imagine one even closer to the hearts desire for those unfortunates who love only themselves the loving embrace of selfpity close hugged like an old and dear friend is the supreme the most precious luxury in life i can assure you my dear fellow that no hippo ever wallowed in his african mud bath with half the relish im sure youre right lonnie i said and a very apt analogy that is too i wasnt listening to him any more my attention had been caught and held by the fleeting glimpse id had of a figure hurrying by on the deck outside heissman i was almost sure it was heissman and if it were id three immediate questions that asked for equally immediate answers heissman was rarely observed to move at any but the most deliberate and leisurely speed so why the uncharacteristic haste why if he were moving aft did he choose the weather instead of the lee side of the superstructure unless he hoped to avoid being observed through the largely snowobscured windows on the weather side of the saloon and what in view of his wellknown and almost pathological aversion to coldan inevitable legacy one supposed of his long years in siberiawas he doing on the upper deck anyway i clapped lonnie on the shoulder tack as the saying goes in a trice i have to visit the sick i left not hurriedly through the lee door then paused to see if anyone was interested enough in my departure to follow me out and someone did follow me almost immediately but if he had any interest in my movements he wasnt letting me see it gunther jungbeck smiled at me briefly indifferently and hurried forward to the entrance to the passenger accommodation i waited a few more seconds then climbed up the vertical steel ladder to the boat deck immediately abaft the bridge and radio office i circled the funnel and engine intake fans casing and found no one there i hadnt expected to even a polar bear wouldnt have hung around that bitter and totally exposed boat deck without a very compelling reason i moved aft by one of our two motorised lifeboats took what illusory shelter i could find beside a ventilator and peered out over the afterdeck for the first few moments i could see nothing nothing that was that was likely to be of any interest to me not so much because of the driving snow as the fact that all objects crowding the afterdeckand there were well over a score of them ranging from fuel drums to a sixteenfoot work boat on a special cradlewere so deeply shrouded in their shapeless cocoons of snow that in most cases it was virtually impossible to decide upon not only their identity but whether they were inanimate or not not until any of them might move one of the cocoons stirred a slender ghostly form detaching itself from the shelter of a square bulky object which i knew to be the cabin for a snocat the figure halfturned in my direction and although the face was almost entirely hidden by a hand that held both sides of the parka hood closed against the snow enough of strawcoloured hair showed to let me identify the only person aboard with that colour of hair almost at once she was joined by a person moving into my line of vision from behind the break of the boat deck and i didnt even have to see the thin ascetic face to know that this was heissman he approached the girl directly took her arm without as far as i could see any kind of opposition being offered and said something to her i sank to my knees partly to reduce the risk of detection if either chanced to look up partly to try and make out what was being said the concealment part worked but the eavesdropping failed partly because the wind was in the wrong direction but chiefly because they had their heads very close together either because they regarded suitably low and conspiratorial conversation as being appropriate to the occasion or because they were affording each others faces protection from the snow i inched forwards to the very end of the boat deck and squatted back on my heels with my head bent forward but this was of no help either heissman now had an arm around mary stuarts shoulders and this time the gesture of intimacy did produce a reaction although scarcely the expected one for she reached up an arm around his neck and put her head on his shoulder at least another two minutes were spent in this highly confidential teteetete then they walked slowly away towards the living accommodation heissman still with his arm around the girls shoulders i made no move to follow them for such a move would not only have almost certainly resulted in quick detection but it would have been pointless whatever personal theyd had to say had already been said yoga in the barents sea a voice said behind me thats dedication for you fanatics always carry everything to excess i said i rose awkwardly but without too much haste before turning round for i knew i had nothing to fear from smithy clad in a hooded duffle coat and looking a great deal fitter than he had been doing just before midnight he was looking at me with what might have been an expression of quizzical amusement except that his eyes didnt seem to find anything humorous in what they saw you have to be regular in these things i explained of course he walked past me looked over the boat deck guardrail and examined the deep tracks left in the snow by mary and heissman birdwatching the haunts of coot and tern yes indeed but an oddly assorted pair of love birds wouldnt you say its this film world smithy it seems to be full of very oddly assorted birds odd birds period he nodded foreword towards the charthouse warmth and cheer doe just the place for some more ornithological research there wasnt a great deal of warmth owing to the fact that smithy had left the side door open after hed looked out through the window and observed me moving cautiously along the boat deck but there was a certain amount of cheer in the shape of a bottle he produced from a cupboard he said shall we send for the kings taster i looked at the unbroken lead seal not unless you think someone has brought his own bottling plant aboard ive checked smithy broke the seal we talked last night at least i did you may or may not have listened i was worried last night i thought you might not be levelling with me im worried stiff now because i know youre not because ive taken up ornithology i said mildly that among other things this wholesale poisoning now ive had time to think just a bit of course you couldnt have had any idea who the poisoner wasits hardly conceivable that if you knew the person who had done in that italian boy that youd have let him do the same to six others two of whom were to die in fact you couldnt even have been sure that the whole thing wasnt accidental the poisoning was on so apparently haphazard a basis thank you kindly i said my opinion of smithy had fallen sharply except that it wasnt on an apparently haphazard basis it was haphazard that was last night it was as if he hadnt heard me then you couldnt have had any idea now you can things have happened havent they what things my opinion of smithy had risen sharply he was sure that there was mayhem afoot but why was he making a mental short list guessing as to who might be the handy lad with the aconitenot that he could possibly know the poison used was aconitewondering where he had got it where he kept it now where he had learned to prepare it so skilfully that it could indetectably be introduced into food and not only who was the poisoner but why was the poisoner acting as he did and why the random nature of the poisoning was he basing his guesses just on my stealthy behaviour lots of things not all of which have necessarily lately happened just things that have come to light or seem odd in view of what we might call recent developments for instance why have captain imrie and mr stokes been chosen for the job instead of any two young and efficient yacht and charter skippers and engineers who usually find themselves unemployed at this time of year because theyre so old and so soaked in scotch and rum that they cant tell the time of day twenty hours out of the twentyfour they just dont see what goes on and even if they were to theyd probably attach no significance to it anyway i didnt put down my glass look keenly at smithy or in any other way indicate that i was not listening with undivided attention but i was this thought had never occurred to me smithy continued i said last night that i thought the presence of mr gerran and his company up here at this time in the year was a bit odd i dont think so any more i think its damned peculiar and calls for some sort of rational explanation from your friend otto which were not likely to get hes not my friend i said and this he pulled out a copy of the olympus productions manifesto a load of meaningless rubbish that old smoothie goin has been inflicting on everybody in sight have you goin a smoothie an untrustworthy timeserving moneygrubbing smoothie with his two hands never on speaking terms and id say that even if he werent a professional accountant maybe hed better not be my friend either i said all this ridiculous secrecy they harp on in this claptrap to protect the importance of their damned screenplay a hundred gets one its a screen to protect something an awful lot more important than their screenplay another hundred gets one that theres no screenplay in the bank vaults they speak of for the reason that there is no screenplay and their shooting schedule for bear island have you read that its not even comic just a lot of unrelated incidents about caves and mysterious motorboats and shooting dummy submarines and climbing cliffs and falling into the sea and dying in arctic snows that any eveyearold could have dreamed up youve got a very suspicious mind smithy i said have i not and this young polish actress the blonde one latvian mary stuart what of her a strange one aloof and alone never mixes but when theres illness on the bridge or in ottos cabin or in the cabin of that young lad they call the duke whos there who but our friend mary stuart shes a kind of samaritan would you be so conspicuous if you wanted to avoid attention might be the very best way to achieve it but if thats not the case why make a point of being so damned inconspicuous just now when meeting heissman in a blizzard on the afterdeck i would very much rather i thought have smith for me than against me i said a romantic assignation perhaps with heissman youre not a girl smithy no he grinned briefly but ive met em why are all the big nobs on the management side so pally with otto in public and so critical in private why is a cameraman a director why how did you know that uhhuh so you knew too because captain imrie showed me this guarantee thing that you and the directors of olympus had signed the count had signed as one of them why is the director this divine fellow who is supposed to be so good at his job so scared of otto while lonnie who is not only a permanent alcoholic layabout but latches on to ottos private hooch supplies with impunity doesnt give a damn about him tell me smithy i said just how much time have you been devoting lately to steering and navigating this boat hard to say just about as much time i would say as you have been to the practice of medicine i didnt say touche or anything like that i just let smithy pour some more of the aconitefree drink into my glass and looked out the window at the grey swirling icy world beyond so many whys smithy so many whys why had mary been foregathering clandestinely with heissman when the heissman id observed last night had been so clearly unwell as to be unable to indulge in any skullduggerynot that this ruled out the chilling possibility that heissman might be one of two or more who held life so lightly and might easily be either a principal or a gobetween why had otto though himself a poisoning victim reacted so violently including having been violently illwhen hed heard that antonio had been a poisoning victim had cecils larder raid been as innocuous as he had claimed had sandys who had checked on the aconitine article disposed of the leftovers in the galley been in my cabin during the night and searched my baggage why had he searched my baggage this extremely active poisoner the same man perhaps who had doctored the scotch bottle clobbered me and been responsible for hallidays death again was there more than one of them and if halliday had died accidentally as i was sure he had then why had he come to the saloon where his visit i was equally sure had not been accidental it was all so full of ifs and buts that i was beginning to clutch at ridiculous straws rather than fight my way through the impenetrable fog what accounted for lonnies diatribefor it had amounted to no less against judith haynes to the effect that she detested all mankind especially when they were womankind no doubt miss haynes was as capable of being catty and jealous as many other otherwise likeable females are but one would have thought that she had too much going for her in the way of wealth success fame position and looks to have to bother too much about despising every woman she met but if that were so why had she coldshouldered mary darling but what could that have to do with murder i didnt know but nothing the slightest bit odd i thought gloomily could be dismissed out of hand as having nothing to do with the very odd goingson aboard the morning rose were jungbeck and heyter for instance to be considered as being possibly under suspicion because one had recently followed me from the saloonespecially as conrad had earlier thrown a degree of suspicion on them by disclaiming all knowledge of them as actors or did this factor of apparently throwing suspicion bring conrad himself under just the tiniest cloud dammit to hell i thought wearily if i keep on thinking like this ill he casting young allen as the master poisoner just because hed told me that hed once studied chemistry briefly at university a penny for your thoughts dr marlowe smithy wasnt very much of a one for letting his face act as a front man for his mind dont throw your money away what thoughts two thoughts two kinds of thoughts all the thoughts youre having about all the things youre not telling me and all the guilty thoughts youre having about not telling me them its like a rule of nature i said some people are always more liable to have injustices done to them than others so youve told me all your thoughts no but the ones i havent told arent worth the telling now if i had some facts so you admit something is pretty far wrong of course and youve told me everything you know just not everything you think of course i speak in sorrow smithy said for my lost illusions about the medical profession he reached up under the hood of my parka pulled down the scarf around my neck and stared at what was by now the great multicoloured and bloodencrusted weal on my neck jesus that is something what happened to you i fell the marlowes of this world dont fall theyre pushed where did you fall i didnt much care for the all but imperceptible accent on the word fall upper deck port side i struck my neck on the storm sill of the saloon door did you now i would say that this was caused by what the criminologists call a solid object a very solid object about halfaninch wide and sharpedged the saloon door sill is three inches wide and made of sorborubber all the storm doors on the morning rose areits to make them totally windproof and waterproof or perhaps you hadnt noticed the way you perhaps havent noticed that john halliday the units still photographer is missing how do you know hed shaken me this time not just a little or my face would have shown it but so much that i knew my features stayed rigidly fixed in the same expression you dont deny it i dont know how do you i went down to see the props man this elderly lad they call sandy id heard he was sick and why did you go if it matters because bes not the sort of person that people visit very much he doesnt seem liked seems a bit hard to be sick and unpopular at the same time i nodded this would be in character with smithy i asked him where his roommate halliday was as i hadnt seen him at breakfast sandy said hed gone for breakfast i didnt say anything to sandy but this made me a bit curious so i had a look in the recreation room he wasnt there either so i got curiouser and curiouser until id searched the morning rose twice from end to end i think i covered every nook and cranny in the vessel where even a stray seagull could be hiding and you can take my word for it hallidays not in the morning rose reported this to the captain well well what an awful lot of reaction no i havent reported it to the captain why not same reason as you havent if i know my captain imrie hed at once declare that there was no clause in that agreement you signed that was binding on this particular case that saying that foul play wasnt involved in this case also would be altogether too much of a good thing and turn the morning rose straight for hammerfest smithy looked at me deadpan over the rim of his glass im rather curious to see what does happen when we get to bear island it might be interesting very noncommittal it might says he thoughtfully be equally interesting to provoke some kind of reaction in dr marlowe just once just for the recordmy own private record i wonder if i could do it do you remember i said on the bridge in the very early hours of this morning that we might just possibly have to call for help and that if we had to we had a transmitter here that could reach almost anywhere in the northern hemisphere not perhaps my exact words but the gist is accurate the gist is accurate even to myself the repetition of the words sounded mechanical and i had to make a conscious effort not to shiver as an iceshod centipede started up a fandango between my shoulder blades well we can call for help till were blue in the face this transmitter here can no longer reach as far as the galley for once almost unbelievably smithys face was registering an emotion other than amusement his face tight with anger he produced a screwdriver from his pocket and turned to the big steelblue receivertransmitter on the inner bulkhead do you always carry a screwdriver about with you the sheer banality of the question made it apposite in the circumstances only when i call up the radio station at tunheim in northeast bear island and get no reply and thats no ordinary radio station its an official norwegian government base smithy set to work on the faceplate screws ive already had this damned thing off about an hour ago youll see in a jiffy why i put it back on again while i was waiting for this jiffy to pass i recalled our conversation on the bridge in the very early hours of the morning the time hed referred to the radio and the relative closenessand by inference the availability of the nato atlantic forces it had been immediately afterwards that id looked through the starboard screen door and seen the sharp fresh footprints in the snow footprints id been immediately certain that had been made by an eavesdropper a preposterous idea id almost as quickly put out of my mind when id appreciated that there had been only one set of footprints there those which id made myself for some now inexplicable reason it had never occurred to me that any person clever enough to have been responsible for the series of undetected crimes that had taken place aboard the morning rose would have been far too clever to have overlooked the blinding obviousness of the advantage that lay in using footsteps already there the footsteps had indeed been newly made our ubiquitous friend had been abroad again smithy removed the last of the screws and not without some effort removed the faceplate i looked at the revealed interior for about ten seconds then said i see now why you put the faceplate back on the only thing that puzzles me is that that cabinet looks a bit small for a man to get inside it with a fourteenpound sledgehammer looks just like it doesnt it the tangled mess of wreckage inside was literally indescribable the vandal who had been at work had seen to it that irrespective of how vast a range of spares were carried the receivertransmitter could never be made operable again youve seen enough i think so he started to replace the cover and i said youve radios in the lifeboats yes handcranked theyll reach farther than the galley but a megaphone would be about as good youll have to report this to the captain of course of course then its heighho for hammerfest twentyfour hours from now and he can heighho for tahiti as far as im concerned smithy tightened the last screw thats when im going to tell him twentyfour hours from now maybe twentysix your outside limit for dropping anchor in sorhamna tying up yes youre a very deceitful man smithy its the company i keep and the life i lead youre not to blame yourself smithy i said kindly we live in vexed and troubled times when the norwegian compilers of the report on bear island had spoken of it as possessing perhaps the most inhospitably bleak coastline in the world they had been speaking with the measured understatement of true professional geographers as we approached it in the first light of dawn which in those latitudes at that time of year and under grey and lowering skies which were not only full of snow but getting rid of it as fast as they could was as near midforenoon as made no differenceit presented the most awesome aweinspiring and in the true sense of the word awful spectacle of nature it had ever been my misfortune to behold a frightening desolation it was a weird combination of the wickedly repellent and unwillingly fascinating an evil and dreadful and sinister place a place full of the terrifying intimation of mortality the culmination of all the terrors for our long lost nordic ancestors for whom hell was the land of eternal cold and for whom this would be the eternally frozen purgatory to be visited only in their dying nightmares bear island was black that was the shocking the almost frightful thing about it bear island was black black as a widows weeds heres in the regions of yearlong snow and ice where in winter even the waters of the barents sea ran a milky white to find this ebony mass towering fifteen hundred vertical feet up into the grey overcast evoked the same feeling of total disbelief the same numbing impact although here magnified a hundredfold as does the first glimpse of the black cliff of the north face of the eiger rearing up its appalling grandeur among the snows of the bernese oberland this benumbment of the senses stemmed from a dichotomous struggle to accept the evidence before the eyes for while reason said that it had to be so that primeval part of the mind that existed long before man knew what reason was just flatly refused to accept it we were just southwest of the most southerly tip of bear island steaming due cast through the calmest seas that we had encountered since leaving wick but even that term was only relative it was still necessary to hang on to something if one wished to maintain the perpendicular overall the weather hadnt changed any for the better the comparative moderating of the seas was due entirely to the fact that the wind blew now directly from the north and we were in the lee of whatever little shelter was afforded by those giant cliffs we were making this particular approach to our destination at ottos request for he was understandably anxious to build up a library of background shots which so far was completely nonexistent and those bleak precipices would have made a cameramans or directors dream but ottos luck was running true to form those driving gusts of snow which would in any event have driven straight into the camera lens and completely obscured it more often than not obscured the cliffs themselves due north lay the highest cliffs of the island the dolomite battlements of the hambergfiell dropping like a stone into the spumetopped waves that lashed its base with standing out to sea an imposing rock needle thrusting up at least feet to the northeast and less than a mile distant stood the equally magnificent bird fell cliffs with clustered at their foot an incredible series of high stacks pinnacles and arches that could only have been the handiwork of some herculean sculptor at once both blind and mad all this weabout ten others and myselfcould see purely by courtesy of the fact that we were on the bridge which had its foreword screen windows equipped with a highspeed kent clearview screen directly in front of the helmsmanwhich at this particular moment was smithywhile on either side were two very large windscreen wipers which coped rather less effectively with the gusting snow i was standing with conrad lonnie and mary stuart in front of the port wiper conrad who was by no means as dashing in real life as he was on the screen appeared to have struck up some kind of diffident friendship with mary which i reflected was as well for her social life as shed barely spoken to me since the morning of the previous day which might have been interpreted as being a bit graceless of her considering id incurred a large variety of aches and cramps in preventing her from falling to the floor during most of the preceding night she hadnt exactly avoided me in the past twentyfour hours but neither had she sought me out maybe she had certain things on her mind such as her conscience and her unforgivable treatment of me nor had i exactly sought her out for i too had a couple of things on my mind the first of which was herself i had developed towards her a markedly ambivalent feeling while i had to be grateful to her for having however unwittingly saved my life because her aversion to scotch had prevented me from having the last nightcap id ever have had in this world at the same time shed prevented me from moving around and just possibly stumbling upon the lad who had been wandering about in the middle watches with illintent in his heart and a sledgehammer in his hand that she and for whomsoever she worked knew beyond question that i was a person who might have reason to be abroad at inconvenient hours i no longer doubted and the second thing in my mind was the whomsoever i no longer doubted that it was heissman and perhaps he didnt even stand in need of an accomplice doctors by the nature of their profession are even more fallible and liable to error than the average run of mankind and i might well have been in error when id seen him on his bed in pain and him unfit to move around moreover goin apart he was the only man with a cabin to himself and so able to sally out and return undetected by a roommate and of course there was always this mysterious siberian background of his none of which not even his secret meeting with mary stuart was enough to hang a cat on lonnie touched my arm and i turned he smelt like a distillery he said remember what we were talking about two nights ago we talked about a lot of things bars dont you ever think of anything else lonnie bars what bars in the great hereafter lonnie said solemnly do you think there are any there in heaven i mean i mean you couldnt very well call it heaven if there are no bars there now could you i mean i wouldnt call it an act of kindness to send an old man like me to a prohibition heaven now would you it wouldnt be kind i dont know lonnie on biblical evidence i should expect there would be some wine around and lots of milk and honey lonnie looked pained what leads you to expect that youre ever going to be faced with the problem i was but posing a hypothetical question the old man spoke with dignity it would be positively unchristian to send me there god im thirsty unkind is what i mean i mean charity is the greatest of christian virtues he shook his head sadly an act of the greatest uncharity my dear boy the very negation of the spirit of kindness lonnie gazed out through a side window at the fantastically shaped islets of keilhous oy hesteinen and stappen now directly off our port beam and less than half a mile distant his face was set in lines of tranquil sacrifice he was as drunk as an owl you do believe in this kindness lonnie i said curiously after a lifetime in the cinema business i didnt see how he possibly could what else is there my dear boy even to those who dont deserve it ah now there is the point those are the ones who deserve it most even judith haynes he looked as if i had struck him and when i saw the expression on his face i felt as if i had struck him even although i felt his to be a mysteriously exaggerated reaction i reached out a hand even as i was about to apologise for i knew not what but he turned away a curious sadness on his face and left the bridge now ive seen the impossible conrad said he wasnt smiling but he wasnt being censorious either someone has at last given offence to lonnie gilbert one has to work at it i said ive transgressed against lonnies creed he thinks that im unkind unkind mary stuart laid a hand on the arm i was using to steady myself the skin under the brown eyes was perceptibly darker than it had been thirtysix hours ago and was even beginning to look puffy and the whites of the eyes themselves were dulled and slightly tinged with red she hesitated as if about to say something then her gaze shifted to a point over my left shoulder i turned captain imrie closed the starboard wheelhouse door behind him insofar as it was possible to detect the shift and play of expression on that splendidly bewhiskered and bearded face it seemed that the captain was upset even agitated he crossed directly to smithy and spoke to him in a low and urgent voice smithy registered surprise then shook his head captain imrie spoke again briefly smithy shrugged his shoulders then said something in return both men looked at me and i knew there was more trouble coming if not actually arrived if for no reason other than that so far nothing untoward had happened with which i hadnt been directly or indirectly concerned captain imrie fixed me with his piercing blue eyes jerked his head with most uncharacteristic peremptoriness towards the chartroom door and headed for it himself i shrugged my own shoulders in apology to mary and conrad and followed captain imrie closed the door behind me more trouble mister i didnt much care for the way he called me mister one of the film crew john halliday has disappeared disappeared where it wasnt a very intelligent question but then it wasnt meant to be thats what id like to know i didnt much care for the way he looked at me either he cant just have disappeared i mean youve searched for him weve searched for him all right the voice was harsh with strain from anchor locker to stern post hes not aboard the morning rose my god i said this is awful i looked at him in what i hoped registered as puzzlement but why tell me all this because i thought you might be able to help us help you id like to but how i assume that you can only be approaching me in my medical capacity and i can assure you that theres absolutely nothing in what ive seen of him or read in his medical history i wasnt approaching you in your bloody medical capacity captain imrie had started to breathe very heavily i just thought you might help me in other ways bloody strange isnt it mister that youve been in the thick of everything thats been happening id nothing to say to this id just been thinking the same thing myself how it was you who just happened to find antonio dead how it was you who just happened to go to the bridge when smith and oakley were ill how it was you who went straight to the stewards cabin in the crew quarters next thing i suppose youd have gone straight to mr gerrans cabin and found him dead also if mr goin hadnt had the good luck to go there first and isnt it bloody strange mister that a doctor the one person who could have helped those people and seemingly couldnt is the one person aboard with enough medical knowledge to make them sick in the first place no questionlooking at it from his anglecaptain imrie was developing quite a reasonable point of view i was more than vaguely surprised to find that he was capable of developing a point of view in the first place clearly id been underestimating him just how much i was immediately to realise and just why were you spending so much time in the galley late the night before lastwhen i was in my bed damn you the place where all the poison came from haggerty told me he told me you were poking aroundand got him out of the galley for a spell you didnt find what you wanted but you came back later didnt you wanted to find out where the food leftovers were didnt you pretended you were surprised when they were gone that would look good in court oh for heavens sake you silly old and you were very very late abroad that night werent you oh making enquiries up in the saloonmr goin told me up yes ive been on the bridgeoakley told me down in the loungegilbert told me and he paused dramaticallyin hallidays cabinhis cabinmate told me and most of all who was the man who stopped me from going to hammerfest when i wanted to and persuaded the others to sign this worthless guarantee of yours absolving me from all blame tell me that eh mister his trump card played captain imrie rested his case i had to stop the old coot he was working himself up to having me clapped in irons i sympathised with him i was sorry for what i would have to say to him but clearly this wasnt my morning for making friends anyway i looked at him coldly and without expression for about ten seconds then said my names doctor not mister im not your damned mate what what was that i opened the door to the wheelhouse and invited him to pass through you just mentioned the word court just step out there and repeat those slanderous allegations in the presence of witnesses and youll find yourself standing in a part of a court you never expected to be in can you imagine the extent of the damages from his face and the perceptible shrinking of his burly frame it was apparent that captain imrie immediately could i was a long long way from being proud of myself he was a worried old man saying honestly what he thought had to be said but hed left me with no option i closed the door and wondered how best to begin i wasnt given the time to begin the knock on the door and the opening of the door came on the same instant oakley had an urgent and rather apprehensive look about him i think youd better come down to the saloon right away sir he said to imrie he looked at me you too im afraid dr marlow theres been a fight down there a bad one great god almighty if captain imrie still had had any lingering hopes that he was running a happy ship the last of them was gone for a man of his years and bulk he made a remarkably rapid exit i followed more leisurely oakleys description had been reasonably accurate there had been a fight and a very unpleasant affair it must have been too during the period it had lastedobviously the very brief period it had lasted there were only halfadozen people in the saloon altogetherone or two were still suffering sufficiently from the rigours or the barents sea to prefer the solitude of their cabins to the forbidding beauties of bear island while the three apostles as ever were down in the recreation room still cacophonously searching for the bottom rung on the ladder to musical immortality three of the six were standing one sitting one kneeling and the last stretched out on the deck of the saloon the three on their feet were lonnie and eddie and hendriks all with the air of concerned but hesitant helplessness that afflicts uncommitted bystanders on such occasions michael stryker was sitting in a chair at the captains table using a very bloodstained handkerchief to dab a deep cut on the right cheekbone it was noticeable that the knuckles of the hand that held the handkerchief were quite badly skinned the kneeling figure was mary darling all i could see was her back the long blond tresses falling to the deck and her big hornrimmed spectacles lying about two feet away she was crying but crying silently the thin shoulders shaking convulsively in incipient hysteria i knelt and raised her still kneeling to an upright position she stared at me ashenfaced no tears in her eyes not recognising me without her glasses she was as good as blind its all right mary i said only me dr marlowe i looked at the figure on the floor and recognised him not without some difficulty as young allen come on now be a good girl let me have a look at him hes terribly hurt dr marlowe terribly hurt she had difficulty in getting her words out during long and almost soundless gasps oh look at him look at him its awful then she started crying in earnest not quietly this time her whole body shook i looked up mr hendriks will you please go to the galley and ask mr haggerty for some brandy tell him i want it if hes not there take it anyway hendriks nodded and hurried away i said to captain imrie sorry i should have asked permission thats all right doctor we were back on professional terms again however briefly perhaps it was because his reply was largely automatic for the bulk of his interest and all that clearly hostile was for the moment centered on michael stryker i turned back to mary go and sit on the settee there and take some of that brandy you hear no no i doctors orders i looked at eddie and lonnie and without a word from me they took her across to the nearest settee i didnt wait to see whether she followed doctors orders or not a now stirring allen had more pressing claims on my attention stryker had done a hatchet job on him he had a cut forehead a bruised cheek an eye that was going to be closed by night blood coming from both nostrils a split lip one tooth missing and another so loose that it was going to be missing very soon also i said to stryker you do this to him obvious isnt it you have to savage him like this christ man hes only a kid why dont you pick on someone your own size next time like you for instance oh my god i said wearily beneath strykers tissuethin veneer of civilisation lay something very crude indeed i ignored him asked lonnie to get water from the galley and cleaned up allen as best i could as was invariable in such cases the removal of surface blood improved his appearance about eighty percent a plaster on his forehead two cottonwool plugs for his nose and two stitches in a frozen lip and id done all i could for him i straightened as an indignant captain imrie started questioning stryker what happened mr stryker a quarrel a quarrel was it now captain imrie was being heavily ironic and what started the quarrel an insult from him from thatfrom that child the captains feelings clearly matched my own what kind of insult to do that to a boy a private insult stryker dabbed the cut on his cheek and hippocrates in temporary abeyance i felt sorry that it wasnt deeper even although it looked quite unpleasant enough as it was he just got what anyone gets who insults me thats all i shall endeavour to keep a still tongue in my head captain imrie said drily however as captain of this ship im not a member of your damned crew if that young fool there doesnt lodge a complaintand he wontfd be obligated if youd mind your own business stryker rose and left the saloon captain imrie made as if to follow changed his mind sat down wearily at the head of his own table and reached for his own private bottle he said to the three men now clustered round mary any of you see what happened no sir it was hendriks mr stryker was standing alone over by the window there when allen went up to speak to him i dont know what and next moment they were rolling about the floor it didnt last more than seconds captain imrie nodded wearily and poured a considerable measure into his glass he was obviously and rightly depending on smithy to make the approach to the anchorage i got allen now quite conscious to his feet and led him towards the saloon door captain imrie said taking him below i nodded and when i come back ill tell you all about how i started it he scowled at me and returned to his scotch mary i noticed was sipping at the brandy and shuddering at every sip lonnie held her glasses in his hand and i escaped with allen before he gave them back to her i got allen into his bunk and covered him up he had a little colour in his battered cheeks now but still hadnt spoken i said what was all that about he hesitated im sorry id rather not say why ever not im sorry again its a bit private someone could be hurt yes i he stopped its all right you must be very fond of her he looked at me for a few silent moments then nodded i went on shall i bring her down no doctor no i dont wanti mean with my face like this no no i couldnt your face was an awful sight worse just five minutes ago she was doing a fair job of breaking her heart even then was she he tried to smile and winced well all right i left and went to strykers cabin he answered my knock and his face didnt have welcome written all over it i looked at the still bleeding cut want me to have a look at that judith haynes clad in a fur parka and trousers and looking rather like a redhaired eskimo was sitting on the cabins only chair her two cocker spaniels in her lap her dazzling smile was in momentary abeyance no it might scar i didnt give a damn whether it scarred or not oh the factor of his appearance it hadnt been too hard to guess was of importance to stryker i entered closed the door examined and dabbed the cut put on astringent and applied a plaster i said look im not captain imrie did you have to bang that boy like that you could have flattened him with a tap you were there when i told captain imrie that it was a purely personal matter id have to revise my psychological thinking clearly neither my freely offered medical assistance nor my reasonableness of approach nor the implied flattery had had the slightest mollifying effect having md hung round your neck doesnt give you the right to ask impertinent prying questions remember what else i said to imrie youd be obligated if i minded my own damned business exactly ill bet young allen feels that way too that young allen deserves all he got judith haynes said her tone wasnt any more friendly than strykers i found what she said interesting for two reasons she was widely supposed to loathe her husband but there was no evidence of it here and here might lie a more fruitful source for enquiry for clearly she wasnt as good at keeping her emotions and tongue under wraps as her husband was how do you know miss haynes you werent there i didnt have to be i darling strykers voice was abrupt warning cant trust your wife to speak for herself is that it i said his big fists balled but i ignored him and looked again at judith haynes do you know theres a little girl up in the saloon crying her eyes out over what your big tough husband did to that kid does that mean nothing to you if youre talking about that little bitch of a continuity girl she deserves all that comes her way too darling strykers voice was urgent i stared at judith haynes in disbelief but i could see she meant what she said her red slash of a mouth was contorted into a line as straight and as thin as the edge of a ruler the once beautiful green eyes were venomous and the face ugly in its contorted attempts to conceal some hatred or viciousness or poison in the mind it was an almost frightening display of what must have been a very very rare public exhibition of what powerful rumour in the film world to which i now partially apologised for my former mental strictures maintained to be a fairly constant private amalgam of the peasant shrew and the screaming fishwife thatharmlesschild i spaced the words in slow incredulity a bitch a tramp a little tramp a slut a little gutter stop it strykers voice was a lash but it had strained overtones i had the feeling that only desperation would make him talk to his wife in this fashion yes stop it i said i dont know what the hell youre talking about miss haynes and im damned sure you dont either all i know is youre sick i turned to go stryker barred my way hed lost a little colour from his cheeks nobody talks to my wife that way his lips hardly moved as he spoke i was suddenly sick of the strykers i said ive insulted your wife unforgivably and so ive insulted you youre getting the point marlowe and anyone who insults you gets whats coming to them thats what you said to captain imrie thats what i said i see i thought you might he still barred my way and if i apologise an apology he smiled coldly lets try one out for size shall we i turned to judith haynes i said i dont know what the hell youre talking about miss haynes and im damned sure you dont either all i know is youre sick her face looked as if invisible claws had sunk deep into both cheeks all the way from temple to chin and dragged back the skin until it was stretched drumtight over the bones i turned to face stryker his facial skin didnt look tight at all the strikingly handsome face wasnt handsome any more the contours seemed to have sagged and jellied and the cheeks were bereft of colour i brushed by him opened the door and stopped you poor bastard i said dont worry doctors never tell i was glad to make my way up to the clean biting cold of the upper deck id left something sick and unhealthy and more than vaguely unclean down there behind me and i didnt have to be a doctor to know what the sickness was the snow had eased now and as i looked out over the weather sidethe port sidei could see that we were leaving one promontory about a half mile behind on the port quarter while another was coming up about the same distance ahead on the port bow kapp kolthoff and kapp malmgren i knew from the chart so we had to be steaming northeast across the evjebukta the cliffs here were less high but we were even more deeply into their lee than twenty minutes previously and the sea had moderated even more we had less than three miles to go i looked up at the bridge the weather obviously was improving considerably or interest and curiosity had been stimulated by the close proximity of our destination for there was now a small knot of people on either wing of the bridge but with hoods so closely drawn as to make features indistinguishable i became aware that there was a figure standing close by me huddled up against the fore superstructure of the bridge it was mary darling with the long tangled blond tresses blowing in every direction of the compass i went towards her put my arm round her with the ease born of recent intensive practice and tilted her face red eyes tearsplotched cheeks a little woebegone face halfhidden behind the enormous spectacles the slut the bitch the little tramp mary darling i said what are you doing here its far too cold you should be inside or below i wanted to be alone there was still the catch of a dying sob in her voice and mr gilbert kept wanting to give me brandyand well she shuddered so youve left lonnie alone with the restorative thatll be an eminently satisfactory allround conclusion as far as lonnie dr marlowe she became aware of the arm round her and made a halfhearted attempt to break away people will see us i dont care i said i want the whole world to know of our love you want the whole she looked at me in consternation her normally big eyes huge behind her glasses then came the first tremulous beginnings of a smile oh dr marlowe theres a young man below who wants to see you immediately i said oh the smile vanished heaven knows what gravity of import she found in my words is hei mean hell have to go to hospital wont he hell be up and around this afternoon really really and truly if youre calling my professional competence into question oh dr marlowe then whatwhy does he i should imagine he wants you to hold his hand im putting myself in his shoes of course oh dr marlowe will iti mean in his cabin do i have to drag you down there no she smiled i dont think that will be necessary she hesitated dr marlowe yes i think youre wonderful i really do hoppit she smiled almost happily now and hopped it i wished i even fractionally shared her opinion of me for if i was in a position to do so there would be a good number fewer of dead and sick and injured around but i was glad of one thing i hadnt had to hurt mary darling as id feared i might there had been no need to ask her any of the questions that had halfformed in my mind even as i had left the strykers cabin if she were even remotely capable of being any of those things that judith haynes had for god knew what misbegotten reasons accused her of being then she had no right to be in the film industry as a continuity girl she was in more than a fair way to making her fame and fortune as one of the great actresses of our time besides i didnt have to ask any questions now not where she and allen and the strykers were concerned it was hard to say whether my contempt for michael stryker was greater than my pity i remained where i was for a few minutes watching some crew members who had just come on to the foredeck begin to remove the no longer necessary lashings from the deck cargo strip off tarpaulins and set slings in places while another two set about clearing away the big fore derrick and testing the winch clearly captain imrie had no intention of wasting any time whatsoever upon our arrival he wanted and understandably to be gone with all dispatch i went aft to the saloon lonnie was the sole occupant alone but not lonely not as long as he had that bottle of hine happily clutched in his fist he lowered his glass as i sat down beside him ah you have assuaged the sufferings of the walking wounded there is a preoccupied air about you my dear fellow he tapped the bottle for the instant alleviation of workaday cares that bottle belongs to the pantry lonnie the fruits of nature belong to all mankind a soupcon if only to stop you from drinking it all i have an apology to make to you lonnie about our delectable leading lady i dont think theres enough kindness around to waste any in throwing it in her direction barren ground you would say stony soil i would say redemption and salvation are not for our fair judith i dont know about that all i know is that i wouldnt like to be the one to try and that looking at her i can only conclude that theres an awful lot of unkindness around amen to that lonnie swallowed some more brandy but we must not forget the parables of the lost sheep and the prodigal son nothing and nobody is ever entirely lost i daresay luck to leading her back to the paths of the righteousyou shouldnt have to fight off too much competition for the job how is it do you think that a person like that should be so different from the other two mary dear and mary darling dear dear girls even in my dotage i love them dearly such sweet children they could do no wrong never ha thats easy to say but what if perhaps they were deeply under the influence of alcohol what lonnie appeared genuinely shocked what are you talking about inconceivable my dear boy inconceivable not even say if they were to have a double gin what piffling nonsense is this we are speaking of the influence of alcohol not about aperitifs for swaddling babes you would see no harm in either of them asking for say just one drink of course not lonnie looked genuinely puzzled you do harp on so my dear fellow yes i do rather i just wondered why once after a long day on the set when mary stuart had asked you for just that one drink you flew completely off the handle in curiously slowmotion fashion lonnie put bottle and glass on the table and rose unsteadily to his feel he looked old and tired and terribly vulnerable ever since you came innow i can see it he spoke in a kind of sad whisper ever since you came in youve been leading up to this one question he shook his head and his eyes were not seeing me i thought you were my friend he said quietly and walked uncertainly from the saloon the northwest corner of the sorhamna bight where the morning rose had finally come to rest was just under three miles due northeast as the crow flies from the most southerly tip of bear island the sorhamna itself ushaped and open to the south was just over a thousand yards in width on its castwest axis and close on a mile in length from north to south the eastern arm of the harbour was discontinuous beginning with a small peninsula perhaps three hundred yards in length followed by a twohundredyard gap of water interspersed with small islands of various sizes then by the much larger island of makehl very narrow from east to west stretching almost half a mile to its most southerly point of kapp roalkvarn the land to the north and cast was lowlying that to the west or true island side rising fairly steeply from a shallow escarpment but nowhere higher than a small hill about four hundred feet high about halfway down the side of the bight here were none of the towering precipices of the hambergfiell or bird fell ranges to the south but on the other hand here the entire land was covered in snow deep on the northfacing slopes and their valleys where the pale low summer sun and the scouring winds had passed them by the sorhamna was not only the best it was virtually the only reasonable anchorage in bear island when the wind blew from the west it offered perfect protection for vessels sheltering there and for a northerly wind it was only slightly less good from an easterly wind dependent upon its strength and precise direction it afforded a reasonable amount of coverthe gap between kapp heer and makehi was the deciding factor here and when the wind stood in this quarter and if the worst came to the worst a vessel could always up anchor and shelter under the lee of makehi island but when the wind blew from the south a vessel was wide open to everything the barents sea cared to throw at it and this was why the degree of unloading activity aboard the morning rose was increasing from the merely hectic to the nearly panicstricken even as we had approached the sorhamna the wind which had been slowly veering the past thirtysix hours now began rapidly to increase its speed of movement round the compass at disconcerting speed so that by the time we had made fast it was blowing directly from the east it was now a few degrees south of east and strengthening and the morning rose was beginning to feel its effects it only had to increase another few knots or veer another few degrees and the trawlers position would become untenable at anchor the morning rose could comfortably have ridden out the threatened blow but the trouble was that the morning rose was not at anchor she was tied up alongside a crumbling limestone jettyneither iron nor wooden structures would have lasted for any time in those stormy and bitter watersthat had first been constructed by lerner and the deutsche seefischereiverein about the turn of the century and then improved uponif that were the termby the international geophysical year expedition that had summered there the jetty which would have been condemned out of hand and forbidden for public use almost anywhere else in the northern hemisphere had originally been tshaped but the left arm of the t was now all but gone while the central section leading to the shore was badly eaten away on its southward side it was against this dangerously dilapidated structure that the morning rose was beginning to pound with increasing force as the southeasterly seas caught her under the starboard quarter and the cushioning effect of a solid row of fenders consisting of blocks of softwood and motor truck tires was becoming increasingly nominal the jarring effect as the trawler struck heavily and repeatedly against the jetty was sufficient to make those working on deck stagger and clutch onto the nearest support it was difficult to say what effect this was having on the morning rose for apart from the scratching and slight indentations of the plates none was visible but trawlers are legendarily tough and it was unlikely that she was coming to any great harm but what was coming to harm and very visibly so was the jetty itself for increasingly large chunks of masonry were beginning to fall into the sorhamna with dismaying frequency and as most of our fuel provisions and equipment still stood there the seemingly imminent collapse of the pier into the sea was not a matter to be viewed with anything like equanimity when wed first come alongside shortly before noon the unloading had gone ahead very briskly and smoothly indeedexcept for the unloading of miss hayness snarling pooches even before wed tied up the after derrick had the sixteenfoot workboat in the water and three minutes later an only slightly smaller fourteenfooter with an outboard had followed it those boats were to remain with us within ten minutes the specially strengthened foreword derrick had lifted the weirdly shapedlaterally truncated so as to have a flat bottommockup of the central section of a submarine over the side and lowered it gently into the water where it floated with what appeared to be perfect stability no doubt because of its four tons of iron ballast it was when the mockup conning tower was swung into position to be bolted on to the central section of the submarine that the trouble began it just wouldnt bolt on goin and heissman and stryker the only three who had observed the original tests said that in practice it had operated perfectly clearly it wasnt operating perfectly now the conning tower section elliptical in shape mas designed to settle precisely over a fourinch vertical flange in the centre of the midsection but settle it just wouldnt do it turned out that one of the shallow curves at the foot of the conning tower was at least a quarterinch out of true a fact that was almost certainly due to the pounding that wed taken on the way up from wick just one lashing not sufficiently bartaut would have permitted that microscopic freedom of vertical movement that would have allowed the tiny distortion to develop the solution was simplejust to hammer the offending curve back into shapeand in a dockyard with skilled plate layers available this would probably have been no more than a matter of minutes but wed neither technical facilities nor skilled labour available and the minutes had now stretched into hours a score of times now the foreword derrick had offered up the offending conning tower piece to the flange a score of times it had had to be lifted again and painstakingly assaulted by hammers several times a perfect fit had been achieved where it had been previously lacking only to find that the distortion had mysteriously and mischievously transferred itself a few inches farther along the metal nor now despite the fact that the submarine section was in the considerable lee afforded by both pier and vessel were matters being made any easier by the little waves that were beginning to creep around the bows of the morning rose and rock it gently at first but with increasing force to the extent that the ultimate good fit was clearly going to depend as much on the luck of timing as the persuasion of the hammers captain imrie wasnt frantic with worry for the sound enough reason that it wasnt in his nature to become frantic about anything but the depth of his concern was evident enough from the fact that he had not only skipped lunch but hadnt as much as fortified himself with anything stronger than coffee since our arrival in the sorhamna his main concern apart from the wellbeing of the morning rosehe clearly didnt give a damn about his passengerswas to get the foredeck cleared of its remaining deck cargo because as id heard otto rather unnecessarily and unpleasantly reminding him it was part of his contractual obligations to land all passengers and cargo before departure for hammerfest and of course what was exercising captain imries mind so powerfully was that with darkness coming on and the weather blowing up the foreword deck cargo had not yet been unloaded and would not be until the fore derrick was freed from its present fulltime occupation of holding the conning tower suspended over the midsection the one plus factor about captain imries concentration was that it gave him little time to worry about hallidays disappearance more precisely it gave him little time to try to do anything constructive about it for i knew it was still very much on his mind from the fact that he had taken time off to tell me that upon his arrival in hammerfest his first intention would be to contact the law there were two things i could have said at this stage but didnt the first was that i failed to see what earthly purpose this could serveit was just i suppose that he felt that he had to do something anything however ineffectual that might be the second was that i felt quite certain that he would never get the length of hammerfest in the first place although just then hardly seemed the time to tell him why i thought so he wasnt then in the properly receptive mood i had hopes that he would be shortly after he had left bear island i went down the screeching metal gangwayits rusty iron wheels apparently permanently locked in position rubbed to and fro with every lurch of the morning roseand made my way along the ancient jetty a small tractor and a small snocatthey had been the third and fourth items to be unloaded from the trawlers afterdeckwere both equipped with towing sledges and everybody from heissman downwards was helping to load equipment aboard those sledges for haulage up to the huts that lay on the slight escarpment not more than twenty yards from the end of the jetty everybody was not only helping they were helping with a will when the temperature is fifteen degrees below freezing the temptation to dawdle is not marked i followed one consignment up to the huts unlike the jetty the huts were of comparatively recent construction and in good condition relics from the latest igythere could have been no possible economic justification in dismantling them and taking them back to norway they were not built of the modern kapok asbestos and aluminium construction so favoured by modern expeditions in arctic regions as base headquarters they were builtalthough admittedly presectioned in the lowslung chalet design fairly universally found in the higher alpine regions of europe they had about them that foursquare hunch shouldered look the appearance of lowering their heads against the storm that made it seem quite likely that they would still be there in a hundred years time provided they are not exposed to prevailing high winds and the constant fluctuation of temperature above and below the freezing point manmade structures can last almost indefinitely in the deep freeze of the high arctic there were five structures here altogether all of them set a considerable distance apartas far as the shoulder of the hill beyond the escarpment would permit little as i knew of the arctic i knew enough to understand the reason for this spacing here where exposure to cold is the permanent and dominating factor of life it is fire which is the greatest enemy for unless there are chemical firefighting appliances to band and there nearly always are not a fire once it has taken hold will not stop until everything combustible has been destroved blocks of ice are scarcely at a premium when it comes to extinguishing flames four small huts were set at the corners of a much larger central block according to the rather splendid diagram heissman had drawn up in his manifesto those were to be given over respectively to transport fuels provisions and equipment i was not quite sure what he meant by equipment those were all square and windowless the central and very much larger building was of a peculiar starfish shape with a pentagonal centrepiece and five triangular annexes forming an integral whole the purpose of this design was difficult to guess i would have thought it one conducive to maximum heat loss the centrepiece was the living dining and cooking area each arm held two tiny bare rooms for sleeping quarters heating was by electric oilfilled black heaters bolted to the walls but until we got our own portable generator going we were dependent on simple oil stoves lighting was by pressurised coleman kerosene lamps cooking which was apparently to consist of the endless opening and heating of contents of tins was to be done on a simple oil stove otto needless to say hadnt brought a cook along cooks cost money with the notable exception of judith haynes everyone even the still groggy allen worked willingly and as quickly as the unfamiliar and freezing conditions would permit they also worried silently and joylessly for although no one had been on anything approaching terms of close friendship with halliday the news of his disappearance had added fresh gloom and apprehension to a company who believed themselves to be evilly jinxed before even the first day of shooting stryker and lonnie who never spoke to each other except when essential checked all the stores fuel oil food clothing arcticising equipmentotto whatever his faults insisted on thoroughness sandy considerably recovered now that he was on dry land checked his props hendriks his sound equipment the count his camera equipment eddie his electrical gear and i myself what little medical kit i had along by three oclock when it was already dusk we had everything stowed away cubicles allocated and camp beds and sleeping bags placed in those the jetty was now quite empty of all the gear that had been unloaded there we lit the oil stoves left a morose and muttering eddiewith the doleful assistance of the three apostlesto get the diesel generator working and made our way back to the morning rose myself because it was essential that i speak to smithy the others because the hut was still miserably bleak and freezing whereas even the muchmaligned morning rose still offered a comparative haven of warmth and comfort very shortly after our return a variety of incidents occurred in short and eventually disconcerting succession at ten past three totally unexpectedly and against all indications the conning tower fitted snugly over the flange of the midship section six bolts were immediately fitted to hold it in positionthere were twentyfour altogetherand the workboat at once set about the task of towing the unwieldy structure into the almost total shelter offered by the right angle formed by the main body of the jetty and its north facing arm at threefifteen the unloading of the foredeck cargo began and with smithy in charge this was undertaken with efficiency and despatch partly because i didnt want to disturb him in his work partly because it was at that moment impossible to speak to smithy privately i went below to my cabin removed a small rectangular clothbound package from the base of my medical bag put it in a small pursestrung duffle bag and went back on top this was at threetwenty the unloading was still less than twenty percent completed but smithy wasnt there it was almost as though he had awaited my momentary absence to betake himself elsewhere and that he had betaken himself elsewhere there was no doubt i asked the winchman where he had gone but the winchman exclusively preoccupied with a job that had to be executed with all despatch was understandably vague about smithys whereabouts he had either gone below or ashore he said which i found a very helpful remark i looked in his cabin on the bridge in the charthouse the saloon and all the other likely places no smithy i questioned passengers and crew with the same result no one had seen him no one had any idea whether he was aboard or had gone ashore which was very understandable because the darkness was now pretty well complete and the harsh light of the arc lamp now rigged up to aid unloading threw the gangway into very heavy shadow so that anyone could be virtually certain of boarding or leaving the morning rose unnoticed nor was there any sign of captain imrie true i wasnt looking for him but i would have expected him to be making his presence very much known the wind was almost round to the southsoutheast now and still freshening the morning rose was beginning to pound regularly against the jetty wall with a succession of jarring impacts and a sound of screeching metal that would normally have had imrie very much in evidence indeed in his anxiety to get rid of all his damned passengers and their equipment in order to get his ship out to the safety of the open sea with all speed but he wasnt around not any place i could see him at threethirty i went ashore and hurried up the jetty to the huts they were deserted except for the equipment hut where eddie was blasphemously trying to start up the diesel he looked up as he saw me nobody could ever call me one for complaining dr marlowe but this bloody have you seen mr smith the mate not ten minutes ago looked in to see how we were getting on why is there something did he say anything what kind of thing about where he was going what he was doing no eddie looked at the shivering three apostles whose blank expressions were of no help to anyone just stood there for a couple of minutes with his hands in his pockets looking at what we were doing and asking a few questions then he strolls off see where he went no he looked at the three apostles who shook their heads as one anything up then nothing urgent ships about to sail and the skippers looking for him if that wasnt quite an accurate assessment of how matters stood at that moment id no doubt it would be in a very few minutes i didnt waste time looking for smithy if he had been hanging around with apparent aimlessness at the camp instead of closely supervising the urgent clearing of the foredeck which one would have expected of him and would normally have been completely in character then smithy had a very good reason for doing so he just wanted however temporarily to become lost at three thirtyfive i returned to the morning rose this time captain imrie was very much in evidence i had thought him incapable of becoming frantic about anything but as i looked at him as he stood in the wash of light at the door of the saloon i could see that i could have been wrong about that perhaps frantic was the wrong term but there was no doubt that he was in a highly excitable condition and was mad clear through his fists were balled what could be seen of his face was mottled red and white and his bright blue eyes were snapping with commendable if lurid brevity he repeated to me what hed clearly told a number of people in the past few minutes worried about the deteriorating weatherthat wasnt quite the way hed put ithed had allison try to contact tunheim for a forecast this allison had been unable to do then he and allison had made the discovery that the transceiver was smashed beyond repair and just over an hour or so previously the receiver had been in orderor smith had said it was for he had then written down the latest weather forecast or what he said was the latest weather forecast and now there was no sign of smith where the hell was smith hes gone ashore i said ashore ashore how the hell do you know hes gone ashore captain imrie didnt sound very friendly but then he was hardly in a friendly mood because ive just been up in the camp talking to mr harbottle the electrician mr smith had just been up there up there he should have been unloading cargo what the hell was he doing up there i didnt see mr smith i explained patiently so i couldnt ask him what the hell were you doing up there youre forgetting yourself captain imrie i am not responsible to you i merely wished to have a word with him before he left weve become quite friendly you know yes you have havent you imrie said significantly it didnt mean anything he was just in a mood for talking significantly allison sir the bosan search party ashore quickly now ill lead you myself if there had ever been any doubt as to the depth of captain imries concern there was none now he turned back to me but as otto gerran and goin were now standing beside me i wasnt sure whether he was addressing me or not and were leaving within the half hour with smith or without him is that fair captain otto asked he may just have gone for a walk or got a little lostyou see how dark it is dont you think it bloody funny that mr smith should vanish just as i discover that a radio over which hes been claiming to receive messages is smashed beyond repair otto fell silent but goin ever the diplomat stepped in smoothly i think mr gerran is right captain you could be acting a little bit unfairly i agree that the destruction of your radio is a serious and worrisome affair and one that is more than possibly in light of all the mysterious things that have happened recently a very sinister affair but i think you are wrong immediately to assume that mr smith has any connection with it for one thing he strikes me as much too intelligent a man to incriminate himself in so extremely obvious a fashion in the second place as your senior officer who knows how vitally important a piece of equipment your radio is why should he do such a wanton thing in the third place if he were trying to escape the consequences of his actions where on earth could he escape to on bear island i do not suggest anything as simple as an accident or amnesia im merely suggesting that he may have got lost you could at least wait until the morning i could see captain imries fists unballing not much just a slight relaxation and i knew that if he werent wavering he was at least on the point of considering a state of approaching uncertainty that lasted just as long as it took otto to undo whatever goin might have been on the point of achieving thats it of course he said he just went to have a look around what in the pitch bloody dark it was an exaggeration but a pardonable one allison oakley all of you come on he lowered his voice a few decibels and said to us im leaving within the half hour smith or no smith hammerfest gentlemen hammerfest and the law he hurried down the gangway half a dozen men close behind goin sighed i suppose wed better lend a hand he left and otto after hesitating for a moment followed i didnt id no intention of lending a hand if smithy didnt want to be found then he wouldnt be instead i went down to my cabin wrote a brief note took the small duffle bag with me and went in search of haggerty i had to trust somebody smithys most damned inconvenient disappearing trick had left me with no option and i thought haggerty was my best bet he was stiffnecked and suspicious and since imries questioning of him that morning he must have become even more suspicious of me but he was no fool he struck me as being incorruptible he was i thought amenable to an authoritative display of discipline and above all hed spent twentyseven years of his life in taking orders it was fifteen minutes touch and go but at last he grudgingly agreed to do what i asked him to you wouldnt be making a fool out of me dr marlowe he asked youd be a fool if you even thought that what would i have to gain theres that theres that he took the small duffle bag reluctantly as soon as were safely clear of the island yes that and the letter to the captain not before those are deep waters dr marlowe he didnt know how deep i was close to drowning in them cant you tell me what it is all about if i knew that haggerty do you think id be remaining behind on this godforsaken island for the first time he smiled no sir i dont really think you would captain imrie and his search party returned only a minute or two after id gone back up to the upper deck they returned without smithy i was surprised neither by their failure to find him nor the brevity of their searchan elapsed time of only twenty minutes bear island on the map may be only the veriest speck in the high arctic but it does cover an area of seventythree square miles and it must have occurred to captain imrie very early on indeed that to attempt to search even a fraction of one percent of that icily mountainous terrain in darkness was to embark upon a monumental folly his fervour for the search had diminished to vanishing point but his failure to find smithy had if anything increased his determination to depart immediately having ensured that the last of the foredeck cargo had been unloaded and that all of the film companys equipment and personal effects were ashore he and mr stokes courteously but swiftly shook hands with us all as we were ushered ashore the derricks were already stayed in position and the mooring ropes singled up captain imrie was not about to stay upon the order of his going otto properly enough was the last to leave at the head of the gangway he said twentytwo days it is then captain imrie youll be back in twentytwo days i wont leave you here the winter mr gerran never fear with both the mystery and his muchunloved bear island about to be left behind captain imrie apparently felt that he could permit himself a slight relaxation of attitude twentytwo days at the very outset why man i can be in hammerfest and back in seventytwo hours i wish you all well with this captain imrie ordered the gangway to be raised and went up to the bridge without explaining his cryptic remark about the seventytwo hours it was more likely than not that what he had in mind at that very moment was indeed to be back inside seventytwo hours with his manner seemed to convey a small regiment of heavily armed norwegian police i wasnt concerned i was as certain as i could be that if that were indeed what he had in mind he would change his mind before the night was out the navigation lights came on and the morning rose moved off slowly northwards from the jetty slewed round in a halfcircle and headed down the sorhamna her engine note deepening as she picked up speed opposite the jetty again captain imrie sounded his hooteronly the captain could have called it a sirentwice a high and lonely sound almost immediately swallowed up in the muffling blanket of snow within sec ends it seemed both the throb of the engine and the pale glow of the navigation lights were lost in the snow and the darkness for what seemed quite some time we all stood there huddled against the bitter cold and peering into the driving snow as if by willing it could bring the lights back into view again the engine throb back into earshot the atmosphere was not one of voyagers happily arrived at their hopedfor destination but of castaways marooned on an arctic desert island the atmosphere inside the big living cabin was not much of an improvement the oil heaters were functioning well enough and eddie had the diesel generator running so that the black heaters on the walls were just beginning to warm up but the effects of a decade of deep freeze were not to be overcome in the space of an hour the inside temperature was still below freezing nobody went to their allocated cubicles for the excellent reason that they were considerably colder than the central living space nobody appeared to want to talk to anybody else heissman embarked upon a pedantic and what promised to be lengthy lecture about arctic survival a subject concerning which his long and intimate acquaintance with siberia presumably made him uniquely qualified to speak but there were no takers it was questionable whether he was even listening to himself then he otto and neal divine began a rather desultory discussion of their plans forweather permittingthe following days shooting but obviously they hadnt their hearts even in that it was eventually conrad who put his finger on the cause of the general malaise or more accurately expressed the thought that was in the mind of everybody with the possible exception of myself he said to heissman in the arctic in winter you require torches right right we have them plenty of course why because i want one i want to go out weve been in here now all of us how long i dont know twenty minutes at least and for all we know there may be a man out there sick or hurt or frostbitten or maybe fallen and broken a leg oh come now come now thats pitching it a bit strongly charles otto said mr smith has always struck me as a man eminently able to take care of himself otto would probably have said the same thing if hed been watching smithy being mangled by a polar bear because of both nature and build otto was not a man to become unnecessarily involved in anything even remotely physical if you dont really care why dont you come out and say so this was a new side of conrad to me and he continued to develop his theme at my expense id have thought youd have been the first to suggest this dr marlowe i might have been too had i not known considerably more about smithy than he did i dont mind being the second i said agreeably in the event we all went with the exception of otto who complained of feeling unwell and judith haynes who roundly maintained that it was all nonsense and that mr smith would conic back when he felt like it an opinion which i held myself but for reasons entirely different from hers we were all provided with torches and agreed to keep as closely together as possible or if separated to be back inside thirty minutes at the latest the party set off in a wide sweep up the escarpment fronting the sorhamna to the north at least the others did i headed straight for the equipment hut where the diesel generator was thudding away reassuringly for it was unlikely that anyone of us would be missedno one would probably be aware of the presence of any other than his immediate neighboursand the best place to sit out a wild goose chase was the warmest and most sheltered spot i could find with my torch switched off so as not to betray my presence i opened the door of the hut passed inside closed the door took a step forward and swore out loud as i stumbled over something comparatively yielding and almost measured my length on the planked floor i recovered turned and switched on my torch a man was lying stretched out on the floor and to my total lack of surprise it proved to be smithy he stirred and groaned halfturned raised a feeble arm to protect his eyes from the bright glare of the torch then slumped back again his arm falling limply by his side his eyes closed there was blood smeared over his left cheek he stirred uneasily moving from side to side and moaning in that soft fashion a man does when he is close to the borderline of consciousness does it hurt much smithy i asked he moaned some more where you scratched your cheek with a handful of frozen snow i said he stopped moving and he stopped moaning the comedy act well keep for later in the programme i said coldly in the meantime will you kindly get up and explain to me why youve behaved like an irresponsible idiot i placed the torch on the generator casing so that the beam shone upwards it didnt give much light just enough to show smithys carefully expressionless face as lie got to his felt what do you mean he said pqs james r huntingdon colder greens and beirut currently and wrongly known as joseph rank smith is who i mean i guess im the irresponsible idiot you mean smithy said it would be nice to have introductions all round dr marlowe i said he kept the same carefully expressionless face four years and four months ago when we took you from your nice cosy job as chief officer in that brokendown lebanese tanker we thought you had a future with us a bright one even four months ago we thought the same thing but here now im very far from sure smithy smiled but his heart wasnt in it you cant very well fire me on bear island i can fire you in timbuctoo if i want to i said matteroffactly well come on you might have made yourself known to me smithy sounded aggrieved and i supposed i would have been also in his position i was beginning to guess i didnt know there was anyone else aboard apart from me you werent supposed to know you werent supposed to guess you were supposed to do exactly what you were told just that and no more you remember the last line in your written instructions they were underlined a quotation from milton i underlined it they also serve who only stand and wait smithy said corny i thought it at the time ive had a limited education i said point is did you stand and wait did you hell your orders were as simple and explicit as orders could ever be remain constantly aboard the morning rose until contacted do not under any circumstances leave the vessel even to step ashore do not repeat not attempt to conduct any investigations upon your own do not seek to discover anything at all times behave like a stereotype merchant navy officer this you failed to do i wanted you aboard that ship smithy i needed you aboardnow and where are youstuck in a godforsaken hut on bear island why in gods name couldnt you follow out simple instructions ok my fault but i thought i was alone circumstances alter cases dont they with four men mysteriously dead and four others pretty close to deathwell damn it all am i supposed to stand by and do nothing am i supposed to have no initiative not to think for myself even once not till youre told to and now look where youve left meone hand behind my back the morning rose was my other hand and now youve deprived me of it i wanted it on call and close to hand every hour of the day and night i might need it at any timeand now i havent got it is there anybody aboard that blasted trawler who could maintain position just offshore in the darkest night or bring her up the sorhamna in a full blizzard you know damn well theres not captain imrie couldnt bring her up the clyde on a midsummers afternoon you have a radio with you then to communicate with the trawler of course built into my medical caseno more than a police job but range enough be rather difficult to communicate with the morning roses transceiver lying in bits and pieces how very true i said and why is it in bits and pieces because on the bridge you started talking freely and at length about shouting for help over that selfsame radio and whistling up the nato atlantic forces if need be while all the time some clevercuts was taking his case out on the bridge wing drinking in every word you said i know there were fresh tracks in the snowwell my tracks but reused if you follow me so of course our clevercuts hies himself off and gets himself a heavy hammer i could have been more circumspect at that i suppose you can have my apologies if you want them but i dont see them being all that useful at this stage im hardly in line myself for a citation for distinguished services so well leave the apologies be now that youre herewell i wont have to watch my back so closely so theyre on to youwhoever they are whoever they are are unquestionably on to me i told him briefly all i knew not all i thought i knew or suspected i knew for i saw no point in making smithy as confused as myself i went on just so we dont act at crosspurposes let me initiate any action that ior wemay think may have to be taken i need hardly say that that doesnt deprive you of initiative if and when you find yourself or think you find yourself physically threatened in that event you have my advance permission to flatten anybody thats nice to know smithy smiled briefly for the first time it would be even nicer to know who it is that im likely to have to flatten it would be even nicer still to know what you who are i gather a fairly senior treasury official and i whom i know to be a junior one are doing on this goddamned island anyway the treasurys basic concern is money always money in one shape or other and thats why were here not our money not british money but what we call international dirty money and all the members of the central banks cooperate very closely on this issue when youre as poor as i am smithy said theres no such thing as dirty money even an underpaid civil servant like yourself wouldnt touch this lot this is all illgotten gains illegal loot from the days of world war ii this money has all been earned in blood and what has been recovered of itand thats only a fraction of the totalhas almost invariably been recovered in blood even as late as the spring of i germany was still a land of priceless treasures by the summer of that year the cupboard was almost entirely bare both the victors and the vanquished laid their sticky fingers on every imaginable object of value they could clap eyes ongold precious stones old masters securitiesgerman bank securities issued forty years ago are still perfectly validand took off in every conceivable direction i need hardly say that none of those involved saw fit to declare their latest acquisitions to the proper authorities i looked at my watch your worried friends are scouring bear island for youor a very small part of it anyway a halfhour search ill have to bring in your unconscious form in about fifteen minutes it all sounds pretty dull to me smith said all this loot i mean was there much of it it all depends what you call much its estimated that the alliesand hen i say allies i mean britain and america as well as the much maligned russiansmanaged to get hold of about twothirds of the total that left the nazis and their sympathisers with about a paltry onethird and the conservative estimate of that onethirdconservative smithy is that it amounts to approximately l pounds sterling you understand a thousand million all told give or take a hundred million that childish remark about this being a dull subject strike it off the record granted now this loot has found its way into some very odd places indeed some of it inevitably lies in secret numbered bank accounts some of itthere is no question about thislies in the form of specie in some of the very deepest austrian alpine lakes and has so far proved irrecoverable i know of two raphaels in the cellar gallery of a buenos aires millionaire a michelangelo in rio several hals and rubens in the same illegal collection in new york and a rembrandt in london their owners are either people who have been in were in or are closely connected to the governments or armed forces of the countries concerned theres nothing the governments concerned can do about it and there are no signs that theyre particularly keen to do anything about it anyway they themselves might be the ultimate beneficiaries as lately as the end of i an international cartel went on the market with њ worth of perfectly valid german securities issued in the s approaching in turn the london new york and zurich markets but the federal bank of germany refused to cash those until proper owner identification was established the point is that its an open secret that those securities were taken from the vaults of the reichsbank in i by a special red army unit who were constituted as the only legalised military burglars in history but thats only the tip of the iceberg so to speak the vast bulk of this immense fortune is hidden because the war is still too recent and people the illegal ownersstill too scared to convert their treasures into currency theres a special italian government recovery office that deals exclusively with this matter and its boss one professor siviero estimates that there are at least seven hundred old masters many of them virtually priceless still untraced while another expert a simon wiesenthal of the austrian jewish documentation service says virtually the same thing he incidentally maintains that there are countless highly wanted characters such as top ranking officers in the ss who are living in great comfort from hundreds of numbered bank accounts scattered throughout europe siviero and wiesenthal are the acknowledged legal experts in this form of recovery unfortunately there are known to be a handful of peoplethey amount to certainly not more than three or fourwho are possessed of an equal or even greater expertise in this matter but who unfortunately are lacking in the high principles of their colleagues if that is the word who operate on the right side of the law their names are known but they are untouchable because they have never committed any known crimes not even fraudulent conversion of stocks because the stocks are always good the claimants always proven they are nevertheless criminals operating on an international level we have the most skilful and successful of the lot with us here on bear island his name is johann heissman heissman none other hes a very gifted lad is our johann but heissman how can that be heissman what kind of sense can that make why its only two years i know its only two years since heissman made his spectacular escape from siberia and arrived in london to the accompaniment of lots of noise and tv cameras and yards of newspaper space and enough red carpet to go from tilbury to tomsk since which time he has occupied himself exclusively with his old love of filmmaking so how can it possibly be heissman well it can be heissman and it is heissman for our johann is a very downy bird indeed we have checked in fact that he was a movie studio partner of otto in vienna just before the war and that they did in fact attend the same gymnasium in st peiten which is not all that far away we do know that heissman ran the wrong way while otto ran the right way at the time of the anschluss and we do know that heissman because of his then communist sympathies was a very welcome guest of the third reich what followed was one of those incredibly involved double and trebledealing spy switches that occurred so frequently in central europe during the war heissman was apparently allowed to escape to russia where his sympathies were well known and then sent back to germany where he was ordered to transmit all possible misleading but still acceptable military information back to the russians why why did he do it because his wife and two children were captured at the same time as he was a good enough reason smithy nodded then when the war was over and the russians overran berlin and turned up their espionage records they found out what heissman had really been doing and shipped him to siberia i would have thought they would have shot him out of hand they would have too but for one small point i told you that heissman was a very downy bird and that this was a treble deal heissman was in effect and actually working throughout the war for the russians for four years he faithfully sent back his misleading reports to his masters and even though he had the help of the german intelligence in the preparation of his coded messages they never once latched onto the fact that heissman was using his own overlaid code throughout the russians simply spirited him away at the end of the war for his own safety and allegedly sent him to siberia our information is that hes never been to siberia we believe that his wife and two married daughters are still living very comfortably in moscow and he has been working for the russians ever since smithy was looking just faintly baffled and i felt some fellow feeling for him heissmans masterful duplicity was not for ready comprehension in his present capacity during his last eight years in his siberian prison heissman in a variety of disguises has been traced in north and south america south africa israel and believe it or not in the savoy hotel in london we know but we cannot prove that all those trips were in some way concerned with the recovery of nazi treasure for his russian mastersyou have to remember that heissman had built up the highest connections in the party the ss and the intelligence he was almost uniquely qualified for the task since his escape from siberia he has made two pictures in europe one in piedmont where an old widow complained that some tattered old paintings had been stolen from the loft of her barn the other in provence where an old country lawyer called in the police about some deed boxes that had been removed from his office whether either pictures or deed boxes were of any value we do not know still less can we connect either disappearance with heissman this is an awful lot to take in all at once smithy complained it is isnt it ok if i smoke five minutes then ive got to drag you back by the heels by the shoulders if its all the same to you smithy lit his cigarette and thought a bit so what weve got to find out is what heissman is doing on bear island thats why were here youve no idea none money its got to be money this would be the last place on earth id associate with money and maybe that association would be wrong anyway maybe its only a means to the money johann as i trust youve gathered by this time is a very devious character indeed would there be a tieup with the film company with his old friend gerran or would he just be making use of them ive simply no idea and mary stuart the secret rendezvous girl what could the possible connection be there same answer we know very little of her we know her real name shes never made any attempt to conceal thatage birthplace and that shes a latvianor comes from what used to be latvia before the russians took it over we also knowand this information she hasnt volunteered that it was only her mother who was latvian her father was german ah in the army perhaps intelligence ss thats the obvious connection to seek but we dont know her immigration forms say that her parents are dead so the department has been checking on her too weve had a rundown on everyone here connected with olympus productions we may as well have saved ourselves the trouble so no facts any hunches feelings hunches arent my stockintrade i somehow didnt feel they would be smithy ground out his cigarette before we go id like to mention two very uncomfortable thoughts that have just occurred to me number one johann heissman is a very bigtime very successful international operative true hes an international criminal a rose by any other name the point is that those boys avoid violence wherever possible isnt that true perfectly true apart from anything else its beneath them and have you ever heard heissmans name being associated with violence theres no record of it but theres been a considerable amount of violence one way or the other in the past day or two so if it isnt heissman whos behind the strongarm behaviour i dont say it isnt heissman the leopard can change his spots he may be finding himself for god knows what reason in so highly unusual a situation that he has no option other than to have recourse to violence he may for all we know have violent associates who dont necessarily represent his attitude or it may be someone entirely unconnected with him thats what i like smithy said simple straightforward answers and theres the second point that may have escaped your attention if our friends are on to you the chances are that theyre on to me too that eavesdropper on the bridge the point had not escaped my attention and not because of the bridge although that may have given pause for thought but because you deliberately skipped ship it doesnt matter what most of them think one person or possibly more is going to be convinced that you did it on purpose youre a marked man smithy so that when you drag me back there not everyone is going to feel genuine pangs of sorrow for poor old smithy some may question the bona fides of my injuries they wont question theyll damn well know but we have to act as if maybe youll watch my back too now and again i have a lot on my mind but ill try i had smithy by the armpits head lolling heels and bands trailing in the snow when two flashlights picked us up less than five yards from the door of the main cabin youve found him then it was goin harbottle by his side good man even to my by now hypersensitive car goins reaction sounded genuine yes about quarter of a mile away i breathed very quickly and deeply to give them some idea as to what it must have been like to drag a two hundredpound dead weight over uneven snowcovered terrain for such a distance found him in the bottom of a gully give me a hand will you they gave me a hand we hauled him inside fetched a camp cot and stretched him out on this good god good god good god otto wrung his hands the anguished expression on his face testimony to the fresh burden now added to the crippling weight of the cross he was already carrying whats happened to the poor fellow the only other occupant of the cabin judith haynes had made no move to leave the oil stove she was monopolising unconscious men being borne into her presence might have been so routine an affair as not even to merit the raising of an eyebrow im not sure i said between gasps heavy fall i think banged his head on a boulder looked like concussion maybe i probed through his hair with my fingertips found a spot on the scalp that felt no different from anywhere else and said ah they looked at me in anxious expectancy brandy i said to otto i fetched my stethoscope went through the necessary charade and managed to revive the coughing moaning smithy with a mouthful or two of brandy for one not trained to the boards he put up a remarkable performance highlighted at its end with a muted series of oaths and an expression of mingled shock and chagrin when i gently informed him that the morning rose had sailed without him during the course of the histrionics most of the other searchers wandered in in twos or threes i watched them all carefully without seeming to looking for an expression that was other than surprise or relief but i might have spared myself the trouble if there was one or more who was neither surprised nor relieved he had his emotions and facial muscles too well schooled to show anything i would have expected nothing else after about ten minutes our concern shifted from a now obviously recovering smithy to the fact that two members of the searching party allen and stryker were still missing after the events of that morning i felt that the absence of those two of all of us to be rather coincidental after fifteen minutes i felt it odd and after twenty minutes i felt it downright ominous a feeling that was clearly shared by nearly everyone there judith haynes had abandoned her squatters rights by her oil stove and was walking up and down in short nervous steps squeezing her hands together she stopped in front of me i dont like it i dont like it her voice was strained and anxious it could have been acting but i didnt think so whats keeping him why is he so long hes out there with that allen fellow somethings wrong i know it is i know it when i didnt answer she said well arent you going out to look for him just as you went out to look for mr smith here i said it wasnt very nice but then i didnt always feel so very kind to other people as lonnie did maybe your husband will come back when he feels like it she looked at me without speaking her lips moving but not speaking no real hostility in her face and i realised for the second time that day that her rumoured hatred for her husband was in fact only a rumour and that buried no matter how deep there did exist some form of concern for him she turned away and i reached for my torch once more unto the breach i said any takers conrad jungbeck heyter and hendriks accompanied me volunteers there were in plenty but i reasoned that not only would increased numbers get in one anothers way but the chances of someone else becoming lost would be all that greater immediately after leaving the hut the five of us fanned out at intervals of not more than fifteen feet and moved off to the north we found alien inside the first thirty seconds more accurately he found us for he saw our torcheshed lost his ownand came stumbling towards us out of the snow and the darkness stumbled was the operative word he was weaving and swaying like one far gone in alcohol or exhaustion and when he tried to speak his voice was thick and slurred he was shivering like a man with the ague it seemed not only pointless but cruel to question him in that condition so we hurried him inside i had a look at him as we sat him on a stool by an oil stove and i didnt have to look twice or very closely to see that this hadnt exactly been aliens day alien had been in the wars again and the damage that had been inflicted on him this time at least matched up to the injuries hed received that morning he had two nasty cuts above what had been up till then his undamaged eye a bruised and scratched right cheek and blood came from both his mouth and nose blood already congealed in the cold but his worst injury was a very deep gash on the back of the head the scalp laid open clear to the bone someone had given young alien a very thorough going over indeed and what happened to you this time i asked he winced as i started to clean up his face or should i say do you know what happened to you i dont know he said thickly he shook his head and drew his breath in sharply as some pain struck through either head or neck i dont know i dont remember youve been in a fight laddie i said again someones cut you up and quite badly i know i can feel it i dont remember honest to god i dont remember ii just dont know what happened but you must have seen him goin said reasonably whoever it was you must have been face to face with him gods sake boy your shirts tom and theres at least a couple of buttons missing from your coat and he had to be standing in front of you when he did this to you surely you must have caught a glimpse of him at least it was dark allen mumbled i didnt see anything i didnt feel anything all i knew was that i woke up kind of groggy like in the snow with the back of my head hurting i knew i was bleeding andplease i dont know what happened yes you do yes you do judith haynes had pushed her way to the front the transformation that had taken place in her face was as astonishing as it was ugly and although her morning performance had partially prepared me for something of this kind and though this expression was different from the one that had disfigure her face that time it was still an almost frightening thing to watch the red gash of the mouth had vanished the lips drawn in and back over hared teeth the green eyes were no more than slits and as had happened that morning the skin was stretched back over her cheekbones until it appeared far too tight for her face she screamed at him you damned liar wanted your own back didnt you you dirty little bastard what have you done with my husband do you hear me do you hear me what have you done with him damn you where is he where did you leave him allen looked up at her in a halfscared astonishment then shook his head wearily im sorry miss haynes i dont know what she hooked her longnailed fingers into talons and lunged for him but id been waiting for it so had both goin and conrad she struggled like a trapped wildcat screaming invective at allen then suddenly relaxed her breath coming in harsh rasping sobs now then now then judith otto said theres no dont you now then me you silly old bastard she screamed filial respect was clearly not judith hayness strong point but otto though clearly nervous accepted his daughters abuse as if it were a matter of course why dont you find out instead what this young swines done to my husband why dont you why dont you she struggled to free her arms and as she was trying to move away we let her go she picked up a torch and ran for the door stop her i said heyter and jungbeck big men both blocked her flight let me go let me out she shouted neither heyter nor jungbeck moved and she whirled round on me who the hell are you toi want to go out and find michael im sorry miss haynes i said youre in no condition to go to look for anyone youd just run wild no trace of where youd been and in five minutes time youd be lost too and perhaps lost for good were leaving in just a moment she took three quick steps towards otto her fists clenched her teeth showing again you let him push me around like this this with an incinerating glare in my direction spineless thats you absolutely spineless anybody can walk over you otto blinked nervously at this latest tirade but said nothing arent i supposed to be your bloody daughter arent you supposed to be the bloody boss gods sake who gives the orders about here you or marlowe your father does goin said naturally but without any disrespect to dr marlowe we dont hire a dog just to bark ourselves hes a medical man and wed be fools not to defer to him in medical matters are you suggesting im a medical case all the colour had drained from her cheeks and she looked uglier than ever are you are you then a mental case perhaps heaven knows i wouldnt have blamed goin if hed said yes straight out and left it at that but goin was far too balanced and diplomatic to say any such thing and besides hed clearly been through this sort of crisis before he said quietly but not condescendingly im suggesting no such thing of course youre distressed of course youre overwrought after all it is your husband thats missing but i agree with dr marlowe that youre not the person to go looking for him well have him back here all the quicker if you cooperate with us judith she hesitated still halfway between hysteria and rage then swung away i taped the gash on allens head and said thatll do till i come back afraid ill have to shave off a few locks and stitch it on the way to the door i stopped and said quietly to goin keep her away from allen will you goin nodded and for heavens sake keep her away from mary darling he looked at me in what was as close to astonishment as he was capable of achieving that kid that kid shes next on the list for miss hayness attentions when miss haynes gets around to thinking about it that is i left with the same four as previously conrad the last out closed the door behind him and said jesus my charming leading lady what a virago she is shes a little upset i said mildly a little upset heaven send im in the next county if she ever gets really mad what the hell do you think can have happened to stryker i have no idea i said and because it was dark i didnt have to assume an honest expression to go with the words i moved closer to him so that the others already fanned out in line of search couldnt hear me seeing were such a bunch of oddballs anyway i hope an odd request from another oddball wont come amiss you disappoint me doctor i thought you and i were two of the very few halfway normal people around here by the prevailing standards any moderate oddball is normal you know anything of lonnies past he was silent for a moment then said he has a past we all have a past if you think i mean a criminal past no lonnie hasnt got one i just want to find out if he was married or had any family thats all why dont you ask him yourself if i felt free to ask him myself would i be asking you another silence your name really marlowe doe marlowe as ever was christopher marlowe passport birth certificate driving licencetheyre all agreed on it christopher marlowe just like the playwright eh my parents had literary inclinations uhhuh he paused again remember what happened to your namesakestabbed in the back by a friend before his thirtieth birthday rest easy my thirtieth birthday is lost in the mists of time and youre really a doctor yes and youre really something else too yes lonnie marital status children or no you may rely on conrads discretion thanks i said we moved apart we were walking to the north for two reasonsthe wind and hence the snow were to our backs and so progress was easier in that direction and allen had come stumbling from that direction in spite of allens professed total lack of recall of what had happened it seemed likely to me that we might find stryker also somewhere in that direction and so it proved over here over here in spite of the muffling effects of the snow hendrikss shout sounded curiously highpitched and cracked ive found him ive found him hed found him all right michael stryker was lying face down in the snow arms and legs outspread in an almost perfectly symmetrical fashion both fists were clenched tight on the snow beside his left shoulder lay a smooth elliptical stone which from its sizeit must have weighed between sixty and seventy poundsbetter qualified for the name of boulder i stooped low over this boulder bringing the torch close and at once saw the few dark hairs imbedded in the dark and encrusted stain proof if proof were required but i hadnt doubted anyway that this was what had been used to smash in the back of strykers skull death would have been instantaneous hes dead jungbeck said incredulously hes all that i said and murdered that too i tried to turn him over on his back but conrad and jungbeck had to lend their not inconsiderable weights before this was done his upper lip was viciously split all the way down from the nostril a tooth was missing and he had a peculiar red and raw looking mark on his right temple by god there must have been a fight jungbeck said huskily i wouldnt have thought that kid allen had had it in him i wouldnt have thought so either i said allen conrad said id have sworn he was telling the truth could hewell do you think it could have happened when he was suffering from amnesia all sorts of funny things can happen when youve had a bump on the head i said i looked at the ground around the dead man there were footprints there not many already faint and blurred from the driving snow there was no help to be gained from that quarter i said lets get him back so we carried the dead man back to the camp and it wasnt in spite of the uneven terrain and the snow in our faces as difficult a task as it might have been for the same reason that id found it so difficult to turn him overthe limbs had already begun to stiffen not from the onset of rigor mortis for it was too soon for that yet but from the effects of the intense cold we laid him in the snow outside the main cabin i said to hendriks go inside and ask goin for a bottle of brandysay that i sent you back for it that we need it to keep us going it was the last thing i would ever have recommended to keep anyone warm in bitter outdoor cold but it was all i could think of on the spur of the moment tell goinquietlyto come here goin clearly aware that there was something far amiss walked out casually and casually shut the door behind him but there was nothing casual about his reaction when he saw stryker lying there his gashed and marblewhite face a deaths head in the harsh light of several torches goins own face was clear enough in the backwash of light reflected from the snow the shocked expression on his face he could have arranged for the draining of blood that left it almost as white as strykers he couldnt jesus christ he whispered dead i said nothing just turned the dead man over with conrads and jungbecks help again this time it was more difficult goin made a strange noise in his throat but otherwise didnt react at all i suppose hed nothing left to react with he just stood there and stared as the driving snow whitened the dead mans anorak and mercifully the fearful wound in the occiput for what seemed quite a long time we stood there in silence gazing down at the dead man i was aware almost subconsciously that the wind now veering beyond south was strengthening for the thickening snow was driving along now almost parallel to the ground i do not know what the temperature was but it must have been close on thirty degrees below freezing i was dimly aware that i was shaking with the cold looking around i could see that the others were also our breaths froze as they struck the icy air but the wind whipped them away before the vapour had time to form accident goin said hoarsely it could have been an accident no i said i saw the boulder that was used to crush his skull in goin made the same curious noise in his throat again and i went on we cant leave him here and we cant take him inside i suggest we leave him in the tractor shed yes yes the tractor shed goin said he really didnt know what he was saying and whos going to break the news to miss haynes i went on god alone knew that i didnt fancy doing it what he was still shocked what was that his wife shell have to be told as a doctor i supposed i was the one to do it but the decision was taken from my hands the cabin door was jerked abruptly open and judith haynes her two dogs by her ankles stood there framed against the light from the interior with otto and the count just vaguely discernible behind her she stood there for some little time a hand on either doorjamb quite immobile and without any expression that i could see then walked forward in a curiously dreamlike fashion and stooped over her husband after a few moments she straightened looked around as if puzzled then turned questioning eyes on me but only for a moment for the questioning eyes turned up in her head and she crumpled and fell heavily across strykers body before i or anyone could get to her conrad and i with goin following brought her inside and laid her on the camp cot so lately occupied by smithy the cocker spaniels had to be forcibly restrained from joining her her face was alabaster white and her breathing very shallow i lifted up her right eyelid and there was no resistance to my thumb it was only an automatic reaction on my part it hadnt even occurred to me that the faint wasnt genuine i became aware that otto was standing close by his eyes wide his mouth slightly open his hands clenched together until the ivory knuckles showed is she all right he asked hoarsely will she shell come to i said smelling salts he said perhaps no smelling salts to hasten her recovery to the bitter reality she would have to face and michael my soninlaw hesi mean you saw him i said almost irritably hes dead of course hes dead but howbut how he was murdered there were one or two involuntary exclamations the shocked indrawing of breath then a silence that became intensified with the passing of seconds by the hissing of the coleman lamps i didnt even bother to look up to see what the individual reactions might be for i knew by now that id learn nothing that way i just looked at the unconscious woman and didnt know what to think stryker the tough urbane cynical stryker had in his own way been terrified of this woman had it been because of the power she had wielded as ottos daughter his knowledge that his livelihood was entirely dependent on her most wayward whim and i could imagine few more gifted exponents of the wayward whim than judith haynes had it been because of her pathological jealousy which i knew beyond all question to exist because of the instant bitchiness which could allegedly range from the irrational to the insane or had she held over his head the threat of some nameless blackmail which could bring him at once to his knees had he in his own way even loved his wife and hoped against hopeless hope that she might reciprocate some of this and been prepared to suffer any humiliation any insult in the hope that he might achieve this or part of it id never know but the questions were academic anyway stryker no longer concerned me i was only turning them over in my mind wondering in what way they could throw any light on judith hayness totally unexpected reaction to strykers death she had despised him she must have despised him for his dependence upon her his weakness his meek acceptance of insult the fear he had displayed before me for the emptiness and nothingness that had lain concealed behind so impressively masculine a facade but had she loved him at the same time loved him for what he had been or might have been or was she just desolated at the loss of her most cherished whipping boy the one sure person in the world upon whom she knew she could with impunity vent her wayward spleen whenever the fancy took her even without her awareness of it he might have become an integral an indispensable part of her existence an insidiously woven warp in the weft of her being always dependable always there always ready to hand when she most needed him even when that need was no more than to absorb the grey corrosive poison eating away steadily at the edges of her mind even the most tarnished cornerstone can support the most crumbling edifice take that away and the house comes tumbling down the traumatic reaction to strykers death could paradoxically be the clinching manifestation of a complete and irredeemable selfishness the as yet unrealised realisation that she was the most pitiful of all creatures a person totally alone judith haynes stirred and her eyes fluttered open memory came back and she shuddered i eased her to a sitting position and she looked dully around her where is he i had to strain to hear the words its all right miss haynes i said and just to compound that fatuous statement added well look after him where is he she moaned hes my husband my husband i want to see him better not miss haynes goin could be surprisingly gentle as dr marlowe says well take care of things youve seen him already and no good can come bring him in bring him in a voice devoid of life but the will absolute i must see him again i rose and went to the door the count barred my way his aquiline aristocratic features held a mixture of revulsion and horror you cant do that its too ghastlyitsits macabre what do you think that i think it is i felt savage but i know i didnt sound that way i think i only sounded tired if i dont bring him in shell just go outside again its not much of a night for being outside so we brought him in the same three of us jungbeck and conrad and myself and we laid him on his back so that the fearful wound in the occiput didnt show judith haynes rose from her camp cot moved slowly towards him like a person in a dream and sank to her knees without moving she looked at him for some moments then reached out and gently touched the gashed face no one spoke no one moved not without effort she pulled his right arm close in to his side made to do the same with his left noticed that the est was still clenched and carefully prised it open a brown circular object lay in the palm of his hand she took it placed it in the palm of her own hand straightenedstill on her kneesand swung in a slow semicircle showing us what she held then her hand outstretched towards him she looked at allen we all looked at allen the brown leather button in her hand matched the still remaining buttons on allens tom coat im not sure how long the silence went on a silence that the almost intolerable hiss of the lamps and the ululating moan of the south wind served only to deepen it must have lasted at least ten seconds although it seemed many times as long a seemingly interminable period of time during which nobody moved and nothing moved not even eyes for allens eyes were fixed on the button in judith hayness hand in fascinated uncomprehension while every other eye in the room was on allen that one small leathercovered button held us all in thrall judith haynes was the first to move she rose very slowly as if it called for a tremendous effort of both mind and muscle and stood there for a moment as if irresolute she seemed quiet now and very resigned and because this was the wrong reaction altogether i looked past her towards conrad and smithy and caught the eyes of both conrad lowered his eyes briefly as if in acknowledgement of a signal smithy shifted his gaze towards judith haynes and when she began to move away from the body of her husband both of them moved casually towards each other to block off her clearly intended approach to allen judith haynes stopped looked at them and smiled that wont be necessary at all she said she tossed the button to allen who caught it in involuntary reaction he held it in his hand staring at it then looked up in perplexity at judith haynes who smiled again youll be needing that wont you she said and walked in the direction of her allocated room i relaxed and was aware that others were doing so also for i could hear the slow exhalation of breaths of those standing closest to me i looked away from judith haynes to allen and that was a mistake because i had relaxed too soon id been instinctively aware that the seemingly quiet and sad resignation had been wholly out of character but had put it down to the effects of the shattering shock she had just received you killed him you killed him her voice was an insane scream but no more insane than the demented fury with which she was attacking mary darling who had already stumbled over backwards the other woman falling on top of her clawing viciously with hooked fingers you bitch you whore you filthy slut youyou murderess youre the person who killed him you killed my husband you you sobbing and shrieking maniacal invective at the terrified and momentarily paralysed mary darling who had already lost her big hornrimmed spectacles judith haynes wound one hand round the unfortunate marys hair and was reaching for her eyes with the other when smithy and conrad got to her both were big strong men but she fought with such crazed and tigerish ferocity and they had at the same time to cope with two equally hysterical dogs that it took them quite some seconds to pull her clear and even then she clung with the strength of madness to marys hair a grip that smithy ruthlessly and without hesitation broke by squeezing her wrist until she shrieked with pain they dragged her upright and she continued to scream hysterically with all the strength of her lungs no longer attempting even to mouth words just that horrible nervedrilling shrieking like some animal in its dying agony then the sound abruptly ceased her legs buckled and smithy and conrad eased her to the floor conrad looked at me act two he was breathing heavily and looked pale no this is real will you please take her to her cubicle i looked at the shocked and sobbing mary but she didnt need any immediate assistance from me for allen his own injuries forgotten had dropped to his knees beside her raised her to a sitting position and was using a nonetooclean handkerchief to dab at the three deep and ugly scratches that had been torn down the length of her left cheek i left them went into my cubicle prepared a hypodermic and entered the cubicle where judith haynes had been taken smithy and conrad were standing watchfully by and had been joined by otto the count and goin otto looked at the syringe and caught my arm is thatis that for my daughter what are you going to do to her its all over now mangood god you can see shes unconscious and im going to see that she bloody well stays that way i said for hours and hours and hours that way its best for her and best for all of us all right im sorry for your daughter shes had a tremendous shock but medically im not concerned with that im just concerned with how best to treat her for the condition shes in now which is frankly unbalanced unstable and highly dangerous or do you want to have a look at mary darling again otto hesitated but goin calmly reasonable as always came to my help dr llarlowe is perfectly right otoand its for jud i iths own good after such a shock a long rest can only help this is the best thing for her i wasnt so sure about that id have preferred a strait jacket but i nodded my thanks to goin administered the injection helped bundle her into a zipped sleeping bag saw that she was covered over and above that with a sufficiency of blankets and left her i took the dogs with me and put them in my own cubiclei dont much like having animals especially highly strung ones in the company of a person under sedation allen had marv darling seated on a bench now but was still dabbing her cheek shed stopped sobbing now was just breathing with long quivering indrawn gasps and scratches apart didnt seem much the worse for an experience that must have been as harrowing as it was brief lonnie was standing a few feet away looking sorrowfully at the girl and shaking his head poor poor lassie he said quietly poor little girl shell be all right i said if i do a halfway job the scratches wont even scar i looked at strykers body and decided that its removal to the tractor shed was clearly the first priority apart from lonnie and allen no one had eyes for anything else and even although out of sight would not necessarily be out of mind the absence of that mutilated body could hardly fail to improve morale i wasnt talking about young mary lonnie had my attention again i was thinking about judith haynes poor lonely lassie i looked at him closely but i should have known him well enough by then to realise that he was incapable of either dissimulation or duplicity he looked as sad as he sounded lonnie i said you never cease to astonish me i lit the oil stove put some water on to heat then turned to stryker both smithy and conrad were waiting and words were unnecessary lonnie insisted on coming with us to open doors and hold a flashlight we left stryker in the tractor shed and went back to the main cabin smithy and conrad went inside but lonnie showed no intentions of following them he stood there as if deep in thought seemingly oblivious of a wind now strong enough to have to lean against of a thickening driving snow now approaching the proportions of a blizzard of the intense and steadily deepening cold i think ill stay out here a bit he said nothing like a little fresh air to clear the head no indeed i said i took the torch from him and directed its beam at the nearest hut in there on the left wherever else olympus productions may have fallen short in the commissariat department it hadnt been in the line of alcoholic stimulants my dear fellow he retrieved his torch with a firm grasp i personally supervised its storage and not even a lock to contend with i said and what if there was otto would give me the key otto would give you a key i said carefully of course do you think im a professional safecracker who goes around festooned with strings of skeleton keys who do you think gave me the keys to the lounge locker on the morning rose otto did i said brightly of course what kind of blackmail are you using lonnie otto is a very very kind man lonnie said seriously i thought id told you that id just forgotten i watched him thoughtfully as he plodded purposefully through the deep snow towards the provisions hut then went inside the main cabin most of the people inside now that stryker had gone had transferred their attention to allen who was clearly selfconsciously aware of this for he no longer had his arm around mary although he still dabbed at her cheek with a handkerchief conrad who had clearly become more than a little smitten by mary stuart for hed sought out her company whenever possible in the past two days was sitting beside her chafing one of her handsi assumed shed been complaining of the temperature which was still barely above freezingand although she seemed halfreluctant and was smiling in some embarrassment she wasnt objecting to the extent of making a song and dance about it otto goin the count and divine were talking in low voices near one of the oil stoves divine not surprisingly was there not in the capacity of a contributor to the conversation but as a bartender for he was laying out glasses and bottles under ottos fussy direction otto beckoned me across after what weve just been through he said i think were all badly in need of a restorative that otto should be lashing out so recklessly with his private supplies was sufficient indication of the extent to which he had been shaken it will also give us time to decide what to do with him who allen of course ah well im sorry im afraid you gentlemen will have to count me out for both drink and deliberations i nodded to allen and mary darling both of whom were watching us with some degree of apprehension a little patching up to do there excuse me i took the now hot water from the oil stove brought it into my cubicle put a white cloth on the rickety table that was there laid out a basin instruments and what medicaments i thought id require then returned to where conrad and mary stuart were sitting in the main body of the cabin like all the other little groups in the cabin they were talking in voices so low as to be virtually whispering whether from a desire for privacy or because they still felt themselves to be in the presence of death i didnt know conrad to my complete lack of surprise was now industriously massaging her other hand and as that was her left or faraway one i assumed that he hadnt had to fight for it i said im sorry to interrupt the first aid but i want to patch up young allen a bit i wonder if mary dear will look after mary darling for a bit mary dear conrad raised an enquiring eyebrow to distinguish her from mary darling i explained its what i call her when were alone in the long watches of the night she smiled slightly but that was her only reaction mary dear conrad said appreciatively i like it may i call you that i dont know she said mockseriously perhaps its copyright he can have the patent under licence i said i can always rescind it what were you two being so conspiratorial about ah yes conrad said your opinion doe that stone out there i mean the lump of rock stryker was clobbered with id guess the weight about seventy pounds would you the same i asked mary here if she could lift a rock like that above her head and she said dont be ridiculous unless shes an olympic weightlifter in disguise well yes you are ridiculous she couldnt why well just look at her he nodded across at the other mary skin and bone just skin and bone now how i wouldnt let allen hear you you know what i mean a rock that size murderess judith haynes called her well so ok she was out there looking with the others but how on earth i think miss haynes had something else in mind i said i left them beckoned to allen then turned to smithy who was sitting close by i require a surgery assistant feeling up to it now sure he rose anything to take my mind off captain imrie and the report be must be writing out about me right now there was nothing i could do to allens face that nature couldnt do better so i concentrated on the gash on the back of his head i froze it shaved the area around it and jerked my head to smithy to have a look he did this and his eyes widened a little but he said nothing i put eight stitches in the wound and covered it with plaster during all of this we hadnt exchanged a word and allen was obviously very conscious of this he said you havent got much to say to me have you dr marlowe a good tradesman doesnt talk on the job youre just thinking what all the others are thinking arent you i dont know i dont know what all the others are thinking well thats it just comb your hair straight back and no one will know youre prematurely bald yes thank you he turned and faced me hesitated and said it does look pretty black against me doesnt it not to a doctor youyou mean you dont think i did it its not a matter of thinking its a matter of knowing look all in all youve had a pretty rough day youre more shaken up than you realise and when that anaesthetic wears off youre going to hurt a bit your cubicles next to mine isnt it yes but go and lie down for a couple of hours yes but and ill send mary through when ive finished with her he made to speak then nodded wearily and left smithy said that was nasty the back of his head i mean it must have been one helluva clout hes been lucky that his skull isnt fractured doubly lucky in that hes not even concussed uhhuh smithy thought for a moment look im not a doctor and im not very good at coining phrases but doesnt this put a rather different complexion upon matters i am a doctor and it does he thought some more especially when you have a close look at stryker especially that i brought mary darling in she was very pale still apprehensive and had a little girl lost look about her but she had herself under control she looked at smithy made as if to speak hesitated changed her mind and let me get on with doing what i could i cleaned and disinfected the scratches taped them up carefully and said itll itch like fury for a bit but if you can resist the temptation to haul the plasters off then youll have no scars thank you doctor ill try she looked very wan can i speak to you please of course she looked at smithy and i said you can speak freely i promise you it will go no further yes yes i know but mr gerran is dispensing free scotch out there smithy said and made for the door id never forgive myself if i passed up an experience that can happen only once in a lifetime she had me by the lapels even before smithy had the door fully closed behind him there was a frantic worry in her face a sick misery in the eyes that made me realise just how much it had cost her to maintain her composure while smithy had been there allen didnt do it dr marlowe he didnt i know he didnt i swear he didnt i know things look awful for him the fight they had this morning and now this other fight and that button inin mr strykers hand and everything but i know he didnt he told me he didnt allen couldnt tell a lie he wouldnt tell me a lie and he couldnt hurt anything i mean just not kill anybody i mean hurt anybody he just couldnt do it and i didnt do it her fists clenched until the knuckles showed she was even for some odd reason trying to shake me now and tears were rolling down her face whatever shed known in her short life hadnt prepared her for times and situations like those she shook her head in despair i didnt i didnt a murderess thats what she called me in front of everybody she called me a murderess i couldnt kill anybody dr marlowe l mary i stopped the hysterical flow by the simple process of putting my fingers across her lips i seriously doubt whether you could dispose of a fly without worrying yourself sick afterwards you and allen together well if it were a particularly obnoxious fly you just might manage it i wouldnt bet on it though she took my hand away and stared at me dr marlowe do you mean i mean youre a silly young goose together you make a fine pair of silly young geese its not that i just dont believe that allen or you had anything to do with strykers death i know you hadnt she sniffed a bit and then she said youre an awfully kind person dr marlowe i know youre trying to help us oh do shut up i said i can prove it prove it prove it there was some hope in the sick eyes she didnt know whether to believe me or not and then it seemed that she decided not to for she shook her head again and said numbly she said i killed him miss haynes was speaking figuratively i said which is not the same thing at all and even then she was wrong what she meant was that you were the precipitating factor in her husbands death which of course you werent precipitating factor yes i took her hands from my now badly crushed lapels held them in mine and looked at her in my best avuncular fashion tell me mary darling have you ever dallied in the moonlight with michael stryker me have i mary yes she said miserably i mean no no i didnt thats very clear i said lets put it this way did you ever give miss haynes reason to suspect that you had been dallying i mean yes she sniffed again no i mean he did i kept my baffled expression in cold storage and looked at her encouragingly he called me into his cabin just the day we left wick that was he was alone there he said that he wanted to discuss some things about the film with me a change from etchings i said she looked at me uncomprehendingly and went on but it wasnt about the film he wanted to talk you must believe me dr marlowe you must i believe you he closed the door and grabbed me and then spare my unsullied mind the grisly details when the villain was forcing his unwelcome attentions upon you there came the pitapat of feminine footsteps in the corridor outside whereupon the villain rapidly assumed a position where you appeared to be forcing your unwelcome attentions upon him and when the door openedto reveal of course none other than his better halfthere he was fending off the licentious young continuity girl and crying no no nanette control yourself this can never be or words to that effect more or less she looked more miserable than ever then her eyes widened how did you know the strykers of this world are pretty thick upon the ground the ensuing scene must have been pretty painful there were two scenes she said dully something like it happened on the upper deck the following night she said she was going to report me to her fathermr gerran he saidnot when she was there of coursethat if i tried to make trouble hed have me fired he was a director you know later when i got well friendly with allen he said hed get us both fired if need be and make sure that neither of us would ever again get a job in films allen said that this was all wrong why should we accept this when neither of us had done anything so so he tried to make him see the error of his ways this morning and got clobbered for his pains dont worry youve neither of you anything to worry about youll find your wounded knight errant next door mary i smiled and gently touched the swollen cheek this should be something to see loves young dream in sticking plaster you do love him dont you mary of course she looked at me solemnly dr marlowe im wonderful she smiled almost happily and left smithy who must have been watching for her departure came in almost at once and i told him what had been said had to be that of course he said the truths always obvious when its hung up in front of you and youre beaten over the head with a twobyfour to make you take notice and now and now i think three things the first to clear the names of the two love birds next door thats not important at this stage but theyre sensitive souls and i think theyd like to be on speaking terms with the rest of the company again second thing is ive no intention of being stranded here for the next twentytwo daystwo days is a lot more like it who knows i might be able to pressure unknown or unknowns into precipitate action i should have thought there had been enough of that already smithy said you may have a point third thing is i could make life a great deal easier and safer for both of us if we had every person so busy watching every other person that it would make it a great deal more difficult for the disaffected to creep up upon our backs unawares you touch upon a very sympathetic nerve smithy said your plan into action and at once i say a small chat with the assembled company a small chat with the assembled company i suggested a couple of hours liedown to allen but i think he and mary should be there would you smithy left and i went into the living area goin otto and the count all armed with glasses as was almost every other person there were still in solemn and lowvoiced conclave otto beckoned me across one moment i said i went outside coughed and caught my breath as the bitter air cut into my lungs then trudged against that snowfilled gale across to the provisions hut lonnie was seated on a packing case lovingly examining the amber contents of a glass against the light from his torch ha he said our peripatetic healer you know when one consumes a noble wine like this wine a figure of speech when one consumes a noble scotch like this half the pleasure lies in the visual satisfaction ever tried it in the darkness flat stale strangely lacking in bouquet theres a worthwhile monograph here im sure he waved his glass in the direction of the crates of bottles by one wall harking back to my earlier allusions to the hereafter if they can have bars in bear island then surely lonnie i said youre missing out on the largesse stakes otto is dispensing noble wine at this very moment hes using very large glasses i was on the very point of leaving he tilted his head and swallowed rapidly i have a dread of being thought a misanthrope i took this friend of the human race back to the main cabin and counted those there twentyone myself included as it should have been the twentysecond and last judith haynes was deeply unconscious and would be so for hours otto beckoned me a second time and i went across weve been having what you might call a council of war otto said importantly weve arrived at a conclusion and would like to have your opinion why mine im just an employee like everyone else here apart of course from the three of youand miss haynes consider yourself a coopted director the count said generously temporary and unpaid of course your opinion would be valued goin said precisely opinion about what our proposed measures for dealing with allen otto said i know that in law every man is presumed innocent until proved otherwise nor do we have any wish to be inhumane but simply in order to protect ourselves i wanted to talk to you about that i said about protecting ourselves i wanted to talk to everybody about that in fact thats what i propose to do this very moment you propose to do what otto could arrange his eyebrows in a very forbidding fashion when he put his mind to it a brief address only i said itll take up hardly any of your time i cant permit that otto said loftily at least not until you give us some idea what you have in mind and then we may or may not give our consent your permission or lack of it is irrelevant i said indifferently i dont require permission when im talking about something that may affect livesyou know the difference between living and dying i forbid it i would remind you of what you have just reminded me otto had forgotten about the need for conducting delicate matters in conspiratorial murmurs and we had the undivided attention of everyone in the cabin you are an employee of mine sir and ill now perform my last act as a dutiful employee i poured myself a measure of ottos scotch which as he and several others were drinking it i presumed to be safe to drink hcalth to one and all i said and i dont mean that lightly or in the conventional sense were going to need it all before we leave this island and let each one of us hope that he or she is not the one who is going to he abandoned by fortune as for being your employee gerran you can consider my resignation as being effective as from this moment i do not care to work for fools more importantly i do not care to work for those who may be both fools and knaves this at least had the effect of reducing otto to silence for to judge by the indigo hue his complexion was assuming he appeared to be having some little difficulty in his breathing the count i observed had a mildly speculative expression on his face while goins face held the impassivity of one withholding judgement i looked round the cabin i said it is i know belabouring the obvious to say that this trip of ours so far has been singularly luckless and illstarred we have been plagued by a series of tragic and extraordinarily strange events we had antonio die this might have been the merest mischance it might equally well be that he was the victim of a premeditated murder or the hapless victim of a misplaced murder attempt that was aimed at someone else exactly the same can be said of the two stewards moxen and scott similar attempts may or may not have been aimed at mr gerran mr smith oakley and young cecil here all i can say with certainty is that if i hadnt been so lucky as to be in the vicinity when they were struck down at least three of those might have died you may wonder why i make such a fuss about what could have been a simple deadly outbreak of food poisoning it is because i have reason to believe without being able to prove it that a deadly poison called aconitine which is indistinguishable in appearance from horseradish was introduced at specific points into the evening meal we had on the occasion when those people were struck down i checked to see if i had the attention of all those present and ive never made a more superfluous check they were so stunned that they hadnt even got to the lengths of looking at each other ottos liquid largesse wholly forgotten they had eyes only for me ears only for what i was saying the average university lecturer would have found it a dream of paradise but then the average university lecturer rarely had the doubtful fortune to chance upon such wholly absorbing subject matter as i had to hand and then we have the mysterious disappearance of halliday i have no doubt that the cause of his death could be established beyond doubt if an autopsy could be carried out but as ive equally no doubt that the unfortunate halliday lies on the floor of the barents sea this can never be possible but it is my beliefand this again is but conjecturethat he died not from any form of food poisoning but because he had a nightcap from a poisoned whisky bottle that was intended for me i looked at mary stuart huge eyes and parted lips in a white shocked face but i was the only one who saw it i pulled down the collar of my duffle coat and showed them the impressively large and impressively multicoloured bruise on the lefthand side of my neck this of course could have been selfinflicted or maybe i just slipped somewhere and banged myself or take this odd business of the smashed radio somebody with an aversion to radios perhaps and suchlike outwards manifestations of what we choose to call progress or someone who found the arctic just too much for him and had to take it out on somethingyou know the equivalent of going cafard in the desert so far nothing but conjecture an extraordinary and even more extraordinarily unconnected series of violent and tragic mishaps one might claim coincidence is an accepted part of life but not surely coincidence multiplied to the nth degree like this that would have to lie at the very farthest bounds of possibility i think you would admit that if we could prove the existence beyond any doubt of a carefully premeditated and carefully executed crime then the other violent happenings must cease to be regarded as conjectural coincidences and considered as being what they then would be deliberately executed murders in pursuit of some goal that cant yet even be guessed at but must be of overwhelming importance they werent admitting anything or at least if they were admitting anything to themselves they werent saying it out loud but i think it was really a case of their minds having stopped working not all their minds there had to be one exception probably more and we have this one proven crime i went on the rather clumsily executed murder of michael stryker which was at the same time an attempt and not a very clever attempt to frame young allen here for something he never did i dont think the murderer had any special illwill towards allen well no more than he seems to have for the general run of mankind he just wanted to divert any possible suspicion from himself i think if youd all had time enough to think about it youd have come to the eventual conclusion that allen couldnt possibly have had anything to do with it with a doctor in the house if youll excuse the phrase he hadnt a hope in hell allen says he has no recollection at all about what happened i believe him absolutely hes sustained a severe blow on the back of the headthe scalp is open to the bone how he escaped a fractured skull far less concussion i cant imagine it certainly must have rendered him unconscious for a considerable period which leads one to assume that this assailant was still in excellent shape after what was clearly this coupdegidee are we to assume then that allen after having been knocked senseless immediately leapt up and smote his assailant hip and thigh that doesnt make any kind of sense at all what does make sense what is the only answer is that the unknown crept up behind allen and laid him out not with his hands but with some heavy and solid objectprobably a stone theres more than enough lying around having done this he proceeded to cut the unconscious allen up about the face ripped his coat and tore off a couple of buttorlsall to give the very convincing impression that hed been in a fight the same thing but this time on a lethal scale happened to stryker im convinced that it was no accident that allen was merely knocked unconscious while stryker was killedour friend who must be a bit of an expert in such matters knew just how much weight to bring to bear in each case by no means as easy a matter as you might think then this ghoul in a stupid attempt to create the impression that stryker had been the other party to the fight proceeded to rough up strykers face as he had done allens i leave it to you to form your own estimate of just how evil must be the mind of a man who will deliberately set about mutilating the face of a dead man i left them for a little to form their own estimates for the most part they looked neither sick nor revolted their reactions were mainly of shock and minds still consciously fighting against comprehension no glances were exchanged no eyes moved their eyes were only for me stryker had a split upper lip a tooth missing and a reddish rough mark on his temple which i think must have been caused by another stone very probably all the injuries were inflicted in this fashion to avoid any telltale marking of the hands or knuckles had those injuries been sustained in the course of a fight there would have been extensive bleeding and fairly massive bruising there were no signs of either because stryker was dead and circulation had ceased before those wounds were caused to complete what he thought would be a most convincing effect the murderer then closed the dead mans hand round one of the buttons torn from allens coat incidentally there were no signs whatever of the churned up snow one would have expected to find at the scene of a fight there were two sets of tracks leading to the place where stryker lay one set leading away no fuss no commotion just a quick if not particularly clean dispatch i sipped some more of ottos scotchit must have come from his own private supply for it was excellent stuffthen asked in my best lecturers fashion are there any questions predictably there were none they were all clearly far too busy asking themselves questions to have any time to put any to me i went on i think youd agree then that it now seems extremely improbable that any of the four previous deaths were the results of innocent coincidence i think that only the most gullible and the most naive would now be prepared to believe that those deaths were unconnected and not the work of the same agent so what we have is in effect a mass murderer a man who is either mad a pathological killer or a vicious and evil monster who finds it essential to murder with what can be only an apparent indiscrimination in order to achieve god knows what murky ends he may it is possible be all three of those at once whatever he is or whoever he is hes in this cabin now i wonder which one of you it is for the first time their eyes left me as they looked quickly and furtively at one another as if in the ludicrous hope that they might by this means discover the identity of the killer none of them examined one another as closely as i observed them all over the rim of my glass if one pair of eyes remained fixed on mine it could only be because its owner knew who the murderer was and didnt have to bother to look around but i knew even as i watched them that i had no real foundation for any such hope the murderer may have been no great shakes at physiology but he was far too clever to walk into what for an intelligent man with five deaths on his conscience must have been a very obvious trap indeed i was certain that there wasnt a pair of eyes before me that didnt flicker surreptitiously around the cabin i waited patiently until i had their combined attention again i have no idea who this murderous fiend may be i said but i think i can with certainty say who it isnt counting the absent miss haynes there are twentytwo of us in this cabin to nine of those i cannot see that any suspicion can possibly attach merciful god goin muttered merciful god this is monstrous dr marlowe unbelievable one of us here one of the people we know one of our friends has the blood of five people on his hands it cant be it just cant be except that you know that it must be i said goin made no reply to begin with i myself am in the clear not because i know i amwe could all claim thatbut because two hostile acts have been committed against my person one of which was intended to be lethal further i was bringing in mr smith here when stryker was killed and allen injured this last was the truth but not the whole truth but only the killer himself would know that and as he was already on to me his opinion was unimportant because he couldnt possibly voice it mr smith is in the clear because not only was he unconscious at the time he was a nearly fatal victim of the poisoners activities and its hardly likely that he would go around poisoning himself then that lets me out dr marlowe the dukes voice was a cracked falsetto hoarse with strain it wasnt me it couldnt agreed cecil it wasnt you apart from the fact that you were another poisoning victim i dont thinkwell im not being physically disparaging but id think it very unlikely that you could have hoisted that rock that was used to kill strvker mr gerran too is above suspicion not only was he poisoned but he was in the cabin here at the time of strykers death allen obviously could have had nothing to do with it and neither did mr goin here although youll have to take my word for that what does that mean dr marlowe goins voice was steady because when you first saw strykers body you turned as white as the proverbial sheet people can do lots of things with their bodies but they cant switch on and off the epidermal blood supply at will had you been prepared for the sight you saw you wouldnt have changed colour you did so you werent prepared our two marys here well have to leave out of the reckoning for it would have been a physical impossibility for either of them to have attacked stryker with that rock and miss haynes of course doesnt come into the reckoning at all which by my count leaves thirteen potential suspects in all i looked round the cabin and counted thats right thirteen lets hope its going to be a very unlucky number for one of you dr marlowe goin said i think you should consider withdrawing your resignation consider it withdrawn i was beginning to wonder what id do for food anvway i looked at my now empty glass then at otto seeing that im now back on the strength as it were would it be in order of course of course otto looking stricken sunk heavily onto a providentially sturdy stool and insofar as it was possible for over two hundredweights of lard to look like a punctured balloon he looked like a punctured balloon dear god this is ghastly one of us here is a murderer one of us here has killed five people he shivered violently although the temperature had by this time risen well above freezing point five people dead and the man who did it is here i lit a cigarette sipped a little more of ottos scotch and waited for some further contributions to the conversation outside the wind had strengthened until it was now a high and lonesome moaning sound that set the teeth on edge a moan that regularly climbed up the register into a weird and eldritch whistling as the wind gusted and fell away everyone appeared to be listening to it and listening intently a weirdly appropriate litany for the fear and the horror that was closing in on their minds a fit requiem for the dead stryker a whole minute dragged by and no one spoke so i took up the conversational burden again the implications will not have escaped you i said at least when you have had as much time to think about them as ive had they wont stryker is deadand so are four others who should want them dead why should they have diex is there a reason a purpose behind those slayings have we a psychopathic murderer amongst us if there is a purpose has it been achieved if it hasntor if the killer is a psychopathwhich one of us is going to be next who is going to die tonight who is going to go to his cubicle tonight knowing that anyone a crazed killer it may be is going to enter at any timeor even possibly ones own roommate may be waiting his turn with a knife or a suffocating pillow in fact i should think that the roommate possibility might be by far the more likelyfor who would do anything so crazily obvious as that except of course a crazy man so before us we have what you might call a sleepless vigil perhaps we can all keep it up for one night but for twentytwo nightscan we keep it up for twentytwo nights is there any one of us here who can be sure of still being alive when the morning rose returns from their expressions and the profound silence that greeted this last question it was apparent that no one was prepared to express any such certainty when i came to consider it myself instead of just asking them to do so i realised that the question of continued existence applied more particularly and more strongly to myself than to any of the others for if the killer were no wayward psycho who struck out as the fancy took him but was an icecold and calculating murderer with a definite objective in view then i was convinced that i was first on his calling list i didnt for a moment think that any attempt to dispose of me would be because that was any part of the kilicts preconceived plans but solely because i represented a threat to those plans and how are we going to comport ourselves from now on i said do we now polarize into two groups the nine acknowledged innocent giving a very wide berth and a leery eye to the thirteen potentially guilty even although this is going to be a mite hard on say twelve of the latter shall we be like oil and water and resolutely refuse to mix or about your shooting plans for tomorrow mr gerran and the count i believe are heading for the fells tomorrow a goodie and a potential baddicmr gerran is going to make sure that he has at least another goodie along with him to watch his back heissman is taking the workboat to reconnoitre possible locations along the sorhamna and perhaps a bit farther south i believe jungbeck and heyter here have volunteered to go along with him three of those you note whose innocence is not proved any white sheep going to go along with black wolf or wolves who may come back and sorrowfully explain that the poor sheep fell over the side and that in spite of their heroic efforts the poor fellow perished miserably and those splendid precipices at the south of the islandone little welltimed nudge a deft clicking together of the ankleswell sixteen hundred feet is a considerable drop especially when you bear in mind that its straight down all the way a perplexing and a difficult problem isnt it gentlemen this is preposterous otto said loudly absolutely preposterous isnt it i said a pity we cant ask stryker his opinion about that or the opinions of antonio and halliday and moxen and scott when your pale ghost looks down from the limbo mr gerran and watches you being lowered into a hole in the frozen snowdo you think it will still look preposterous otto shuddered and reached for the bottle what in gods name are we going to do ive no idea i said you heard what i just said to mr goin i have reverted to the position of employee i havent got my shirt on this film as i heard mr goin say to captain imrie that you had im afraid this is a decision to arrive at at a directorial levelwell the three directors that are still capable of making decisions would our employee mind telling us what he means goin tried to smile but it didnt come off his heart wasnt in it do you want to go ahead with shooting all your scenes up here or dont you its up to you if we all stay here in the cabin permanently at least half a dozen awake at any given time looking with all their eyes and listening with all their ears then the chances are high that well all still be in relatively mint condition by the time the twentytwo days are up on the other hand of course that means that you wont get any of your film shot and youll lose all your investment its a problem i wouldnt like to have to face thats excellent scotch you have there mr gerran i can see that you appreciate it otto would have liked a touch of asperity in his voice but all he managed to do was to sound worried dont be so mean i helped myself those are times that try mens souls i wasnt really listening to otto i was barely listening to myself once before since leaving wick on the occasion when the count had said something about a surfeit of horseradish certain words had had the effect of a touchpaper being applied to a train of gunpowder triggering off a succession of thoughts that came tumbling in one after the other almost faster than my mind could register them and now the same thing had happened again only this time the words had been triggered off by something id said myself i became aware that the count was speaking presumably to me i said sorry mind on other things you know i can see that the count was looking at me in a thoughtful fashion all very well to opt out of responsibility but what would you do he smiled if i were to coopt you again as a temporary unpaid director easy i said and the answer did come easilyas the result of the past thirty seconds thinking id watch my back and get on with the ruddy film so otto nodded and he the count and goin looked at one another in apparent satisfaction but now this moment what would you do when do we have supper supper otto blinked oh about eight say and its now five about to have three hours kip thats what im going to do and i wouldnt advise anyone to come near me either for an aspirin or with a knife in their hand for im feeling very nervous indeed smithy cleared his throat would i get clobbered if i asked for an aspirin now or something a bit more powerful to make a man sleep i feel as if my head has been on a butchers block i can have you asleep in ten minutes mind you youll probably feel a damn sight worse when you wake up impossible lead me to the knockout drops inside my cubicle i gripped the handle of the small square doubleplate glazed window and opened it with some difficulty can you do that with yours you do have things on your mind no mangers allocated for uninvited guests all the better bring a cot in here you can borrow one from judith hayness room of course he said theres a spare one there five minutes later wrapped to the eyes against the bitter cold the driving snow and that wind that was now howling not moaning across the frozen face of the island smithy and i stood in the lee of the cabin by my window which id wedged shut against a wad of paper there was no handle on the outside to pull it open again but i had with me a multitooled swiss army knife that could pry open just about anything we looked at the vaguely seen bulk of the cabin at the bright lightcoleman lamps have an intensely white flamestreaming from one of the windows in the central section and the pale glimmer of smaller lights from a few of the cubicles no night for an honest citizen to be taking a constitutional smithy said in my ear but how about bumping into one of the less honest ones too soon for him or them to be stirring abroad i said for the moment the flame of suspicion burns too high for anyone even to clear his throat at the wrong moment later perhaps but not now we went directly to the provisions store closed the door behind us and since the hut was windowless switched on both our torches we searched through all the bags crates cartons and packages of food and found nothing untoward what are we supposed to be looking for smithy asked ive no idea anything shall we say that shouldnt be here a gun a big black ribbed bottle marked deadly poison something like that i lifted a bottle of haig from a crate and stuck it in my parka pocket medicinal use only i explained of course smithy made a farewell sweep of his torch beam round the walls of the hut the beam steadied on three small highly varnished boxes on an upper shelf must be very high grade food in those smithy said caviar for otto maybe spare medical equipment for me mainly instruments no poisons guaranteed i made for the door come on not checking no point be a bit difficult to hide a submachine gun in one of those the boxes were about ten inches by eight ok to have a look all the same all right i was a bit impatient hurry it up though smithy opened the lids of the first two boxes glanced cursorily at the contents and closed them again he opened the third box and said broken into your reserves already i see i have not then somebody has he handed over the box and i saw the two vacant moulds in the blue felt somebody has indeed i said a hypodermic and a tube of needles smithy looked at me in silence took the box closed the lid and replaced it he said i dont think i like this very much twentytwo days could be a very long time i said now if we could only find the stuff thats going to go inside this syringe if you dont think somebody may have borrowed it for his own private use somebody on the hard stuff whos bent his own plunger one of the three apostles for instance right background after allpop world film world just kids no i dont think that i dont think so either i wish i did we went from there to the fuel hut two minutes was sufficient to discover that the fuel hut had nothing to offer us neither had the equipment hut although it afforded me two items i wanted a screwdriver from the toolbox eddie had used when he was connecting up the generator and a packet of screws smithy said what do you want those for for the screwing up of windows i said a door is not the only way you can enter the cubicle of a sleeping man you dont trust an awful lot of people do you i weep for my lost innocence there was no temptation to linger in the tractor shed not with stryker lying there his face ghastly in the reflected wash from the torches his glazed eyes staring unseeingly at the ceiling we rummaged through toolboxes examined metal panniers even went to the length of probing fuel tanks oil tanks and radiators we found nothing we made our way down to the jetty from the main cabin it was a distance of just over twenty yards and it took us five minutes to find it we did not dare use our torches and with that heavy and driving snow reducing visibility to virtually arms length we were blind people moving in a blind world we edged our way very gingerly out to the end of the jettythe snow had covered up the gaps in the crumbling limestone and heavily clad as we were the chances of surviving a tumble into the freezing waters of the sorhamna were not highlocated the workboat in the sheltered northwest angle of the jetty and climbed down into it by means of a vertical iron ladder that was so ancient and rusty that the outboard ends of some of the rungs were scarcely more than a quarter of an inch in diameter on a dark night the glow from a torch can be seen from a considerable distance even through the most heavily falling snow but now that we were below the level of the jetty wall we switched our torches on again though still careful to keep them hooded a quick search of the workboat revealed nothing we clambered into the fourteenfooter lying alongside and had the same lack of success from here we transferred ourselves to the mockup submarinean iron ladder had been welded both to its side and the conning tower the conning tower had a platform welded across its circumference at a distance of about four feet from the top a hatch in this led to a semicircular platform about eighteen inches below the flange to which the conning tower was secured from here a short ladder led to the deck of the submarine we went down and shone our torches around give me subs any time smithy said at least they keep the snow out that apart i dont think id care to settle down here the narrow and cramped interior was indeed a bleak and cheerless place the deck consisted of transverse spaced wooden planks held in position at either side by large butterfly nuts beneath the planks we could see firmly held in position rows of long narrow greypainted barsthe four tons of castiron that served as ballast four square ballast tanks were arranged along either side of the shellthose could be filled to give negative buoyancyand at one end of the shell stood a small diesel its exhaust passing through the deckhead as far as the top of the conning tower to which it was bolted this engine was coupled to a compressor unit for emptying the ballast tanks and that structurally was all that there was to it i had been told that the entire mockup had cost fifteen thousand pounds and could only conclude that otto had been engaged in the producers favourite pastime of cooking the books there were several other disparate items of equipment in a locker in what i took to be the after end of this central mockup were four small mushroom anchors with chains together with a small portable windlass immediately above these was a hatch in the deckhead which gave access to the upper deck the anchors could only be for mooring the model securely in any desired position opposite this locker securely lashed against a bulkhead was a lightweight plastic reconstruction of a periscope that appeared to be capable of operating in a sufficiently realistic fashion close by were three other plastic models a dummy threeinch gun presumably for mounting on the deck and two model machine guns which would be fitted i imagined somewhere in the conning tower in the foreword end of the craft were two more lockers one held a number of cork life jackets the other six cans of paint and some paint brushes the cans were marked instant grey and what does that mean smithy asked some sort of quickdrying paint i should imagine everything shipshape and bristol fashion smithy said i wouldnt have given otto the credit he shivered maybe it isnt snowing in here but id have you know that im very cold indeed this place reminds me of an iron tomb it isnt very cosy up and away a fruitless search you might say you might i didnt have many hopes anyway is that why you changed your mind about their getting on with the making of the film one minute indifference the next advising them to press on so that you could perhaps examine their quarters and their possessions when theyre out whatever put such a thought in your mind smithy there are a thousand snowdrifts where a person could hide anything thats a thought thats also in my mind we made the trip from the jetty to the main cabin with much greater ease than we had the other way for this time we had the faint and diffuse glow of light from the colemans to guide us we scrambled back inside our cubicle without too much difficulty brushed the snow from our boots and upper clothing and hung the latter up compared to the interior of the submarine shell the warmth inside the cubicle was positively genial i took screwdriver and screws and started to secure the window while smithy after some references to the low state of his health retrieved the bottle id taken from the provisions shed and took two small beakers from my medical box he watched me until i had finished well he said thats us safe for the night how about the others i dont think most of the others are in any danger because they dont offer any danger to the plans of our friend or friends most of the others i think ill screw up judith hayness window too judith haynes i have a feeling that she is in danger whether its grave danger or imminent danger i have no idea maybe im just fey i shouldnt wonder smithy said ambiguously he drank some scotch absently ive just been thinking myself but along rather different lines when do you think is it going to occur to our directorial board to call some law in or some outside help or at least to let the world know that the employees of olympus productions are dying off like flies and not from natural causes either thats the decision you would arrive at if i wasnt a criminal or in this case the criminal and had very powerful reasons for not wanting the law around yes i would im not a criminal but ive very powerful reasons for not wanting the law around either the moment the law officially steps into the picture every criminal thought intent and potential action will go into deep freeze and well be left with five unresolved deaths on our hands and thatll be the end of it for theres nothing surer than that we havent got a thing to hang on anyone yet theres only one way and thats by giving out enough rope for a hanging job what if you give out too much rope and our friend instead of hanging himself hangs one of us instead what if theres murder in that case wed have to call in the law im here to do a job in the best way i can but that doesnt mean by any means i can i cant use the innocent as sacrificial pawns well thats some relief but if the thought does occur to them then obviously well have to try to contact tunheimtheres a meteorological office radio there that should just about reach the moon or well have to offer to try to contact tunheim its less than ten miles away but in weather conditions like those it might as well be on the far side of siberia if the weather cases it might be possible the winds veering round to the west now and if it stayed in that quarter a trip by boat up the coast might be possiblepretty unpleasant but just possible if it goes much north of west it wouldntthose are only open workboats and would be swamped in any kind of sea by landif the snow stoppedwell i just dont know in the first place the terrain is so broken and mountainous that you couldnt possibly use the little snocatyoud have to make it on foot youd have to go well inland to the west to avoid the misery fell complex for that ends in cliffs on the east coast there are hundreds of little lakes lying in that region and ive no idea how heavily they may be frozen over maybe some of them not very much maybe just enough to support a covering of snow and not a manand i believe some of those lakes are over a hundred feet deep you might be ankledeep kneedeep thighdeep waistdeep in snow and apart from being boggeddown or drowned were not equipped for winter travel we havent even got a tent for an overnight stopthere isnt a hope of you making it in one dayand if the snow started falling again and kept on falling i bet olympus productions havent even as much as a hand compass to prevent you from walking in circles until you drop dead from cold or hunger or just plain old exhaustion you you you smithy said youre always talking about me how about you going instead he grinned of course i could always set off for there search around till i found some convenient cave or shelter hole up there for the night and return the next day announcing mission impossible well see how the cards fall i finished my drink and picked up screwdriver and screws lets go and see how miss haynes is miss haynes seemed to be in reasonable health no fever normal pulse breathing deeply and evenly how she would feel when she woke was another matter altogether i screwed up her window until nobody could have entered her room from the outside without smashing their way in and breaking through two sheets of plate glass would cause enough racket to wake up half the occupants of the cabin then we went into the living area of the cabin it was surprisingly empty at least ten people i would have expected to be there were absent but a quick mental count of the missing heads convinced me that there was no likely cause for alarm in this otto the count heissman and goin conspicuously absent were probably in secret conclave in one of their cubicles discussing weighty matters which they didnt wish their underlings to hear lonnie had almost certainly betaken himself again in his quest for fresh air and i hoped that he hadnt managed to lose himself between the cabin and the provisions hut allen almost certainly had gone to lie down again and i presumed that mary darling who appeared to have overcome a great number of her earlier inhibitions had returned to her dutiful handholding i couldnt imagine where the three apostles had got to nor was i particularly worried i was sure that there was nothing to fear from them other than permanent damage to the eardrums i crossed to where conrad was presiding over a threeburner oil cooker mounted on top of a stove he had two large pans and a large pot all bubbling away at once stew beans and coffee and he seemed to be enjoying his role of chef not least i guessed because he had mary stuart as his assistant in another man i would have looked for a less than altruistic motive in this cheerful willingness the hailfellowwellmet leading man playing the democrat to an admiring gallery but i knew enough of conrad now to realise that this formed no part of his nature at all he was just a naturally helpful character who never thought to place himself above his fellow actors conrad i thought must be a very rara avis indeed in the cinema world whats all this then i said you qualified for this sort of thing i thought otto had appointed the three apostles as alternate chefs the three apostles had it in mind to start improving their musical technique in this very spot conrad said i did a selfdefence trade with them theyre practising across in the equipment hutyou know where the generator is i tried to imagine the total degree of cacophony produced by their tatonal voices their amplified instruments and the diesel engine in a confined space of eight by eight but my imagination wasnt up to it i said you deserve a medal you too mary dear me she smiled why remember what i said about the goodies pairing off with the baddies delighted to see you keeping a close eye on our suspect here havent seen his hand hovering suspiciously long over one of the pots have you she stopped smiling i dont think thats funny dr marlowe i dont think it is either a clumsy attempt to lighten the atmosphere i looked at conrad can i have a word with the chef conrad looked at me briefly speculatively nodded and turned away mary stuart said thats nice for me i mean why cant you have a word with him here im going to tell him some funny stories you dont seem to care much for my humour i walked away a few paces with conrad and said had a chance of a word with lonnie yet no i mean i havent had an opportunity yet is it that urgent im beginning to think it may be look i havent seen him there but im certain as can be that lonnie is across in the provisions hut where otto keeps all those elixirs of life you wouldnt expect to find lonnie in the fuel shed diesel and petrol arent his tipples i wonder if you could go across there seeking liquid solace from this harsh and weary world from bear island from olympus productions from whatever you like and engage him in crafty conversation touch upon the theme of how youre missing your family anything just get him to tell you about his he hesitated i like lonnie i dont like this job im past caring now about peoples feelings im just concerned with peoples livesthat they should keep on living i mean right he nodded and looked at me soberly taking a bit of a chance arent you enlisting the aid of one of your suspects i mean youre not on my list of suspects i said you never were he looked at me for some moments then said tell that to mary dear will you he turned and made for the outer door i returned to the oil cooker mary stuart looked at me with her usual grave and remote lack of expression i said conrad tells me to tell you that ive just told himyoure following methat hes not on my list of suspects and never was thats nice she gave me a little smile but there was a touch of winter in it mary i said you are displeased with me well well what are you a friend of mine of course of course of course she mimicked my tone very creditably dr marlowe is a friend of all mankind dr marlowe doesnt hold all mankind in his arms all night long another smile this time there was a touch of spring in it she said and charles conrad i like him i dont know what he thinks about me and i like him and i know he likes me and so were all friends together i thought better of saying of course again and just nodded so why dont we all share secrets together women are the most curious creatures i said in every sense of the word curious please dont be clever with me do you always share secrets she frowned a little as if perplexed and i went on lets play kiddies games shall we you tell me a secret and ill tell you one what on earth do you mean this secret assignation you had yesterday morning in the snow and on the upper deck when you were being so very affectionate with heissman id expected some very positive reaction from this and was correspondingly disappointed when there was none she looked at me silently thoughtful then said so you were spying on us i just happened to chance by i didnt see you chancing by she bit her lip but not in any particularly discernible anguish i wish you hadnt seen that why it had been briefly in my mind to be heavily ironic but i could hear a little warning bell tinkling in the distance because i dont want people to know thats obvious i said patiently why because im not very proud of it i have to make a living dr marlowe i came to this country only two years ago and i havent got any qualifications for anything i havent even got any qualifications for what im doing now im a hopeless actress i know i am ive just got no talent at all the last two films i was inwell they were just awful are you surprised that people give me the cold shoulder why theyre wondering out loud why im making my third film with olympus productions well you can guess now johann heissman is the why she smiled just a very small smile you are surprised dr marlowe shocked perhaps no the little smile went away some of the life went from her face and when she spoke her voice was dull it is so easy then to believe this of me well no the point is that i just dont believe you at all she looked at me her face a little sad and quite uncomprehending you dont believeyou dont believe this of me not of mary stuart not of mary dear some of the life came back and she said almost wonderingly thats the nicest thing anybodys ever said to me she looked down at her hands as if hesitating then said without looking up johann heissman is my uncle my mothers brother your uncle id been mentally shuffling all sorts of possibilities through my mind but this one hadnt even begun to occur to me uncle johann again the little almost secret smile this time with what could have been an imagined trace of mischief i wondered what her smile would be like if she ever smiled in pure delight or happiness you dont have to believe me just go and ask him yourself but privately if you please dinner that night wasnt much of a social success the atmosphere of cheerful good fellowship which is required to make such communal gettogethers go with a swing was noticeably lacking this may have been due partially to the fact that most people either ate by their solitary selves or both sitting and standing in scattered small groups around the cabin their attention almost exclusively devoted to the unappetising goulash in the bowls held in their hands but it was mainly due to the fact that everybody was clearly and painfully aware that we were experiencing the secular equivalent of our own last supper for the interest in the food was not allabsorbing frequently but very very briefly a pair of eyes would break off their rapt communion with the stew and beans glance swiftly around the cabin then return in an oddly guilty defensiveness to the food as if the person had hoped in that one lightning ocular sortie to discover some unmistakable telltale signs that would infallibly identify the traitor in our midst there were needless to say no such overt indications of selfbetrayal on display and the problem of identification was deepened and confused by the fact that most of those present exhibited a measure of abnormality in their behaviour that would ordinarily have given rise to more than a modicum of suspicion anyway for it is an odd characteristic of human nature that even the most innocent person who knows himself or herself to be under suspicion tends to overreact with an unnatural degree of casual indifference and insouciant unconcern that serves only to heighten the original suspicion otto clearly was not one of those thus afflicted whether it was because he knew himself to be one of those who was regarded as being completely in the clear or because as chairman of the company and producer of the film he regarded himself as being above and apart from the problems that afflicted the common run of mankind otto was remarkably composed and astonishingly even forceful and assertive unlikely though it had appeared up to that moment otto normally so dithering and indecisive might well be one of those who only showed of their best in the moments of crisis there was certainly nothing dithering or indecisive about him when he rose to speak at the end of the meal we are all aware said otto briskly of the dreadful happenings of the past day or two and i think that we have no alternative to accepting dr marlowes interpretation of the events further i fear we have to accept as very real the doctors warnings as to what may happen in the near future those are inescapable facts and entirely conceivable possibilities so please dont for a moment imagine that im trying to minimise the seriousness of the situation on the contrary it would be impossible to exaggerate it impossible to exaggerate an impossible situation here we are marooned in the high arctic and beyond any reach of help with the knowledge that there are those of us who have come to a violent end and that this violence may not yet be over he looked unhurriedly around the company and i did the same i could see that there were quite a number who were as impressed by ottos calm assessment of the situation as i was he went on it is precisely because the state of affairs in which we find ourselves is so unbelievable and so abnormal that i suggest we comport ourselves in the most rational and normal fashion possible a descent into hysteria will achieve no reversal of the awful things that have just occurred and can only harm all of us accordingly my colleagues and i have decided that subject of course to taking every possible precaution we should proceed with the business in handthe reason why we came to this island at allin as normal a fashion as possible i am sure you will all agree with me that it is much better to have our time and attention taken upi will not say gainfully employedby working steadily at something purposive and constructive rather than sit idly by and have those awful things prey upon our minds i do not suggest that we can pretend that those things never happened i do suggest that it will benefit all of us if we act as if they hadnt weather permitting we will have three crews in the field tomorrow otto wasnt consulting he was telling id have done the same in his place the main group under mr divine here will go north up lerners waya road built through to the next bay about the turn of the century although i dont suppose there are many traces left of it now the count allen and cecil here will of course accompany him i intend to go along myself and ill want you there too charles this to conrad youll require me along mr gerran this from mary darling her hand upraised like a little girl in class well itll be nearly all background he broke off glanced at allens battered face then looked again at mary with what i took to be a roguish smile if you wish to certainly mr hendriks with luke mark and john here will try to capture for us all the sounds of the islandthe wind on the fells the birds on the cliffs the waves breaking against the shore mr heissman here is taking a hand camera out in the boat to seek out some suitable seaward locationsmr jungbeck and mr heyter who have nothing on tomorrow have kindly volunteered to accompany him these then are our decisions for tomorrows programme but the most important decision of all which i have left to the last is in no way connected with our work we have decided that it is essential that we seek help with all possible speed by help i mean the law police or some such recognised authority it is not only our duty it may well be essential for our own selfpreservation to have a thorough and expert investigation made as quickly as is humanly possible to call for help we need a radio and the nearest is at the norwegian meteorological station in tunheim i carefully refrained from looking at smithy and was confident that he would reciprocate mr smith your presence here may prove to be a blessingyou are the only professional seaman amongst us what would be the chances of reaching tunheim by boat smithy was silent for a few seconds to lend weight to his observations then said in the present conditions so poor that i wouldnt even consider trying it not even in those desperate circumstances weve had very heavy weather recently mr gerran and the seas wont subside for quite some time the drawback with those workboats is that if one does encounter rough seas ahead you cant do what you would normally do that is turn and run before the sea those boats are completely open at the back and would almost certainly be poopedthat is theyd fill up with water and sink so youd have to be pretty certain of your weather before you set out i see too dangerous for the moment when the sea moderates mr smith depends upon the wind its backing to the west right now and if it were to stay in that quarterwell its feasible if it moves round to the northwest or beyond no not on smithy smiled i wouldnt say that an overland trip would be all that easier but at least you wouldnt be swamped in heavy seas ah so you think that it is at least possible to reach tunheim on foot well i dont know im no expert on arctic travel im sure mr heissman hereim told hes been giving a lecture about this alreadyis much more qualified to speak about it than i am no no heissman waved a deprecating hand lets hear what you think mr smith so smithy let them hear what he thought which was more or less a verbatim repetition of what id said to him in our cubicle earlier when hed finished heissman who probably knew as much about winter travel in arctic regions as i did about the back side of the moon nodded sagely and said succinctly and admirably put i agree entirely with mr smith there was a thoughtful silence eventually broken by smithy who said diffidently im the supernumerary here if the weather eases i dont mind trying and now i have to disagree with you heissman said promptly suicidal just suicidal my boy not to he thought of for an instant otto said firmly for safetyfor mutual safetynothing short of an expedition would do i wouldnt want an expedition smithy said mildly i dont see that the blind leading the blind would help much mr gerran it was jon heyter speaking perhaps i could be of help here you otto looked at him in momentary perplexity then his face cleared of course id forgotten about that he said in explanation jon here was my stuntman in the high sierra a climbing picture he doubled for the actors who were too terrified or too valuable for the climbing sequences a really firstclass alpinist i assure you how about that then eh mr smith i was about to wonder how smithv would field that one when he answered immediatelv thats about the size of the expedition id have in mind id be very glad to have mr heyter alonghed probably have to carry me most of the way there well thats settled then otto said very grateful to you both but only of course if the weather improves well i think that covers everything he smiled at me as coopted board member wouldnt you agree well yes i said except with your assumption that everyone will be here in the morning to play the parts you have assigned to them ah otto said precisely i said you werent seriously contemplating that we should all retire for the night were you for certain people with certain purposes in mind there is no time like the still small hours when i say people im not going out of the bounds of this cabin when i say purposes i refer to homicidal ones my colleagues and i have in fact discussed this otto said you propose we set watches it might help some of us to live a little longer i said i moved two or i three steps until i was in the centre of the cabin trom here i can see into all eve corridors it would be impossible for any person to leave or enter any of the cubicles without being observed by a person standing here going to call for a rather special type of person isnt it conrad said someone with his neck mounted on swivels not if we have two on watch at the same time i said and as the times long gone when anybodys hurt feelings are a matter of any importance two people on watch who are not only watching the corridors but watching each other a suspect shall we say and a nonsuspect among the nonsuspects i think we might gallantly exclude the two marys and i think that allen too could do with a full nights sleep that would leave mr gerran mr goin mr smith cecil and myself five of us which would work out rather well for twohour watches between say ten pm and eight am an excellent suggestion otto said well then five volunteers there were thirteen potential volunteers and all thirteen immediately offered their services eventually it was agreed that goin and hendriks should share the ten to midnight watch smith and conrad the midnight to two myself and luke the two to four otto and jungbeck the four to six and cecil and eddie the six to eight some of the others notably the count and heissman protested not too strongly that they were being discriminated against the reminder that there would be still another twentyone nights after this one was sufficient to ensure that the protest was no more than a token one the decision not to linger around in small talk and socialising was reached with a far from surprising unanimity there was really only one thing to talk about and nobody wished to talk about it in case he had picked the wrong person to talk to in ones and twos and within a very few minutes almost everybody had moved off to their cubicles apart from smithy and myself only conrad remained and i knew that he wished to talk to me smithy glanced briefly at me then left for our cubicle how did you know conrad said about lonnie and his family i didnt i guessed hes talked to you a little not much he had a family had had wife and two daughters two grownup girls a car crash i dont know if they hit another car i dont know who was driving lonnie just clammed up as if he had already said too much he wouldnt even say whether he had been in the car himself whether anyone else had been present not even when it had taken place and that was all that conrad had learnt we talked in a desultory fashion for some little time and when goin and hendriks appeared to begin the first watch i left for my cubicle smithy was not in his camp bed fully clothed he was just removing the last of the screws id used to secure the window frame hed the flame of the little oil lamp turned so low that the cubicle was in semidarkness leaving i said somebody out there smithy reached for his anorak and i did the same i thought maybe we shouldnt use the front door who is it no idea he looked in here but his face was just a white blur he doesnt know i saw him im sure of that for he went from here and shone a torch through judith hayness window and he wouldnt have done that if he thought anyone was watching smithy was already clambering through the window he put his torch out but not before i saw where he was heading down to the jetty im sure i followed smithy and jammed the window shut as i had done before the weather was very much as it had been earlier still that driving snow the deepening cold the darkness and that bitter wind which was still boxing the compass and had moved around to the southwest we moved across to judith hayness window hooded our torches to give thin pencil beams of light picked up tracks in the snow that led off in the direction of the jetty and were about to follow them when it occurred to me that it might be instructive to see where they came from but we couldnt find where they came from whoever the unknown was hed walked keeping very close to the walls at least twice round the cabin obviously dragging his feet as he had gone so that it was quite impossible to discover which cubicle window hed used as an exit route from the cabin that he should have so effectively covered his tracks was annoying that he should have thought to do it at all was disconcerting for it plainly demonstrated at least the awareness that such latenight sorties might be expected we made our way quickly but cautiously down to the jetty giving the unknowns tracks a prudently wide berth at the head of the jetty i risked a quick hash with the narrowed beam of my torch a single line of tracks led outwards well now smithy said softly our lads down at the boats or the sub if we go to investigate we might bump into him if we go down to the end of the jetty for a quick looksee and dont bump into him hes still bound to see our tracks on his return trip we want to make our presence known no no law against a man taking a stroll when he feels like it even though it is in a blizzard and if we declare ourselves you can be damn sure hell never put another foot wrong as long as we remain on bear island we withdrew to the shelter of some rocks only a few yards distant along the beach an almost wholly superfluous precaution in that close to zero visibility what do you think hes up to smithy said specifically no idea generally anything between the felonious and the villainous well check down there when hes gone whatever purpose hed had in mind it hadnt taken him long to achieve it for he was gone within two minutes the snow was so thick the darkness so nearly absolute that he might well have passed by both unseen and unheard had it not been for the erratic movement of the small torch he held in his hand we waited for some seconds then straightened was he carrying anything i said same thought here smithy said he could have been but i couldnt swear to it we followed the double tracks in the snow down to the end of the jetty where they ended at the head of the iron ladder leading down to the submarine mockup no question but this was where hed gone for apart from the fact that there was nowhere else where he could have been his footprints were all over the hull and when wed climbed into it the platform in the conning tower we dropped down into the hull of the submarine nothing was changed nothing appeared to be missing from our earlier visit smithy said ive taken a sudden dislike to this place last time we were here i called it an iron tomb i wouldnt want it to be our tomb you feel it might our friend seemingly didnt take anything away but he must have had some purpose in coming here so i assume he brought something on the track record to date that purpose wouldnt be anything id like and neither would be that something he brought how would it be if hed planted something to blow the damn thing up why would he want to do a crazy thing like that i didnt feel as disbelieving as i sounded why has he done any of the crazy things hes done right now i dont want a reason i just want to know whether as of now and here and now hes just done another crazy thing what i mean is im nervous he wasnt the only one i said assuming youre right he couldnt blow this thing up with a little itsybitsy piece of plastic explosive it would have to be something big enough to make a big bang so a delayedaction fuse to give him time to be asleep in his innocent bed when the explosion goes off im more nervous than ever i wonder how long he figured it would take him to get back to his bed he could do it in a minute gods sake why are we standing here talking smithy flashed his torch around where the hell would a man put a device like that against a bulkhead id say or on the bottom we examined the deck first but all the bars of castiron ballast and their securing wooden battens appeared to be undisturbed and firmly in place there was just no room there for even the smallest explosive device we turned to the rest of the hull looked behind the mushroom anchors among the chains under the compressor unit and the windlass and behind the plastic models of periscope and guns we found nothing we even peered at the cleaning plates on the ballast tanks to see if any of those could have been unscrewed but there were no marks on them and there was certainly no place where such a device could have been attached to the bulkheads themselves without being instantly detectable smithy looked at me it was difficult to say whether he was perplexed or like me increasingly and uncomfortably conscious of the fact that if such a time device did exist time might be swiftly running out he looked towards the fore end of the hull and said or he might just have dropped it in one of those lockers easiest and quickest place to hide anything after all most unlikely i said but i reached there before he did i ran the beam of the torch over the paint locker and then the light steadied on a wooden batten close by the floor of the locker i kept the light where it was and said to smithy you see it too a giveaway piece of fresh and unmelted snow from a boot he reached for the lid of the locker well times awasting better open the damn thing better not id caught his arm how do you know its not boobytrapped theres that hed snatched back his band like a man seeing a tigers jaws closing on it it would save the cost of a time fuse how do we open it then gradually its unlikely that he had the time to rig up anything so elaborate as an electrical trigger but if he did therell be contacts in the lid more likely if anything a simple pull cord in either event nothing can operate in the first two inches of lift for he must have left at least that space to withdraw his hand so we gingerly opened the lid those two inches examined the rim and what we could see of the interior of the locker and found nothing i pushed the locker lid right back there was no sign of any explosive nothing had been put inside but something had been removedtwo cans of the quickdry paint and two brushes smithy looked at me and shook his head neither of us said anything the reasons for removing a couple of paint cans were so wholly inconceivable that clearly there was nothing that could be gainfully said we closed the locker climbed up the conning tower and regained the pier i said its very unlikely that he would have taken them back to the cabin with him after all theyre large cans and not easy things to hide in a tiny cubicle especially if any of your friends should chance to come calling he doesnt have to hide them there as i said earlier there are a thousand snowdrifts where you can hide practically anything but if hed hidden anything he hadnt hidden them in any of the snowdrifts between the jetty and the cabin for his tracks led straight back to the latter without any deviation to either side we followed the footprints right back close up to the cabin walls and there they were lost in the smudged line of tracks that led right round the cabins perimeter smithy hooded his torch and examined the tracks for some seconds he said i think that tracks wider and deeper than it was before i think that someoneand it doesnt have to be the same personhas been making another grand tour of the cabin i think youre right i said i led the way back to the window of our own cubicle and was about to pull it open when some instinctor perhaps it was because i was now subconsciously looking for the suspicious or untoward in every possible situationmade me shine my torch on the window frame i turned to smithy notice something i notice something the wad of paper we left jammed between the window and framewell its no longer jammed between window and frame he shone his torch on the ground stopped and picked something up because it was lying down there a caller or callers so it would seem we clambered inside and while smithy started screwing the window back in place i turned up the oil lamp and started to look around partly for some other evidence to show that an intruder had been there but mainly to try to discover the reason for his being there inevitably my first check was on the medical equipment and my first check was my last and very brief it was too well well i said two birds with one stone were a brilliant pair we are the lad you saw with his face pressed against that window probably had it stuck against it for all of five minutes until hed made sure hed been seen then to make certain you were really interested he went and shone his torch into judith hayness window no two actions he must have calculated could have been designed to lure us out into the open more quickly he was right at that wasnt he he looked at my opened medical kit and said carefully im to take it then that theres something missing there you may so take it i showed him the velvetlined gap in the tray where the something missing had been a lethal dose of morphine four bells and alls well smithy said shaking my shoulder neither the call nor the shake was necessary i was by this time even in my sleep in so keyedup a state that his turning of the door handle had been enough to have me instantly awake time to report to the bridge weve made some fresh coffee i followed him into the main cabin said a greeting to conrad who was bent over pot and cups at the oil stove and went to the front door to my surprise the wind now fully round to the west had dropped away to something of not more than the order for a force the snow had thinned to the extent that it promised to cease altogether pretty soon and i even imagined i could see a few faint stars in a clear patch of sky to the south beyond the entrance of the sorhamna but the cold if anything was even more intense than it had been earlier in the night i closed the door quickly turned to smithy and spoke softly an unlooked for change in the weather if this improvement maintains itself i can see otto calling on youand if he doesnt someones going to remind him by suggesting itto carry out your offer of last night and strike out for tunheim and the law im beginning to regret i ever made the offerbut i didnt seem to have much option at the time and you wont have any option if come the dawn the sun is shining no way to pull out now watch heyter though watch him very very closely smithy was silent for a considering moment you think he bears watching hes one of thirteen potential murderers and for me those odds are small enough to make them all deserving of as close an eye as the crown jewels and if in that thirteen you were to cut out conrad lonnie and the three apostlesand mentally ive already cut them outyouve brought the odds down to one in eight perhaps two in eightperhaps even a very uncomfortable three in eight youre very encouraging smithy said what makes you so sure that those five he broke off as luke yawning and stretching vastly entered the main cabin luke was a thin awkward gangling creature a towheaded youth urgently in need of the restraining influences of either a barber or a ribbon i said do you see him as a gun for hire i could have him up for committing musical atrocities with a guitar i should think otherwiseyes i agree very little threat to life and limb and yes again that would go for the other four too he watched as conrad went into one of the passages carrying a cup of coffee id put my money on our leading man any day where on earth is he off to bearing sustenance for his ladylove i should imagine miss stuart spent much of our watch with us i was on the point of observing that the alleged ladylove had a remarkable predilection for moving around in the darker watches of the night but thought better of it that mary stuart was involved in matters dark and deviousheissmans being her uncle didnt even begin to account for the earlier oddity of her behaviouri didnt for a moment doubt that she was engaged in any murderous activities i couldnt for a moment believe smithy went on its important that i reach turtheim it hardly matters whether you do or not with heyter along only the weather and the terrain can decide that if you have to turn back thats fine with me id rather have you here if you get to tunheim just stay there stay there how can i stay there im going there for help am i not and heyter will be shouting to come back im sure theyll understand if you explain that youre tired and need a rest if heyter makes a noise have him locked upill give you a letter to the met officer in charge youll do that will you and what if the met officer pointblank refuses i think youll find some people up there wholl be only too happy to oblige you he looked at me without a great deal of enthusiasm friends of yours of course theres a visiting meteorological team from britain staying there briefly five of them only theyre not meteorologists naturally not the lack of enthusiasm deteriorated into a coldness that was just short of outright hostility you play your cards mighty close to the chest dont you dr marlowe dont get angry with me im not asking you that im telling you policyi obey orders even if you dont a secret shared is never a secret halvedeven a peck at my cards and who knows whos kibitzing ill give you that letter early this morning ok smithy was obviously restraining himself with no small difficulty he went on morosely i suppose i shouldnt be too surprised to find even the morning rose up there let me put it this way i said i wouldnt put it beyond the bounds of possibility smithy nodded turned and walked to the oil stove where conrad now returned was pouring coffee we sat for ten minutes drinking and talking about nothing much then smithy and conrad left the next hour or so passed without event except that after five minutes luke fell sound asleep and stayed that way i didnt bother to wake him up it wasnt necessary i was in an almost hypernatural state of alertness unlike luke i had things on my mind a door in a passage opened and lonnie appeared as lonnie by his own account wasnt given to sleeping much and as he wasnt on my list of suspects anyway this was hardly call for alarm he came into the cabin and sat heavily in a chair by my side he looked old and tired and grey and the usual note of badinage was lacking in his tone once again the kindly healer he said and once again looking after his little flock i have come my boy to share your midnight vigil its twentyfive to four i said a figure of speech he sighed i have not slept well in fact i have not slept at all you see before you doctor a troubled old man im sorry to hear that lonnie no tears for lonnie for me as for most of pitiful mankind ray troubles are my own making to be an old man is bad enough to be alonely old man and i have been lonely for many years makes a man sad for much of the time but to be a lonely old man who can no longer live with his conscienceah that is not to be borne he sighed again i am feeling uncommonly sorry for myself tonight whats your conscience doing now its keeping me awake thats what its doing ah my boy my boy to cease upon the midnight with no pain what more could a man want when its evening and time to be gone this wine shop on the far shore not even that he shook his head mournfully no welcoming arms in paradise for the lost lonnies of this world havent the right entry qualifications my boy he smiled and his eyes were sad ill pin my hopes on a small fourale bar in purgatory he lapsed into silence his eyes closed and i thought he was drifting off into sleep but he presently stirred cleared his throat and said apparently apropos of nothing its always too late always whats always too late lonnie compassion is or understanding or forgiveness i fear that lonnie gilbert has been less than he should have been but its always too late too late to say i like you or i love you or how nice you are or i forgive you if only if only if only it is difficult to make your peace with someone if youre looking at that person and hes lying there dead my my my as if with an immense effort he pushed himself to his feel but theres still a little shred of something that can be saved lonnie gilbert is now about to go and do something that he should have done many many years ago but first i must arm myself some life in the ancient bones some clarity in the faded mind in short prepare myself for what im ashamed to say i still regard as the ordeal that lies ahead in brief my dear fellow wheres the scotch im afraid otto has taken it with him a kind fellow otto none kinder but be has his parsimonious side to him but no matter the main source of supply is less than a sundays march away he made for the outer door but i stopped him one of those times lonnie youre going to go out there sit down there go to sleep and not come back again because youll be frozen to death besides theres no need theres some in my cubicle same source of supply i assure you ill fetch it just keep your eye open in my absence will you it didnt matter very much whether he kept his eyes open or dot for i was back inside twenty seconds smithy clearly was a heavier sleeper than i was for he didnt stir during my brief visit lonnie helped himself copiously drained his glass in a few gulps gazed at the bottle longingly then set it firmly aside duty completed i shall return and enjoy this at my leisure meantime i am sufficiently fortified where are you going it was difficult to imagine what pressing task he had on hand at that time of the night i am in great debt to miss haynes it is my wish to judith haynes i know i stared at him it was my understanding that you could with but difficulty look at her in great debt he said firmly it is my wish to discharge it to clear the books you might say you understand no what i do understand is that its only three fortyfive if this business has been outstanding as you said for so many years surely it can wait just another few hours besides miss haynes has been sick and shocked and shes under sedatives as her doctor and whether she likes it or not i am her doctor i cant permit it and as a doctor my dear fellow you should understand the necessity for immediacy i have worked myself up to this screwed myself as it were to the sticking point another few hours as you say and it may be too late the lonnie gilbert you see before you will almost certainly have reverted to the bad old cowardly old selfish old claysouled lonnie of yore the lonnie we all know so well and then it will always be too late he paused and switched his argument sedatives you say how long do the effects of those last varies from person to person four hours six hours maybe as much as eight well there you are then poor girls probably been lying awake for hours just longing for some company although not in all likelihood that of lonnie gilbert or has it escaped your attention that close on twelve hours have elapsed since you administered that sedative it had but what had not escaped my attention was that lonnies relationship visavis judith haynes had been intriguing me considerably for some time it might i thought be very helpful and with regards to a deeper penetration of the fog of mystery surrounding us more than a little constructive if i could learn something of the burden of what lonnie had in mind to say to judith haynes i said let me go and see her if shes awake and i think shes fit to talk then ok he nodded i went to judith hayness room and entered without knocking the oil lamp was turned up and she was awake stretched out under the covers with only her face showing she looked ghastly which was the way i had expected her to look with the titian hair emphasising the drawn pallor of her face the usually striking green eyes were glazed and lacklustre and her cheeks were smudged and streaked with tears she looked at me indifferently as i pulled up a stool then looked as indifferently away i hope you slept well miss haynes i said how are you feeling do you usually come calling on patients in the middle of the night her voice was as dull as her eyes i dont make a practice of it but were taking turns keeping watch tonight and this happens to be my turn is there anything that you want no have you found out who killed my husband she was so preternaturally calm under such seemingly iron control that i suspected it to be the prelude to another uncontrollable hysterical outburst no am i to take it from that miss haynes that you no longer think that young allen did i dont think so ive been lying here for hours just thinking and i dont think so from the lifeless voice and the lifeless face i was pretty sure she was still under the influence of the sedative you will get him wont you the man who killed michael michael wasnt as bad as people thought dr marlowe no he really wasnt for the first time a trace of expression just the weary suggestion of a smile i dont say he was a kind man or a good one or a gentle one for he wasnt but he was the man for me i know i said as if i understood which i only partially did i hope we get the man responsible i think we will do you have any ideas that could help my ideas are not worth much doctor my mind doesnt seem to be very clear do you think you could talk for a bit miss haynes it wouldnt be too tiring i am talking not to me to lonnie gilbert he seems terribly anxious to speak to you speak to me tired surprise but not outright rejection of the idea why should lonnie gilbert wish to speak to me i dont know lonnie doesnt believe in confiding in doctors all i gather is that he feels that hes done you some great wrong and he wants to say sorry i think lonnie say sorry to me astonishment had driven the flat hopelessness from her voice apologise to ine no not to me she was silent for a bit then she said yes id very much like to see him now i concealed my own astonishment as best i could went back to the main cabin told an equally astonished lonnie that judith haynes was more than prepared to meet him and watched him as he went along the passage entered her room and closed the door behind him i glanced at luke he appeared if anything to be more soundly asleep than ever absurdly young to be in this situation a pleased smile on his face he was probably dreaming of golden discs i walked quietly along the passage to judith hayness room there was nothing in the hippocratic oath against doctors listening at dosed doors it was clear that i was going to have to listen very closely indeed for although the door was only made of bonded ply the voices in the room were being kept low and i could hear little more than a confused murmur i dropped to my knees and applied my car to the keyhole the audibility factor improved quite remarkably you judith haynes said there was a catch in her voice i wouldnt have believed her capable of any of the more kindly emotions you to apologise to me of all people you me my dear me all those years all those vears his voice fell away and i couldnt catch his next few words then he said despicable despicable for any man to go through life nurturing the animosity nay my dear the hatred he broke off and there was silence for some moments he went on no forgiveness no forgiveness i know he cant i know he couldnt have been so bad or even really bad at all you loved him and no one can love a person who is bad all through but even if his sins had been black as the midnight shades lonnie the interruption was sharp even forceful i know i wasnt married to any angel but i wasnt married to any devil either i know that my dear i know that i was merely saying will you listen lonnie michael wasnt in that car that night michael was never near that car i strained for the answer but none came judith haynes went on neither was i lonnie there was a prolonged silence then lonnie said in a voice so low that it was a barely heard whisper thats not what i was told im sure it wasnt lonnie my car yes but i wasnt driving it michael wasnt driving it butyou wont deny that my daughters werewell incapable that night and that you were too and that you made them that way im not denying anything we all had too much to drink that night thats why ive never drunk since lonnie i dont know who was responsible all i know is that michael and i never left the house good god do you think i have to tell you thisnow that michael is dead no no you dont thenthen who was driving your car two other people two men two men and youve been protecting them all those years protecting no i wouldnt use the word protecting except inadvertently no i didnt put that well i meanwell any protection given was just incidental to something else we really wanted our own selfish ends i suppose you could call it everybody knows well enough that michael and iwell we werent criminals but we always had an eye on the main chance two men it was almost as if lonnie hadnt been listening to a word shed said two men you must know them another silence then she said quietly of course once more an infuriating silence i even stopped breathing in case i were to miss the next few words but i wasnt given the chance either to miss them or to hear them for a harsh and hostile voice behind me said what in the devil do you think you are doing here sir i refrained from doing what i felt like doing which was to let loose with a few choice and uninhibited phrases turned and looked up to find ottos massively pearshaped bulk looming massively above me his fists were clenched his puce complexion had darkened dangerously his eyes were glaring and his lips were clamped in a thin line that threatened to disappear at any moment you look upset mr gerran i said in point of fact i was eavesdropping i pushed myself to my feet dusted off the knees of my trousers straightened and dusted off my hands i can explain everything im waiting for your explanation he was fractionally more livid than ever it should be interesting dr marlowe i only said i can explain everything can mr gerran that doesnt mean ive got any intention of explaining anything come to that what are you doing here what am i what am i he spluttered into outraged speechlessness the years top candidate for an instant coronary god damn your impudence sir im about to go on watch what are you doing at my daughters door im surprised youre not looking through that keyhole marlowe instead of listening at it i dont have to look through keyholes i said reasonably miss haynes is my patient and im a doctor if i want to see her i just open the door and walk in well then now that youre on watch ill be on my way bed im tired bed bed by god i swear this marlowe youll regretwhos in there with her lonnie gilbert lonnie gilbertl what in the name of hellstand aside sir let me pass i barred his wayphysically it was like stopping a small tank upholstered in dunlopillo but i had the advantage of having my back to the wall and he brought up a foot short of the door i wouldnt if i were you theyre having a rather painful moment in there lost one might say in the far from sweet remembrance of things past what the devil do you mean what are you trying to tell me youyou eavesdropper im not trying to tell you anything maybe though youd tell me something maybe you would like to tell me something about that car crashi assume that it must have been in californiain which lonnie gilberts wife and two children were killed a long long time ago he stopped being livid he even stopped being his normal puce colour drained from his face to leave it ugly and mottled and stained with grey car crash hed a much better control over his voice than he had over his complexion what do you mean car crash sir i dont know what i mean thats why im asking you i heard lonnie just snippets talking about his familys fatal car crash and as your daughter seemed to know something about it i assumed you would too i dont know what hes talking about nor you otto who seemed suddenly to have lost all his inquisitorial predilections wheeled and walked up the passage to the centre of the cabin i followed and walked to the outer door smithy was in for a hike i thought no doubt about it now although the cold was as intense as ever the snow had stopped the west wind dropped away to no more than an icily gentle breezethe fact that we were now in the lee of the antarcticflell might have accounted for thatand there were quite large patches of starstudded sky all around there was a curious lightness a luminescence in the atmosphere too much to be accounted for by the presence of stars alone i walked out a few paces until i was clear of the main cabin and low to the south i could see a threequarter moon riding in an empty sky i went back inside and as i closed the door i saw lonnie crossing the main living area heading i assumed for his cubicle he walked uncertainly like a man not seeing too well and as he went by close to me i could see that his eyes were masked in tears i would have given a lot to know just what it had been that had been responsible for those tears it was a mark of lonnies emotional upset that he did not so much as glance at the still threequarter full bottle of scotch on the small table by which otto was sitting he didnt even so much as look at otto more extraordinarily still otto didnt even look up at lonnies passing in the mood hed been in when hed accosted me outside his daughters door id have expected him to question lonnie pretty closely probably with both hands around the old mans neck but ottos mood clearly had undergone a considerable sea change i was walking towards luke bent on rousing the faithful watch dog from his slumbers when otto suddenly heaved his bulk upright and made his way down the passage towards his daughters cubicle i didnt even hesitate in for a penny in for a pound i followed him and took up my by now accustomed station outside judith hayness door although this time i didnt have to have recourse to the keyhole again as otto in what was presumably his agitation had left the door considerately ajar otto was addressing his daughter in a low harsh voice that was noticeably lacking in filial affection what have you been saying you young shedevil what have you been saying car crash car crash what lies have you been telling gilbert you blackmailing little bitch get out of here judith haynes had abandoned the use of her dull and expressionless voice although probably involuntarily leave me you horrible evil old man get out get out get out i leaned more closely to the crack between door and jamb it wasnt every day one had the opportunity to listen to those family teteetetes by god and ill not have my own daughter cross me otto had forgotten the need to talk in a low voice ive put up with more than enough from you and that other idle worthless bastard of a blackmailer what did you you dare to talk of michael like that her voice had gone very quiet and i shivered involuntarily at the sound of it you talk of him like that and hes lying dead murdered my husband well father dear can i tell you about something you dont know that i know he was blackmailing you with shall i father dear and shall i tell it to johann heissman too there was a silence then otto said you venomous little bitch he sounded as if he was trying to choke himself wenomous venomous she laughed a cracked and chilling sound coming from you thats rich come now daddy dear surely you remember iwhy even i can remember it poor old johann he ran and ran and ran and all the time he ran the wrong way poor uncle johann thats what you taught me to call him then wasnt it daddy dear uncle johann i left not because i had heard all that i wanted to hear but because i thought that this was a conversation that was not going to last very long and i could foresee a degree of awkwardness arising if otto caught me outside his daughters door a second time besidesi checked the timejungbeck ottos watchmate was due to make his appearance just at that moment and i didnt want him to find me where i was and very likely lose no time in telling his boss about it so i returned to luke decided that there was no point in awakening him only to tell him to go to sleep again poured myself a sort of morning nightcap and was about to savour it when i heard a feminine voice scream get out get out get out and saw otto emerging hurriedly from his daughters cubicle and as hurriedly close the door behind him he waddled swiftly into the middle of the cabin seized the whisky bottle without as much as byyourleavetrue it was his own but he didnt know tbatpoured himself a brimming measure and downed half of it at a gulp his shaking hand spilling a fair proportion of it on the way up to his mouth that was very thoughtless of you mr gerran i said reproachfully upsetting your daughter like that shes really a very sick girl and what she needs is tender affection a measure of loving care tender affection he was on the second half of his glass now and he splattered much of it over his shirt front loving care jesus he splashed some more scotch into his glass and gradually subsided a little by and by he became calm almost thoughtful when he spoke no one would have thought that only a few minutes previously his greatest yearning in life would have been to disembowel me maybe i wasnt as thoughtful as i ought to have been but an hysterical girl very hysterical this actress temperament you know im afraid your sedatives arent very effective dr marlowe peoples reactions to sedatives vary greatly mr gerran and unpredictably im not blaming you not blaming you he said irritatedly care and attention yes yes but sonic rest a damned good sleep is more important if you ask me hem about another sedativea more effective one this time no danger in that is there no no harm in it she did sound a bitwhat shall we sayworked up but shes rather a selfwilled person if she refuses ha selfwilled try anyway he seemed to lose interest in the subject and gazed moodily at the floor he looked up without any enthusiasm as jungbeck made a sleepy entrance turned and shook luke roughly by the shoulder wake up man luke stirred and opened bleary eyes bloody fine guard you are your watch is over go to bed luke mumbled some sort of apology rose stiffly and moved off you might have let him be i said hell have to get up for the day inside a few hours anyway too late now besides otto added inconsequentially im going to have the lot of them up inside two hours weathers cleared theres a moon to travel by we can all be where we want to be and ready to shoot as soon as theres enough light in the sky he glanced along the corridor where his daughters cubicle was well arent you going to try i nodded and left ten minutes timein the right circumstances which in this case were the wrong onescan bring about a change in a persons features which lies just within the bounds of credibility the face that had looked merely drawn so very recently now looked haggard she looked her real age and then ten hard and bitter years after that she wept in a sore and aching silence and the tears flowed steadily down her temples and past the carlobes the damp marks spreading on the grey rough linen of her pillow i would not have thought it possible that i could ever feel such deep pity for this person and wish to comfort her but that was how it was i said i think you should sleep now why her hands were clenched so tightly that the ivory of the knuckles showed what does it matter ill have to wake up wont l yes i know it was the sort of situation where no matter what i said the words would sound banal but the sleep would do you good miss haynes well yes she said it was hard for her to speak through the quiet tears all right make it a long sleep so like a fool i made it a long sleep like an even greater fool i went to my cubicle and lay down and like the greatest fool of all i went to sleep myself i slept for over four hours and awoke to an almost deserted cabin otto had indeed been as good as his word and had had everyone up and around at what they must have regarded as the most unreasonable crack of dawn understandably enough neither he nor anyone else had seen fit to wake me i was one of the few who had no functions to perform that day otto and conrad were the only two people in the main quarter of the cabin both were drinking coffee but as both were heavily muffled they were clearly on the point of departure conrad said a civil good morning otto didnt bother he informed me that the count neal divine allen cecil and nary darling had taken off with the snocat and cameras along lerners way and that he and conrad were following immediately hendriks and the three apostles were abroad with their sound recording equipment smithy and heyter had left over an hour previously for tunheim initially i found s vaguely disturbing i would have thought that smithy would have at least woken and spoken to me before leaving on reflection however i found this omission less than disturbing it was a measure of smithys confidence in himself and by implication my unspoken confidence in himself that he had not thought it necessary to seek either advice or reassurance before his departure finally otto told me heissman and his hand held camera along with jungbeck had taken off on his location reconnaissance in the sixteenfoot workboat they had been accompanied by goin who had volunteered to stand in for the now absent heyter otto stood up drained his cup and said about my daughter dr marlowe shell be all right she would never again be all right id like to talk to her before i go i couldnt begin to imagine a reason why he should wish to talk to her or she to him but i refrained from comment he went on you have no objections medical ones i mean no just straightforward commonsense ones shes under heavy sedation you couldnt even shake her awake but surely two or three hours at the very least if you dont want my advice mr gerran why ask for it fair enough fair enough leave her be he headed towards the outer door your plans for the day dr marlowe whos left here i said apart from your daughter and myself he looked at me his brows levelled in a frown then said mary stuart then theres lonnie eddie and sandy why theyre asleep as far as i know why someone has to bury stryker ah yes of course stryker i hadnt forgotten you know butyes of course yes yes you yes i am in your debt a ghastly business ghastly ghastly ghastly thank you again dr marlowe he waddled purposefully towards the door come charles we are overdue they left i poured myself some coffee but had nothing to eat for it wasnt a morning for eating went outside into the equipment shed and found myself a spade the frozen snow was not too deep not much more than a foot but the permafrost had set into the ground and it cost me over an hour and a half and what is always dangerous in those high latitudes the loss of much sweat before id done what had to be done i returned the spade and went inside quickly to change it was a fine clear morning of bitter cold with the sun not yet in the sky but no morning for an overheated man to linger five minutes later a pair of binoculars slung round my neck i closed the front door softly behind me despite the fact that it was now close on ten oclock eddie sandy lonnie and mary stuart had not as yet put in an appearance the presence of the first three would have given me no cause for concern for all were notorious for their aversion to any form of physical activity and it was extremely unlikely that any would have suggested that they accompany me on my outing mary stuart might well have done so for any number of reasons curiosity the wish to explore because shed been told to keep an eye on me even maybe because she would have felt safer with me than being left behind at the cabin but whatever her reasons might have been i most definitely didnt want mary stuart keeping an eye on me when i was setting out to keep an eye on heissman but to keep an eye on heissman i had first of all to find him and heissman inconveniently and most annoyingly was nowhere to be seen the intention as i had understood it was that he with jungbeck and goin should cruise the sorhamna in the sixteenfooter in search of likely background material but there was no trace of their boat anywhere in the sorhamna and from where i stood in the vicinity of the cabin i could take in the whole sweep of the bay at one glance against the remote possibility that the boat might have temporarily moved in behind one of the tiny islands on the east side of the bay i kept the glasses on those for a few minutes nothing stirred heissman i was sure had left the sorhamna he could have moved out to the open sea to the cast by way of the northern tip of the island of makehl but this seemed unlikely the northerly seas were whitecapped and confused and apart from the fact that heissman was as far removed from the popular concept of an intrepid seaman as it was possible to imagine it seemed unlikely that he would have forgotten smithys warning the previous day about the dangers inherent in taking an openpooped boat out in such weather much more likely i thought hed moved south out of the sorhamna into the sheltered waters of the next bay to the south the eviebukta i too made my way south initially i moved in a southwesterly direction to give the low cliffs of the bay as wide a berth as possible not from any vertiginous fear of heights but because hendriks and the three apostles were down there somewhere recording or hoping to record the cries of the kittiwake gulls the fulmars the black guillernots which were reputed to haunt those parts i had no reason to fear anything at their hands i just didnt want to go around arousing too much curiosity the going diagonally upwards across a deceptively easylooking slope proved very laborious indeed mountaineering ability was not called for which in view of my lack of expertise or anything resembling specialised equipment was just as well what was required was some form of inbuilt radar to enable me to detect the presence of hidden fissures and sudden dips in the smooth expanse of white and in this unfortunately i was equally lacking with the result that i fell abruptly and at fairly regular intervals into drifts of newly formed snow that at times reached as high as my shoulders there was no physical danger in this the cushioning effect of newly driven snow is almost absolute but the effort of almost continuously extricating myself from those miniature ravines and struggling back up to something resembling terra firmawhich even then had seldom less than twelve or fifteen inches of soft snowwas very wearing indeed if it were so difficult for me to make progress along such relatively simple ground i wondered how smithy and heyter must be faring in the so much more wildly rugged mountainous terrain to the north it took me just on an hour and a half to cover less than a mile and arrive at a vantage point of a height of about five hundred feet that enabled me to see into the next baythe evjebukta this wide ushaped bay stretching from kapp malmgren in the northeast to kapp kolthoff in the southwest was just over a mile in length and perhaps half of that in width the entire coastline of the bay consisted of vertical cliffs a bleak forbidding and repellent stretch of grey water and precipitous limestone that offered no haven to those in peril on the sea i stretched out gratefully on the snow and when the thumping of my heart and the rasping of my breathing had quietened sufficiently for me to hold a pair of binoculars steady i used them to quarter the evjebukta it was completely bereft of life the sun was up now low over the southeastern horizon but even although it was in my eyes visibility was good enough and the resolution of the binoculars such that i could have picked up a seagull floating on the waters there were some little islands to the north of the bay and of course there were the cliffs immediately below me that blocked off all view of what might be happening at their feel but if the boat was concealed either behind an island or under the cliffs it was most unlikely that heissman would remain in such positions long for there would he nothing to detain him i looked south beyond the tip of kapp kolthoff and there beyond the protection of the headland the sun glinted off the broken tops of white water i was as certain as one could be without absolute proof that they would not have ventured beyond the protection of the point heissmans unseamanlike qualities apart goin was far too prudent a man to step unheedingly into anything that would even smack of danger how long i lay there waiting for the boat to appear either from behind an island or out from under the concealment of the nearest cliffs i didnt know what i did know was that i suddenly became aware of the fact that i was shaking with the cold and that both hands and feet were almost completely benumbed and i became aware of something else for several minutes now id had the binoculars trained not on the north end of the bay but at the foot of the cliffs to the south on a spot where about three hundred yards northwest of the tip of kapp kolthoff there was a peculiar indentation in the cliff walls partly because of the fact that it appeared to bear to the right and out of sight behind one of the cliff faces guarding the entrance and partly because due to the height of the cliffs and the fact that the sun was almost directly behind the shadows cast were very deep i was unable to make out any details beyond this narrow entrance but that it was an entrance to some cove beyond i didnt doubt of any place within the reach of my binoculars it was the only one where the boat could have lain concealed why anyone should wish to lie there at all was another matter altogether a reason for which i couldnt even guess at one thing was for certain a landward investigation from where i lay was out of the question even if i didnt break my neck in the minimum of the twohour journey it would take me to get there nothing would be achieved by making such a trip anyway for not only did the descent of those beetling black cliffs seem quite suicidal but even if it were impossibly accomplished what lay at the end of it removed any uncertainty about the permanency of the awaiting reception for there was no foreshore whatever just the precipitous plunge of those limestone walls into the dark and icy seas stiffly clumsily i rose and headed back towards the cabin the trip back was easier than the outwards one for it was downhill and by following my own tracks i was able to avoid most of the involuntary descents into the sunken snowdrifts that had punctuated my climb even so it was nearer one oclock than noon when i approached the cabin i was only a few paces distant when the main door opened and mary stuart appeared one look at her and my heart turned over and something cold and leaden seemed to settle in the pit of my stomach dishevelled hair a white and shocked face eyes wild and full of fear id have had to be blind not to know that somewhere close death had walked by again thank god her voice was husky and full of tears thank god youre here please come quickly something terrible has happened i didnt waste time asking her what clearly id find out soon enough just followed her running footsteps into the cabin and along the passage to judith hayness opened door something terrible had indeed happened but there had been no need for haste judith haynes had fallen from her cot and was lying sideways on the floor halfcovered by her blanket which shed apparently dragged down along with her on the bed lay an opened and threepart empty bottle of barbiturate tablets a few scattered over the bed on the floor its neck still clutched in her hand lay a bottle of gin also threeparts empty i stooped and touched the marble forehead even allowing for the icy atmosphere in the cubicle she must have been dead for hours make it a long sleep shed said to me make it a long sleep is sheis she the dead make people speak in whispers cant you tell a dead person when you see one it was brutal of me but i felt flooding into me that cold anger that was to remain with me until wed left the island ii didnt touch her i when did you find her a minute ago two id just made some food and coffee and i came to see where are the others lonnie sandy eddie where are i dont know they left a little while agosaid they were going for a walk a likely tale there was only one reason that would make at least two of the three walk as far as the front door i said get them youll end them in the provision shed provision shed why would they be there because thats where otto keeps his scotch she left i put the gin bottle and barbiturate bottle to one side then i lifted judith haynes onto the bed for no better reason than that it seemed cruel to leave her lying on the wooden floor i looked quickly around the cubicle but i could see nothing that could be regarded as untoward or amiss the window was still screwed in its closed position the few clothes that she had unpacked neatly folded on a small chair my eye kept returning to the gin bottle stryker had told me and id overheard her telling lonnie that she never drank had not drunk alcohol for many years an abstainer does not habitually carry around a bottle of gin just on the offchance that he or she may just suddenly feel thirsty lonnie eddie and sandy came in trailing with them the redolence of a highland distillery but that was the only evidence of their sojourn in the provision shed whatever theyd been like when mary had found them they were shocked cold sober now they just stood there staring at the dead woman and saying nothing understandably i suppose they thought there was nothing they could usefully say i said mr gerran must be informed that his daughter is dead hes gone north to the next bay hell be easy to findyouve only got to follow the snocats tracks i think you should go together god love us all lonnie spoke in a hushed and anguished reverence the poor girl the poor poor lassie first her manand now this wheres it all going to end doctor i dont know lonnie lifes not always so kind is it no need to kill yourselves looking for mr gerran a heart attack on top of this we can do without poor little judith lonnie said and what do we tell otto she died of alcohol and sleeping tabletsits a pretty lethal combination isnt it frequently they looked at each other uncertainly then turned and left mary stuart said what can i do stay there the harshness in my voice surprised me almost as much as it clearly surprised her i want to talk to you i found a towel and a handkerchief wrapped the gin bottle in the former and the barbiturate bottle in the latter i had a glimpse of mary watching me wideeyed in what could have been wonder or fear or both then crossed to examine the dead woman to see whether there were any visible marks on her there wasnt much to examinealthough shed been in bed with blankets over her shed been fully clothed in parka and some kind of fur trousers i didnt have to look long i beckoned mary across and pointed to a tiny puncture exposed by pushing back the hair on judith hayness neck mary ran the tip of her tongue across dry lips and looked at me with sick eyes yes i said murdered how do you feel about that mary dear the term was affectionate the tone not murdered she whispered murdered she looked at the wrapped bottles licked her lips again made as if to speak and seemingly couldnt there may be some gin inside her i conceded possibly even some barbiturate id doubt it thoughits very hard to make people swallow anything when theyre unconscious maybe there are no other fingerprints on the bottlesthey could have been wiped off but if we find only her forefinger and thumb round the neckwell you dont drink threequarters of a bottle of gin holding it by the finger and thumb she stared in fascinated horror at the pinprick in the neck and then i let the hair fall back i dont know but i think an injection of an overdose of morphine killed her how do you feel about it mary dear she looked at me pitifully but i wasnt wasting my pity on the living she said thats the second time you said that why did you say that because its partly your faultand it may be a very large partthat shes dead oh and very cleverly dead i assure you im very good at finding those things outwhen its too damn late rigged for suicideonly i know she never drank well i didnt kill her oh god i didnt kill her i didnt i didnt i didnt and i hope to god youre not responsible for killing smithy too i said savagely if he doesnt come back youre first in line as accessory after murder mr smith her bewilderment was total and totally pathetic and i was totally unmoved she said before god i dont know what youre talking about of course not and you wont know what im talking about when i ask you whats going on between gerran and heissman how could you a sweet and innocent child like you or you wouldnt know whats going on between you and your dear lovable uncle johann she stared at me in a dumb animallike misery and shook her head i struck her even although i was aware that the anger that was in me was directed more against myself than at her still it could not be contained and i struck her and when she looked at me the way a favourite pet would look at a person who has shot it but not quite killed it i lifted my hand again but this time when she closed her eyes and flinched away turning her head to one side i let my hand drop helplessly to my side then did what i should have done in the first place i put my arms around her and held her tight she didnt try to fight or struggle just stood quite still she had nothing left to fight with any more poor mary dear i said youve got no place left to run to have you she made no answer her eyes were still closed uncle johann is no more your uncle than i am your immigration papers state that your father and mother are dead it is my belief that they are still alive and that heissman is no more your mothers brother than he is your uncle it is my belief that he is holding them as hostage for your good conduct and that he is holding you as hostage for theirs i dont just think that heissman is up to no good i know he is for i just dont think hes a criminal operating on an international scale i know that too i know that youre not latvian but strictly of german ancestry i know too that your father ranked very highly in the berlin councils of war i didnt know that at all but it had become an increasingly safe guess and i know too that theres a great deal of money involved not in hard cash but in negotiable securities all this is true is it not there was a silence then she said dully if you know so much whats the good in pretending any more she pushed back a little and looked at me through defeated eyes youre not a real doctor im real enough but not in the ordinary way of things for which any patients i might have had would probably feel very thankful as i havent practised those past good few years im just a civil servant working for the british government nothing glamorous or romantic like intelligence or counterintelligence just the treasury which is why im here because weve been interested in heissmans shennanigans for quite some time i didnt expect to run into this other busload of trouble though what do you mean too long to explain even if i could i cant yet and ive things to do mr smith she hesitated from the treasury too i nodded and she went on ive been thinking that she hesitated again my father commanded submarine groups during the war he was also a high party official very high i think then he disappeared where was his command for the last year the northtromso trondheim narvik places like that im not sure i was all of a sudden i was i knew it had to be true i said then disappearance a war criminal she nodded and now an old man another nod and amnestied because of age yes just over two years ago then he came back to usmr heissman brought us all together i dont know how i could have explained heissmans special background qualifications for this very job but it was hardly the moment i said your fathers not only a war criminal hes also a civil criminalprobably an embezzler on a grand scale yet you do all this for him for my mother im sorry im sorry too im sorry for all the trouble ive given you do you think my mother will be all right i think so i said which considering my recent disastrous record in keeping people alive was a pretty rash statement on my part but what can we do what on earth can we do with all those terrible things happening its not what ive can do i know what to do its what you are going to do ill do anything anything you say i promise then do nothing behave exactly as youve been behaving especially towards uncle johann but never a word of our talk to him never a word to anyone not even to charles conrad least of all to him but i thought you liked sure i do but not half as much as our charles likes you hed just up and clobber heissman on the spot i havent i said bitterly been displaying very much cleverness or finesse to date give me this one last chance i thought a bit about being clever then said one thing you can do let me know if you see anyone returning here im going to look around a bit otto had almost as many locks as i had keys as befitted the chairman of olympus productions the producer of the film and the de facto leader of the expedition he carried a great number of bits and pieces of equiprnent with him most of the belongings were personal and most of these clothes for although otto because of his spherical shape was automatically excluded from the list of the top ten bestdressed men his sartorial aspirations were of the most soaring and he carried at least a dozen suits with him although what he intended to do with them on bear island was a matter for conjecture more interestingly he had two small squat brown suitcases that served merely as cover for two metal deedboxes those were haspbound with imposing brass padlocks that a blind and palsied picklock could have had opened in under a minute and it didnt take me much longer the first contained nothing of importance nothing of importance that was to anyone except otto they consisted of hundreds of press clippings no doubt carefully selected for the laudatory nature of their contents and going back for twentyodd years all of them unanimous in extolling ottos cinematic genius precisely the sort of egofeeding nourishment that otto would carry around with him the second deedbox contained papers of a purely financial nature recorded ottos transactions incomes and outgoes over a good number of years and would have proved i felt certain fascinating reading for any inland revenue inspector or lawabiding accountant if there were any such around but my interest in them was minimal what did interest me though and powerfully was a collection of cancelled chequebooks and as i couldnt see that those were going to be of any use to otto in the arctic i pocketed them checked that everything was as i had found it and left goin as befitted the firms accountant was also much given to keeping things under lock and key but because the total of his impediments didnt come to much more than a quarter of ottos the search took correspondingly less time again as befitted an accountant goins main concern was clearly with matters financial and as this goincided with my own current interest i took with me three items that i judged likely to be handsomely rewarding of more leisured study those were the olympus productions salary lists goins splendidly padded private bankbook and a morocco diary that was full of items in some sort of private code but was nonetheless clearly concerned with money for goin hadnt bothered to construct a code for the columns of pounds and pence there was nothing necessarily sinister about this concern for privacy especially other peoples privacy could be an admirable trait in an accountant in the next half hour i went through four cubicles in heissmans i found what i had expected to find nothing a man with his background and experience would have discovered many years ago that the only safe place to file his records was inside his head but he did have some innocuous itemsi supposed he had used them in the production of the olympus manifesto for the filmwhich were of interest to me several largescale charts of bear island one of those i took neal divines private papers revealed little of interest except a large number of unpaid bills ius and a number of letters all of them menacing in varying degrees from an assortment of different bankersa form of correspondence that went well with divines nervous apprehensive and generally downtrodden mien at the bottom of an oldfashioned gladstone in the counts room i found a small black automatic loaded but as an envelope beside it contained a current london licence for the gun this discovery might or might not have significance the number of lawabiding people in lawabiding britain who for divers lawabiding reasons consider it prudent to own a gun are in their total quite remarkable in the cubicle shared by jungbeck and heyter i found nothing incriminating but i was intrigued by a small brown paper packet scaled that i found in jungbecks case i took this into the main cabin where mary stuart was moving from window to windowthere were four of themkeeping watch nothing i said she shook her head put on a kettle will you theres coffee there and some food i dont want coffee a kettlewaterhalf an inch will do i handed her the packet steam this open for me will you steamwhats in it if i knew that i wouldnt ask you to open it i went into lonnies cubicle but it held nothing but lonnies dreamsan album full of faded photographs with few exceptions they were of his familyclearly lonnie had taken them himself the first few showed a dark attractive girl with a wavy shoulderlength is hairdo holding two babies who were obviously twins later photographs showed that the babies were girls as the years had passed lonnies wife changing hair styles apart had changed remarkably little while the girls had grown up from page to page until eventually they had become two rather beautiful youngsters very closely resembling their mother in the last photograph about twothirds of the way through the album all three were shown in white summer dresses of an unconscionable length leaning against a dark open roadster the two girls would then have been about eighteen i closed the album with that guilty and uncomfortable feeling you have when you stumble however inadvertently across another mans private dreams i was crossing the passage to eddies room when mary called me she had the package open and was holding the contents in a white handkerchief i said thats clever two thousand pounds she said wonderingly all in new fivepound notes thats a lot of money they were not only new they were in consecutive serial number order i noted down the first and last numbers tracing would be automatic and immediate somebody was being very stupid indeed or very confident indeed this was one item of what might he useful evidence that i did not appropriate but locked up again resealed in jungbecles case men a man has that much money around hes apt to check on its continued presence pretty frequently neither eddies nor hendrikss cubicles revealed any item of interest while the only thing i learned from a brief glance at sandys room was that he was just that modicum less scrupulous in obtaining his illicit supplies than lonnie sandy stocked up on ottos scotch by the bottleful the three apostless quarters i passed up a search in there would i was convinced yield nothing it never occurred to me to check on conrad it was just after three oclock with the light beginning to fade from the sky when i returned to the main cabin lonnie and the other two should have contacted otto and the others a long time ago their return i should have thought was considerably overdue mary who had eatenor said she hadgave me steak and chips both of the frozen and precooked variety and i could see that she was worried heaven knew she had enough reason to be worried about a great number of things but i guessed that her present worry was due to one particular cause where on earth can they all be she said im sure something must have happened to them hell be all right they probably just went farther than they intended thats all i hope so its getting dark and the snows starting she broke off and looked at me in embarrassed accusation youre very clever arent you i wish to god i were i said and meant it i pushed my almost uneaten meal away and rose thank you sorry and its nothing to do with your cooking but im not hungry ill be in my room its getting dark she repeated inconsequentially i wont be long i lay on my cot and looked at my haul from the various cabins i didnt have to look long and i didnt have to be possessed of any outstanding deductive powers to realise the significance of what i had before me the salary lists were very instructive but not half so enlightening as the correspondence between ottos chequebooks and goins bankbook but the mapmore precisely the detailed inset of the evjebuktawas perhaps the most interesting of all i was gazing at the map and having long long thoughts about mary stuarts father when mary stuart herself came into my room theres someone coming who i dont know its too dark and theres snow falling what direction that way she pointed south thatll be hendriks and the three apostles i wrapped the papers up into a small towel and handed them to her hide those in your room i turned my medical bag upside down brought a small coach screwdriver from my pocket and began to unscrew the four metal studs that served as floor rests yes yes of course she hesitated do you mind telling me there are shameless people around who wouldnt think twice of searching through a mans private possessions especially mine if im not here thats to say id removed the base and now started working free the flat black metal box that had fitted so snugly into the bottom youre going out she said it mechanically eke one who is beyond surprise where well im not dropping in at the local and thats for sure i took out the black box and handed it to her careful heavy hide that tooand hide it well but what hurry up i hear them at the door she hurried up i screwed the base of the bag back in position and went into the main cabin hendriks and the three apostles were there and from the way they clapped their arms together to restore circulation and in between sipped the hot coffee that mary had left on the stove they seemed to be more than happy to be back their happiness vanished abruptly when i told them briefly of judith hayness death and although like the rest of the company none of them had any cause to cherish any tender feelings towards the dead woman the simple fact of the death of a person they knew and that this fresh death suicide though it had been had come so cruelly swiftly after the preceding murders had the immediate effect of reducing them to a state of speechless shock a state from which they werent even beginning to recover when the door opened and otto lurched in he was gasping for mr and seemed close to exhaustion although such symptoms of physical distress where otto was concerned were not in themselves necessarily indicative of recent and violent exertion even the minor labour of tying his shoelaces made otto huff and puff in an alarming fashion i looked at him with what i hoped was a proper concern now now mr gerran you must take it easy i said solicitously i know this has been a terrible shock to you where is she he said hoarsely wheres my daughter how in gods name in her cubicle he made to brush by me but i barred his way in a moment mr gerran but i must see first thatwell you understand he stared at me under lowered brows then nodded impatiently to show that he understood which was more than i did and said be quick please seconds only i looked at mary stuart some brandy for mr gerran what i had to do in judith hayness cubicle took only ten seconds i didnt want otto asking awkward questions about why id so lovingly wrapped up the gin and barbiturate bottles so holding them gingerly by the tops of the necks i unwrapped them placed them in reasonably conspicuous positions and summoned otto he hung around for a bit looking suitably stricken and making desolate sounds but offered no resistance when i took his arm suggested that he was achieving nothing by remaining there and led him outside in the passage he said suicide of course no doubt about that he sighed god how i reproach myself for youve nothing to reproach yourself with mr gerran you saw how completely broken she was at the news of her husbands death just plain oldfashioned grief its good to have a man like you around in times like those otto murmured i met this in modest silence led him back to his brandy and said where are the others just a few minutes behind i ran on ahead how come lonnie and the other two took so long to find you it was a marvellous day for shooting all background we just kept moving on every shot better than the last one and then of course we had this damned rescue job my god if ever a location unit has been plagued with such ill luck rescue job i hoped i sounded puzzled that my tone didnt reflect my sudden chill heyter hurt himself otto lowered some brandy and shook his head to show the burden of woes he was carrying he and smith were climbing when he fell ankle sprained or broken i dont know they could see us coming along lerners way heading more or less the way theyd gone though they were much higher of course seems heyter persuaded smith to carry on said hed be all right hed attract our attention otto shook his head again and drained his brandy fool i dont understand i said i could hear the engine of the approaching snocat instead of just lying there till we came within shouting distance he tried to hobble down the hill towards us of course his blasted ankle gave wayhe fell into a gully and knocked himself about pretty badly god knows how long he was lying there unconscious it was early afternoon before we heard his shouts for help a most damnable job getting him down that hill just damnable is that the snocat out there i nodded otto heaved himself to his feet and we went towards the front door together i said smithy did you see him smith otto looked at me in faint surprise no of course not i told you hed gone on ahead of course i said id forgotten the door opened from the outside just as we reached it conrad and the count entered halfcarrying a heyter who could only hop on one leg his head hung exhaustedly his chin on his chest and his pale face was heavily bruised on both the right cheek and temple we got him onto a couch and i eased off his right boot the ankle was swollen and badly discoloured and bleeding slightly where the skin had been broken in several places while mary stuart was heating some water i propped him up gave him some brandy smiled at him in my most encouraging physicians fashion commiserated with him on his ill luck and marked him down for death ottos stocks of liquid cheer were taking a severe beating it is a medical commonplace that there are those who under severe stress resort to the consumption of large quantities of food olympus productions ltd harboured none of those the demand for food was nonexistent but in a correspondingly inverse proportion alcoholic solace was being eagerly sought and the atmosphere in the cabin was powerfully redolent of that of a glasgow public house when a scottish soccer team has resoundingly defeated its ancient enemies from across the border the sixteen people scattered around the cabinthe injured heyter apartshowed no desire to repair to their cubicles there was an unacknowledged and wholly illogical tacit assumption that if judith haynes could die in her cubicle anyone could instead they sat scattered around in twos and threes drinking silently or conversing in murmurs furtive eyes forever moving around the others present all deepening a cheerless and doomladen mr which stemmed not from judith hayness death but from what might or might not be yet another impending disaster although it was close on seven now with the darkness almost total and the snow falling steadily out of the north heissman goin and jungbeck had not yet returned otto unusually sat by himself chewing on a cigar but not drinking he gave the impression of a man who is wondering what fearsome blow fate now has in store for him i had talked to him briefly some little time previously and he had given it as his morose and unshakeable opinion that all three of them had been drowned none of them as he had pointed out knew the first thing about handling a boat even if they managed to survive more than a few minutes in those icy waters what hope lay for them if they did swim to shore if they reached a cliff face their fingers would only scrabble uselessly against the smoothly vertical rock until their strength gave out and they slid under if they managed to scramble ashore at some more accessible point the icy mr would reach through their soaked clothes to their soaked bodies and freeze them to death almost instantly if they didnt turn up he said and now he was sure they wouldnt he was going to abandon the entire venture and wait for smithy to bring help and if that didnt come soon he would propose that the entire company strike out for the safety of tunheim the entire company had momentarily fallen silent and otto looking across the cabin to where i was standing gave a painful smile and said as if in a desperate attempt to lighten the atmosphere come come dr marlowe i see you havent got a glass no i said i dont think its wise otto looked around the cabin if he was being harrowed by the contemplation of his rapidly dwindling stocks he was concealing his grief well the others seem to think its wise the others dont have to take into account the danger of exposing opened pores to zero temperatures what he peered at me whats that supposed to mean it means that if heissman jungbeck and goin arent back here in a very few minutes i intend to take the fourteenfooter and go to look for them what this in a very different tone of voice otto hauled himself painfully to his feet as he always did when he was preparing to appear impressive go to look for them are you mad sir look for them indeed on a night like this pitch dark cant see a hand in front of your nose no by god ive already lost too many people far too many i absolutely forbid it have you taken into account that their engine may have just failed that theyre just drifting helplessly around freezing to death by the minute while we sit here doing nothing i have and i dont believe it possible the boat engines were overhauled completely before our departure and i know that jungbeck is a very competent mechanic the matter is not to be contemplated im going anyway i would remind you that that boat is company property whos going to stop me taking it otto spluttered ineffectually then said you realise i realise i was tired of otto im fired youd better fire me too then conrad said we all turned to look at him im going along with him id have expected no less from conrad he after all had been the one to initiate the search for smithy soon after our landing i didnt try to argue with him i could see mary stuart with her hand on his arm looking at him in dismay if she couldnt dissuade him i wasnt going to bother to try charles otto was bringing the full weight of his authority to bear i would remind you that you have a contract the contract conrad said otto stared at him in disbelief clamped his lips quite shut wheeled and headed for his cubicle with his departure everybody it seemed started to speak at the same time i crossed to where the count was moodily drinking the inevitable brandy he looked up and gave me a cheerless smile if you want a third suicidal volunteer my dear boy how long have you known otto gerran whats that he seemed momentarily at a loss then quaffed some more brandy thirtyodd years its no secret i knew him well in prewar vienna why do you you were in the film business then yes and no he smiled in an oddly quizzical fashion again its on the record in the halcyon days my dear fellow when count tadeusz leswzynskithats mewas if not exactly a name to be conjured with at least a man of considerable means i was ottos angel his first backer again a smile this time amused why do you think im a member of the board what do you know of the circumstances of heissmans sudden disappearance from vienna in i the count stopped being amused i said so thats not on the record i paused to see if he would say anything and when he didnt i went on watch your back count mymy back that part of the anatomy thats so subject to being pierced by sharp objects or rapidly moving blunt ones or has it not occurred that the board of olympus are falling off their lofty perches like so many stricken birds one lying dead outside another lying dead inside and two more at peril or perhaps even perished on the high seas what makes you think you should be so lucky beware the slings and arrows tadeusz and you might tell neal divine and lonnie to beware of the same things at least while im gone especially lonnieid be glad if you made sure he doesnt step outside this cabin in my absence very vulnerable things backs the count sat in silence for some moments his face not giving any thing away then he said im sure i dont know what youre talking about i never for a moment thought you would i tapped the bulky pocket of his anorak thats where it should be not lying about uselessly in your cabin what for heavens sake your mm beretta automatic i left the count on this suitably enigmatic note and moved across to where lonnie was making hay while the sun shone the hand that held his glass shook with an almost constant tremor and his eyes were glassy but his speech was as intelligible and lucid as ever and once again our medical lochinvar or was it launcelot gallops forth to the rescue lonnie intoned i cant tell you my dear boy how my heart fills with pride stay inside when im gone lonnie dont go beyond that door not once please for me merciful heavens lonnie hiccoughed on a grand scale one would think i am in danger you are believe me you are me me he was genuinely baffled and who would wish ill to poor old harmless lonnie youd be astonished at the people who would wish ill to poor old harmless lonnie dispensing for the moment with your homilies about the innate kindness of human nature will you promise me really promise me that you wont go out tonight this is so important to you then my boy it is very well with this gnarled hand on a vat of the choicest malt i left him to get on with what promised to be a very lengthy promise indeed and approached conrad and mary stuart who seemed to be engaged in an argument that was as lowpitched as it was intense they broke off and mary stuart put a beseeching hand on my arm she said please dr marlowe please tell charles not to go hell listen to you i know he will she shivered i just know that something awful is going to happen tonight you may well be right at that i said mr conrad you are not expendable i could i immediately realised have lighted upon a more fortunate turn of phrase instead of looking at conrad she kept looking at me and the implications of what id said dawned on me quite some time after they had clearly dawned on her she put both hands on my arm looked at me with dull and hopeless eyes then turned and walked towards her cubicle go after her i said to conrad tell her no point im going she knows it go after her and tell her to open her window and put that black box i gave her on the snow outside then close her window conrad looked at me closelv made as if to speak then left he was nobodys fool he hadnt even given a nod that could have been interpreted as acknowledgement he was back within a minute we pulled on all the outer clothes we could and furnished ourselves with four of the largest torches on the way to the door mary darling rose from where she was sitting beside a still badly battered allen ur marlowe i put my head to where i figured her car lay behind the tangled platinum hair and whispered im wonderful she nodded solemnly eyes sad behind the huge hornrimmed glasses and kissed me i didnt know what the audience thought of this little vignette and didnt much care probably a last tender farewell to the good doctor before he moved out forever into the outer darkness as the door closed behind us conrad said complainingly she might have kissed me too i think youve done pretty well already i said he had the grace to keep silent with our torches off we moved across to what shelter was offered to the now quite heavily falling snow by the provisions hut and remained there for two or three minutes until we were quite certain that no one had it in mind to follow us then we moved round the side of the main cabin and picked up the black box outside mary stuarts window she was standing there and im quite sure she saw us but she made no gesture or any attempt to wave goodbye it seemed as if the two marys had but one thought in common we made our way through the snow and the darkness down to the jetty stowed the black box securely under the stern sheets started up the outboard horsepower only but enough for a fourteenfooterand cast off as we came round the northern arm of the jetty conrad said christ its as black as the earl of hells waistcoat how do you propose to set about it set about what finding heissman and company of course i couldnt care if i never saw that lot again i said candidly ive no intention of trying to find them on the contrary all our best efforts are going to be brought to bear to avoid the while conrad was silently mulling over this volteface i took the boamt the motor throttled right back for prudences sake just over a hundred yards out until we were close into the northern shore of the sorhamna and cut the engine as the boat drifted to a stop i went foreword and eased anchor and rope over the side according to the chart i said there are three fathoms here according to the experts that should mean about fifty feet of rope to prevent us from drifting so fifty feel and as were against the land and so cant be silhouetted that should make us practically invisible to anyone approaching from the south no smoking of course very funny conrad said then after a pause he went on carefully who are you expecting to approach from the south snow white and the seven dwarfs all right all right so you dont think theres anything wrong with them i think theres a great deal wrong with them but not in the sense you mean ah there was a silence which i took to be a very thoughtful one on his part speaking of snow white yes how about whiling away the time by telling me a fairy story so i told everything i knew or thought i knew and he listened in complete silence throughout when i finished i waited for comment but none came so i said i have your promise that you wont clobber heissman on sight reluctantly given reluctantly given he shivered jesus its cold it will be listen at first faintly intermittently through the falling snow and against the northerly wind came the sound of an engine closing within two minutes the exhaust beat was sharp and distinct conrad said well would you believe it they got their motor fixed we remained quietly where we were bobbing gently at anchor and shivering in the deepening cold as heissmans boat rounded the northern arm of the jetty and cut its engine heissman goin and jungbeck didnt just tie up and go ashore immediately they remained by the jetty for over ten minutes it was impossible to see what they were doing the darkness and the snow made it impossible to see even the most shadowy outlines of their forms but several times we could see the flickering of torch beams behind the jetty arm several times i heard distinctly metallic thuds and twice i imagined i heard the splash of something heavy entering the water finally we saw three pinpoints of light move along the main arm of the jetty and disappear in the direction of the cabin conrad said i suppose at this stage i should have some intelligent questions to ask and i should have some intelligent answers i think well have them soon get that anchor in will you i started up the outboard again and keeping it at its lowest revolutions moved eastwards for another two hundred yards then turned south until calculating that the combination of distance and the northerly wind had taken us safelv out of earshot of the cabin i judged the moment had come to open the throttle to its maximum navigating if that was the word for it was easier than i had thought it would be wed been out more than long enough now to achieve the maximum in night sight and i had little difficulty in making out the coastline to my right even on a darker night than this it would have been difficult not to distinguish the sharp demarcation line between the blackness of the cliffs and the snowcovered hills stretching away beyond them neither was the sea as rough as i had feared it might be choppy but no more than that the wind could hardly have lain in a more favourable quarter than it did that night kapp malrogren came up close on the starboard band and i turned the boat more to the southwest to move into the evjebukta but not too much for although the cliffs were easily enough discernible objects low in the water and lying against their black background were virtually undetectable and i had no wish to run the boat onto the islands that i had observed that morning in the northern part of the bay for the first time since wed weighed anchor conrad spoke he was possessed of an exemplary patience clearing his throat he said is one permitted to ask a question youre even permitted to receive an answer remember those extraordinary stacks and pinnacles close by the cliffs when we were rounding the south of the island in the morning rose of blessed memory conrad said yearningly no need for heartbreak i said encouragingly youll be seeing her again tonight what yes indeed the morning rose none other that is to say i hope but later those stacks were caused by erosion which in turn were caused by tidal streams storm waves and frostisland used to be much bigger than it is now bits of it are falling into the sea all the time this same erosion also caused caves to form in the cliffs but it formed something elsei knew nothing about it until this afternoonwhich i think must be unique in the world two or three hundred yards in from the southern tip of this bay a promontory called kapp kolthoff is a tiny horseshoeshaped harbouri saw it through the binoculars this morning you did i was out for a walk at the inner end of this harbour there is an opening not just any opening but a tunnel that goes clear through to the other side of kapp kolthoff it must be at least two hundred yards in length its called perleporten you have to have a largescale map of bear island to find it i got my hands on a largescale map this afternoon that length straight through it must be manmade who the hell would spend a fortune tunnelling through two hundred yards of rock from a to b when you can sail from a to b in five minutes i mean in bear island its not very likely conrad said and you think heissman and his friends may have been here i dont know where else they could have been i looked every place i could look this morning in the sorhamna and in this bay nothing conrad said nothing which was one of the things i liked about a man who i was beginning to like very much he could have asked a dozen questions to which there were as yet no answers but because he knew there were none he refrained from asking them the evinrude kept purring along with reassuring steadiness and in about ten minutes i could see the outline of the cliffs on the south of the evjebukta looming up to the left the tip of kapp kolthoff was clearly to be seen i imagined i could see white breakers beyond there cant possibly be anyone to see us i said and we dont need our night sight any more i know there are no islands in the vicinity headlamps would be handy conrad moved up into the bows and switched on two of our powerful torches within two minutes i could see the sheer of dripping black cliffs less than a hundred yards ahead i turned to starboard and paralleled the cliffs to the northwest one minute later we had itthe eastward facing entrance to a tiny circular inlet i throttled the motor right back and moved gingerly inside and almost at once we had ita small semicircular opening at the base of the south cliff it seemed impossibly small we drifted towards it at less than one knot conrad looked back over his shoulder im claustrophobic me too if we get stuck the sixteenfooter is bigger than this one if it was here ah well in for a penny in for a pound i crossed my mental fingers that conrad would have cause to remember those words and eased the boat into the tunnel it was bigger than it looked but not all that bigger the waves and waters of countless aeons had worn the rock walls as smooth as alabaster although it held a remarkably true direction almost due south it was clear because of the varying widths and the varying heights of the tunnel roof that the band of man had never been near the perleporten then suddenly when conrad called out and pointed ahead and to the right that wasnt so clear any more the opening in the wall no more really than an indentation hardly distinguishable from one or two already passed was at its deepest no more than six feel but it was bounded by an odd hat shelf that varied from two to five feet in width it looked as if it had been manmade but then there were so many curiously shaped rock formations in those parts that it might just possibly have resulted from natural causes but there was one thing about that place that absolutely was in no way due to natural causes a pile of greypainted metal bars neatly stacked in crisscross symmetry neither of us spoke conrad switched on the other two torches pivoted their heads until they were facing upwards and placed them all on the shelf flooding the tiny area with light not without some difficulty we scrambled on to the shelf and looped the painter round one of the bars still without speaking i took the boat book and probed for bottom it was less than five feet below the surface and a very odd kind of rock it felt too i guddled around some more left the hook strike something at once hard and yielding and hauled it up it was a halfinch chain corroded in places but still sound i hauled some more and the end of another rectangular bar identical in size to those on the shelf and secured to the chain by an eye bolt came into sight it was badly discoloured i lowered chain and bar back to the bottom still in this uncanny silence i took a knife from my pocket and tested the surface of one of the bars the metal almost certainly lead was soft and yielding but it was no more than a covering skin there was something harder beneath i dug the knife blade in hard and scraped away an inch of the lead something yellow glittered in the lamplight well now conrad said jackpot i believe is the technical term something like that and look at this conrad reached behind the pile of bars and brought up a can of paint it was labeled instant grey it seems to be very good stuff i said i touched one of the bars quite dry and you must admit quite clever you saw off the eye bolt paint the whole lot over and what do you have a ballast bar identical in size and colour to the ballast bars in the mockup sub ten out of ten i said i hefted one of the bars just right for easy handling a fortypound ingot how do you know its my treasury training current valuesay thirty thousand dollars how many bars in that pile would you say a hundred more and thats just for starters bulk is almost certainly still under water paint brushes there yes conrad reached behind the pile but i checked him please not i said think of all those lovely fingerprints conrad said slowly my minds just engaged gear again he looked at the pile and said incredulously three million dollars give or take a few percent i think wed better leave conrad said im coming all over avaricious we left as we emerged into the little circular bay we both looked back at the dark and menacing little tunnel conrad said who discovered this i have no idea perleporten what does that mean the gates of pearl they came pretty close at that it wasnt a bad try the journey back was a great deal more unpleasant than the outward one had been the seas were against us the icy wind and the equally icy snow were in our faces and because of that same snow the visibility was drastically reduced but we made it inside an hour almost literally frozen stiff but at the same time contradictorily shaking with the cold we tied the boat up conrad clambered up on to the jetty i passed him the black box cut about thirty feet off the boats anchor rope and followed i built a rope cradle round the box fumbled with a pair of catches and opened a hinged cover section which comprised a third of the top plate and twothirds of a side plate in the near total darkness switches and dials were less than halfseen blurs but i didnt need light to operate this instrument which was a basically very simple affair anyway i pulled out a manually operated telescopic aerial to its fullest extent and turned two switches a dim green light glowed and a faint hum that couldnt have been heard a yard away came from the box i always think its so satisfactory when those little toys work conrad said but wont the snow gum up the works this little toy costs just over a thousand pounds you can immerse it in acid you can boil it in water you can drop it from a fourstory building it still works its got a little sister that can he fired from a naval gun i dont think a little snow will harm do you i wouldnt think so he watched in silence as i lowered the box pilot light facing the stonework over the south arm of the pier secured the rope to a bollard made it fast round its base and concealed it with a scattering of snow whats the range forty miles it wont require a quarter of that tonight and its transmitting now its transmitting now we moved back to the main arm of the pier brushing footmarks away with our gloves i said i wouldnt think they would have heard us coming back but no chances a weather eye if you please i was down inside the hull of the mockup sub and had rejoined conrad inside two minutes he said no trouble none the two paints dont quite match but youd never notice it unless you were looking for it we were not greeted like returning heroes it would not be true to say that our return or our early return was greeted with anything like disappointment but there was definitely an anticlimactic mr to it maybe they had already expended all their sympathies on heissman jungbeck and goin who had claimed predictably enough that their engine had broken down in the late afternoon heissman thanked us properly enough but there was a faint trace of amused condescension to his thanks that would normally have aroused a degree of antagonism in me were it not for the fact that my antagonism towards heissman was already so total that any deepening of it would have been quite impossible so conrad and i contented ourselves with making a show of expressing our relief to find the three voyagers alive while not troubling very much to conceal our chagrin conrad especially was splendid at this clearly he had a considerable future as an actor the atmosphere in the cabin was almost unbearably funereal i would have thought that the safe return of five of their company might have been cause for some subdued degree of rejoicing but it may well have been that the very fact of our being alive only heightened the collective awareness of the dead woman lying in her cubicle heissman tried to tell us about the marvellous backgrounds he had found that day and i couldnt help reflecting that he was going to have a most hellishly difficult job in setting up camera and sound crews within the extraordinarily restrictive confines of the perleporten tunnel heissman desisted when it became clear that no one was listening to him otto made a halfhearted attempt to establish some kind of working relationship with me and even went to the length of pressing some scotch upon me which i accepted without thanks but drank nevertheless he tried to make some feebly jocular remark about open pores and it being obvious that i didnt intend venturing forth again that night and i didnt tell him not just yet that i did indeed intend to venture forth again that night but that as my proposed walk would take me no farther than the jetty it was unlikely that all the open pores in the world would incapacitate me i looked at my watch another ten minutes no more then we would all go for that little walk the four directors of olympus productions lonnie and myself just the six of us no more the four directors were already there and given the time lonnie normally took to regain contact with reality after a prolonged session with the only company left in the world that gave him any solace it was time that he was here also i went down the passage and into his cabin it was bitterly cold in there because the window was wide open and it was wide open because that was the way that lonnie had elected to leave his cubicle which was quite empty i picked up a torch that was lying by the rumpled cot and peered out the window the snow was still falling steadily but not so heavily as to obscure the tracks that led away from the window there were two sets of tracks lonnie had been persuaded to leave not that he would have required much persuasion i ignored the curious looks that came my way as i went quickly through the main cabin and headed for the provisions hut its door was open but lonnie was not there either the only sure sign that he had been there was a halffull bottle of scotch with its screw top off so much for lonnie and his mighty oath taken with his hand on a vat of the choicest malt the tracks outside the hut were numerous and confused it was clear that my chances of isolating and following any particular set of those was minimal i returned to the cabin and there was no lack of immediate volunteers for the search lonnie had never made an unwitting enemy in his life it was the count who found him inside a minute face down in a deep drift behind the generator shed he was already shrouded in white so he must have been lying there for some time he was clad in only shirt pullover trousers and what appeared to be a pair of ancient carpet slippers the snow beside his head was stained yellow where the contentsor part of the contentsof yet another bottle still clutched in his right hand had been spilt we turned him over if ever a man looked like a dead man it was lonnie his skin was icecold to the touch his face the colour of old ivory his glazed unmoving eyes were open to the falling snow and there was no rise and fall to his chest but on the offchance that there might just be some substance in the old saw that a special providence looks after little children and drunks i put my car to his chest and thought i detected a faint and faroff murmur we carried him inside and laid him on his cot while oil beaters hot water bags and heated blankets were being brought in or preparedapart from the general esteem in which lonnie was held everyone seemed almost pathetically eager to contribute to something constructivei used my stethoscope and established that he did indeed have a heartbeat if such a term could be applied to something as weak and as fluttering as the wings of a wounded captive bird i thought briefly of a heart stimulant and brandy and dismissed both ideas both in his touchandgo condition were as likely to kill him off as to have any good effect so we just concentrated on heating up the frozen and lifelessseeming body as quickly as was possible while four people continuously massaged ominously white feet and bands to try to restore some measure of circulation fifteen minutes after wed first found him he was perceptibly breathing again a shallow and gasping fight for mr but breathing nevertheless he was now as warm as artificial aids could make him so i thanked the others and told them they could go i asked the two marys to stay behind as nurses because i couldnt stay myself by my watch i was already ten minutes late lonnies eyes moved no other part of him did but his eyes moved after a few moments they focussed blearily on me he was as conscious as he was likely to be for a long time you bloody old fool i said it was no way to talk to a man with one foot still halfway through deaths door but it was the way i felt why did you do it aha his voice was a faroff whisper who took you out of here who gave you the drink i was aware that the two marys had at first stared at me then at each other but the time was gone when it mattered what anyone thought lonnies lips moved soundlessly a few times then his eyes flickered shiftily and he gave a drunken cackle no more than a faint rasping sound deep in his throat a kind man he whispered weakly very kind man i would have shaken him except for the fact that i would certainly have shaken the life out of him i restrained myself with a considerable effort and said what kind man lonnie kind man he muttered kind man he lifted one thin wrist and beckoned i bent towards him know something his voice was a fading murmur tell me lonnie in the end his voice trailed away yes lonnie he made a great effort in the endthere was a long pause i had to put my ear to his mouthin the end theres only kindness he lowered his waxen eyelids i swore and i kept on swearing until i realised that both girls were staring at me with shocked eyes they must have thought that i was swearing at lonnie i said to mary stuart go to conradcharles tell him to tell the count to come to my cubicle now conrad will know how to do it she left without a question mary darling said to me will lonnie live dr marlowe i dont know mary butbut hes quite warm now it wont be exposure that will kill him if thats what you mean she looked at me the eyes behind the hornrims at once earnest and scared you meanyou mean he might go from alcoholic poisoning he might i dont know she said with a flash of that almost touching asperity that could be so characteristic of her you dont really care do you dr marlowe no i dont she looked at me the pinched face shocked and i put my arm round the thin shoulders i dont care mary because he doesnt care lonnies been dead a long time now i went back to my cubicle found the count there and wasted no words i said are you aware that that was a deliberate attempt on lonnies life no but i wondered the counts customary cloak of badinage had fallen away completely do you know that judith haynes was murdered murdered the count was badly shaken and there was no pretence about it either somebody injected her with a lethal dose of morphine just for good measure it was my hypodermic my morphine he said nothing so your rather illegal bullion hunt has turned out to be something more than fun and games indeed it has you know you have been consorting with murderers i know now you know now you know what interpretation the law will put on that i know that too you have your gun he nodded you can use it i am a polish count sir a touch of the old tadeusz and very impressive a polish count should look in a witness box too i said you are aware of course that your only hope is to turn queens evidence yes he said i know that too mr gorran i said id be grateful if you mr heissman mr goin and tadeusz here would step outside with me for a moment step outside otto looked at his watch his three fellow directors his watch again and me in that order on a night like this and an hour like this whatever for please i looked at the others in the cabin id also be grateful if the rest of you remained here in this room till i return i hope i wont be too long you dont have to do as i ask and im certainly in no position to enforce my request but i suggest it would be in your own best interests to do so i know now ive known since this morning who the killer amongst us is but before i put a name to this man i think it is only fair and right that i should first discuss the matter with mr gerran and his fellow directors this brief address was received not unsurprisingly in total silence otto predictably was the one to break the silence he cleared his throat and said carefully you claim to know this mans identity i do you can substantiate this claim prove it you mean yes no i cant ah otto said significantly he looked around the company and said youre taking rather much upon yourself are you not in what way this rather dictatorial attitude youve been increasingly adopting good god man if youve found or think youve found our man for gods sake tell us and dont make this big production out of it it ill becomes any man to play god dr marlowe i would remind you that youre but one of a group an employee if you like of olympus productions just like i am not an employee of olympus productions i am an employee of the british treasury who has been sent to investigate certain aspects of olympus productions ltd those investigations are now completed otto overreacted to the extent that he let his drop goin didnt react much but his smooth and habitually bland face took a wary expression that was quite foreign to it heissman said incredulously a government agent a secret service youve got your countries mixed up government agents work for the u s treasury not the british one im just a civil servant and ive never fired a pistol in my life far less carry one i have as much official power as a postman or a whitehall clerk no more thats why im asking for cooperation i looked at otto thats why im offering you what i regard as the courtesy of a prior consultation investigations clearly id lost otto at least half a minute previously what kind of investigations and how does it come that a man hired as doctor otto broke off shaking his head in the classic manner of one baffled beyond all hope of illumination how do you think it came that none of the seven other applicants for the post of medical officers turned up for an interview they dont teach us much about manners in medical school but were not as rude as that shall we go goin said calmly i think otto that we should hear what he has to say i think id like to hear what you have to say too conrad said he was one of the very few in the cabin who wasnt looking at me as if i were some creature from outer space im sure you would however im afraid youll have to remain but i would like a private word with you if i may i turned without waiting for an answer and made for my cubicle otto barred my way theres nothing you can have to say to charles that you cant say to all of us how do you know i brushed roughly by him and closed the door when conrad entered the cubicle i said i dont want you to come for two reasons if our friends arrive they may miss me down at the jetty and come straight hereid like you in that case to tell them where i am more importantly id like you to keep an eye on jungbeck if he tries to leave try to reason with him if he wont listen to reason let him goabout three feet if you can kind of naturally happen to have a full bottle of scotch or suchlike in your hand at the time then clobber him with all you have not on the headthat would kill him on the shoulder close in to the neck youll probably break the odd bone in any event it will surely incapacitate him conrad didnt as much as raise an eyebrow he said i can see why you dont bother with guns socially and otherwise i said a bottle of scotch is a great leveller id taken a coleman storm lantern along with me and now hung it on a rung of the vertical iron ladder leading down from the conning tower to the interior of the submarine mockup its harsh glare threw that icily dank metallic tomb into a weirdly heterogeneous melange of dazzling white and inkily black geometrical patterns while the others watched me in a far from friendly silence i unscrewed one of the wooden floor battens lifted and placed a ballast bar on top of the compressor and scraped at the surface with the blade of my knife you will observe i said to otto that i am not making a production of this prologues dispensed with we arrive at the point without waste of time i closed my knife and inspected the handiwork it had wrought all that glitters is not gold but does this look like toffee to you i looked at them each in turn clearly it didnt look like toffee to any of them a total lack of reaction a total lack of surprise i put my knife back in my pocket and smiled at the stiffening attitudes of three out of the four of them scouts honour we civil servants never carry guns and why should there be surprise even at the fact of my knowledgeall four of you have been perfectly well aware for some time that i am not what i was engaged to be and why should any of you express surprise at the sight of this goldafter all that was the only reason for your coming to bear island in the first place they said nothing curiously enough they werent even looking at me they were all looking at the gold ingot as if it were vastly more important than i was which from their point of view was probably a perfectly understandable priority preference dear me dear me i said where are all the instant denials the holierthanthou clutching of the hearts the outraged cries of what in gods name are you talking about i would think wouldnt you that the unbiassed observer would find this negative reaction every bit as incriminating as a written confession i looked at them with what might have been interpreted as an encouraging expression but againapart from heissmans apparently finding it necessary to lubricate his lower lip with the tip of his tonguei elicited no response so i went on it was as even your defending counsel will have to admit in court a clever and wellthoughtout scheme would any of you care to tell me what the scheme was it is my opinion dr marlowe otto said magisterially that the strain of the past few days has made you mentally unbalanced not a bad reaction at all i said approvingly unfortunately youre about two minutes too late in coming up with it no volunteers to set the scene then do we suffer from an excess of modesty or just a lack of cooperation wouldnt you for instance mr goin care to say a few words after all you are in my debt without me without our dramatic little confrontation youd have been dead before the week was out i think mr gerran is right goin said in that measured voice he knew so well how to use me about to die he shook his head the strain for you must have been intolerable under such circumstances as a medical man you should know that a persons imagination can easily imagination am i imagining this fortypound gold ingot i pointed to the ballast bars below the battens am i imagining those other fifteen ingots there am i imagining the hundredodd ingots piled in a rock shelf inside the perleporten am i imagining the fact that your total lack of reaction to the word perleporten demonstrates beyond question that you all know what perleporten is where it is and what its significance is am i imagining the scores of other leadsheathed ingots still under water in the perleporten lets stop playing silly little games for your own game is up as i say quite a clever little game while it lasted what better cover for a bullionrecovery trip to the arctic than a film unitafter all film people are widely regarded as being eccentric to the extent of being lunatic so that even their most ludicrous behaviour is accepted as being normal within its own abnormal context what better time to set out to achieve the recovery of this bullion than when there are only a few hours daylight so that the recovery operation can be carried out through the long hours of darkness what better way of bringing the bullion back to britain than by switching it with this vessels ballast so that it can be slipped into the country under the eyes of the customs authorities i surveyed the ballast four tons according to this splendid brochure that mr heissman wrote id put it nearer five say ten million dollars justifies a trip to even an outoftheway resort like bear island id say wouldnt you they wouldnt say anything by and by i went on youd probably have manufactured some excuse for towing this vessel down to perleporten so as to make the transshipment of the gold all that easier and then heighho for merry england and the just enjoyment of the fruits of your labours could i he wrong no otto was very calm youre right but i think youd find it very hard to make a criminal case out of this what could we possibly be charged with theft ridiculous finders keepers finders keepers a few miserable tons of gold your ambitions are only paltry youre only swimming the surface of the available loot isnt that so heissman they all looked at heissman heissman in turn didnt appear particularly anxious to look at anyone why do you silly people think im here i said why do you think that in spite of the elaborate smoke screen you set up that the british government not only knew that you were going to bear island but also knew that your purpose in going there was not as advertised dont you know that in certain matters european governments cooperate very closely dont you know that most of them share a keen interest in the activities of johann heissman for what you dont know is that most of them know a great deal more about johann heissman than you do perhaps heissman youd like to tell them yourselfstarting shall we say with the thirtyodd years youve been working for the soviet government otto stared at heissman his huge jowls seeming to fall apart goins facial muscles tightened until the habitual smooth blandness had vanished from his face the counts expression didnt change he just nodded slowly as if understanding at last the solution of a longstanding problem heissman looked acutely unhappy well i said as heissman doesnt appear to have any intention of telling anyone anything i suppose that leaves it up to me heissman here is a remarkably gifted specialist in an extremely specialised field he is purely and simply a treasurehunter and theres no one in the business who can hold a candle to him but he doesnt just hunt for the type of treasure that you people think he does i fear he may have been deceiving you on this point as indeed he has been deceiving you on another i refer to the fact that a precondition of his cutting you into a share of the loot was that his niece mary stuart be employed by olympus productions having the nasty and suspicious minds that you do you probably and rapidly arrived at the conclusion that she wasnt his niece at allwhich she isntand was along for some other purposes which she is but not for the purposes which your nasty and suspicious minds attributed to her for heissman miss stuart was essential for the achievement of an entirely different purpose which he kind of forgot to tell you about miss stuarts father you have to understand was just as unscrupulous and unprincipled a rogue as any of you he held very senior positions in both the german navy and the nazi party and like others similarly placed used his power to feather his own nestjust as hermann goering didwhen the war was seen to be lost although he was smarter than goering and managed to get out from under before the war criminal roundup the gold although this will probably never be proved almost certainly came from the vaults of norwegian banks and a man with all the resources of the german navy behind him would have had no trouble in choosing such a splendidly isolated spot as perleporten in bear island and having the stuff transferred there probably by submarine not that it matters but it wasnt just the gold that was transported to perleporten which is why mary stuart is here feathers werent enough for dads nest nothing less than swansdown would do the swansdown almost certainly took the form of either bank bonds or securities probably obtainedi wouldnt say purchasedin the late s such securities are perfectly redeemable even today an attempt was recently made to sell worth of such securities through foreign exchanges but the west german federal bank wouldnt play ball because proper owner identification was lacking but there wouldnt be any problem about owner identification this time would there heissman heissman didnt say whether there would or there wouldnt and where are they i said nicely welded up on a dummy steel ingot as he still wasnt being very forthcoming i went on no matter well have them and then youre never going to have the pleasure of seeing mary stuarts father put his signature and fingerprints on those documents and of checking that they match up youre sure of that heissman said he bad recovered his normal degree of composure which meant that he was very composed indeed in a changing world like ours who can be sure of anything but with that proviso yes i think youve overlooked something i have yes we have admiral hanneman thats miss stuarts fathers true name you didnt even know that no its of no relevance and no i havent overlooked that fact i shall attend to that matter shortly after i have attended to your friends maybe thats the wrong word maybe theyre not your friends any more i mean they dont look particularly friendly do they monstrous otto shouted absolutely monstrous unforgivable diabolical our own partner he spluttered into an outraged silence despicable goin said coldly absolutely contemptible isnt it i said tell me does this moral indignation stem from this revelation of the depths of heissmans perfidy or merely because he omitted to cut you in on the proceeds of the cashing of the securities dont bother answering that question its purely rhetorical as villains youre dyed in the same inky black as heissman what i mean is most of you spend a great deal of time and careful thought in concealing from the other members of the board of olympus productions just what the true natures of your activities are heissman is hardly alone in this respect take the count here compared to the rest of you he was a vestal angel but even he dabbled in some murky waters for over thirty years now hes been a member of the board and has had a free meal ticket for life because he happened to be in vienna when the anschluss came when otto headed for the states and heissman was spirited away heissman was spirited away because otto bad arranged for him to be so that he could take all the film companys capital out of the country otto was never a man to hesitate when it came to selling a friend down the river what otto didnt know but what the count did but carefully refrained from telling him was that heissmans disappearance had been entirely voluntary heissman had been a german secret agent for some time and his adopted country needed him what his adopted country didnt know was that russia had adopted him even before they had but this isnt germane to the main point that otto believed he had betrayed a friend for gold and that the count knew it unfortunately its going to be very hard to prove anything against the count and not being a grasping man by nature never asked for anything more than his salary theres nothing to demonstrate blackmail which is why ive chosen himand hes accepted as the person to turn queens evidence against his fellow directors on the board heissman now joined otto and goin in giving the count the kind of look they had so lately given him or take otto i went on for years hed been embezzling very large sums of money from the company virtually bleeding it white it was now the turn of heissman and the count to stare at otto or take goin he discovered about the embezzling and for two or three years hes been blackmailing otto and bleeding him white in sum you constitute the most unpleasant unprincipled and depraved bunch its ever been my misfortune to encounter but i havent even scratched the surface of your infamy have i or the infamy of one of you we havent even discussed the person responsible for the violent deaths that have taken place he is of course one of you he is of course quite quite mad and will end his days in broadmoor although i have to admit that theres been a certain far from crazy logic in his thinking and actions but a prison for the insaneone regrets the abolition of the death penaltyis a certainty it may well be otto as well as being the best you can hope for that you wont live long after you get there otto said nothing the expression on his face remained unchanged i went on for your hired killers of course jungbeck and heyter there will be life sentences in maximum security gaols the temperature in that icily cold metallic tomb had fallen to many degrees below freezing point but everyone appeared to be completely unaware of the fact the classic example of mind over matter and heaven knew that the minds could rarely have been more exclusively and almost obsessively possessed than those of the men in those weird and alien surroundings otto gerran is an evil man i said and the enormity of his crimes scarcely within the bounds of comprehension however one has to admit that he has had the most singularly wretched luck in his choice of business associates and those associates must be held partly to blame for the terrible events that happened for their extraordinary cupidity and selfishness drove otto into a comer from which he could escape only by resorting to the most desperate measures we have already established that three of you here have been black mailing otto steadily over the years his other two fellow directors his daughter and stryker joined wholeheartedly in what had become by this time a very popular pastime they however used a very different basis for their blackmail this basis i cannot as yet prove but the facts i believe will be established in time the facts are concerned with a car crash that took place in california over twenty years ago there were two cars involved one of those belonged to lonnie gilbert and had three women insidehis wife and two daughters all of whom appeared to be considerably the worse for drink at the time the other car belonged to the strykersbut the strykers were not in their car the two people who were bad like lonnies family been at the same party in the strykers house and like lonnies family were in an advanced state of intoxication they were otto and neal divine isnt that so otto theres nothing of this rubbish that can be proved not yet now otto was driving the car but when divine recovered from the effects of the crash he was convincedno doubt by ottothat he had been at the wheel so for years now divine has been under the impression that he owes his immunity from manslaughter charges purely to ottos silence the salary lists show where did you get the salary lists from goin asked from your cubiclewhere i also found this splendid bankbook of yours the lists show that divine has been receiving only a pittance in salary for years how admirable is our otto he not only makes a man take the responsibility for deaths which he himself has caused but in the process reduces that man to the level of a serf and a pauper the blackmailed doing some blackmailing on his own account makes for a very pretty picture all round does it not but the strykers knew who had really caused the crash for otto had been driving when they left the house so they sold their silence in return for jobs on the board of olympus productions and vastly inflated salaries you are a lovable lovable lot arent you do you know that this fat monster here actually tried to have lonnie murdered tonight why because judith haynes very shortly before she died had told lonnie the truth of what had happened in the car crash so of course lonnie would have been a danger to otto as long as he had lived i dont know who suggested this film expedition as a cover for getting the bullion heissman i suppose not that it matters what matters is that otto saw in this proposed trip a unique and probably never to be repeated opportunity to solve all his troubles at one stroke the solution was simple eliminate all his five partners including his daughter whom he hated as much as she hated him so he gets himself two guns for hire heyter and jungbeckno question about the hire aspect i found two thousand pounds in fivepound notes in jungbecks case this afternoon two alleged actors of whom no one but otto had ever heard in effect otto would clear his board in one fell sweep hed get rid of the people he hated and who hated him hed buy enough time by their deaths to conceal his embezzlement hed collect very considerable insurance money and get back in the black with the help of accommodating accountants who can be as venal as the next lot he would get all that lovely gold for himself and above all hed be forever free of the continuous blackmail that had dominated his life and warped his mind until it drove him over the edge of insanity i looked at goin do you understand now what i mean by saying that without me youd have been dead by the end of the week yes yes i think so i have no option other than to believe you are right he looked at otto in a kind of wonder but if he was only after the board of directors why should others die iii luck ill management or someone just got in his way the first intended victim was the count and this was where the ill luck came in not the countsantonios otto as i think digging into his past will show is a man of many parts among some of the more esoteric skills acquired were some relating to either chemistry or medicine otto is at home with poisons he is also as so many very fat men are extremely gifted at palming articles at the table on the night when antonio died the food as usual was served from the side table at the top of the main table where otto sat otto introduced some aconiteonly a pinch was necessaryinto the horseradish on the plate intended for the count unfortunately for poor antonio the count has a profound dislike of horseradish and passed his on to the vegetarian antonio and so antonio died he tried to poison heissman at the same time but heissman wasnt feeling in the best of form that evening were you heissmanyou will recall that you left the table in a great hurry your plate untouched the economical haggerty instead of consigning this clearly untouched plate to the gash bucket put it back in the casserole from which the two stewards scott and moxen were served later that nightand from which the duke stole a few surreptitious mouthfuls three became very ill two died all through ill luck arent you overlooking the fact that otto himself was poisoned the count said sure he was by his own band to obviate any suspicion that might fall on him he didnt use aconite thoughall that was required was some relatively harmless emetic and some acting this incidentally was why otto sent me off on a tour of the morning rosenot to check on seasickness but to see who else he might have poisoned by accident his reaction when he heard of antonios death was unnaturally violentthough i didnt get the significance at the time matters took another tragic turn later that evening two people came to check my cabin in my absenceone was either jungbeck or heyter and the other was halliday i looked at heissman he was your man wasnt he heissman nodded silently heissman was suspicious of me he wanted to check on my bona fides and examined my caseshad them examined rather by halliday otto was suspicious and one of his hired men discovered that id been reading an article about aconite one death more or less wasnt going to mean much to otto now so he planned to eliminate me using his favourite eliminatorpoison in a bottle of scotch unfortunately for halliday who had come to see if he could lay hands on the medical case that id taken up to the saloon he drank the nightcap intended for me the other deaths are easy to explain when the party was searching for smithy jungbeck and heyter clobbered allen and killed stryker in this clumsy attempt to frame allen and during the night otto arranged for the execution of his own daughter he was on watch with jungbeck and the murder could only have occurred during that time i looked at otto you should have checked on your daughters windowid screwed it shut so that it was impossible for anyone to have entered from the outside id also found that a hypodermic and a phial of morphine had been stolen you dont have to admit any of thisboth jungbeck and heyter will sing like canaries i admit everything otto spoke with a massive calm you are correct in every detail not that i see that any of it is going to do you any good id said that he was an artist in palming things and he proceeded to prove it the very unpleasantlooking little black automatic that he held in his hand just seemed to have materialised there i dont see that thats going to do you any good either i said after all youve just admitted that youre guilty of everything i claimed you were i was standing directly under the conning tower hatchway where id deliberately and advisedly positioned myself as soon as wed arrived and i could see things that otto couldnt where do you think the morning rose is now what was that i didnt much like the way his pudgy little hand tightened round the butt of his gun she never went farther than tunheim where there have been people up there waiting to hear from me true they couldnt hear by direct radio contact because youd had one of your hard men smash the trawlers transceiver hadnt you but before the morning rose left here id left aboard a radio device that tunes into a radio homer they had clear instructions as to what to do the moment that device was actuated by the homer transmitter its been transmitting for almost ninety minutes now there are armed soldiers and police officers of both norway and britain aboard that trawler rather they were theyre aboard this vessel now please take my word for it otherwise we have useless bloodshed otto didnt take my word for it he stepped forward quickly raising his gun as he peered up towards the conning tower unfortunately for otto he was standing in a brightly lit spot while peering up into the darkness the sound of a shot hurtful to the ears in that enclosed space came at the same instant as his scream of pain followed by a metallic clunk as the gun falling from his bloodied hand struck a bar of bullion im sorry i said you didnt give me time to tell you that they were specially picked soldiers four men descended into the body of the vessel two were in civilian clothes two in norwegian army uniforms one of the civilians said to me dr marlowe i nodded and he went on inspector matthewson this is inspector nielsen it looks as if we were on time yes thank you they werent in time to save antonio and halliday the two stewards judith haynes and her husband but that was entireiy my fault you were very prompt indeed weve been here for some time we actually saw you go below we came ashore by rubber dinghy from the outside north of makehl captain imrie didnt much fancy coming up the sorhamna at night i dont think he sees too well but i do the harsh voice came from above drop that gun drop it or ill kill you heyters voice carried utter conviction there was only one person carrying a gun the soldier who had shot otto and he dropped it without hesitation at a sharp word from the norwegian inspector heyter climbed down into the hull his eyes watchful his gun moving in a slight arc well done heyter well done otto moaned from the pain of his shattered hand well done i said you want to be responsible for another death you want this to be the last thing heyter ever does well or not too late for words ottos puce face had turned grey the blood was dripping steadily on to the gold too late too late you fool i knew that heyter was mobile youd forgotten i was a doctor even if not much of a one hed a badly cut ankle inside a thick leather boot that could only have been caused by a compound fracture there was no such fracture a sprained ankle doesnt cut the skin open a selfinflicted injury as in killing stryker so in killing smith a crude and total lack of imagination you did kill him didnt you heyter yes he turned his gun on me i like killing people put that gun down or youre a dead man he swore at me viciously and in contempt and was still swearing when the red rose bloomed in the centre of his forehead the count lowered his beretta dark smoke still wisping from its muzzle and said apologetically well i was a polish count but we do get out of practice you know i can see that i said a rotten shot but i guess its worth a royal pardon at that on the jetty the police inspectors insisted on handcuffing goin heissman and even the wounded otto i persuaded them that the count was not a danger and further persuaded them to let me have a word with heissman while they made their way up to the cabin when we were alone i said the water in the harbour there is below the normally accepted freezing point with those heavy clothes and your wrists handcuffed behind your back youll be dead in thirty seconds thats the advantage of being a doctor one can be fairly definite about those things i took him by the arm and pushed him towards the edge of the jetty he said in a bighstrained voice you had heyter deliberately killed didnt you of course didnt you knowtheres no death penalty in england now up here theres no problem goodbye heissman i swear it i swear it his voice was now close to a scream ill have mary stuarts parents released and safely reunited i swear it i swear it its your life heissman yes he shivered violently and it wasnt because of the bitter wind yes i know that the atmosphere in the cabin was extraordinarily quiet and subdued it stemmed i suppose from that reaction which is the inevitable concomitant of profound and still as yet unbelieving relief matthewson clearly had been explaining things jungbeck was lying on the floor his right hand clutching his left shoulder and moaning as in great pain i looked at conrad who looked at the fallen man and then pointed to the broken shards of glass on the floor i did as you asked he said im afraid the bottle broke im sorry about that i said the scotch i mean i looked at mary darling who was sobbing bitterly and at mary stuart who was trying to comfort her and looked only fractionally less unhappy i said reprovingly tears idle tears my two marys its all over now lonnies dead big blurred eyes staring miserably from behind huge glasses five minutes ago he just died im sorry i said but no tears for lonnie his words not mine he hates him much that would upon the rack of this tough world stretch him out longer she looked at me uncomprehendingly did he say that no chap called kent he said something else mary stuart said he said we were to tell the kindly healeri suppose he meant youto bring his penny to toss for the first round of drinks in some bar i didnt understand a fourale bar it wouldnt have been in purgatory purgatory oh i dont know it didnt make any sense to me it makes sense to me i said i wont forget my penny the end
