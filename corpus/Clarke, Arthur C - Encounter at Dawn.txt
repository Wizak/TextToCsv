encoutner at dawn originally published as encounter in the dawn by ziff davis publishing co arthur c clarke it was in the last days of the empire the tiny ship was far from home and almost a hundred lightyears from the great parent vessel searching through the loosely packed stars at the rim of the milky way but even here it could not escape from the shadow that lay across civilization beneath that shadow pausing ever and again in their work to wonder how their distant homes were faring the scientists of the galactic survey still labored at their neverending task the ship held only three occupants but between them they carried knowledge of many sciences and the experience of half a lifetime in space after the long interstellar night the star ahead was warming their spirits as they dropped down toward its fires a little more golden a trifle more brilliant than the sun that now seemed a legend of their childhood they knew from past experience that the chance of locating planets here was more than ninety per cent and for the moment they forgot all else in the excitement of discovery they found the first planet within minutes of coming to rest it was a giant of a familiar type too cold for protoplasmic life and probably possessing no stable surface so they turned their search sunward and presently were rewarded it was a world that made their hearts ache for home a world where everything was hauntingly familiar yet never quite the same two great land masses floated in bluegreen seas capped by ice at either pole there were some desert regions but the larger part of the planet was obviously fertile even from this distance the signs of vegetation were unmistakably clear they gazed hungrily at the expanding landscape as they fell down into the atmosphere heading toward noon in the subtropics the ship plummeted through cloudless skies toward a great river checked its fall with a surge of soundless power and came to rest among the long grasses by the waters edge no one moved there was nothing to be done until the automatic instruments had finished their work then a bell tinkled softly and the lights on the control board flashed in a pattern of meaningful chaos captain altman rose to his feet with a sigh of relief were in luck he said we can go outside without protection if the pathogenic tests are satisfactory what did you make of the place as we came in bertrond geologically stableno active volcanoes at least i didnt see any trace of cities but that proves nothing if theres a civilization here it may have passed that stage or not reached it yet bertrond shrugged eithers just as likely it may take us some time to find out on a planet this size more time than weve got said clindar glancing at the communications panel that linked them to the mother ship and thence to the galaxys threatened heart for a moment there was a gloomy silence then clindar walked to the control board and pressed a pattern of keys with automatic skill with a slight jar a section of the hull slid aside and the fourth member of the crew stepped out onto the new planet flexing metal limbs and adjusting servo motors to the unaccustomed gravity inside the ship a television screen glimmered into life revealing a long vista of waving grasses some trees in the middle distance and a glimpse of the great river clindar punched a button and the picture flowed steadily across the screen as the robot turned its head which way shall we go clindar asked lets have a look at those trees altman replied if theres any animal life well find it there look cried bertrond a bird clindars fingers flew over the keyboard the picture centered on the tiny speck that had suddenly appeared on the left of the screen and expanded rapidly as the robots telephoto lens came into action youre right he said feathersbeakwell up the evolutionary ladder this place looks promising ill start the camera the swaying motion of the picture as the robot walked forward did not distract them they had grown accustomed to it long ago but they had never become reconciled to this exploration by proxy when all their impulses cried out to them to leave the ship to run through the grass and to feel the wind blowing against their faces yet it was too great a risk to take even on a world that seemed as fair as this there was always a skull hidden behind natures most smiling face wild beasts poisonous reptiles quagmiresdeath could come to the unwary explorer in a thousand disguises and worst of all were the invisible enemies the bacteria and viruses against which the only defense might often be a thousand light years away a robot could laugh at all these dangers and even if as sometimes happened it encountered a beast powerful enough to destroy itwell machines could always be replaced they met nothing on the walk across the grasslands if any small animals were disturbed by the robots passage they kept outside its field of vision clindar slowed the machine as it approached the trees and the watchers in the spaceship flinched involuntarily at the branches that appeared to slash across their eyes the picture dimmed for a moment before the controls readjusted themselves to the weaker illumination then it came back to normal the forest was full of life it lurked in the undergrowth clambered among the branches flew through the air it red chattering and gibbering through the trees as the robot advanced and all the while the automatic cameras were recording the pictures that formed on the screen gathering material for the biologists to analyze when the ship returned to base clindar breathed a sigh of relief when the trees suddenly thinned it was exhausting work keeping the robot from smashing into obstacles as it moved through the forest but on open ground it could take care of itself thn the picture trembled as if beneath a hammerblow there was a grinding metallic thud and the whole scene swept vertiginously upward as the robot toppled and fell whats that cried altman did you trip no said clindar grimly his fingers flying over the keyboard something attacked from the rear i hope ah ive still got control he brought the robot to a sitting position and swiveled its head it did not take long to find the cause of the trouble standing a few feet away and lashing its tail angrily was a large quadruped with a most ferocious set of teeth at the moment it was fairly obviously trying to decide whether to attack again slowly the robot rose to its feet and as it did so the great beast crouched to spring a smile flitted across clindars face he knew how to deal with this situation his thumb felt for the seldomused key labeled siren the forest echoed with a hideous undulating scream from the robots concealed speaker and the machine advanced to meet its adversary arms flailing in front of it the startled beast almost fell over backward in its effort to turn and in seconds was gone from sight now i suppose well have to wait a couple of hours until everything comes out of hiding again said bertrond ruefully i dont know much about animal psychology interjected altman but is it usual for them to attack something completely unfamiliar some will attack anything that moves but thats unusual normally they attack only for food or if theyve already been threatened what are you driving at do you suggest that there are other robots on this planet certainly not but our carnivorous friend may have mistaken our machine for a more edible biped dont you think that this opening in the jungle is rather unnatural it could easily be a path in that case said clindar promptly well follow it and find out im tired of dodging trees but i hope nothing jumps on us again its bad for my nerves you were right altman said bertrond a little later its certainly a path but that doesnt mean intelligence after all animals he stopped in midsentence and at the same instant clindar brought the advancing robot to a halt the path had suddenly opened out into a wide clearing almost completely occupied by a village of flimsy huts it was ringed by a wooden palisade obviously defense against an enemy who at the moment presented no threat for the gates were wide open and beyond them the inhabitants were going peacefully about their ways for many minutes the three explorers stared in silence at the screen then clindar shivered a little and remarked its uncanny it might be our own planet a hundred thousand years ago i feel as if ive gone back in time theres nothing weird about it said the practical altman after all weve discovered nearly a hundred planets with our type of life on them yes retorted clindar a hundred in the whole galaxy i still think its strange it had to happen to us well it had to happen to somebody said bertrond philosophically meanwhile we must work out our contact procedure if we send the robot into the village it will start a panic that said altman is a masterly understatement what well have to do is catch a native by himself and prove that were friendly hide the robot clindar somewhere in the woods where it can watch the village without being spotted weve a weeks practical anthropology ahead of us it was three days before the biological tests showed that it would be safe to leave the ship even then bertrond insisted on going alonealone that is if one ignored the substantial company of the robot with such an ally he was not afraid of this planets larger beasts and his bodys natural defenses could take care of the microorganisms so at least the analyzers had assured him and considering the complexity of the problem they made remarkably few mistakes he stayed outside for an hour enjoying himself cautiously while his companions watched with envy it would be another three days before they could be quite certain that it was safe to follow bertronds example meanwhile they kept busy enough watching the village through the lenses of the robot and recording everything they could with the cameras they had moved the spaceship at night so that it was hidden in the depths of the forest for they did not wish to be discovered until they were ready and all the while the news from home grew worse though their remoteness here at the edge of the universe deadened its impact it lay heavily on their minds and sometimes overwhelmed them with a sense of futility at any moment they knew the signal for recall might come as the empire summoned up its last resources in its extremity but until then they would continue their work as though pure knowledge were the only thing that mattered seven days after landing they were ready to make the experiment they knew now what paths the villagers used when going hunting and bertrond chose one of the less frequented ways then he placed a chair firmly in the middle of the path and settled down to read a book it was not of course quite as simple as that bertrond had takenall imaginable precautions hidden in the undergrowth fifty yards away the robot was watching through its telescopic lenses and in its hand it held a small but deadly weapon controlling it from the spaceship his fingers poised over the keyboard clindar waited to do what might be necessary that was the negative side of the plan the positive side was more obvious lying at bertronds feet was the carcass of a small homed animal which he hoped would be an acceptable gift to any hunter passing this way two hours later the radio in his suit harness whispered a warning quite calmly though the blood was pounding in his veins bertrond laid aside his book and looked down the trail the savage was walking forward confidently enough swinging a spear in his right hand he paused for a moment when he saw bertrond then advanced more cautiously he could tell that there was nothing to fear for the stranger was slightly built and obviously unarmed when only twenty feet separated them bertrond gave a reassuring smile and rose slowly to his feet he bent down picked up the carcass and carried it forward as an offering the gesture would have been understood by any creature on any world and it was understood here the savage reached forward took the animal and threw it effortlessly over his shoulder for an instant he stared into bertronds eyes with a fathomless expression then he turned and walked back toward the village three times he glanced round to see if bertrond was following and each time bertrond smiled and waved reassurance the whole episode lasted little more than a minute as the first contact between two races it was completely without drama though not without dignity bertrond did not move until the other had vanished from sight then he relaxed and spoke into his suit microphone that was a pretty good beginning he said jubilantly he wasnt in the least frightened or even suspicious i think hell be back it still seems too good to be true said altmans voice in his ear i should have thought hed have been either scared or hostile would you have accepted a lavish gift from a peculiar stranger with such little fuss bertrond was slowly walking back to the ship the robot had now come out of cover and was keeping guard a few paces behind him i wouldnt he replied but i belong to a civilized community complete savages may react to strangers in many different ways according to their past experience suppose this tribe has never had any enemies thats quite possible on a large but sparsely populated planet then we may expect curiosity but no fear at all if these people have no enemies put in clindar no longer fully occupied in controlling the robot why have they got a stockade round the village i meant no human enemies replied bertrond if thats true it simplifies our task immensely do you think hell come back of course if hes as human as i think curiosity and greed will make him return in a couple of days well be bosom friends looked at dispassionately it became a fantastic routine every morning the robot would go hunting under clindars direction until it was now the deadliest killer in the jungle then bertrond would wait until yaanwhich was the nearest they could get to his namecame striding confidently along the path he came at the same time every day and he always came alone they wondered about this did he wish to keep his great discovery to himself and thus get all the credit for his hunting prowess if so it showed unexpected foresight and cunning at first yaan had departed at once with his prize as if afraid that the donor of such a generous gift might change his mind soon however as bertrond had hoped he could be induced to stay for a while by simple conjuring tricks and a display of brightly colored fabrics and crystals in which he took a childlike delight at last bertrond was able to engage him in lengthy conversations all of which were recorded as well as being filmed through the eyes of the hidden robot one day the philologists might be able to analyze this material the best that bertrond could do was to discover the meanings of a few simple verbs and nouns this was made more difficult by the fact that yaan not only used different words for the same thing but sometimes the same word for different things between these daily interviews the ship traveled far surveying the planet from the air and sometimes landing for more detailed examinations although several other human settlements were observed bertrond made no attempt to get in touch with them for it was easy to see that they were all at much the same cultural level as yaans people it was bertrond often thought a particularly bad joke on the part of fate that one of the galaxys very few truly human races should have been discovered at this moment of time not long ago this would have been an event of supreme importance now civilization was too hardpressed to concern itself with these savage cousins waiting at the dawn of history not until bertrond was sure he had become part of yaans everyday life did he introduce him to the robot he was showing yaan the patterns in a kaleidoscope when clindar brought the machine striding through the grass with its latest victim dangling across one metal arm for the first time yaan showed something akin to fear but he relaxed at bertronds soothing words though he continued to watch the advancing monster it halted some distance away and bertrond walked forward to meet it as he did so the robot raised its arms and handed him the dead beast he took it solemnly and carried it back to yaan staggering a little under the unaccustomed load bertrond would have given a great deal to know just what yaan was thinking as he accepted the gift was he trying to decide whether the robot was master or slave perhaps such conceptions as this were beyond his grasp to him the robot might be merely another man a hunter who was a friend of bertrond clindars voice slightly larger than life came from the robots speaker its astonishing how calmly he accepts us wont anything scare him you will keep judging him by your own standards replied bertrond remember his psychology is completely different and much simpler now that he has confidence in me anything that i accept wont worry him i wonder if that will be true of all his race queried altman its hardly safe to judge by a single specimen i want to see what happens when we send the robot into the village hello exclaimed bertrond that surprised him hes never met a person who could speak with two voices before do you think hell guess the truth when he meets us said clindar no the robot will be pure magic to himbut it wont be any more wonderful than fire and lightning and all the other forces he must already take for granted well whats the next move asked altman a little impatiently are you going to bring him to the ship or will you go into the village first bertrond hesitated im anxious not to do too much too quickly you know the accidents that have happened with strange races when thats been tried ill let him think this over and when we get back tomorrow ill try to persuade him to take the robot back to the village in the hidden ship clindar reactivated the robot and started it moving again like altman he was growing a little impatient of this excessive caution but on all matters relating to alien lifeforms bertrond was the expert and they had to obey his orders there were times now when he almost wished he were a robot himself devoid of feelings or emotions able to watch the fall of a leaf or the death agonies of a world with equal detachment the sun was low when yaan heard the great voice crying from the jungle he recognized it at once despite its inhuman volume it was the voice of his friend and it was calling him in the echoing silence the life of the village came to a stop even the children ceased their play the only sound was the thin cry of a baby frightened by the sudden silence all eyes were upon yaan as he walked swiftly to his hut and grasped the spear that lay beside the entrance the stockade would soon be closed against the prowlers of the night but he did not hesitate as he stepped out into the lengthening shadows he was passing through the gates when once again that mighty voice summoned him and now it held a note of urgency that came clearly across all the barriers of language and culture the shining giant who spoke with many voices met him a little way from the village and beckoned him to follow there was no sign of bertrond they walked for almost a mile before they saw him in the distance standing not far from the rivers edge and staring out across the dark slowly moving waters he turned as yaan approached yet for a moment seemed unaware of his presence then he gave a gesture of dismissal to the shining one who withdrew into the distance yaan waited he was patient and though he could never have expressed it in words contented when he was with bertrond he felt the first intimations of that selfless utterly irrational devotion his race would not fully achieve for many ages it was a strange tableau here at the rivers brink two men were standing one was dressed in a closelyfitting uniform equipped with tiny intricate mechanisms the other was wearing the skin of an animal and was carrying a flinttipped spear ten thousand generations lay between them ten thousand generations and an immeasurable gulf of space yet they were both human as she must do often in eternity nature had repeated one of her basic patterns presently bertrond began to speak walking to and fro in short quick steps as he did and in his voice there was a trace of madness its all over yaan id hoped that with our knowledge we could have brought you out of barbarism in a dozen generations but now you will have to fight your way up from the jungle alone and it may take you a million years to do so im sorrytheres so much we could have done even now i wanted to stay here but altman and clindar talk of duty and i suppose that they are right there is little enough that we can do but our world is calling and we must not forsake it i wish you could understand me yaan i wish you knew what was saying im leaving you these tools some of them you will discover how to use though as likely as not in a generation theyll be lost or forgotten see how this blade cuts it will be ages before your world can make its like and guard this well when you press the buttonlook if you use it sparingly it will give you light for years though sooner or later it will die as for these other things find what use for them you can here come the first stars up there in the east do you ever look at the stars yaan i wonder how long it will be before you have discovered what they are and i wonder what will have happened to us by then those stars are our homes yaan and we cannot save them many have died already in explosions so vast that i can imagine them no more than you in a hundred thousand of your years the light of those funeral pyres will reach your world and set its peoples wondering by then perhaps your race will be reaching for the stars i wish i could warn you against the mistakes we made and which now will cost us all that we have won it is well for your people yaan that your world is here at the frontier of the universe you may escape the doom that waits for us one day perhaps your ships will go searching among the stars as we have done and they may come upon the ruins of our worlds and wonder who we were but they will never know that we met here by this river when your race was young here come my friends they would give me no more time goodby yaanuse well the things i have left you they are your worlds greatest treasures something huge something that glittered in the starlight was sliding down from the sky it did not reach the ground but came to rest a little way above the surface and in utter silence a rectangle of light opened in its side the shining giant appeared out of the night and stepped through the golden door bertrond followed pausing for a moment at the threshold to wave back at yaan then the darkness closed behind him no more swiftly than smoke drifts upward from a fire the ship lifted away when it was so small that yaan felt he could hold it in his hands it seemed to blur into a long line of light slanting upward into the stars from the empty sky a peal of thunder echoed over the sleeping land and yaan knew at last that the gods were gone and would never come again for a long time he stood by the gently moving waters and into his soul there came a sense of loss he was never to forget and never to understand then carefully and reverently he collected together the gifts that bertrond had left under the stars the lonely figure walked homeward across a nameless land behind him the river flowed softly to the sea winding through the fertile plains on which more than a thousand centuries ahead yaans descendants would build the great city they were to call babylon
