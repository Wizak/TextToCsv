 chapter one a weeks holiday wheres the map said julian is that it george good now where shall we spread it on the floor said anne a map is always easiest to read on the floor ill push the table out of the way well be careful for goodness sake said george fathers in his study and you know what happened before when someone pushed the table right over everyone laughed georges father so often came pouncing out of his study if any sudden noise was made when he was working the table was pushed out of the way and the big map unfolded and spread out over the floor timmy was surprised to see the four children kneeling down around it and barked imagining this was some kind of new game be quiet timmy said dick youve got into trouble once this morning already for making a row and stop brushing my face with your tail wuff said timmy and lay down heavily on the map get up idiot said dick dont you know were in a hurry we want to trace our route to billycock hill billycock hill what a lovely name said anne is that where were going yes said julian poring over the map its near some caves we want to see and theres a butterfly farm not far off and a butterfly farm said george surprised whatevers that just what it sounds like said dick a farm for butterflies toby a friend of ours at school told me about it he lives quite near it and he says its a most interesting place they breed butterflies and moths too from eggs and sell them to collectors do they really said anne well i must say i used to enjoy keeping caterpillars and seeing what they turned into it was like magic to see a lovely butterfly or moth creep out of the chrysalis but a farm for them can we really go and see it oh yes toby says the men who run it are very decent about showing anyone round said julian apparently billycock hill is a good place for rare butterflies too thats why theyve got their farm there they rush about with nets half the time and at night they go mothhunting it sounds exciting said dick well what with caves to see and a butterfly farm and toby to visit and and just five together again on a sunny weeks holiday said george giving timmy a sudden thump of joy hurrah for whitsun and thank goodness our two schools had a weeks holiday at the same time the four cousins sprawled on the floor looking with great interest at the map following out a route with their fingers as they traced out the way there came an angry noise from the study where georges father was at work whos been tidying my desk where are those papers i left here fanny fanny come here he wants mother ill get her said george no i cant shes gone shopping why cant people leave my papers alone came her fathers voice again fanny fanny then the study door was flung open and mr kirrin came striding out muttering to himself he didnt see the four children on the floor and fell right over them timmy barked in delight and leapt at him thinking that for once in a way georges father was actually having a game with them oooh said george as her fathers hand came over her face dont what are you doing father uncle quentin sorry you fell over us said julian shut up timmy this isnt a game he helped his uncle up and waited for the explosion his uncle brushed himself down and glared at julian have you got to lie on the floor get down will you timmy wheres your mother george get up for goodness sake wheres joan if shes been tidying my desk again ill give her notice joan the cook appeared at the doorway wiping her floury hands on her apron whatevers all this noise about she began oh sorry sir i didnt know it was you i joan have you been tidying my desk again almost shouted georges father no sir have you lost something never you mind sir ill come along and find it said joan who was used to mr kirrins ways pick up that map you four and put the table back stop barking timmy george take him out for goodness sake or your father will go mad hes only excited because were all together again said george and took timmy into the garden the others followed julian folding up the map grinning we ought to put uncle quentin into a play said dick hed bring the house down well do we know the way julian and when do we start heres mother said george as someone came to the front gate with a basket julian ran to open it he was very fond of his kindly pleasantfaced aunt she smiled round at them all well have you decided where to go and what to take with you youll be able to camp out this beautiful weather what a lovely whitsun its going to be yes said julian taking his aunts basket from her and carrying it indoors were going to billycock hill and as our friend toby lives at the bottom of it at billycock farm hes going to lend us all the camping gear we need so we shant need to load our bikes with tents and mattresses and things said dick oh good said his aunt what about food you can get it at tobys farm i suppose rather we shant feed there of course said julian but we shall buy any eggs or milk or bread we need and toby says the strawberries are already ripening aunt fanny smiled well i neednt worry about your meals then and youll have timmy with you too so hell look after you all wont you timmy you wont let them get into any trouble will you woof said timmy in his deepest voice and wagged his tail woof good old tim said george patting him if it wasnt for you wed never be allowed to go off so much on our own i bet uncle quentins a bit on the warpath aunt fanny said dick he wants to know whos been tidying his desk he came rushing out of the study didnt see us lying on the floor round our map and fell right over us oh dear id better go and find out what papers hes lost now said his aunt i expect he forgot that he had a tidying fit on last night and tidied his desk himself hes probably put a lot of his most precious papers into the wastepaper basket everyone laughed as mrs kirrin hurried into the study well lets get ready said julian we wont need to take much as old tobys going to help us macs of course and dont forget yours timmy and jerseys and one or two maps and torches said anne because we want to explore those caves oh and lets take our swimsuits in case we find somewhere to bathe its warm enough and candles and matches said george slapping the pocket of her shorts ive got those i got joan to give me three boxes and lets take some sweets yes that tin of humbugs said julian and i vote we take our little portable radio oh yes thats a good idea said anne pleased we can hear our favourite programmes then and the news i dont suppose we shall be able to buy newspapers ill get out the bikes from the shed said julian dick get the sandwiches from joan she said shed make us some because we shant get to tobys farm till after our dinnertime and i bet well be hungry wuff said timmy who knew that word very well he says remember biscuits for him said anne with a laugh ill go and get some now tim though i expect you can share meals with the dogs at billycock farm joan had two large packets of sandwiches and cake ready for them and two bottles of orangeade there you are she said handing them over and if you get through all those youll no longer feel hungry and here are timmys biscuits and a bone youre a brick joan said dick and put his arm round her to give her one of the sudden hugs she liked well youll soon be rid of us a whole week at whitsun isnt that luck and with such glorious weather too buck up called julian ive got the bikes and no ones had a puncture for a change bring my mac dick in three minutes everything was packed into the bicycle baskets or strapped at the back timmy made sure that his biscuits and bone were packed by sniffing at each basket until he came to the smell he was hoping for then he wagged his tail and bounded round excitedly the five were together again and who knew what might happen timmy was ready for anything goodbye dears said mrs kirrin standing at the gate to see them go julian take care of the girls and tim take care of everyone uncle quentin suddenly appeared at the window whats all the noise about he began impatiently oh theyre off at last are they now well have a little peace and quiet goodbye and behave yourselves grown ups always say that said anne as the five set off happily ringing their bells in farewell hurrah were off on our own again yes you too timmy what fun chapter two off to billycock hill the sun shone down hotly as the five sped down the sandy road that ran alongside kirrin bay timmy loped easily beside them his tongue hanging out quite a long way anne always said that he had the longest tongue of any dog she had ever known the sea was as blue as forgetmenots as they cycled along beside it across the bay they could see little kirrin island with kirrin castle towering up doesnt it look fine said dick i half wish we were going to spend whitsun at kirrin cottage and going bathing and rowing across to georges little island over there we can do that in the summer hols said julian its fun to explore other parts of the country when we can toby says the caves in billycock hill are marvellous whats toby like asked george weve never seen him anne and i hes a bit of a joker said dick likes to put caterpillars down peoples necks and so on and beware if he has a magnificent rose in his buttonhole and asks you to smell it why asked anne surprised because when you bend down to smell it youll get a squirt of water in your face said dick its a trick rose i dont think im going to like him much said george who didnt take kindly to tricks of this sort ill probably bash him on the head if he does things like that to me that wont be any good said dick cheerfully he wont bash you back hell just think up some worse trick dont scowl george were on holiday tobys all right a bit of an ass thats all they had now left kirrin bay behind and were cycling down a country lane set with hawthorn hedges each side the may was over now and the first wild roses were showing pink here and there a little breeze got up and was very welcome indeed well have an ice when we come to a village said julian after they had cycled about six miles two ices said anne oh dear this hill what a steep one weve come to i dont know whether its worse to ride up slowly and painfully or to get off and push my bike to the top timmy tore up to the top in front of them and then sat down to wait in the cool breeze there his tongue hanging out longer than ever julian came to the top first and looked down the other side theres a village there he said right at the bottom lets see yes its tennick village well stop and ask if it sells ices it did of course strawberry and vanilla the four children sat on a seat under a tree outside the small village shop and dug little wooden spoons into icetubs timmy sat nearby watching hopefully he knew that at least he would be able to lick out the empty tubs oh tim i didnt mean to buy you one because you really are a bit fat said george looking at the beseeching brown eyes fixed on her ice cream but as youll probably get very thin running so far while were cycling ill buy you a whole one for yourself wuff said timmy bounding into the little shop at once and putting his great paws up on the counter much to the surprise of the woman behind it its a waste really giving timmy an ice said anne when george and the dog came out he just loosens it with his tongue and gulps it down i sometimes wonder he doesnt chew up the cardboard tub too after ten minutes rest they all set off again feeling nice and cool inside it really was lovely cycling through the june countryside the trees were so fresh and green still and the fields they passed were golden with buttercups thousands and thousands of them nodding their polished heads in the wind there was very little traffic on these deserted country roads an occasional farmcart and sometimes a car but little else the five kept to the lanes as much as they could for they all preferred their quaint winding curves set with hedges of all kinds to the wide dusty main roads straight and uninteresting we ought to get to billycock farm about four oclock said dick or maybe sooner what time do we have our lunch julian and where well find a good place about one oclock said julian and not a minute before so its no good anyone saying they are hungry yet its only twelve im more thirsty than hungry said anne and im sure old timmy must be dying of thirst lets stop at the next stream so that he can have a drink theres one said dick pointing to where a stream wound across a nearby field hey tim go and have a drink old fellow timmy shot through the hedge to the stream and began to lap the others dismounted and stood waiting anne picked a spray of honeysuckle and put it through a buttonhole of her blouse now i can sniff it all the time she said delicious hey tim leave some water for the fishes shouted dick george stop him drinking any more hes swelling up like a balloon hes not said george timmy thats enough here boy here timmy took one last lap and then raced over to george he pranced round her barking joyfully there he feels much better now said george and away they all went again groaning as they cycled slowly up the many hills in that part of the country and shouting with delight as they sped furiously down the other side julian had decided where to have their midday meal on the top of a high hill then they could see all the country for miles around and there would also be a nice cooling breeze cheer up he said as they came to the steepest hill they had so far encountered well have our lunch at the top of this hill and a good long rest thank goodness panted anne well be as stiff as anything tomorrow it really was lovely at the top of the hill it was so high that they could see the countryside spreading for miles and miles around them you can see five counties from here said julian but dont ask me which ive forgotten lets lie in this heather and have a bit of a rest before we have our lunch it was soft and comfortable lying in the springy heather but timmy did not approve of a rest before lunch he wanted his bone he went to where george had put her bicycle down and sniffed in her basket yes his bone was most certainly there he glanced round to make sure that everyone was resting and nobody watching him then he began to nuzzle a paper parcel out of the basket anne was lying nearest to him and she heard the crackling of the paper and sat up timmy she said shocked oh timmy fancy helping yourself to our sandwiches george sat up at once and timmy put his tail down still wagging it a little as if to say sorry but after all it is my bone oh he just wants his bone said george hes not after our sandwiches as if he should take them anne you might have known he wouldnt i feel rather like having mine now said anne julian cant we have some and i do want a drink the idea of a drink made everyone long to begin lunch and soon they were unwrapping ham and tomato sandwiches and enormous slices of joans fruit cake julian found the little cardboard drinking cups and poured out the orangeade carefully this is fine said dick munching his sandwiches and gazing out over the rolling countryside with its moorlands its stretches of farmland with the fields of green corn and its sloping hills look see that hill far away in the distance julian over there would that be billycock hill do you think its rather a funny shape ill look through my fieldglasses said julian and took them from their leather case he put them to his eyes and stared hard at the faraway hill that lay to the north of them yes i think it probably is billycock hill he said its got such a queerlyshaped top it looks a bit like an old billycock hat he handed the glasses round and everyone looked at the faroff hill george put the glasses to timmys eyes there you are she said have a squint timmy julian it doesnt look so very far away its not as the crow flies said julian taking back his glasses and surveying the countryside around them again but its a long long way through those hundreds of little winding lanes any more sandwiches anyone there arent any more left said dick or fruit cake either have a humbug if youre still hungry the humbugs were passed round and timmy waited hopefully for his turn george gave him one not that its much use to you she said you just swallow it without even one suck well rest for half an hour more said julian gosh i do feel sleepy they all snuggled down into the soft clumps of heather and soon they were asleep in the warm sun even timmy snoozed with one ear half up just in case someone came by but nobody did in fact it was so very quiet on the top of the hill that threequarters of an hour went by before anyone awoke anne felt something crawling up her arm and woke with a jump ugh a big beetle she said and shook it off she glanced at her watch dick ju wake up we must get on or well never be there by teatime soon they were once more on their way tearing down the hill at top speed shouting as they went with timmy barking madly beside them really the start of a holiday was the happiest thing in the world chapter three billycock farm the five certainly cycled fast that afternoon and would have arrived at billycock hill even sooner than they did if it hadnt been for timmy he panted so much in the heat that they stopped for brief rests every fifteen minutes its a pity hes so big and heavy said anne if he had been a small dog we could have taken turns at carrying him in our bicycle baskets billycock hill was soon very near it certainly was a queer shape very like an oldfashioned hat it was partly heatherclad and partly sloping meadow land cows grazed in the meadows and farther up the hill where there was shorter wiry grass the farmer had put a good many sheep nestling down at the foot of the hill was a rambling old farmbuilding with outhouses and stables and a big greenhouse that must be billycock farm said julian well weve made very good time you know its only half past three lets wash our faces in that stream over there we all look rather hot and dirty timmy you can have a bathe if you want to the water was cool and silky to the touch and the children laved it over their faces and necks wishing they could do as timmy was doing lie down in the stream and let the water flow over him thats better said dick mopping his face with an enormous handkerchief now lets go and present ourselves at billycock farm i hope tobys remembered that were coming he promised to lend us all we wanted for camping out they combed their hair brushed down their clothes with their hands and then feeling more respectable made their way across a fieldpath to a farm gate the field was bumpy so they rode slowly soon they were in a big farmyard with hens pecking around them and ducks swimming on a round duckpond farm dogs began barking from somewhere and then something ran round the corner of the old house something very small and pink whatever is it said anne oh its a pigling what a pet oh its come right up to us little pigling have you escaped from your sty how clean you are the tiny pig gave funny little squeals and ran up to timmy who sat back on his haunches in surprise staring at this unexpected little creature he thought it must be some sort of dog without any hair the pigling butted timmy gently and timmy retreated backwards julian laughed tim cant make it out he said no dont growl timmy its quite harmless hallo whos this said dick as a small figure came round the house it stopped when it saw the five what a dear little boy said anne is he tobys brother the child didnt look more than five years old he had a head of bright yellow curls big brown eyes and a grin just like his big brothers thats my pig he said coming slowly towards them he runned away from me anne laughed whats your pigs name she said curly said the small boy and pointed at the piglings tail hes got a curly tail it wont go straight its a nice tail said anne the pigling ran to the small boy and he grabbed it by its tail you runned away again he said then he picked up the pig and walked off hey is this billycock farm called julian have you got a brother called toby toby yes tobys over there said the boy and he pointed to a big barn tobys ratting with binky right said julian the little boy disappeared with his queer pet and julian laughed hes rather a pet himself he said come on lets go and find toby and binky perhaps binky is another brother or a dog said george and put her hand on timmys collar better be careful he might go for tim yes binky might be a dog of course probably a good ratter said julian dick and i will go to the barn and you two girls stay here with timmy they went off to the barn a great noise came from inside as the two boys approached shouts and barks and the rap of a stick came to their ears get him binky look he went under that sack oh you fathead youve lost him again wuffwuffwuff raprap more yells in great curiosity julian and dick peered into the rather dark old barn they saw toby there prodding under sacks with a most excited collie beside him barking incessantly hey toby yelled julian and toby stood up and turned a red and perspiring face towards the two boys oh youve arrived he said going quickly to the door i thought you were never coming glad to see you but are there only two of you i got out tents and things for four there are four of us five counting timmy said julian weve left the two girls over there with him hes our dog will yours be friendly or not oh yes so long as i introduce them said toby and they all went out of the barn as soon as binky tobys dog saw timmy he stood still made himself stiff and growled while the hackles on his neck slowly rose up its all right shouted toby to the girls bring your dog here hell be all right with binky in half a minute rather doubtfully george brought timmy across timmy was a bit doubtful himself of this big collie toby bent down and spoke into binkys ear binky shake paws with this nice girl shes a friend he nodded at george hold out your hand he said george bent down to the collie and held out her hand at once the dog put up his paw and allowed her to shake it solemnly now you said toby to anne and she did the same she liked this dog binky with his bright brown eyes and long sleek nose does your dog shake hands too asked toby george nodded he does right tell him to shake paws with binky binky shake timmy shake commanded george and very politely and solemnly the two dogs shook paws eyeing each other cautiously timmy gave a sudden little whine and then the two were tearing round the yard together barking furiously chasing one another rolling over and having a wonderful game thats all right then said toby pleased binkys quite all right with anyone human or animal so long as he can shake hands with them ive taught him that but hes a dud ratter he just cant seem to nip a rat well lets go and see my mother shes expecting you shes got a whopping great tea this was all very satisfactory just the kind of welcome the five liked anne looked sideways at toby she thought he was rather nice george wasnt so sure he had a rose in his buttonhole was it a trick one and was he going to ask her to smell it we saw a little yellowhaired boy just now said anne with a tiny pigling oh thats benny with his pet pig said toby laughing he calls it curly and he adores it weve offered him a kitten or a puppy but no he wants that pigling they go everywhere together like mary and her lamb bennys a pet he really is kid brothers are usually a nuisance you know but benny isnt kid sisters are a bit of a nuisance sometimes too said dick glancing slyly at anne who at once gave him a determined punch still annes not too bad is she ju tobys mother mrs thomas was a plump and jolly woman with a smile as wide as tobys and bennys she made them all very welcome come along in she said tobys pleased youre going to camp hereabouts hes got all the tents and rugs youll need and you can come every day and get eggs and milk and bread and butter and anything else you need from here dont be afraid to ask there was suddenly the scamper of little hooves and curly the pigling came running indoors there now said tobys mother theres that pigling again benny benny you are not to let curly come indoors cats i dont mind nor dogs but pigs i wont have benny benny appeared looking most apologetic sorry mum but hes lively today oooh i say what a tea can we have some yet ill just make the tea unless youd rather have some of our creamy milk said tobys mother oh milk please mrs thomas said anne and they all said the same nothing could be nicer than icycold creamy farm milk from the dairy on a hot day like this they all sat down to tea and the four visitors wished they had not had such a big lunch a large ham sat on the table and there were crusty loaves of new bread crisp lettuces dewy and cool and red radishes were side by side in a big glass dish on the sideboard was an enormous cake and beside it a dish of scones great slabs of butter and jugs of creamy milk were there too with honey and homemade jam i wish i was hungry really hungry said dick this is just the kind of meal for a hungry day i didnt think youd have had much lunch said mrs thomas now then toby youre the host see to your guests please and benny take the pigling off your knee i will not have him at the table curly will be very upset if he sees that ham said toby slyly thats his grandfather benny put curly down hurriedly afraid that his feelings might be hurt the pigling went to sit beside timmy who very much surprised but rather pleased at once made room for him it was a very happy meal and toby was a good host anne sat beside little benny and found herself liking him more than ever hes like a little boy out of a story she said to george he and curly ought to be put into a book well now said mrs thomas after everyone had eaten their fill what are your plans toby show them where you have put their tents and everything then they can decide where they are going to camp come on then said toby and benny and curly and binky all came along too you can help to carry everything and well go up on billycock hill and find a fine camping place how i wish i could camp out with you too away they all went feeling rather full but very happy where should they camp how lovely to sleep out at nights and see the stars through the opening in the tent chapter four a fine campingplace toby had put all the campingout gear in a nearby barn he took the five there with benny and the pigling trailing after binky came too so friendly now with timmy that they trotted along side by side occasionally pushing against each other like schoolboys julian and dick looked at the pile of canvas the pegs and the ropes yes these two tents would do very well though if the weather stayed like this they would hardly need tents they could lay their rugs out on the springy heather this is fine toby said julian gratefully youve even provided a kettle and a fryingpan well you might want to cook a meal said toby or boil soup theres a saucepan for that ah here it is he picked it up and promptly put it on bennys head where it stuck tightly on his yellow curls benny yelled and ran at toby hitting him with his fists the little pig rushed away in fright and disappeared round a corner anne took the saucepan off poor bennys head youre all right she said it was a funny hat to wear wasnt it curlys runned away again wept benny and he pummelled the laughing toby i hate you i hate you you go and find him said toby fending off the angry small boy and benny ran off on his fat little legs well weve got rid of him for a few minutes said toby now is there anything ive forgotten youve got torches i suppose what about candles and matches weve got those too said dick and weve brought macs and swimsuits but thats about all i see youve put a couple of rugs here as well in case were cold well it might turn wet and chilly said toby of course if it snows or anything like that youll have to come and borrow some more rugs now shall i help you to fix them on your bikes it was too difficult to fix everything on to the four bikes and in the end toby found a handcart and the children piled everything into that well fetch our bikes some other time said julian leave them here said toby theyll be all right are you going now well ill get a package mothers got ready for you you know ham and newlaid eggs and bread and butter and the rest its most awfully good of her said julian gratefully well lets start weve got everything in the handcart now well just wait for the food dick you and i can push this handcart together it will need two of us up the hill and i vote we camp on the side of the slope somewhere so that we can get a good view toby came back with an enormous package of food benny came with him curly trotting behind benny carried a basket of ripe strawberries i picked them for you he said and handed them to anne what beauties she said and gave the smiling child a hug we shall enjoy them benny can i come and see your camp when youve builded it he asked can i bring curly hes never seen a camp yes of course you can said anne are we ready now julian what about milk mrs thomas said we could take some oh yes i forgot that said toby its in the dairy he sped off with binky and the others arranged everything neatly in the useful little handcart toby came back with the milk two big bottles they were stacked carefully in a corner of the cart well were ready now i think said julian and he and dick began to push the cart down the path to the gate timmy and binky trotted on ahead and everyone else followed benny came as far as the gate with curly then toby sent him back you know what mother said benny he said youre not to come with us now itll be too late when binky and i come back bennys mouth went down but he didnt attempt to follow them he picked curly up in his arms in case the pigling should run away after the others bennys a pet said anne i wish i had a little brother like that hes all right said toby a bit of a crybaby though im trying to bring him up properly teasing him out of his babyishness and making him stand on his own feet he seems to be able to do that all right said dick my word the way he went for you when you put that saucepan on his head he pummelled you right and left bennys a funny little kid said toby giving a hand with the cart as they reached the slope of the hill hes always having queer pets two years ago he had a lamb that followed him everywhere last year he had two goslings that followed him about and when they grew into geese they still followed him they waddled all the way upstairs one day and this year hes got a pig said george who like anne was very much amused with benny dont you think timmy was very funny with curly im sure he still thinks its a puppy without any hair they made their way up the hill following a narrow sheeppath the handcart bumped and wobbled and soon it needed four or five pairs of hands to push it how much farther panted toby at last surely youre not going right to the top no said julian about halfway up we do want to have a good view toby not very much farther up i should think but lets have a bit of rest shall we they sat down glad to get their breath certainly the view was magnificent far away on the horizon were purplish hills and in front of them stretched miles and miles of green and golden countryside green for growing corn and grass gold for the buttercups which were at their best in this sunny week of june i like those silvery threads here and there winding about the green fields said anne little streams or rivers curving like snakes all about and i like the dark green patches that are woods whats that just down there asked george pointing to what looked like an enormous field with great sheds in the centre thats an airfield said toby promptly a bit hushhush secret planes tried out and all that i know all about it because a cousin of mine is there hes a flightlieutenant he comes to see us sometimes and tells me things its an experimental place whats that exactly asked anne well where new ideas are tried out said toby they deal mostly with very small planes down there oneman fighter planes i think dont be scared if you hear noises from the airfield sometimes bangs and bursts i dont know what they are of course its all to do with their experiments i wish i could visit the airfield said dick im keen on planes im going to fly one when im older youd better meet my cousin then said toby he might take you up in one i should like to meet him said dick delighted so would julian wed better get on now said julian standing up we wont go much higher the view cant be much better anywhere else george and anne went on ahead to find a good campingplace while the three boys pushed the cart slowly over the heather but it was timmy who found the right place he ran on ahead feeling thirsty so when he heard the sound of running water he ran to it at once from under a jutting rock gushed a little spring it rippled down a rocky shelf and lost itself in a mass of lush greenery below rushes grew to mark the way it went and georges sharp eyes could follow its path for quite a long way down the hill outlined by the dark line of rushes julian look what timmys found she called as she watched him lap from the clear spring water a little spring gushing out of the hillside hadnt we better camp near it jolly good idea shouted back julian and left the handcart to come and see yes this is just the place a fine view plenty of spring heather to camp on and water laid on quite near everyone agreed that it was a fine place and soon all the gear was taken from the handcart the tents were not erected for everyone meant to sleep under the stars that night the evening was so warm nobody wanted to lie in a stuffy tent anne unpacked the food parcel wondering where would be the coolest place for a larder she went over to the rock from which gushed the crystalclear spring water she pushed away the rushes around and discovered a kind of small cave hollowed out of the rock below the spring it would be as cool as anything in there thought anne and put her hand through the falling water into the cavelike hole yes it was icy cold was it big enough to hold the milk bottles and everything just about she thought anne loved arranging anything and she was soon at work putting away the food and the milk into her queer larder george laughed when she saw it just like you anne she said well wed better put a towel by the spring for certainly we shall get soaked every time we get out any food tell timmy hes not to try and poke his head into my larder said anne pushing timmy away oh now hes all wet go and shake yourself somewhere else timmy youre showering me with drops of water toby had to leave them for it was already past his suppertime see you tomorrow he said how i wish i was staying up here with you so long away he went down the hill with binky at his heels the five looked at one another and grinned hes nice but its good to be alone again just us five said george come on lets settle in this is the best camp weve ever had chapter five the first night and a morning visitor whats the time said julian looking at his watch good gracious its almost eight oclock anyone feel tired yes said dick anne and george and even timmy joined in with his deepest woof with all that bicycling and then pushing that heavy cart up the hill i can hardly move said dick i vote we have a simple supper something out of annes little larder and then spread our rugs over some thick heather and sleep under the sky even up here with a breeze its warm i should be stifled in a tent well were all agreed on that said julian anne what do you suggest for a light supper bread butter and some of mrs thomass farm cheese said anne promptly with a tomato or two if you like and icycold milk and bennys strawberries to finish with that is if the milk has had time to get cold in the little hole under the spring sounds jolly good said julian what do you think timmy anne if you and george get the supper ready dick and i will prepare our heathery beds then we can all turn in as soon as possible i honestly feel that once i sit down or lie down ill not be able to get up again same here said dick and went off with julian to find the best place for sleeping they soon found one they came across a giant of a gorse bush thick prickly and still full of golden blooms in front of it was a stretch of very closeset heather as springy as the best mattress in the world dick sat down on it and grinned at julian just made for us he said we shall sleep like tops here we hardly need a rug to lie on its so closegrown help me up ju my legs wont do anything now ive sat down julian pulled him up and they called to the girls anne george bring the supper here weve found a good place its by this giant gorse bush the girls came along with the meal and the boys fetched a couple of rugs from the pile of things that they had brought in the handcart they spread them on the heather i say this certainly is a good place said george coming up with anne and timmy carrying a loaf of bread a pat of butter and tomatoes anne had the milk and the cheese timmy was carrying a little bag of his own biscuits the gorse bush will shelter us from too much wind said dick taking the milk from anne its an ideal spot and the view is superb it was a very happy supper they had sitting in the heather while the sun sank lower and lower in the west the evenings were very light now and certainly they would not need candles they finished up everything and then went to wash at the little spring that bubbled out so cheerfully they lay down on their rugs in the heather while it was still daylight good night said dick and promptly fell fast asleep good night called julian and lay for a few seconds looking at the view which was now becoming dim and blue timmy kept the two girls awake for a minute or two trying to squeeze in between them do keep still timmy said george and just remember youre on guard even though i dont expect there is anyone nearer than a mile and that will be at billycock farm lie still now or ill push you off the rug good night anne george was soon asleep and so was timmy tired out with so many miles of running anne lay awake for a few minutes looking at the evening star which shone large and golden in the sky she felt very happy i dont want to grow up she thought there cant be anything nicer in the world than this being with the others having fun with them no i dont want to grow up then she too fell asleep and night came quietly down with stars brilliant in the sky and very little noise to be heard anywhere just the gurgling of the spring some way away and the faroff bark of some dog perhaps binky at the farm the breeze died down so that even that could not be heard no one except timmy awoke at all that night timmy put up one ear when he heard a squeak just above his head it came again and he opened one eye it was a small black bat circling and swooping hunting for insects its squeak was so high that only timmys quick ear caught it he put down his listening ear and went to sleep again nobody stirred until a very loud noise awakened them rrrrrrrrrr rrrrrrrrrr they all woke up with a jump and the boys sat up straight startled what could it be its a plane said julian staring up at a small aeroplane flying over the hill it must be one from that airfield down there i say its five past nine five past nine weve slept for nearly twelve hours well im going to sleep for some more said dick snuggling down into his heathery bed again and shutting his eyes no youre not said julian giving him a shove its too good a day to waste in any more sleep hey you girls are you awake yes called george sitting up rubbing her eyes that aeroplane wakened me annes awake too and you can see that timmy is hes gone after a rabbit or something well all go and wash at the spring said anne scrambling off the rug and george and i will get breakfast anyone like a boiled egg the sun shone down out of a blue sky and the little breeze awoke and began to blow again they washed in the cold water and timmy drank it lapping it thirstily as it splashed down over his nose then they had their breakfast it was easy to make a little fire in the shelter of the giant gorse bush and boil the eggs in the saucepan bread and butter and tomatoes completed the simple meal with cold creamy milk to wash it down in the middle of this timmy began ta bark frantically but as his tail was wagging all the time the others guessed that it must be toby coming they heard binkys answering bark and then the dog himself appeared panting and excited he greeted timmy first of all and then ran round to give everyone a lick hallo hallo hallo came tobys voice and he appeared round the gorse bush had a good night i say arent you late still having your breakfast my word youre sleepyheads ive been up since six ive milked cows and cleaned out a shed and fed the hens and collected the eggs the five immediately felt ashamed of themselves they gazed at toby in admiration why he was quite a farmer ive brought you some more milk bread and eggs and cake he said and put down a basket jolly good of you said julian we must pay for any food we get from your farm you know that any idea of how much we owe for yesterdays food and for what youve brought today well my mother says you dont need to pay her said toby but i know you mean to so i suggest that you pay me each time and ill put the money into a box and buy my mother a smashing present at the end from you all will that do thats a good idea said julian we couldnt possibly accept food if we didnt pay for it but i know what mothers are they dont like being paid in money for their kindness so well do what you say now reckon up what we owe so far and ill pay you right said toby in a businesslike way ill charge you market prices not top prices ill just tot up the bill while youre cleaning up and putting away what ive brought the girls washedup in the spring and the boys carried everything there for anne to put in her larder toby presented julian with a neatlywritten bill which he at once paid toby receipted the bill and gave it back there you are all businesslike he said thanks very much what are you going to do today there are super caves to be explored if you like or theres the butterfly farm or you can just come down to our farm for the day no not today said julian afraid that they might make themselves a nuisance to mrs thomas i dont feel like seeing caves this morning either so dark and eerie on such a sunny day what shall we do girls but before they could decide binky and timmy began to bark each dog standing quite still facing the same way towards the giant gorse bush who is it tim asked george go and see go on then timmy ran behind the bush followed by binky and then the children heard a surprised voice hallo binky what are you doing all the way up here and whos your friend its mr gringle said toby one of the men who own the butterfly farm hes often up here with his net because its a wonderful place for butterflies a man came round the gorse bush rather a peculiar figure untidy with glasses slipping down his nose and his hair much too long he carried a big butterfly net and stopped when he saw the five children hallo he said who are all these toby quite a crowd friends of mine mr cringle said toby solemnly allow me to introduce them julian kirrin dick kirrin anne kirrin george kirrin their cousin and their dog timothy ha pleased to meet you said mr gringle and came shambling forward his big butterfly net over his shoulder behind his glasses shone curiously bright eyes he nodded his head to each of the four cousins three boys and a girl very nice lot too you dont look as if youll leave litter about or start fires in this lovely countryside we shouldnt dream of it said george delighted that he had thought she was a boy nothing pleased george as much as that mr gringle could we see your butterfly farm please we would so like to of course my dear boy of course said mr gringle and his eyes shone as if he were very pleased we dont often have visitors so its quite an event when somebody comes along this way this way chapter six the butterfly farm mr gringle led the way down the hill by a little path so overgrown that it was hardly possible to see it halfway down the little company heard a squealing noise and then an excited little voice toby toby im here can i come with you its benny and the pigling said anne amused at the little couple making their way excitedly towards them timmy ran to curly and sniffed him all over still not quite sure that he wasnt some kind of strange puppy what are you doing up here said toby sternly you know youre not supposed to wander too far from the farm youll get lost one of these days benny curly runned away said benny looking up at his big brother with wide brown eyes you mean you wanted to find out where id gone so you came after me with curly said toby curly runned away he runned fast said benny looking as if he was going to cry youre a scoundrel benny said toby you make that pigling of yours an excuse for getting about all over the place you wait till dad hears it youll get such a spanking well tail on to us now were going to the butterfly farm and if curly runs away let him im tired of that pig ill carry him said benny and picked up the little creature in his arms but he soon had to put him down for curly squealed so loudly that timmy and binky both leapt round him in great concern hm well shall we proceed asked mr gringle walking on in front quite a party we have today are your butterflies afraid of pigs or dogs asked benny trotting beside him shall we leave them outside dont ask idiotic questions benny said toby then he gave a cry and caught mr gringles arm i say sir look at that butterfly dont you want to catch it is it rare no said mr gringle rather coldly its a meadowbrown very common indeed dont they teach you anything at school fancy not knowing that julian do we have any butterfly lessons asked toby with a grin i say mr gringle what about you coming and teaching us about cabbage butterflies and cauliflower moths and red admirals and blue captains and peacock butterflies and ostrich moths and dont be an ass toby said julian seeing that mr gringle had no sense of humour at all and did not think this in the least funny mr gringle are there many rare butterflies about here oh yes yes said the butterfly man but not only that there are so many of all kinds here and it is easy to catch as many as i want for breeding purposes one butterfly means hundreds of eggs you know and we hatch them out and sell them he suddenly made a dart to one side almost knocking george over sorry boy he said making the others smile sorry theres a brown argus there a lovely specimen first ive seen this year stand clear will you the children and the dogs too stood still as he tiptoed towards a small dark brown butterfly spreading its tiny wings as it sat on a flowering plant with a swift downwards swoop the net closed over the plant and in a trice the butterfly man had caught the fluttering insect he pinched the net inwards and showed the children the tiny creature there you are a female brown argus one of the family of the blue butterflies you see so often in full summer shell lay me plenty of eggs and theyll all hatch into fat little sluglike caterpillars and but this isnt a blue butterfly said anne looking through the fine net its dark brown with a row of pretty orange spots along the margins of its wings all the same it belongs to the blue butterfly family said mr gringle taking it out with the gentlest of fingers and putting it into a tin case slung round his shoulders its probably come up from one of those hay meadows down in the valley there in you go my little beauty mr gringle quick heres a most lovely butterfly called george its got greenyblack front wings with red spots and lovely red back wings with dark green borders oh quick im sure you want this one thats not a butterfly said dick who knew a good deal about them i should think not said mr gringle getting his net poised ready to swoop its a moth a lovely little thing down went his net and the pretty little red and green insect fluttered in surprise inside it but moths dont fly in the daytime argued george only at night rubbish said mr gringle looking at the moth through the thick lens of his glasses what are boys coming to nowadays in my boyhood nearly every boy knew that there are nighttime and daytime ones as well but began george again and stopped as mr gringle gave her quite a glare this is a sixspot burnet dayflying moth he said speaking slowly as if he were addressing a very small child it loves to fly in the hot sunshine please do not argue with me i dont like ignorance of this sort george looked rather mutinous and dick nudged her hes right fathead he said in a low voice you dont know much about moths so say nothing george or he wont let us go with him id like two or three more of these sixspots highlycoloured and unusually large perhaps you would see if you can find any more all of you everybody began to look here and there and to shake any little bush or clump of grass they passed timmy and binky were most interested in this and began a hunt on their own sniffing and snuffling everywhere not quite sure what they were looking for but enjoying it all the same mr gringle took a long time to get to his butterfly farm and the children began to wish they hadnt asked to go there was so much sidestepping to see this and that so much examining when a specimen was caught so much talkytalk as dick whispered to anne do you keep your butterflies and moths in those glasshouses asked julian yes said mr gringle come along ill show you what i and my friend mr brent do hes away today so you cant meet him it was certainly a queer place the cottage looked as if it were about to fall down at any moment two of the windows were broken and some tiles had fallen off the roof but the glasshouses were in good repair and the glass panes were perfectly clean evidently the butterfly men thought more of their butterflies and moths than they did of themselves do you live here all alone with mr brent your friend asked dick curiously thinking that it must be a strange and lonely life oh no old mrs janes does for us said mr cringle and sometimes her son comes here to do any small repairs and to clean all the glass of the butterfly houses theres the old lady look she cant bear insects of any sort so she never comes into the glass houses an old woman looking exactly like a witch peered out at them through a window in the cottage anne was quite scared to see her toby grinned shes quite harmless he said to anne our cook knows her because she often comes to us for eggs and milk shes got no teeth at all so she mutters and mumbles and that makes her seem more like a witch than ever i dont much like the look of her said anne going thankfully into the first of the butterfly houses oh what a lot of butterflies there certainly were hundreds were flying about loose and many others were in little compartments either by themselves or with another butterfly to match the children saw that many bushes and plants were growing in the glasshouse and on some of them were placed long sleeves made of muslin tied in at each end whats in these long sleeves of fine muslin asked dick oh i see they are full of caterpillars my word how they are eating too yes i told you we breed butterflies and moths said mr gringle and he opened the end of one of the muslin bags so that the visitors could see the caterpillars better these are the caterpillars of one kind of butterfly they feed on this particular plant the children gazed at scores of green caterpillars marked with red and yellow spots all eating greedily on the leaves of the twig enclosed there mr gringle undid another of the muslin bags and showed them some huge caterpillars each of them green with purple stripes on the side and a curious black horn on the tail end privethawk moth caterpillars said mr gringle and julian and dick nodded they knew these big green caterpillars quite well why is the moth called privethawk asked anne there are so many different hawkmoths i know ive often wondered why they are all called hawk mr gringle beamed at anne evidently thinking that this was a quite intelligent question havent you ever seen a hawk moth flying he said no well it flies very strongly indeed oh a most striking flight like the flight of the bird called a hawk you know youre not feeding the caterpillars on privet though said george but you said they were privethawks there isnt any privet growing near here said mr gringle so i give them elder this is an elder bush which i planted in the glasshouse they like it just as much the butterfly farm was certainly interesting and the children wandered about the glasshouse watching caterpillars of all kinds admiring the lovely specimens of butterflies and marvelling at the collection of curiousshaped chrysalides and cocoons that mr gringle kept carefully in boxes waiting for the perfect insect moth or butterfly to emerge like magic he said in an awed voice his eyes shining behind his glasses sometimes you know i feel like a magician myself and my butterfly net is a wand the children felt rather uncomfortable as he said this waving his butterfly net to and fro like a wand he really was rather a queer person its terribly hot in here said julian suddenly lets get into the fresh air ive had enough goodbye mr gringle and thank you out they all went and drew in deep breaths of fresh air and then they heard a croaking voice behind them get out of here said the voice get out chapter seven mrs janes a spider and a pool timmy growled and so did binky the children swung round and saw the old witchlike woman standing there her wispy grey hair hanging over her face whats the matter mrs er mrs janes said julian fortunately remembering the name mr gringle had told him were not doing any harm my son dont like strangers here said mrs janes mumbling so much that the children could hardly understand what she was saying but this place belongs to mr gringle surely and his friend said dick puzzled i tell ee my son dont hold with strangers here mumbled the old woman again and shook her fist at them timmy didnt like this and growled she at once pointed her finger at him and muttered a long string of such queersounding words that anne shrank back afraid really mrs janes did look exactly like a witch and sounded like one too timmy acted strangely he put his tail down stopped growling and crept close to george she was most astonished it looks as if shes trying to put a spell on old tim said dick half laughing but that was too much for anne and george taking timmy by the collar george rushed off quickly with anne following the boys laughed binky ran after timmy and toby spoke boldly to the queer old woman your son isnt even here so what business is it of his to tell you to give orders to visitors tears suddenly began to pour down the old womans face and she wrung her bony hands together hell hit me she wept hell twist my arm go away do go away if he comes hell chase you off hes a bad man my son is shes mad poor old thing said toby feeling sorry for old mrs janes our cook often says so though shes harmless enough her sons not too bad hes quite handy at repairs and we used to have him come to the farm to mend roofs and things like that but hes not so good as he used to be come on lets go mr gringles a bit queer too isnt he they went off after the two girls julian still feeling uncomfortable and distressed whats mr gringles friend like the one who helps him asked julian i dont know ive never seen him said toby hes away mostly doing the business side i think selling specimens of eggs caterpillars and so on and the perfect moths and butterflies too of course id like to see that butterfly house again but mr gringle gets on my nerves said dick those brilliant eyes behind those thick glasses youd think that if they were as bright and piercing as that he wouldnt need to wear any glasses at all hey george anne shouted julian wait for us were just coming they caught up the girls and julian grinned at george you thought old timmy was going to be changed into a black beetle or something didnt you he said no of course not said george going red i just didnt like her very much pointing her finger like that at timmy no wonder he growled you didnt hear what she said about her son said dick she began to cry like anything after youd gone and say that her son would beat her and twist her arm if we didnt go and hes not even there shes mad said george i dont want to go there again what are we going to do now go up to our campingplace and have our lunch said julian promptly come with us toby or have you got jobs to do at the farm no ive done them all said toby id love to have a meal with you up on the hill it wasnt very long before they were back at their campingplace everything was as they had left it macs neatly under the gorse bush with the rugs and other little things and the food in annes larder waiting for them the meal was very hilarious as toby was in one of his silly moods and produced some idiotic jokes the most successful one was a large imitation spider with shaky legs which while anne and george had gone to get the food he hung by a thin nylon thread to a spray on the nearby gorse bush dick grinned broadly wait till anne sees that he said george always says she doesnt mind spiders but a big one like that is distinctly creepy it certainly was anne didnt spot it until she was eating her strawberries covered with some of the cream that tobys mother had generously sent then she suddenly spied it shaking slightly in the breeze hanging by its thread just over georges head ooooooooh she squealed ooooh george be careful theres a monster spider just over your head what is george scared of spiders cried toby at once just like a girl george glared at him i dont mind them at all she said coldly im glad you arent scared of them said toby id have to call you georgina if you were thats your right name isnt it george do move cried anne upsetting her strawberries in her anxiety its almost on your head i tell you its legs are wobbling as if they are going to settle on your hair george its an enormous one it might even be one of those foreign things a tarantula or something the wind blew a little just then and the spider moved about on the thread most realistically even dick was glad it wasnt alive george couldnt resist looking up pretending to be quite unmoved but when she saw the enormous creature just above her she shot straight out of her place and landed on tobys legs making him spill his strawberries and cream now now georgina said the annoying toby picking up his strawberries you said you didnt mind spiders ill remove it for you and you can go back to your place no no dont touch it ugh cried anne but toby putting on a very brave face leaned over and neatly took the spider off the gorsebush still swinging by its thread he swung it near to anne who scrambled up at once then he made it walk over dicks knee and timmy came to investigate at once binky came too and snapped at it breaking the nylon thread that held it ass said toby giving him a smack my beautiful spider my spinner of webs my tame catcher of flies what is it a tame one said anne in horror more or less said toby and put it carefully into his pocket grinning all over his round face thats enough toby said julian jokes finished george stared at toby her face growing crimson a joke a joke you wait till i pay you out toby i dont call that a joke i call it a mean trick you knew anne hated spiders lets change the subject said dick hastily what are we going to do this afternoon i know what id like to do said julian longingly id like a bathe its so jolly hot if we were at kirrin id be in the sea all the afternoon i wish we were at kirrin said george sulkily well if you really do want a bathe i can take you to a pool said toby anxious to get into everyones good books again a pool where said dick eagerly well see that airfield down there said toby pointing and see this spring here where you get your water it goes on and on running down the hill joins two or three more little rivulets and ends in a smashing pool not far from the airfield cold as ice it is too ive often bathed there it sounds jolly good said julian pleased well we cant bathe immediately after a meal the girls will want to do their bit of washingup and put the rest of the food away well sit here and wait till theyve finished have a bit of a rest and then go and find this pool everyone agreed to this and the girls hurried off to the little spring if toby has any more idiotic tricks like that ill play a few on him said george in fact ive a good mind to pull him under in the pool hes all right george said anne hes just like that at school dick says he must drive the masters mad they soon joined the boys and had a short rest while timmy and binky went off amiably together to do a little hunting sniping down holes and under bushes looking very serious indeed they came back immediately george whistled were going timmy said george heres your swimsuit dick and yours julian good thing we brought them with us what about you toby you havent a swimsuit with you said julian we have to pass fairly near the farm said toby ill leave you when were near there and get mine it wont take more than five minutes if i run all the way back they set off down the hill towards the airfield except for the planes they had heard that morning they had heard and seen none it seemed a very quiet airfield wait till they start experimenting with the new fighter planes my cousin told me about said toby youll hear a noise then theyre so fast they break the soundbarrier every time they go up would your cousin let us look over the airfield one day asked julian id like to do that it wouldnt interest the girls but dick and i would love it i should certainly like to go said george at once it would interest me as much as you but youre a girl said toby girls dont understand the first thing about aeroplanes or motorcars or ships or spiders either come to that i really dont think youd be interested georgina dear my name is not georgina said george furiously and dont call me dear shut up you two said julian its too nice an afternoon to begin an argument look isnt that your farm toby weve got here jolly quickly but its all downhill of course yes said toby come on binky race you home and back shant be long julian keep straight ahead and walk towards that big pinetree you can see in the distance ill be with you by the time youre there he raced off at top speed while the others went on slowly towards the pinetree in the distance it would be heavenly to bathe in a cold pool toby was certainly a fast runner just before they reached the pinetree he came up behind them his swimsuit over his shoulder so out of breath that he could hardly speak its over there he panted look the pool and sure enough there was the pool deep blue cool and as smooth as glass trees surrounded it on one side and heather grew right down to the edge the five children went towards it gladly but suddenly they came to a big notice nailed to a tree keep out danger crown property i say what does that mean said dick in dismay we cant bathe after all oh take no notice of that said toby it doesnt mean a thing but it did as they were very soon to find out chapter eight a spot of trouble what do you mean by saying that the notice doesnt mean a thing said julianwhy put it up then oh there are notices like that all round the airfield said toby airily telling you to keep out theres danger but there isnt only aeroplanes are here no guns no bombs nothing its a jolly lonely place too tucked away at the foot of this hill why dont you ask your cousin why they put up the notices asekd dick there must be some reason i tell you those notices have been up for ages said toby sounding cross ages they might have been some use at some time or other but not now we can bathe here and do what we like all right but i hope you know what youre talking about said julian i must say i cant see any sense myself in putting notices here theres no wire or fencing to keep anyone out lets get into our bathing things then said dick you girls can have that bush over there and well have this one buck up they were soon changed into their swimsuits and dived into the pool which was surprisingly deep it was also deliciously cool and silky to the touch just as the spring water had been the two dogs leapt in gladly and swam vigorously round and round the children splashed them and timmy began to bark excitedly shut up timmy said toby at once why should he demanded george swimming up well someone at the airfield might hear him said toby you said it didnt matter us being here said george look out for yourself she dived underwater and got hold of tobys legs pulling him down he yelled and kicked and spluttered but george was strong and she gave him a very very good ducking he came up purple in the face i said id pay you out for the spider yelled george and swam strongly away toby swam after her and she led him a fine dance round the pool for she was a splendid swimmer the others laughed at the contest i back old george said dick shed outswim most boys well shes put toby in his place all right he wont be so free with spiders and silly jokes for a while timmy began to bark again when he saw toby chasing george and binky joined in shut up binky shouted toby i tell you stop barking before toby had obeyed something happened a stentorian voice came across the pool whats all this youre trespassing on crown property didnt you see the notice the dogs stopped barking and the five children looked round to see who was shouting their heads bobbed on the surface of the water as they gazed about to find the shouter it was a man in air force uniform a big man burly and redfaced whats the matter called julian swimming towards him were only bathing were not doing any harm didnt you see the notice shouted the man pointing over to it yes but we couldnt see much danger here called back julian wishing now that he hadnt believed toby you come on out roared the man all of you come on they all waded out of the cool pond anne feeling scared the dogs splashed out too and stood eyeing the man grimly he calmed down a little when he saw them those your dogs i heard barking well now i see youre all kids though one of yous big enough to know better and he pointed to julian i thought maybe you were trippers thinking you could come wandering on the airfield and not get into trouble trippers dont come here said toby squeezing the water out of his hair nor do sensible children retorted the man ive had trouble from you before havent i yes didnt you come walking round the hangars bold as brass one day and that dog with you too i only went to see my cousin flightlieutenant thomas said toby i wasnt doing any harm i wasnt spying i tell you i only went to see my cousin well i shall report you to him said the man and tell him to give you a proper ticking off weve strict instructions to warn off anyone theres notices everywhere is something hushhush going on then said toby with a sudden grin as if id tell you if there was said the man in disgust far as i can see theres nothing much doing here dull as ditchwater this place and as far as im concerned id welcome a horde of trippers it would liven up the place no end but orders is orders as you very well know julian thought it was about time that he should join in the man was only doing his duty and toby was an ass to have said that the notices meant nothing well we apologize for trespassing he said in his clear pleasant voice we shant bathe here again i promise you sorry to have made you come all this way to warn us off the raf guard looked at julian with respect there was something about the boy that reassured people and the man now felt quite sure that it was all tobys fault he smiled and gave a sketchy salute thats all right he said sorry to cut your bathe short this hot day and er if that rogue of a boy here he pointed to toby if he cares to ask flightlieutenant thomas for permission to bathe in this pool at certain hours its okay by me i shant come running then when i hear dogs barking and a lot of shouting if i know youre allowed here at certain hours thanks said julian but anyway were only here for a few days so long said the man who saluted them all and walked off smartly well said toby quite unashamed what did he want to come messing about here for spoiling our bathe he said there wasnt anything secret going on so why oh shut up said dick you heard what he said about orders being orders hes not a silly schoolboy trying to be clever and getting out of doing his work yes like you do at school toby and a good many of the others hes a man in uniform youd better grow up a bit young toby i agree said julian so dont lets hear any more about it you slipped up toby and thats all there is to it now lets dry ourselves and go to the farm and ask your nice kind mother if shell let us have some more food to take back to our camp with us im as hungry as a hunter after our bathe toby was rather subdued after all this he glanced at george to see if she was gloating over his ticking off but george was never one to exult over anyones downfall and toby felt relieved shall i ask my cousin if hell get permission for us to bathe in the pool he said as they went away from the water dry and dressed again i think not said julian but id like to meet your cousin some time all the same he might take us up in a plane said toby hopefully his spirits rising at the thought oh look there heres that little wretch benny again and the pigling benny panted up carrying the little pig you look like tom tom the pipers son said julian ruffling the yellow curls he stole a pig and ran away carrying it under his arm but this is my own pig said benny surprised i didnt steal him i came to find you because my mother says come to tea you have got a nice mother said anne taking the small boys hand why dont you put the pig down he must be so heavy he runned away again said benny severely so i carried him put a collar on his neck with a lead suggested dick he hasnt got a neck said benny and indeed the pigling was so plump that his head joined his body without any neck at all the little procession made its way to the farm and the pigling at once ran in front squealing it seemed surprised and delighted to find it was home again timmy pricked up his ears when it squealed he thought that it must be in pain and he was worried he ran beside the little creature trying to nuzzle it mrs thomas saw them through the window come along in she said i thought you might like to have tea here again today because ive a visitor youd like to meet who is it cried toby running indoors oh its you cousin jeff hey julian dick look its my cousin jeff from the airfield flightlieutenant thomas the one i told you about cousin jeff meet my friends julian dick anne georgina er i mean george and timmy a tall goodlooking young man stood up smiling the five gazed at him liking him very much indeed what a fine young fellow how strong what keen straight eyes he had what a cousin to possess they all envied toby at that moment no wonder he had boasted about him so much hallo to you said cousin jeff glad to see you all hey look at this dog and well might everyone look for timmy had marched straight up to him and then held up a paw wuff he said which of course meant shake how do you do said cousin jeff solemnly and shook paws with timmy at once timmys never done that before said george astonished well what a surprising thing he must like you very much chapter nine cousin jeff i like dogs said jeff and patted timmy on the head this is a fine one as smart as can be too isnt he george nodded pleased she loved anyone to praise timmy yes hes very clever hes been in heaps of adventures with us he can be very fierce if he thinks anyone is going to attack us oh look he wants to shake hands again isnt he funny jeff shook paws once more and then timmy settled down beside him almost as if he considered himself to be his dog george didnt mind she liked cousin jeff as much as timmy did tell us about your job begged dick its such a queer airfield the one youre at no fencing round it hardly any planes nobody about the field do you do much flying not much at the moment said cousin jeff but dont be misled by the fact that theres no fencing round the airfield believe me the commanding officer knows immediately if any stranger comes into the district and er well let us say that extra precautions are taken really said george do you mean to say for instance that your commanding officer knows weve arrived you bet he does said jeff laughing youve probably been given the onceover already though you didnt know it i expect someone has been detailed to find out who you are and why youre here and you may even have been watched for a few hours though you had no idea of it this was rather a creepy thought watched how by whom and where did they hide to watch dick asked jeff these questions but the young airman shook his head sorry cant answer he said but you neednt worry youre all right maybe my aunt here has said a few words about you you never know mrs thomas smiled but said nothing she beckoned to anne and george to help her to bring in the tea just as good a one as they had had before the girls bustled about setting out cups and saucers while the boys talked to cousin jeff and asked him eager questions about planes and flying and how this was done and that i suppose you wouldnt take us up some time cousin jeff would youasked toby at last i dont think id be allowed to said jeff in fact i dont think i can even ask you see the planes there are pretty special you cant go joyriding in them and of course we see said julian hurriedly afraid of embarrassing the friendly young airman we wouldnt dream of bothering you when are you going up next can we watch you from our campingplace yes i should think you could see me with fieldglasses said jeff considering ill tell you the number of my plane its painted underneath it of course so youll know its me if you see it circling over the hill but i shant do any stunts im afraid like coming down low to you or anything like that only fatheaded beginners do that well look out for you said dick quite envious of toby for having such a fine young cousin i dont expect youll see us but well wave anyway tea was now ready and they all drew up their chairs benny wandered in with his pigling under his arm and set it down in the cats basket where it stayed quite peacefully falling asleep and making tiny grunting snores does the cat mind asked george astonished looking at the basket not a bit said mrs thomas it had to put up with two goslings last year in its basket and something the year before a lamb said toby oh yes and old tinky thats the cat didnt seem to worry at all said mrs thomas pouring out creamy milk for everyone even cousin jeff i once found her curled up round the goslings one morning purring loudly good old tinky said toby where is she id like to see what she thinks of curly she couldnt cuddle him he takes up nearly all the basket hes so plump tea was a merry meal with toby playing the fool putting a spoonful of sifted sugar on the side of annes plate to eat with her crisp radishes instead of salt and offering the salt to george to eat with her strawberries both girls were listening so intently to cousin jeff that they didnt even notice what toby had done and he almost fell off his chair with laughing when he saw their faces salt with strawberries ugh sugar and radishes ugh funny boy arent you said george annoyed at being tricked you wait but toby was too wily to be tricked and george had to give it up anyway she couldnt bother with toby when cousin jeff was talking about planes his eyes shining with pleasure flying was his great love and in listening to him all three boys there made up their minds to take it up as soon as ever they could benny didnt listen much he was more interested in animals than in planes he ate his tea solemnly and watched his pigling in the cats basket occasionally leaning over to tap his mothers hand when he wanted to speak to her curly runned away again he told her solemnly right up to the horsepond i thought i had told you not to go there said his mother you fell in last time but curly runned there said benny his big eyes looking very wide and innocent i had to go after him didnt i hes my pigling well i shall spank curly if he takes you to places youve been told not to go to said his mother i cant let him grow up disobedient can i this needed thinking over and benny ate his tea with a serious face ignoring the others anne looked at him several times delighted with the solemn little boy and his funny ways how nice it would be to have a small brother like that well i must be off said jeff when the meal was finished thanks most awfully for a super tea aunt sarah but then your teas always are super i was jolly lucky to be stationed here so near to billycock farm well so long everyone so long timmy everyone went with him to the gate timmy and binky as well and benny awoke his little pig and carried him to the gate too squealing and kicking they all watched the tall sturdy young airman striding away round the hill do you like him asked toby proudly isnt he super im awfully proud of him hes supposed to be one of the cleverest flying men in the kingdom did you know no we didnt said dick but im not surprised hes got eyes as keen as a hawks and hes heart and soul in his work how lucky for you that he is stationed so near wed better get back to our camp when the girls have helped your mother to clear away and washup said julian anxious not to outstay his welcome at the farm toby can you pack us up a bit more food in case we dont see you tomorrow right said toby and went off whistling benny appeared again with curly running round his feet hallo said dick with a grin is that pigling of yours running away again benny grinned back if he runned away to your camp would you be cross he asked looking most innocently up at dick he mustnt do that said dick seriously guessing what was in the little boys mind he meant to go to find the camp himself and then say that it was curly who had runned away there you see you might lose your way if you went so far benriy said no more but wandered off with his comical pet running in front of him the boys went to find toby to see if they could help him to pack food into a basket we must pay his bill too said julian feeling for his purse it was a good idea of his to save up the money to buy his mother a present she really is a darling soon the five were on their way back to their camp again toby was left behind to do his usual jobs of collecting the eggs washing them and grading them into sizes for the market ill be up tomorrow he called after them well plan something good to do maybe visit the caves if you like the four children went up the steep slope of billycock hill talking while timmy ranged in front sniffing everywhere as usual and then suddenly a large butterfly sailed through the air and came to rest on a flower of a blossoming elder bush just in front of george a butterfly that none of them had ever seen before look at that what is it cried anne in delight oh what a beauty julian what is it ive absolutely no idea said julian astonished it may be an unusual fritillary though its early in the year for those that butterfly man whats his name now mr gringle said that this hill was famous for rare butterflies and i imagine this is pretty uncommon it is a beauty isnt it they watched the butterfly opening and shutting its magnificent wings on the white blossom we ought to try and catch it said dick im sure that mr gringle would be thrilled it might lay eggs for him and start a whole breed of uncommon butterflies in this country ive got a very thin hanky said anne i think i can catch it without harming its wings and well put it into the little box that toby filled with sugar lumps for us get it and empty it dick in half a minute the butterfly was inside the box quite unharmed for anne had been very deft in catching it what a magnificent creature said dick shutting the box now come on well give mr gringle a surprise what about that witch woman you know mrs janes who looks exactly like a witch said anne i dont want to meet her again ill tell her to jump on her broomstick and fly away said julian with a laugh dont be silly anne she cant hurt you they went off round the hill taking the little path down which mr gringle had guided them soon they saw the reflection of the sun glittering on the glasshouses anne and george hesitated as they came near and timmy stopped too his tail down well stay there then said dick impatiently ju and i wont be long and off went the two boys together while george and anne waited in the distance i hope they wont be long said anne worried i dont know why i feel creepy here but i do chapter ten butterfly farm again dick and julian went to the glasshouses where the butterflies and caterpillars lived they peered through the panes but could see nobody there mr gringle must be in the cottage said julian lets stand outside and call hell come out then i dont much like mrs janes so they stood outside the tumbledown cottage and shouted mr gringle mr gringle nobody answered no mr gringle came out but somebody pulled aside the corner of a window curtain upstairs and peeped out the boys shouted again waving at the window mr gringle weve got a rare butterfly for you the window opened and old mrs janes looked out seeming more witchlike than ever mr gringles away she mumbled what about his friend mr brent the one we didnt see shouted dick is he in the old woman stared at them mumbled something else and then disappeared very suddenly indeed from the window dick looked at julian in surprise why did she go so suddenly almost as if somebody pulled her roughly away julian i dont like it why do you think that son of hers is here the one she said was cruel to her asked julian who was puzzled too i dont know said dick lets snoop round a bit perhaps mr gringle is somewhere about whatever old mrs janes says they went round the corner of the house and peered into a shed nobody there then they heard footsteps and turned round hurriedly a man was coming towards them small and thin with a pinchedlooking face and dark glasses he carried a butterfly net and nodded at the two boys my friend gringle is away he said can i do anything for you oh youre mr brent then said dick look weve found a rare butterfly thats why we came he undid the box in which the butterfly was peacefully resting having found a tiny grain of sugar to feed on mr brent looked at it through his dark glasses hm hm he said peering closely at it yes very fine indeed ill buy it off you for five shillings oh you can have it for nothing said dick what is it cant say without examining it closely said mr brent and took the box and put the lid on again but isnt it some kind of fritillary asked julian we thought it was quite likely said mr brent and suddenly produced two halfcrowns and shoved them at dick here you are much obliged ill tell mr gringle you came he turned abruptly and went off his butterfly net still over his shoulder dick stared at the two halfcrowns in his hand then at the receding back of mr brent what a queer fellow he said well i must say that he and mr gringle are a pair what are we to do with this five shillings julian i dont want it lets see if we can give it to that poor mrs janes said julian always generous she looks as if they paid her only about a shilling a week poor soul they went round to the front of the house hoping to fmd the old woman and after a little hesitation knocked at the door it opened and she stood there mumbling as before you go away my sons coming back hell hit me he dont like strangers you go away i say all right said dick look heres something for you and he pressed the two halfcrowns into her clawlike hand she looked at them as if she couldnt believe her eyes and then amazingly quickly she slipped the money into one of her brokendown shoes when she stood up her eyes were full of tears youre kind she whispered and gave them a little push yes youre kind keep away from here my sons a bad man keep away the boys went off silently not knowing what to make of it after all toby knew the son they had employed him at the farm why did the old woman keep saying he was bad and cruel she must be at least a little mad to talk like that it must be a queer household said julian as they went to join the waiting girls two butterfly men both rather peculiar one old witchlike woman very peculiar and a son who seems to terrify her out of her wits i vote we dont go there again so do i said dick hallo you two did we keep you waiting long you did rather said anne we were just about to send timmy to look for you we thought you might have been turned into mice or something the boys told the two girls about mr brent and the five shillings and old mrs janes a funny household altogether said dick we think well give it a miss now however many rare butterflies we spot im pretty certain that the one we found was a kind of fritillary arent you julian yes i was surprised mr brent didnt say so said julian i have a feeling that mr gringle is the expert of the two mr brent probably does the donkeywork sees to the caterpillars and so on they came to their camp at last and timmy at once went to the larder but anne shook her head no tim its not nearly suppertime bad luck what shall we do asked dick flinging himself down on the heather its another heavenly evening yes but i dont much like the look of the sky over to the west tonight said julian see those clouds there coming up slowly against the wind it looks like rain tomorrow to me blow said george the weather might have lasted for just one week whatever shall we do if it pours sit in our tents all day i suppose cheer up we could go and see the caves said dick i know what well do now well get out our portable radio and turn it on if theres some decent music it will sound glorious up here all right but for goodness sake have it on softly said anne i loathe people who take radios out into the country with them and switch them on loudly so that it spoils the peace and quiet for everyone else i could go and kick their radios to pieces gracious anne you do sound fierce said george looking at her cousin in surprise you dont know our quiet sister anne quite as well as we do george said julian with a twinkle in his eyes she can be really fierce if she thinks anyone is spoiling things for others i had to stop her once from going up to scold people at a picnic they actually had a gramophone going fullpelt in spite of the angry looks from people all round i do believe she meant to take off the gramophone record and break it over somebodys head oh julian how can you say such a thing said anne i did feel like it but i didnt do it all right young anne said julian affectionately and patted her head both he and dick thought the world of their quiet kind little sister and looked after her well she smiled at them well lets have some music then she said theres the pastoral symphony on sometime this evening i know because i made a note of it it would sound beautiful out here in this lovely countryside with that view spreading for miles in front of us but softly please julian fetched the little radio set and took it out of its waterproof case he switched on and a voice came loudly from the set julian lowered the volume to make it softer its the seven oclock news he said well hear it shall we but it was almost the end of the news and the voice soon stopped to give way to an announcer yes it was going to be the pastoral symphony now soon the first notes came softly from the little radio and it seemed to set the countryside around to music the four settled down in the heather to listen lying halfpropped up to watch the changing colours of the view in front of them as the sun sank lower the bank of cloud on the horizon was higher now and the sun would soon slip behind it for it was coming up fast what a pity and then cutting across the music came another sound the sound of an aeroplane rrrrrrr rrrrrrr rrrrrrr it sounded so very loud that dick and julian leapt to their feet and timmy began to bark loudly where is it said dick puzzled it sounds so jolly near i wonder if its cousin jeffs there it is coming up over the back of the hill said julian and as he spoke a small aeroplane appeared over the brow of the hill and circled once before it flew down to the airfield the four children could plainly see the number painted underneath began julian and dick gave a shout its jeffs plane it is thats his number wave everybody wave so they all waved madly though they felt sure that jeff wouldnt see them tucked away in their camp on the hillside they watched the plane fly down to the airfield circle round and land neatly on the runway it came to a stop julian looked through his glasses and saw a small figure leap from the plane i bet its jeff he said gosh i do wish i had a plane to fly over the hills and far away chapter eleven a stormy night the five soon began to prepare for their evening meal and timmy trotted about pretending to help always hopeful of being allowed to carry a loaf of bread or piece of cold ham in his mouth but he was never lucky as they sat eating their meal julian glanced uneasily at the western sky again the rains certainly coming he said that cloud has covered half the sky now and swallowed up the evening sun i think we ought to put up the tents blow i suppose we ought said george and wed better do it quickly said dick i distinctly felt a nasty cold wind just then the first really cold air since we came here we shall certainly want to roll up in our rugs tonight well lets get the things out from under the old gorsebush said julian it wont take long to put up the tents if we all get to work in threequarters of an hour the tents were up set nicely in the shelter of the giant gorsebush a good businesslike job said dick pleased it would take a hurricane to blow the tents away well be quite all right here lets pull up some more heather and pile it in the tents we shall want our rugs to wrap ourselves in not to lie on tonight so we might as well make our beds as soft as possible they piled heather into the tents spread their macs there too and then looked at the sky yes there was no doubt about it there was rain coming and probably a storm still it might clear tomorrow and be as fine as ever if it wasnt they would go and explore the caves that toby had told them about it was now almost dark and the children decided that they would all get into one tent and have the radio on again they called timmy but he preferred to be outside they set the radio going but almost immediately timmy began to bark george switched off at once thats the bark he gives when somebody is coming she said i wonder who it is toby to say wed better go to the farm for the night guessed dick mr gringle hunting for moths said anne with a giggle old mrs janes looking for things to make spells with said george everyone laughed idiot said dick though i must say this looks a night for witches timmy went on barking and julian put his head out of the tent whats up tim he said whos coming wuff wuff said timmy not turning his head to julian but seeming to watch something or someone in the halflight it may be a hedgehog hes seen said george from inside the tent he always barks at them because he knows he cant pick them up well maybe youre right said julian but i think ill just go out and get timmy to take me to whatever it is hes barking at i feel id like to know he obviously hears or sees something he slid out of the tentopening and went to timmy come on tim he said who is it whats upsetting you timmy wagged his tail and ran in front of julian he obviously had no doubts about where he was going julian followed him stumbling over the heather and wishing he had brought his torch for it was now halfdark timmy ran some way down the hill towards the airfield then rounded a clump of birchtrees and stopped he barked loudly again julian saw a dark shadow moving there and called out whos there who is it its only me mr brent said an annoyed voice and julian caught sight of a long stick with a shadowy net on the end ive come out to examine our honeytraps before the rain comes and washes away the moths feeding there oh said julian i might have thought of that when timmy barked is mr gringle about too yes so if your dog barks again youll know its only us said mr brent were often prowling around at night this is just as good a hill for moths at night as it is for butterflies by day cant you stop that dog barking at me really hes very badly trained shut up tim ordered julian and timmy obediently closed his mouth but still stood stiffly staring at the man in the darkness im going on to our next honeytrap said the man so you can take that noisy dog back to wherever you are camping mr brent began to move away flashing a torch in front of him were just up the hill said julian about a hundred yards oh youve got a torch i see i wish id brought mine the man said nothing more but went slowly on his way the beam of his torch growing fainter julian began to climb back up the hill to the tents but in the growing darkness it was not easy he missed his way and went much too far to the right timmy was puzzled and went to him tugging gently at his sleeve am i going wrong said julian blow id soon get lost on this lonely hillside dick george anne give a shout will you i dont know where i am but he had wandered so far off the path that the three didnt hear him and timmy had to guide him for a good way before he saw the torches of the others flashing up above he felt most relieved he had no wish to be caught in a heavy rainstorm on the exposed side of billycock hill is that you julian called annes anxious voice what a long time youve been did you get lost almost said julian like a fathead i went without my torch but timmy here knew the way all right im glad im back its just beginning to rain who was tim barking at asked george one of the butterfly men mr brent the one dick and i saw today said julian i just caught the glint of his dark glasses in the halflight and saw the butterfly net he carried he said mr gringle was out too but whatever for with a storm coming marvelled anne all the moths would be well in hiding theyve come out to examine their mothtraps as they call them said julian they spread sticky stuff like honey or something round the trunks of trees and the moths fly down to it by the score then they come along and collect any they want to take back i see and i suppose mr brent was afraid the rain might wash away the clinging moths said dick well theyll both be caught in the storm thats certain hark at the rain pelting down on the tent now timmy squeezed into the tent not liking the sting of the heavy raindrops he sat down by george and anne you do take up a lot of room in a small tent tim said george cant you make yourself a bit smaller timmy couldnt he was a big dog and rather a sprawly one he put his wet head on georges knee and heaved a heavy sigh george patted him humbug she said what are you sighing about because youve finished your bone because its raining and you cant go and sit and bark at anything moving on the hill what shall we do now said julian setting his torch on the radio set so that it more or less lighted up the tent theres nothing on the radio we want to hear ive got a pack of cards in the pocket of my mac said george much to everybodys joy and she got them out lets have a game of some sort it was rather dificult in the small tent with timmy sometimes getting up just when all the cards were neatly dealt and upsetting the piles the storm grew fiercer and the rain tried its best to lash its way through the canvas of the little tent then timmy began to bark again startling everyone very much he climbed over legs and knees and poked his head out of the tent opening barking loudly good gracious you almost gave me a heart attack said dick pulling him back youll get soaked out there tim come back its only those mad mothmen out there picking moths off rainsoaked honeytraps dont worry about them theyre probably enjoying themselves enormously but timmy simply would not stop barking and even growled when julian tried to drag him into the tent whatevers up with him said julian bewildered oh stop it timmy youre deafening us somethings upsetting him something unusual said george listen was that a yell everyone listened but the rain was pelting down so hard that it was impossible to hear anything but the slashing rain and the wind well we cant do much about it whatever it is thats upsetting timmy said dick we cant possibly go wandering about in this storm wed get soaked through and probably lost timmy was still barking and george grew cross timmy stop do you hear me i wont have it it was so seldom that george was angry with him that timmy turned in surprise george pounced at his collar and dragged him forcibly into the tent now be quiet she commanded whatever it is we cant do anything about it just then another noise rose above the howling of the wind and the torrents of rain and the five pricked up their ears at once sitting absolutely still rrrrrrrrr rrrrrrrrrrr rrrrrrrrrrr rrrrrrrrrr they all looked round at one another aeroplanes said dick aeroplanes in this weather too whatever is going on chapter twelve what happened in billycock caves the little company in the tent were amazed why should aeroplanes take off from the airfield in the middle of a stormy night for experiments in storms perhaps said dick no that would be rather unnecessary perhaps they were aeroplanes landing there not leaving suggested anne possibly perhaps seeking the shelter of the airfield when they were caught in this storm said dick but julian shook his head no he said this airfield is too far off the ordinary airroutes nobody would bother about it its so small for one thing more of a little experimental station than anything else any aeroplane in difficulties could easily go to a firstclass airfield for shelter or help i wonder if jeff went up in one of the two we heard said george anne yawned what about bedding down she said this tent is so hot and stuffy that i feel halfasleep yes its getting late said julian looking at his watch you two girls and timmy can have this tent it will save you going out into the rain fasten the flap after weve gone and yell if you want anything right good night ju good night dick said the girls and the boys scrambled out into the rain anne fastened the flap of the tent and wrapped her rug round her she burrowed into her heathery bed and made herself comfortable george did the same good night said anne sleepily keep tim on your side i cant bear him on my legs hes so heavy the five slept soundly and awoke the next morning to a dismal scene of rain and dark clouds how disappointing said dick peering out of his tent we ought to have listened to the weather forecast to see if it would clear today whats the time julian just gone eight said julian my word we are sleepy these days well its not raining so very hard now lets see if the girls are awake and put on our macs and go and wash at the spring they all had breakfast not quite so merry as usual because it was a bit of a crowd in the tent and not nearly so much fun as having it in the sunshine still the day might clear and then they could go down to see toby at the farm i suppose wed better go and explore those caves this morning said dick after breakfast theres nothing else to do and i refuse to play cards all morning we all refuse said george lets put on our macs and see if we can find the caves we can look at the map said julian its a largescale one there must be a road or lane to them they are quite wellknown theyre probably round the hill a bit lower down well never mind well see if we can find them and if we cant it wont matter we shall have been for a walk said dick they set off in a fine drizzle walking through the damp heather timmy leaping in front everyone got torches said dick suddenly ive got mine well need them in the caves yes everyone had a torch except timmy and he as anne pointed out had eyes that were far better for seeing in the dark than any torch could ever be they made their way down the hill and then veered off to the north side and came suddenly upon a wide rather chalky path where the heather had been cut well back this rather looks as if it led somewhere said julian stopping it might lead to an old chalk quarry said dick kicking some loose white lumps of chalk like the one near kirrin well lets follow it up and see said george and they went along it kicking the lumps of chalk as they went they rounded a corner and saw a notice to billycock caves warning keep only to the roped ways beware of losing your way in the unroped tunnels this sounds good said julian lets see what did toby tell us about the caves theyre thousands of years old theyve got stalagmites and stalactites said george oh i know what those are said anne they look like icicles hanging from the roof while below on the floor of the cave other icicles seem to grow upwards to meet them yes the roof ones are stalactites and the ground ones are stalagmites said dick i simply never can remember which is which said anne its easy said julian the stalactite icicles have to hold tight to the roof and the stalagmite might some day join with the ones above them the others laughed i shall never forget which are which now said anne the path they were following altered as they came near to the caves and lost its chalky look just in front of the entrance the way was properly paved and was no longer rough the entrance was only about six feet high and had over it a white board with two words painted very large in black billycock caves the warning they had read on the first notice they had come to was repeated on another one just inside the entrance read it tim said george seeing him looking at it and keep close to us they went right in and had to switch on their torches at once timmy was amazed to see the walls around him glittering suddenly in the light of the four torches he began to bark and the noise echoed all around in a very weird manner timmy didnt like it and he pressed close to george she laughed come on silly these are only caves youve been in plenty in your life timmy goodness dont they feel cold im glad of my mac they passed through one or two small and ordinary caves and then came to a magnificent one full of what looked like gleaming icicles some hung down from the roof others rose up from the ground in some places the one below had reached to the one hanging down so that they had joined making it look as if the cave was held up by great shining pillars oh said anne catching her breath what a wonderful sight how they gleam and shine it reminds me of cathedrals i have seen said julian looking up at the roof of the cave i dont know why all these finelywrought pillars come along lets go into the next cave the next one was smaller but contained some splendid coloured icicles that shone and gleamed in the light of the torches its like a cave in fairyland said anne full of rainbow colours the following cave had no colour but was of a dazzling white walls roof floor and pillars so many stalactites and stalagmites had joined that they almost formed a snowwhite screen through which the children peered only to see even more of the strange icicles they came to a threefold forking of the ways the centre one was roped but the other two tunnels were not the children looked down the unroped tunnels stretching away so dark and quiet and shivered how awful to go down one and lose the way never to be found again perhaps iets go down the roped way said george just to see where it leads to more caves probably timmy ran sniffing down one of the other ways and george called him tim youll get lost come back but timmy didnt come back he ran off into the darkness and the others felt cross blow him said dick whats he after tim tim the echoes took up the last word and sent it repeatedly up and down the passage timmy barked in answer and at once the place was full of weird barking echoing everywhere and making anne put her fingers to her ears woofoofoofoof said the echoes sounding as if a gang of dogs were barking madly in the caves then timmy appeared in the light of their torches looking extremely surprised at the enormous noise he had created with his barking i shall put you on the lead timmy scolded george keep to heel now surely you understand what that word means after all these years timmy did he kept faithfully to heel as the little company went along a narrow roped tunnel and came out into a succession of dazzling caves all linked together by little passages or tunnels they kept only to those that were roped many of them were not and the five longed to see where they led to but were sensible enough not to try and then as they were examining what looked like a frozen pool which reflected the snowy roof above like a mirror a curious noise came to their ears they straightened themselves and listened it was a whistling sound highpitched and shrill that filled the cave and filled their eardrums too until they felt like bursting it rose high then died down then rose again till the children were forced to put their hands to their heads and died away timmy couldnt bear it he barked frantically and ran round and round like a mad thing and then the second noise began a howling a howling that seemed to be tossed to and fro and grew louder as the echoes threw it about from cave to cave anne clutched dick terrified what is it she said quick lets go and led by an extremely scared timmy the five raced pellmell out of billycock caves as if a hundred dogs were after them chapter thirteen a dreadful shock the five stood panting outside the entrance of the caves feeling decidedly sheepish at having run away from a noise whew said julian mopping his forehead that was decidedly weird that whistling it got inside my head it was like a like a police whistle gone mad or something as for the howling well it was horrible said anne looking quite pale like wild animals im not going into those caves again for anything lets get back to the camp they walked soberly down the chalkstrewn path that led away from the caves and made their way back to their camp the rain had stopped now and the clouds were beginning to break the five sat down inside a tent and discussed the matter well ask toby if its usual for noises like that to be heard said dick i wonder anyone ever visits the caves if it is infested with horrible whistles and screeches like that all the same we were a bit cowardly said julian now feeling rather ashamed of himself well go back and do a bit of howling yourself suggested george it may frighten the howler as much as his howling scared you nothing doing said julian promptly im not going in for any howling matches he burrowed down under the rug for his fieldglasses and slung them round his neck im going to have a squint at the airfield he said just to see if i can spot cousin jeff he put the glasses to his eyes and focused them on the airfield below them he gave a sudden exclamation theres quite a lot doing on the airfield this morning he said in surprise dozens of people there i wonder whats up there are quite a lot of planes too they must all have arrived this morning each of the others took a turn at looking through the glasses yes julian was right there was certainly something going on at the airfield today men hurried about and then came the noise of yet another aeroplane which zoomed neatly down to the runway gosh another plane said dick where did all the others come from we never heard them they must have arrived while we were in the caves said dick i wish we could ask tobys cousin jeff what all the excitement is about we could go down to the farm after our lunch and see if he has heard anything suggested anne and the others agreed thank goodness the suns coming out again said george as a shaft of warm sunlight burst out from behind a cloud and the sun sailed into a patch of blue sky the heather will soon dry now lets have the news on we may just catch the weather forecast i dont want to carry my mac about if its going to clear up they switched on the little radio set but they had missed the weather news blow said dick and raised his hand to switch off and then he heard two words that stopped him they were billycock hill he left his hand suspended in the air and listened full of surprise the announcers voice came clearly to the four the aeroplanes stolen from billycock hill airfield were two valuable ones into which had been incorporated new devices said the voice from the radio it is possible that they were stolen because of these we regret that it appears that two of our best pilots flew them away flightlieutenant jeffrey thomas and flightlieutenant ray wells no news has been received of either plane both disappeared during a storm over billycock hill during the night there was a pause and then the announcer went on to another item of news dick switched off the radio and looked blankly at the others no one had a word to say at first to think that jeff could do a thing like that jeft a traitor flying off with a plane of ours to sell to an enemy said julian at last voicing the thought of all the others we heard the planes go said dick two of them gosh we ought to go to the police and tell what we know not that its much but i say fancy jeff doing that i liked him so much so did i said anne turning her head away so did timmy said george and he hardly ever makes a mistake in anyone what will poor toby do said dick he thought the world of jeff timmy suddenly ran off a few yards and began barking a welcoming bark this time julian looked to see who was coming it was toby he came up to them and sat down beside them he looked pale and shocked though he tried to smile at them ive got awful news he said in a queer croaking voice we know said dick weve just heard it on the radio oh toby fancy jeff to everyones horror tobys face crumpled up and tears poured down his cheeks he made no attempt to wipe them away indeed he hardly seemed to know that they were there nobody knew what to do except timmy dear old tim scrambled over julian and most sympathetically licked tobys wet face whining as he did so toby put his arm round the dogs neck and began to speak it wasnt jeff jeff couldnt have done such a thing he couldnt you know he couldnt dont you he turned quite fiercely on the others as he spoke i cant believe that he did said julian he seemed to me to be absolutely straight and trustworthy even though i only met him that once he was well a sort of hero to me said toby beginning to mop his cheeks with his hanky and staring in surprise to see it so damp gosh im a sissy to go on like this but when the military police came to our farm this morning to ask questions about jeff hes my dads nephew you know i couldnt believe my ears i was so furious with one fathead that i punched him and mother sent me out of the room i suppose both jeff and the other fellow have definitely gone asked julian no other pilots are missing are they no i asked that said toby dismally everyone answered rollcall at the camp this morning except jeff and ray ray is jeffs best friend you know it looks bad said dick after a long pause but its not true that jeffs a traitor cried toby up in arms again are you suggesting that he is no im not said dick dont be an ass i dont then he stopped as timmy ran off and barked fiercely now who was coming a deep voice called to timmy down boy down where are your friends julian scrambled up and saw two military policemen standing facing the excited timmy here tim called julian its all right friends timmy ran to him and the two burly men came up you the children camping on this hill asked the fist one well we want to ask you a few questions about last night you were here then werent you yes sir we know what youve come about too said julian well tell you all we know but were pretty certain that flightlieutenant thomas hadnt anything to do with it sir thats as maybe said the man well sit down all of you and well have a little talk soon they were sitting down in the heather while julian told all they knew which wasnt much just the sound of the two aeroplanes flying off together and you heard nothing suspicious last night nothing to all asked the first man nothing said julian nobody about at all i suppose asked the second man looking up from his notebook in which he had been writing oh well yes there were people about said julian suddenly remembering the butterfly man mr brent who had said that he and mr gringle were out looking at their mothtraps the first policeman asked some rapid questions and julian and the others told them what little they knew though julian knew the most of course youre sure it was mr brent you saw asked the policeman well he said he was said julian and he carried a butterfly net on his shoulder and he wore the same dark glasses i saw him wearing in the morning of course it was pretty dark but i honestly think it was mr brent i didnt see or hear mr gringle mr brent said he was some way off theyre both mad on moth and butterfly hunting i see said the policeman and the second one shut his notebook thanks very much i think well just go and pay a call on these er what do you call them butterfly men where do they hang out the children offered to guide them on their way and the whole company went with the two burly men almost to the butterfiy farm well thanks a lot said the first policeman as they came near the tumbledown cottage well go on alone now you get back to your camp sir will you send us word as soon as you know it wasnt my cousin jeff asked toby forlornly hell be getting in touch with you i know as soon as he hears what hes suspected of its bad luck on you son hes your cousin isnt he said the big policeman kindly but youll have to make up your mind to it it was jeff thomas all right that flew off in one of those aeioplanes last night there isnt a doubt of it chapter fourteen mr gringle is annoyed the military police went off down the hill to the butterfly farm and the five children stood disconsolately watching them with timmy staring too tail well down he didnt quite know what had happened but he was sure it was something dreadful well its no good waiting about here i suppose said julian i bet the police wont get anything useful out of the butterfly men they wouldnt have noticed anything when they were out last night except their precious moths they were just turning away when they heard someone screaming in a high voice and they stopped to listen in surprise it must be old mrs janes said dick whats up with her wed better see said julian and he and the others with timmy at their heels went quickly down to the cottage they heard the voices of the two policemen as they came near now now old lady dont take on so one was saying in a kindly voice weve only come to ask a few questions go away go away screamed the old woman and actually battered at the men with her little bony hands why are you here go away i tell you now listen ma dont take on so said the other man patiently we want to talk to mr gringle and mr brent are they here who who did you say oh them theyre out with their nets mumbled the old woman im all alone her and im scairt of strangers you go away listen said one policeman were mr gringle and mr brent out on the hills last night im in my bed at nights she answered how would i know you go away and leave me in peace the policemen looked at one another and shook their heads it was clearly quite useless to find out anything from this frightened old woman well well go ma said one patting her shoulder gently sorry weve scared you theres nothing to be afraid of they turned away and came back up the slope of the hill seeing the children standing silently there we heard old mrs janes screaming said julian so we came to see what was happening the butterfly men as you call them are out with their nets said one policeman a funny life i must say catching insects and looking after their eggs and caterpillars well i dont suppose they know anything about last nights job not that theres anything to know two pilots flew off with the planes we know who they were and thats that well one was not my cousin jeff said toby fiercely the men shrugged their shoulders and went off together the five children went off up the hill again very silent i think wed better have something to eat said julian at last weve had no lunch and its long past our usual time toby stay and have some with us i couldnt eat a thing said toby not a thing get out what weve got anne and george said julian and the girls and timmy went to the little larder nobody really felt like eating but when the food was there in front of them they found that they were quite hungry except poor toby who sat forlorn and palefaced trying to chew through a sandwich made for him by anne but not making a very good job of it timmy began to bark in the middle of the meal and everyone looked to see who was coming now julian thought he saw a movement some way down the hill and took his fieldglasses and put them to his eyes i think its mr gringle he said i can see his net too hes out butterflying i suppose lets shout to him said dick we can tell him why the police went to call at his cottage this morning when he wasnt there hell never get any sense out of old mrs janes julian cooeed and there came an answering call hes coming up said dick timmy ran to meet him and soon the man was just below them panting as he made his way up the steep slope i hoped id see you he said i want you to look out for some special moths for me another dayflying one like the sixspot burnet you saw the other day its the cinnabar moth its got rich crimson underwings and yes i know that one said julian well look out for it we just wanted to tell you that two military policemen went to your cottage a little while ago to ask you some questions about last night and as were sure old mrs janes wont be able to explain anything to you we thought wed better tell you ourselves mr gringle looked absolutely blank and bewildered but but why on earth should military policemen come to our cottage he said at last for nothing much said julian only to ask you if you saw anything suspicious when you were out looking at your mothtraps last night you see two aeroplanes were mr gringle interrupted in a most surprised voice but but dear boy i wasnt out at all last night it wouldnt have been a bit of good looking for moths anywhere on our mothtraps or anywhere else on a night like that well said julian also surprised we saw your friend mr brent and he said you were both out looking at your mothtraps mr gringle stared at julian as if he were mad and his mouth fell open in amazement mr brent he said at last but peter thats mr brent was at home with me we were busy writing up our notes together there was a silence after this surprising statement julian frowned what was all this was mr gringle trying to hide the fact that he and his friend had been out on the hills the night before well i certainly saw mr brent said julian at last it was very dark i admit but im sure i saw his butterfly net and his dark glasses he doesnt wear dark glasses said mr gringle still more astonished what is this tale is it a joke of some sort if you cant talk better sense than this im going wait said dick something else occurring to him you say that mr brent doesnt wear dark glasses then who was the man that took the moth from us yesterday evening about six oclock and gave us five shillings he said he was mr brent your friend this is all nonsense said mr gringle getting up angrily wasting my time on a poor joke of this kind brent doesnt wear dark glasses i tell you and he wasnt at home at six oclock yesterday wed been to buy some tackle in the next town he was with me not at the cottage you couldnt possibly have seen him what do you mean by all this nonsense dark glasses five shillings for a moth and seeing brent on the hillside last night when he didnt stir out of the house he was now standing up looking very fierce his brilliant eyes flashing behind his thick glasses well said julian all this is extremely puzzling and puzzling youre nothing but a pack of nitwitted illmannered children suddenly roared mr gringle quite losing his temper tirnmy gave a warning growl and stood up he didnt allow anyone to rave at his friends mr gringle went off angrily trampling down the heather as if he were trampling down the children they heard him muttering to himself as he went off they looked at one another in really great surprise well i simply dont know what to make of all this said julian helplessly was i dreaming last night no i did see that fellow halfsee him anyway and he did say he was mr brent and that gringle was somewhere near but if he wasnt brent who was he and what was he doing on a stormy night hunting moths nobody could make even a guess toby spoke first perhaps the man you saw was mixed up in the stealing of those aeroplanes you never know impossible toby said julian thats too farfetched i cant say that i understand it at all but honestly he didnt seem like a man who could steal an aeroplane who was the man that gave us the five shillings then if it wasnt brent said dick puzzled could it have been mrs janes son pretending he was brent just for a silly joke said george what was he like asked toby at once i know will janes i told you hes often been to our farm we dont have him now because he drinks so much and he isnt reliable any more what was this man brent like id soon know if he was will janes pretending to be someone else he was small and thin with dark glasses began dick and toby interrupted him at once then it wasnt will janes hes tall and burly with a thick neck and anyway he doesnt wear dark glasses or any glasses at all then who in the world was it and why did he pretend to be brent gringles friend wondered dick everyone frowned and puzzled over the whole thing but nobody could think of a sensible reason for anyone wanting to pretend to be mr brent well for goodness sake lets get on with our meal said george at last we stopped in the middle of it and the rest is still waiting for us have another ham sandwich julian they all munched in silence thinking hard toby sighed i dont really feel that this mixup with the butterfly men and somebody else whoever he is has anything to do with the stealing of the aeroplanes i wish it had all the same it wants looking into said dick seriously and whats more i vote we keep our eyes and ears open somethings going on at butterfly farm chapter fifteen more news and a night trip the five spent most of the afternoon talking about the mystery of the man who had pretended to be mr brent it really was difficult to understand why anyone should do such a foolish thing especially as it could be so easily found out i can only think theres a madman about who has got it into his head that he is mr brent said dick at last no wonder he didnt seem to recognize that butterfly we took him do you know what i think would be a good idea suddenly said george why dont we slip down to butterfly farm tonight when its getting dark and see if the false mr brent is there and the real one whom weve never seen by the way and mr gringle hm yes quite an idea said julian seriously but only dick and i will go not you or anne ill come too said toby right said julian but well have to be jolly careful because if there is something funny going on down there we dont want to be caught it wouldnt be at all pleasant i fear take timmy with you said george at once no he might bark or something said dick well be all right george gracious weve had enough adventures by now to teach us how to go about things like this ha i shall look forward to tonight everyone suddenly felt much more cheerful even toby he managed a very small smile and stood up to brush the crumbs off his jersey im going now he said ive a lot of farm jobs to do this afternoon ill meet you at the big oaktree behind the butterfly farm did you notice it yes an enormous one said julian right be there at say ten oclock no eleven it will be dark by then or almost so long said toby and plunged down the hill accompanied for a little way by timmy well i feel much better now weve made a definite plan said dick my goodness its half past five already dont suggest tea george we had our lunch so late i wasnt going to said george well miss it out and have a really good supper later on and dont lets forget to listen to the news at six oclock there might be some about jeff and his friend ray and the aeroplanes so just before six oclock they switched on the little radio set and listened intently for the news it came at last and almost the first piece was about the stolen aeroplanes the children listened holding their breath bending close to the set the two aeroplanes stolen from billycock airfield last night flown away by flightlieutenant jeffrey thomas and flightlieutenant ray wells have been found both planes apparently crashed into the sea but were seen and there is a chance of their being salvaged the pilots were not found and are presumed to have been drowned at edinburgh this afternoon there was a grand rally of julian switched off the news and looked at the others soberly well thats that crashed both of them that was because of the storm i suppose well at least no enemy will be able to get hold of the new devices that were incorporated in the planes but that means tobys cousin is drowned or killed said anne her face very white yes but remember if he flew away in that plane he was a traitor to his country said dick gravely and traitors deserve to die but tobys cousin didnt seem like a traitor said george he seemed so well so very british and i cant say anything finer than that i feel as if i shall never trust my judgment of anyone again i liked him so very much so did i said dick frowning well these things happen but i just wish it hadnt been tobys cousin he was such a hero to him i dont feel as if toby will ever be quite the same after this its something so absolutely beastly nobody said anything for a little while they were all profoundly shocked not only by the idea of cousin jeff being a traitor but also by the news that he had been drowned it seemed such a horrible end to come to that brighteyed smiling your airman they had joked with only the other day and yet it was an end that a traitor deserved and that the other man deserved too do you think we ought to pack up and go home said anne i mean wont it be awkward for the thomass to have us hanging round when they must feel shocked and unhappy no we dont need to bother them much at the farm said julian and i dont think we can desert old toby at the moment it will help him to have friends around you know yes youre right said dick this is the sort of time to have good friends poor old toby hell be knocked out by this last piece of news will he be waiting for you at the old oaktree tonight do you think asked george dont know said julian it doesnt rnatter if hes not there anyway dick and i can do all the snooping round that is necessary and it will take our minds off this shock a bit to try and solve the mystery down at butterfly farm they went for a walk round the hill with timmy leaping over the heather in delight he couldnt understand the lack of laughter and the unusual solemnity shown by his four friends and he was pleased to be able to forget any troubles and sniff for rabbits they had their suppers at eight oclock and then turned on the radio to listen to a programme well hear the news at nine said dick just in case there might be any more but the nine oclock news only repeated what had been said about the two planes in the six oclock broadcast and not a word more dick switched off and gazed down at the airfield below there were still quite a lot of planes there though some of them had taken off and flown away during the day julian trained his fieldglasses on the field not so many men scurrying about now he said things are quietening down my word what a shock it must have been for everyone there last night to hear the planes revved up and then flown away they must have been amazed maybe they didnt hear them go in the storm said george they must have said dick we heard them up here well what about you girls turningin dick and i dont want to in case we fall off to sleep weve got to slip away about half past ten or we shant be down at the oaktree at eleven i wish youd take timmy with you said george uneasily i dont like butterfly farm or the witchlike old woman there or the man you met with dark glasses who wasnt mr brent or the son you havent seen dont be an ass george said julian we shall be back by twelve i expect and timmy is sure to bark in welcome so youll know were safe the girls wouldnt go to their tent to sleep so they all sat and talked and watched the sun slip behind the clear horizon the weather was now perfect again and there wasnt a cloud in the sky it was difficult to imagine the sweeping rain and howling wind of last nights storm well said julian at last looking at his watch time we went timmy look after the girls as usual woof said timmy understanding perfectly and you look after yourselves said anne well come down a little way with you its such a lovely evening they all set off together and the girls went halfway to the butterfly farm and then turned back with timmy well tim mind you bark at twelve when they come back said anne though somehow i think that both george and i will still be awake the two boys went on down the hill and round to the right across towards butterfly farm it was almost dark now though the june night was very clear and bright better be careful were not seen muttered julian its such a clear night they made their way to the big old oaktree that stood at the back of the butterfly farm toby was not there but in about two minutes they heard a slight rustling noise and saw toby panting a little as if he had been hurrying then he was close beside them sorry im a bit late he whispered i say did you hear the six oclock news yes we were awfully sorry about it said julian well as i still dont believe that cousin jeff stole the aeroplanes with ray wells but that somebody else did i wasnt any more upset than before said toby if jeff didnt steal the plane he wasnt in it when it crashed so hes not drowned see yes i see said julian glad that toby had taken the news in that way but convinced himself that there wasnt really much hope what are your plans whispered toby there are lights in the cottage windows and i dont think any curtains are pulled we could go and peep into each one and see exactly who is there good idea said julian come on and for goodness sake dont make a noise single file of course ill lead the way and silently and slowly they went round the oaktree and down to the tumbledown cottage what would they see there when they looked through those lighted windows chapter sixteen looking through windows the three tiptoed quietly up to the cottage dont go too near when you look in whispered julian keep a little distance away we shall be able to see who is in the rooms but they mustnt be able to see us outside i sincerely hope they wont look in the downstairs rooms said dick see thats the kitchen window over there old mrs janes may be there if shes still up they crept to the uncurtained window the room was lighted by only a candle and was full of shadows the boys gazed in old mrs james was there sitting up in a brown rockingchair clad in a dirty dressinggown she rocked herself to and fro and although the boys could not see her face they sensed that the old woman was frightened and unhappy her head sank on her chest and when she put her wispy hair back from her face her hand shook shes no witch poor old thing whispered dick feeling quite sad to see her rocking to and fro all by herself so late at night shes just a poor frightened old woman why is she up so late wondered julian she must be waiting for someone yes she might be wed better look out then said toby at once looking behind him as if he expected to see someone creeping up now lets go round to the front said dick so they tiptoed there and saw another lighted window much more brightly lighted than the kitchen window had been they kept a little way from the pane afraid of being seen they looked in and saw two men there sitting at a table poring over some papers mr gringle said julian in a low voice no doubt about that and the other one must be his friend mr brent i suppose certainly he isnt wearing dark glasses as that man was we gave the butterfly to and who gave us five shillings he isnt a bit like him they all looked intently at the friend he was a perfectly ordinary man with a small moustache dark hair and a rather big nose not in the least like the mr brent they had seen the day before what are they doing whispered toby it looks as if theyre making lists of something probably making out bills for their customers said julian anyway i must say they look perfectly ordinary sitting there doing a perfectly ordinary job i think mr gringle was speaking the truth when he said that it wasnt mr brent who gave us the five shillings and it certainly wasnt him either that i saw on the hillside last night with a butterfly net then who was it asked dick pulling the others right away from the window in order to talk more easily and why did he carry the butterfly net and tell that lie about mothtraps why was he on the hill the night the planes were stolen yes why was he id like to ask him that said toby in too loud a voice the others nudged him at once and he spoke more softly something funny was going on last night something people dont know anything about id like to find that phony mr brent you met on the hillside julian well maybe we shall said julian now any other window lighted yes one up there under the roof whos there i wonder perhaps its mrs janes son said dick it would be just like him to take one of the three bedrooms and make her sleep downstairs in the old rockingchair i expect the other two little rooms up there are used by the butterfly men how can we see into the lighted room wondered toby look if we got up in that tree there wed see in theres an easier way said julian switching his torch on and off very quickly giving the others just half a second to see a ladder leaning against a nearby woodshed good yes that would be much easier said dick but well have to be jolly quiet whoever is in there would come to the window at once if he so much as heard the top of the ladder grating against the windowledge well well manage it all right said julian the window isnt very high and the ladder isnt very heavy between us we can place it very gently against the wall without disturbing anyone the ladder was certainly quite light the boys found no difficulty in carrying it slowly and carefully across to the cottage they placed it against the wall without a sound ill go up whispered julian hold the ladder steady and for goodness sake keep a lookout give me a signal if you hear anything at all because i dont want to be trapped at the top of the ladder the others held the sides as he climbed the rather rickety rungs he came to the lighted window and very cautiously and slowly lifted his head until he could see right into the room it was lighted by a candle a very small and untidy room poorly furnished a man sat on the bed there a big hulking man with broad shoulders and a neck like a bull julian gazed at him yes that must be mrs janes son who she said was so unkind to her julian remembered the old mumbling voice saying that her son was cruel he hits me he twists my arm yes the man on the bed could be a nasty bully no doubt about that he was reading a newspaper close to the candle as julian looked at him he pulled out a big watch from his pocket and stared at it muttering something that julian couldnt hear he stood up and the boy was so afraid that he might come to the window that he slithered down the ladder as quickly as possible the sons in there he whispered to the others i was afraid he was coming to the window to look out thats why i slid down so quickly blow ive got a splinter in the palm of my hand doing that toby could you creep up to the top in a minute or two and look in just to make sure im right and that it is will janes the old womans son toby went up the ladder as soon as they were certain that will janes was not going to look out he came down almost at once yes thats will but my word he has changed whispered toby he looks a brute now and yet he was a kind decent fellow not so long ago mother said hed fallen in with a bad set of fellows and had taken to drinking so i suppose hes quite different now he looked at his watch as if he was expecting someone said julian i wonder now i wonder if the man who paraded about the hillside last night with a net is coming here tonight i must say id like to get a good look at him he cant be up to any good well lets hide somewhere and wait suggested toby nobody knows ive slipped out to be with you so i shant be missed anyway mother wouldnt mind if she knew i was on a night trip with you two well hide in that barn over there said julian and on tiptoe again they crossed to an old ruined barn whose roof was partly off and whose walls were falling in it smelt dirty and there seemed no clean place to sit in but at last julian pulled out some dusty sacks and they laid them in a corner and sat there waiting in the dark pooh said dick what a horrible smell in here old rotting potatoes or something i wish wed chosen somewhere else sh said julian suddenly giving him a nudge that made him jump i can hear something they all sat silent and listened they could certainly hear something yes quiet footsteps very quiet made by rubbersoled shoes the soft sounds passed by the barn and they could no longer hear them then came a soft low whistle julian stood up and looked through the broken barn window i think there are two men standing below will janes bedroom he whispered they must be the men he was waiting for hell be coming down i hope to goodness they dont come into this barn to talk this was a horrible thought but there was no chance of going anywhere else because at that moment the front door opened and will janes came out julian still looking through the broken pane could see him dimly outlined in the light that came from mr gringles front window the three men went off very quietly round the cottage come on said julian lets shadow them we might hear something to explain whats up whats the time asked dick i hope the girls wont start worrying about us it must be gone twelve by now yes it is said julian looking at the luminous hands of his watch it cant be helped theyll guess were on to something they crept after the three men who went to a clump of trees on the other side of the glasshouses there they began to talk but in such low tones that the three boys could hear nothing but the murmur of the voices then one man raised his voice it was will janes toby recognized it at once and told the others its will hes furious about something he always loses his temper when he thinks people have treated him badly in any way and it sounds as if he thinks those two men have the two men tried to quiet him but he would not be pacified i want my money the boys heard him say i helped you didnt i i hid you here didnt i till the job was done then give me my money his voice rose almost to a shout and the two men with him grew frightened exactly what happened next the boys never knew but quite suddenly there was the sound of a blow and a fall then another blow and a fall and will janes laughed it was not a nice laugh in a few seconds there came an anxious voice from the window of the room where mr gringle and his friend were at work whos there whats happening crash that was the sound of breaking glass will janes had picked up a big stone and flung it at the nearby glasshouse it made the three boys almost jump out of their skins its all right sir i came out to see who was prowling about shouted will janes and whoever it was has broken some of the glass in your butterfly house ive been out here shouting trying to catch him he came blundering towards the house and then as luck would have it his torch picked out the three crouching boys he gave a yell whos this here they are sir kids whove been trying to smash the glass catch them thats right ive got two of them you catch the third chapter seventeen quite a lot happens things then happened so quickly that to their utter amazement the three boys found themselves captives quite unable to escape big will janes had hold of both dick and toby and he was so strong and held them in such a vicelike grip one in each hand that it was hopeless to try to get away julian had run straight into mr gringle and mr brent and the men had captured him between them they were very angry what do you mean by coming here and snooping round smashing our glasshouses yelled mr gringle shaking julian in his rage we shall lose all our butterflies through that broken pane let me go we didnt break your glass shouted julian he did i saw him shouted will janes you didnt cried toby let me go will im toby thomas from billycock farm you let me go or my father will have something to say oho so its toby thomas is it said will in a sneering voice toby thomas whose father wont employ will janes now because he turns his nose up at him you wait till i tell the police tomorrow what ive caught you doing ill say youre the kids that have been taking our hens will dragged the angry boys over to a shed calling out to the other two men bring them here chuck them in and well lock the door and let them cool off till tomorrow morning julian struggled valiantly against the two men but short of kicking them viciously there was nothing he could do to escape and he didnt really want to harm them it was all a mistake and then oh joy there came a sound that made julians heart leap the bark of a dog timmy its timmy yelled julian to the others call him hell soon make janes drop you tim tim shouted dick and timmy ran to him at once and began to growl so ferociously that will janes stopped dragging the boys to the shed set us free or hell spring at you warned dick timmy growled again and nipped wills ankle just to let him know he had teeth will let both boys go and they staggered away from him in relief then tirnmy ran to julian but mr gringle and mr brent had already heard his fierce growls and did not wait for any more they gave julian a shove away from them and retreated into the cottage will janes also went into the cottage and lumbered up the stairs the boys saw his figure outlined against the candlelight well thank goodness he didnt go and scare his poor old mother said julian shaking his clothes straight they had been twisted and pulled in the struggle wed better go and see if will knocked those two men out gracious what a night good old timmy you just came in time i bet the girls sent him after us when twelve oclock came said dick hed smell our tracks easily dear old tim now go carefully its about here that will floored those two men whoever they were but there was no sign of the men at all they must have got up from the ground very quickly and made themselves scarce they went while the going was good said toby grimly what do we do next get back to the camp said julian were really not much wiser now than when we came except that we know that gringle and brent are butterfly men and that janes was a bad lot and in with those two fellows he knocked out and that he helped them in some way and hid them here and hasnt been paid finished dick but how did he help them and why ive no idea said julian i cant think any more tonight my mind just wont work go back home toby well talk it all out tomorrow toby went off to the farm puzzled and excited what an evening what would cousin jeff say when he told him but no he couldnt tell him people said he had gone off in that plane and that he was now at the bottom of the sea but i wont believe it thought the tired boy stoutly i will not believe it the girls were most relieved to hear the boys and timmy coming back what happened why are you so late said george timmy found you all right of course couldnt have come at a better moment said julian grinning in the light of georges torch i suppose you sent him after us we did said george he wanted to go anyway he kept whining and whining as if you needed help so we sent him off and we did need help said dick flinging himself down in the heather listen to our tale he and julian told it and the girls listened astonishedwhat has been going on down there said george puzzled what has will janes been up to with those fellows how can we find out he wont talk said julian nobody can make him either but i think maybe if we went down tomorrow morning and found that hed gone out we might persuade old mrs janes to tell us a few secrets yes thats a good idea said george she must know what her son has been up to especially if he has been hiding people there she would have to feed them of course yes old mrs janes could tell you if she would but now said julian snuggling down in the heather on his rug now you two gabblers i want to go to sleep good night well whos been doing the gabbling said george we have hardly been able to get a word in come on anne we can go to sleep all right now i wonder if tobys home safely and fast asleep in bed yes toby was home but he wasnt asleep he was still brooding over his cousin jeff if only he could do something but he couldnt cousin jeff had disappeared and he and he only could clear himself of the hateful charge of traitor but people said he was drowned next morning the five awoke late even timmy there wasnt a great deal left in the larder and julian hoped that toby would bring up some more food if not they must certainly go down to billycock farm and get some they breakfasted on bread and butter and cheese with water to wash it down and a humbug from the tin to follow well go straight down to the butterfly farm i think said julian taking the leadership as he always did when there was any quick decision to be made dick youd better take on the asking of questions the old lady was so touched when you gave her that five shillings shes probably got a soft spot for you now right said dick well are we ready they set off to the butterfly farm timmy at their heels when they came near they slowed their steps not wanting to run into will janes but there did not seem to be anybody about at all not even the butterfly men themselves theyve probably gone off butterflyhunting i should think said dick look theres poor old mrs janes trying to peg up her washing dropping half of it on the ground go and help her anne anne ran over to the little woman ill peg up the things for you she said here let me have them mrs janes turned to her and anne was shocked to see that her right eye was black and bruised however did you get that black eye she began here give me the whole basket gracious what a lot of washing mrs janes seemed a little dazed she let anne peg up the things without a word she just stood and watched her where are mr gringle and mr brent asked anne as she pegged mrs janes mumbled something anne made out with some difhculty that they had gone butterflyhunting and where is your son will she asked having been prompted to ask this by signs from julian to her dismay mrs janes began to sob the old woman lifted her dirty apron and covered her head with it and then halfblinded by it she stumbled towards the kitchen door her arms stretched out in front of her gracious whatevers the matter with her this morning said anne to the others dick ran to the kitchen door and guided the old lady in sitting her down in her rockingchair her apron slid down from her head and she looked at him youre the one that give me five shillin she mumbled and patted his hand kind you are nobodys kind to me now my son hes cruel he hits me did he give you that black eye asked dick gently when today yes he wanted money he allus wants money wept mrs janes and i werent going to give him that five shillin and he hit me and then the police came and took him away what the police took him this morning do you mean asked dick astonished the others came a little closer astonished too why it was only last night that will janes had captured two of them they do say he thieved sobbed mrs janes robbed old farmer darvil of his ducks but its those bad men that changed my son he were a good son once what men asked dick patting the skinny old hand you tell us everything we understand well help you youre the one that give me five shillin arent you she said once more youll help a pore old woman wont you it was those men i tell you that changed my son where are they now did he hide them here asked dick mrs janes clung to his hand and pulled him closer there was four men she mumbled in such a low voice that dick could hardly hear and my son he was promised money if he hid them here on billycock hill they all had a secret see and they only talked about it when they was hid up in my bedroom there but i listened and i heard what was the secret asked dick his heart beating fast now perhaps he would hear what all this mystery was about they was watching something whispered mrs janes watching something out on the hills sometimes daytime sometimes nighttime always watching and they hid up there in my little old room and cook for them i did and got nothing for it bad men they were she sobbed again and the four children felt sad and embarrassed dont worry her any more said anne then there came the sound of feet outside and mr gringle walked by the window he looked in and was astounded to see such a crowd in the little kitchen what you again he cried as he saw julian and dick you just look out i told the police about you when they fetched will janes this morning theyll be after you next and youll be punished for prowling round here at night and smashing my glasshouse how dare you come here again chapter eighteen nobody knows where to look lets go said george we cant find out any more from the poor old woman im glad that son of hers has been arrested for thieving at least he wont be here to knock her about any more mr gringle began to talk angrily again but the five had had enough timmy growled and made him retreat were going mr gringle said julian coldly we shall be very glad to see the police if you have really sent them after us quite a lot has been going on here that you dont know anything about youve noticed nothing but your butterflies and moths anything wrong in that you uncivil boy shouted mr gringle well it would have been a good thing if you had noticed how that fellow janes knocked his poor mother about said julian i suppose you havent even seen the bruised black eye she has this morning no i thought not well maybe the police will be asking you a few questions soon about the four strangers that have been hiding in that little bedroom up there what whats that you say what do you mean stammered mr gringle astonished men where from who ive no idea said julian i wish i had and then the five walked off together leaving a very puzzled and worried mr gringle behind them it serves him right said julian to think that he could make that miserable little woman slave for him and never even notice how frightened and unhappy she was or even see that she had a black eye from that scoundrel of a son let him get back to his butterflies what did mrs janes mean mumbling about men hidden in that room four of them she said wondered anne and why did they go and watch on the hillside what for that must have been one of them you saw that night of the storm julian the one you spotted with the butterfly net who said he was mr brent i suppose he pretended to be him so that nobody would ask him why he was prowling out there yes youre right said julian of course they may have been watching the airfield you know yes of course thats what they were doing why didnt i think of that before they were watching it night and day two by day i suppose and two by night and paid janes to keep them hidden in that room what were they up to julian could it could it possibly be anything to do with the stolen aeroplanes asked george with sudden excitement in her voice it might it certainly might said julian but i dont know how it ties up with jeff thomas and ray wells flying them away that doesnt seem to fit somehow you know i do really believe we are on to something here lets go down to billycock farm and see if mr thomas tobys father is about i think we ought to tell him all we know yes thats a fine idea said anne pleased we do want a bit of help over this now well come on then said julian and off they went at top speed down the hill taking the path to billycock farm they soon came to the farmyard and called toby toby where are you weve got a bit of news toby appeared at the barndoor looking rather pale for he had had a bad night oh hallo what news the only news i want to hear is about jeff i cant get it out of my mind wheres your father asked julian we think he ought to hear what weve got to say hell know what to do im afraid we dont its a puzzle we cant seem to fit together ill call dad said toby at once and sent a shout over the field where redandwhite cows were grazing daad daad youre wanted his father came hurrying over the field what is it im busy dad julian and dick have got something to tell you said toby it wont take very long but theyre a bit worried oh well what is it lads said mr thomas turning his kindly brown face to the boys got into any trouble oh no sir not exactly said julian ill tell you as shortly as i can and he began to tell him the tale of the butterfly farm and of the man he had seen at night on the hill of the old woman at the butterfly farm and of will janes who treated her so badly the farmer nodded at that ay he said wills changed this last year got into bad company of course weve met some of the bad company said julian and told of their adventure the night before and then ended by telling mr thomas what the old woman had said to them that morning now what has will janes been up to said the farmer bad enough to get into ill company but worse to illtreat his poor old mother hell have to say who these men are that hes been harbouring up there at butterfly farm and why they go out at night watching the airfield as you say i dont doubt why maybe theyve even had a hand in the stealing of those planes toby became very excited at this and his face grew crimson dad maybe it was those men who took the planes there were four werent there they would be strong enough to capture jeff and ray and take them off somewhere and then two of them could fly off the planes and the other two watch poor jeff and ray wherever they are you know you may be right young toby said his father this is a matter for the police and at once too they must get on to will and get everything out of him make him confess if jeff and ray are held prisoner anywhere they must be freed toby was dancing round in excitement i knew it wasnt jeff i knew he couldnt do a thing like that im sure it was two of those men dad get on to the police at once mr thomas hurried indoors to the telephone and was soon telling the police all he knew they listened in astonishment and at once saw the tremendous importance of the information the children had given well question will janes at once they said hes held on a matter of thieving so weve got him under our hands well call you back sir in about half an hour that halfhour was the very longest the children had ever known julian looked at his watch a score of times and nobody could sit still least of all toby anne was fidgety too and thought she would play with benny but neither benny nor the pigling were there so she had to wait in patience when the telephone bell at last shrilled out everyone jumped violently mr thomas ran to it yes yes thats the police speaking is it yes im listening whats the news oh yes yes the farmer held the telephone close to his ear nodding as he listened intently the children watched him just as intently trying to glean something from his few words and from his face i see well thats very disappointing they heard mr thomas say and their hearts sank thank you yes very worrying indeed goodbye he put down the receiver and faced the children toby called out to him was it jeff who stole the plane dad was it no said his father and toby gave a wild yell of joy and leapt into the air then nothing else matters he cried oh i knew it wasnt jeff wait a minute wait a minute said mr thomas theres something very worrying what said toby startled will janes has confessed that those four men were sent to steal those two planes he said two of them were firstclass pilots foreign of course the other two were thugs bullies sent to capture jeff and ray that night in the storm they knocked them out and dragged them away from the airfield and hid them somewhere then the pilots got out the two planes and flew them away when the alarm was raised it was too late so when the planes crashed into the sea it was the foreign pilots who were drowned not jeff and ray said julian yes but heres the worrying part the other two men the ones who captured jeff and ray have hidden them away but didnt tell janes where said mr thomas they refused to pay him any money for his help because the planes had crashed and their plans had failed and they also refused to tell him where jeff and ray were hidden and now i suppose the two thugs have left the district made their escape and left jeff and ray to starve in some place where they may never be found said toby sitting down heavily and looking suddenly subdued exactly said mr thomas and unless we find out where they are pretty quickly things will go hard with them theyre probably bound hand and foot and are dependent on the two bullies for food and water once the men are gone there is no one to bring them anything oh i say said toby horrified dad we must find them we must thats what the police think said his father and what i think too but nobody knows where to look nobody knows where to look the words repeated themselves in everyones mind nobody knows where to look chapter nineteen a morning of work there was a dead silence after mr thomas had said those despairing words nobody knows where to look where were jeff and ray lying worried and anxious knowing their planes to be stolen picturing them in the hands of an alien country being dismantled to discover the new and secret devices built into them they must be absolutely furious to think how easily it was all done said dick taken by surprise like that surely there must be someone on the airfield who was in the secret bound to be said mr thomas these things are carefully planned to the very last detail and of course it was a bit of luck for the men to have a storm going on just at the time when they needed something to make their getaway unseen and unheard unheard that is until the planes were actually up in the air and then it didnt matter yes the rain simply slashed down that night said george remembering nobody would be out in it even the guards on the airfield would be under shelter somewhere it was a bit of luck for those fellows i expect they were delighted to look out of that tiny little window at the cottage and see a storm blowing up on the very night they wanted one said dick it beats me how mr gringle and mr brent never heard or suspected anything with four strange men hanging about butterfly farm said julian there cant be anything in their heads but butterflies or moths said toby i bet the police will have something to say to them the thing is whats to be done now said julian frowning he turned to mr thomas who was deep in thought what do you think sir is there anything we can do i doubt it said mr thomas the police have had reports of two men driving a closed van at a fast speed the number was taken by two or three people who complained and they think that it might have been one used to transport jeff and ray to some distant hidingplace somewhere in a disused quarry or in some deserted cellar likely places of that sort everyone groaned there certainly was absolutely nothing they could do then it would be impossible to hunt for miles for old quarries or other hidingplaces well i must get on with my work said mr thomas wheres your mother toby youd better tell her about all this shes gone shopping said toby looking at the clock shell be back just before dinnertime i suppose benny has gone with her said mr thomas going to the door wheres curly his pigling surely he hasnt taken him too i expect he has said toby he looked at the other four children suddenly remembering something i say arent you a bit short of food up at the camp shall i get you some to take back with you well if it isnt an awful bother said julian apologetically it seemed rather dreadful to think about food when probably jeff and ray were lying tied up somewhere hungry and thirsty with no chance of food of any sort ill get some you come with me anne and say what you want said toby and he and anne went off together to the kitchen and opened the door of the immense larder soon anne was choosing what she wanted trying to cheer up poor downcast toby at the same time can we stay and help you this morning toby asked julian when he and anne came back he knew that toby had many jobs to do on the farm although it was a holiday week and he thought too that it would be good for the boy to have company that worrying morning yes id like you to said toby brightening at once i told dad id limewash the henhouses today its just the kind of day for that nice and dry with a little breeze you and dick could help and wed get them all done by dinnertime right well help you all morning then well go back to our camp and have a picnic lunch said julian if youve finished all the jobs you have to do you could come back with us and we could go on a hike or something this afternoon oh yes said toby cheering up considerably come on then well get the lime and find the brushes hey binky come and help us and you too timmy wait a minute cant we help said george i can limewash henhouses as well as anyone oh no george its a messy job a job for boys not girls said toby and went off with dick and julian leaving george looking furious now youve offended george said dick grinning toby was genuinely surprised have i really he said oh of course i forgot she doesnt like to be girlish half a minute he ran back to the window of the sittingroom and called through it hie george what about doing a job for my mother she never has time to weed her flowergarden and she is always upset because its so untidy i suppose you and anne couldnt do something about that yes of course called anne going out of the dour lets find a trowel each and something to put weeds in george dont look so gloomy lets weed the whole bed and make it marvellous for mrs thomas shes so kind and generous id like to do something for her all right so would i said george more graciously and went with her cousin into the garden i wish little benny was at home said anne as she and george began their task a few minutes later complete with trowels and two old tin pails for the weeds id like him running round us asking questions in that dear little high voice of his and curly his pigling running about like a funny little pigpuppy yes i like benny too said george pulling up a handful of weeds my word there are more weeds than flowers in this bed lets take benny up to the camp with us this afternoon if toby comes said anne then toby can take him back with him when he goes i love little benny i could look after him while you and the boys go hiking this afternoon all right said george torn between wanting to stay with anne and little benny and his pig and going with the boys help ive been stung by a most vicious nettle all the children worked hard that morning the henhouses had been scrubbed down and well and truly limewashed now they were drying quickly the doors flung open to sun and wind the girls had practically cleared the big flowerbed of weeds and were feeling rather pleased with it and with themselves too there came the sound of a car at about a quarter to one that must be mrs thomas coming back from her shopping said george quick lets finish this bed before she sees us weve only about ten minutes more work benny will soon come running to see what we are doing said anne and little curly too my word ive just filled my ninth pail of weeds the three boys came by just then swinging their empty pails and carrying their big brushes timmy came too with quite a few white patches on his coat hallo girls said dick my word youve done a fine job on that bed you can actually see the flowers now the girls sat back pleased yes it looks a bit better said anne pushing back her hair your mothers home i think toby wed better go now because youll soon be having your dinner and well be as hungry as hunters by the time we get back to our camp right said toby here ill take those pails of weeds for you and the trowels oh thanks said george dick anne and i will go off to the camp now with timmy and take the salad and stuff that wants washing under the spring you bring the rest of the food will you of course said dick you take one basket and well take the other they went off with toby anne and george went to look for mrs thomas but she had gone into the dairy and was not to be seen never mind shell be busy said anne well go off straight away and get our lunch ready they went off to the farmgate and up the path on to the steep slopes of billycock hill the basket between them soon they were out of sight the boys washed their hands under a pump in the yard toby had gone to see his mother and to tell her what the police had said but his father had already told her she was very worried indeed poor jeff poor ray she said then she looked round as she heard the footsteps of dick and julian oh she said i thought it was benny where is he benny well he was with you wasnt he said toby you didnt leave him in the car did you what do you mean toby said mrs thomas looking startled i left benny here at the farm i didnt take him with me i never do when i have a lot of shopping he gets so bored but mother ive not seen him all morning said toby hes not at the farm ive not seen him for hours oh toby said his mother looking frightened toby whats happened to him then i thought youd look after him as you usually do and i thought hed gone with you groaned toby dick julian have you seen benny or curly no we havent set eyes on him this morning said dick gosh wheres he got to he may have gone up billycock hill to try and find our camp i know he wanted to toby the horsepond said mrs thomas looking pale go there he may have fallen in look in the loft of the barn too and go into the machinery shed oh benny benny where are you she turned to dick and julian standing anxiously beside her go up to your camp she said hunt and call all the way he may be lost on the hillside my little benny perhaps his pigling runned away again as he so often tells us and he followed and got lost oh dear whatever shall i do chapter twenty a peculiar message toby raced off to the horsepond very frightened the pond was deep in the middle and benny couldnt swim dick and julian went off hurriedly through the farmgate up to billycock hill calling as they went benny benny where are you benny they toiled up the steep heathery slopes looking for any sign of the small boy but there was none they were both anxious benny was such a little wanderer and his pig made such a good excuse for going long distances benny benny they called and sometimes the echo came back to them calling the name too perhaps he will be at the camp said dick i know he wanted to visit it he may be there the little monkey with curly too i hope so said julian soberly but its a long way for his small legs to go i dont see how he could possibly find the way without someone to guide him he has never been there yet well maybe the girls spotted him on their way up said dick my word this is a day isnt it nobody knows where jeff and ray are and nobody knows where little benny is either i dont call this a very good holiday exciting but decidedly worrying said julian why do we always run into something like this we never seem to have a really peaceful time dick glanced sideways at julian and gave a fleeting smile would you like a really peaceful time ju he said i dont think you would come on lets shout again they came to the camp at last not having seen a sign of benny or the pigling he was not at the camp either that was quite clear the girls and timmy were alone they were horrified when they were told about benny anne went pale lets go and look for him at once she said we must well can you make some sandwiches very quickly asked dick were all hungry and it wont take a minute we can munch them as we go lets make a plan of campaign while youre cutting them george and anne set to work with the sandwiches annes finger were all thumbs she was so shocked to hear thatlittle benny was missing oh i hope nothings happened to him she said missing all the morning for hours poor mrs thomas the sandwiches are ready said george now whats the plan julian we all separate i suppose and quarter the hill shouting all the time thats it said julian beginning on his sandwiches hungrily and slipping some tomatoes and radishes into his pocket you go round that side anne and george one of you high up on the hill and one lower down so that your shouts cover as much distance as possible and dick and i will do the same on this side well go down to butterfly farm too in case he has wandered there they all set off and soon the hill echoed to stentorian shouts benny beenny benny cooee benny cooee over the heather scrambled the four with timmy excitedly leaping about too he knew that benny was lost and he was sniffing for some smell of the small boy but his sharp nose could find nothing julian went to butterfly farm and searched all about but there was no sign of the boy there in fact there was no sign of anyone not even old mrs janes she had gone off somewhere and the two men were out butterflying as usual in fact george and anne saw them as they searched their side of the hill and called to them have you seen anything of a small boy and a little pig the two men were curt and unhelpful no no sign at all i suppose theyre annoyed because they still think the boys broke the glass of their butterfly house said george well i wish they would hunt for benny instead of butterflies it was two hours before benny was found and the five had almost given up looking for him they had met together as they came round the hill and were standing in despair wondering what to do next when timmy suddenly pricked up his ears then he barked an excited little bark that said as plainly as possible ive heard something interesting what is it then tim what is it cried george at once go find go find timmy trotted off his ears well pricked he stopped every now and again and listened then went on again the children listened too but they could hear nothing no call no groan no whimper why hes going downhill towards the caves said julian at last the caves why didnt we think of those but how could that tiny little fellow have found the way there its a long and complicated way from billycock farm he might have followed curly the pig said anne we always thought that he only pretended that the pig ran away so that he could wander where he liked and blame it on the pig but this time the pig might really have runned away lets hope its benny that timmy can hear said julian i must say i cant hear a single sound and ive got pretty sharp ears and then the next minute they all heard something a small tired voice calling high and clear curly curly i want you benny yelled everyone and leapt ahead so fast that the heathery ground shook beneath their trampling feet timmy was there first of course and when the four children came up they saw him gently licking the goldenhaired little boy who had put his arms round the dogs neck in delight benny was sitting just outside the entrance of the caves all by himself his pigling was not there benny oh benny darling weve found you cried anne and knelt down beside him he looked up at the others not seeming at all surprised to see them curly runned away he said he runned right away curlys gonned in there and he pointed into the caves thank goodness you didnt follow him said george you might never have been found come along we must take you home but as soon as she lifted up the child he began to kick and scream no no i want curly i want curly darling hell come along when hes tired of the caves said anne but your mummy wants you now and your dinner is waiting for you im hungry announced benny i want my dinner but i want curly too curly curly come here we must take benny back said dick his mother will be so terribly worried curly will eventually come out if hes got sense enough to remember the way if not well its just too bad we darent go wandering down the unroped paths in case we get lost come on bring benny george curly will come when hes ready george said as she carried the little boy away from the entrance to the caves but now your mummy wants you and your dinners waiting with timmy jumping up delightedly beside her she carried the small boy down the chalky path talking to him they were all so thankful to have found him that they felt quite cheerful forgetting jeff and ray for a time they teased little benny trying to make him forget his lost pet mrs thomas was overjoyed to see the small boy again she cried over him as she took him into her arms oh benny benny what a bad pair you are you and your pigling he runned away said benny of course he was set down at the table to have his dinner and began to eat very fast indeed because he was so hungry everyone sat and watched him so glad to have him safe again that they hardly took their eyes off him while he gobbled his meal he finished at last im going to look for curly he announced as he got down from his chair oh no youre not said his mother youre going to stay with me i want you to help me to make some cakes curly will come home when hes ready and in an hours time when julian dick anne george and toby were busy at the messy job of cleaning out the duckpond curly did come back he trotted into the farmyard making his usual funny little squeals arid everyone looked round at once curly you have come back oh you bad little pig cried george and timmy ran up to the pigling and sniffed him and licked him the pig turned himself round to look for benny and julian laughed someones written something on him in black come here curly and lets see curly trotted over to him and julian examined the rather smudged black lettering cant make it out he said somebodys printed something on his pink little body silly thing to do but it will wash off wait said dick sharply as julian bent to get one of the rags they were using to wash the piglings body wait i say look isnt that a j and a t and below those are letters that look like r and v no w because half that letter has been rubbed off by heather or something now everyone was staring in excitement j t and r w said toby in a breathless voice then it rose to a shout they stand for jeff thomas and ray wells what does it mean who put those letters there there are some more letters smaller and rather smudged said julian hold the pigling still dick we must we must make out what they are its some kind of message from jeft and ray the pigling must have been where they are hidden they all looked earnestly at the smudgy letters which appeared to be five in number they were almost unreadable but dicks sharp brain got hold of them at last the word is caves he said see the first letter might be g or o or c but the third one is certainly v and last is s im sure its caves and thats where curly went we know whew thats where jeff and ray are hidden then said julian quite near after all and we thought they had been taken away by car and hidden miles away quick wheres your father toby mr thomas was found and was shown curly with the smudgy black letters on his back he was astounded so curly went wandering in the caves did he what a pig he is cant keep his nose out of anything and somehow he went to where jeff and ray were what a strange way to send a message they could surely have tied one on to his tail or round his neck these letters are almost unreadable i nearly washed them off thinking that somebody had played a silly joke on curly said julian my word if i had wed not have known where jeff and ray were what shall we do now sir go to the caves at once telephone the police both said mr thomas the police must know because they are searching everywhere of course now you start off to the caves but take a ball of string with you because jeff and ray wont have been hidden in any of the roped tunnels where sightseers so often go and without string you might not be able to find your way back down the unroped ones you may find that you need to unwind the string in order to get back safely and take timmy hell be useful he certainly will said julian and well take the little pig too so that timmy can smell him and then smell the tracks curly made as he wandered through the caves and follow them we shant have to wander all about wondering where jeff and ray are then the five set off at once with toby too all as excited as they could possibly be good old jeff good old ray toby kept saying were coming hang on were coming chapter twentyone an exciting finish up the heathery hill panted the five children and timmy julian carried the frightened little pig who was not at all sure what was happening to him he kicked and squealed but nobody took any notice of him he would be of importance when they reached the caves but not till then at last they reached the chalky roadway to the caves and pounded along it the loose bits of chalk flying between their feet they came to the entrance where the warning notice stood timmy called george as julian put down the trembling little pig and held him tightly timmy come here smell curly thats right smell him all over now follow follow follow smell where he went in the caves and follow tim follow timmy knew perfectly well what tracking meant and obediently smelt curly thoroughly and then put his nose to the ground to follow the scent of the piglings footsteps he soon picked it up and began to run into the first cave he stopped and looked back enquiringly go on tim go on i know this seems peculiar to you when weve got curly here but we want to know where he went called george afraid that timmy might think it was just a silly game and give up timmy put his nose to the ground again he came to the magnificent cave full of the gleaming icicles the stalactites and stalagmites some of them looking like shining pillars then into the next cave which with its glowing rainbow colours had reminded anne of a fairyland cave then through the next cave they went and came to the forking of the ways here we are at the three tunnels said george i bet timmy wont go down the usual roped one that all visitors would take as she spoke the words timmy nose to ground still following the scent of the piglings footsteps took the lefthand unroped way and everyone followed torches shining brightly i thought so said george and her voice began to echo round thought so thought so so so do you remember those awful noises we heard the other day that piercing whistling and those howls said dick well i bet they were made by the bullies who dragged jeff and ray here i expect they heard timmy barking he must have heard the men probably though we didnt and they were scared in case we were coming so they made those frightful noises to scare us off and the echoes magnified them horribly well they certainly scared us away all right said anne remembering yes it must have been those men there arent any awful noises today my word what a long winding tunnel this is and look its forking into two timmy will know which way to take said george and of course he did with his nose to the ground he chose the lefthand one without any hesitation you didnt really need to bring a ball of string julian said toby timmy will easily be able to take us the right way back wont he yes said julian hes better than any unwinding ball of string but without tim wed never find the way back there are so many caves and so many tunnels we must be well into the heart of the hill now timmy suddenly stopped in his tracking raised his head and listened could he hear jeff and ray he barked loudly and from somewhere in the near distance came a shout hoy hoy this way this way its jeff shouted toby dancing in the dark tunnel with excitement jeff can you hear me jeff and a voice came back at once hie toby this way this way timmy ran down the passage and stopped at first the children could not see why and then they saw that the passage came to an end there a blank wall faced them just beyond timmy and yet jeffs voice came quite clearly to them here we are here why theres a hole in the floor of the tunnel just by timmy cried julian shining his torch on it thats where jeff and ray are down that hole hey cousin jeff are you down there julian shone his torch right through the hole and there lying on the floor of a cave below was ray and standing beside him looking up eagerly was jeff thank god youve found us he said those fellows told us they were leaving us here and not coming back rays got a twisted ankle he cant stand on it they pushed us down this hole without any warning and he fell awkwardly but with your help we can get him up jeff oh jeff im so glad weve found you yelled toby trying to look down into the hole with julian whats the best way to get you up this entrance hole isnt very big if you can manage to pull me up thats the first thing to do said jeff considering the matter then two of you boys can go down to ray and help him to stand and i think i could haul him up this is an awful place no outlet except through that small hole up there which was too high for me to jump up to and ray couldnt stand of course to help me there was soon a great deal of acrobatic work on the part of jeff julian and dick the two boys managed to haul up jeff by lying down on the floor above and putting their arms and shoulders through the hole to drag him up toby and george had to hold on to their legs to prevent them from being pulled into the hole and anne had to hold the little pig which did its best to try and get down the hole too at last jeff was up through the hole and then the two boys julian and dick leapt down to ray he seemed rather dazed and jeff said that he thought he had hurt his head as well as his leg when the men pushed them down the hole julian pulled him gently to his feet and then he and dick lifted him until he could reach jeffs swinging hands as he leaned down through the hole poor ray was pulled up at last and then up went julian and dick in the same way timmy thought the whole procedure was most extraordinary and produced volleys of excited barks scaring the little pig almost out of its skin phew said jeff when at last ray was up and being helped by the others i never thought wed get out of there lets get away from this nightmare place as quickly as possible what we want is a little fresh air and food and water those brutes havent been near us for what seems like weeks they made their way back to the cave entrance timmy leading the way confidently not even troubling to smell it he never forgot a path once he had beep along it they came out into the bright june sunshine and it was so very dazzling to the two men who had been so long in pitchblack darkness that they had to shade their eyes sit down a bit till you get used to it said julian and tell us how you wrote your message on the pig did he suddenly appear down the hole jeff laughed well he said there we were down in that awful hole ray and i with no watch to tell us the time no means of knowing if it was night or day or even if it was last thursday or next monday and suddenly we heard a pitterpattering noise and the next thing we knew was that something had fallen down through the hole and landed on top of us it began to squeal like billyo so we guessed it was a little pig though why a pig should suddenly descend on us out of the dark tunnel above us we simply couldnt imagine everyone laughed even ray go on said dick what did you do well we felt the pig all over and knew it was a baby said jeff but it didnt occur to us for some time that we might use it as a messenger that was rays bright idea we could hardly read your message said dick it was just touch and go that we made it out i dare say but when you consider that we had been robbed of everything even my silver pencil taken and my old fountain pen to say nothing of my money my watch and my torch and rays too and that it was pitchdark in the hole im sure you will agree that we didnt make a bad job of printing that message said jeff but what did you print it with if your pockets had been emptied asked george in wonder well ray found a tiny bit of black chalk at the bottom of his trouser pocket said jeff its chalk we use to mark out our airroutes on big maps and that was all we had to use ray held the pigling and i printed our initials and the word caves on his back i couldnt see what i was doing in the dark but i just hoped for the best then i stood up and tossed the poor little pig through the hole it was a jolly good shot i must say i heard him scrambling on the edge and then away he trotted the finest little pig in the world what a tale said julian my word youre lucky jeff that the pigling came home all right its a wanderer that pig always running away and to think that i nearly washed your message off his back before we read it whew it gives me the creeps to hear that said jeff now tell me what happened when it was discovered that wed disappeared from the airfield wasnt there an uproar rather you knew your planes were stolen didnt you said dick i guessed that when i heard two planes take off just as some great thugs were hauling us up the hill said jeff i heard a dog barking as we were being kicked and dragged up was it timmy i did hope he would come to our rescue oh yes that must have been the time when he began to bark that night of the storm said george remembering so it was you and those thugs we heard oh what a pity he didnt know it those two stolen planes crashed into the sea during the storm jeff said toby the pilots werent found oh said jeff and was silent for a moment i shall miss my dear old bus well lets hope i get another plane and ray too ray how do you feel now can you hobble along again or not yes if the boys can help me as they did just now said ray who was already looking much better since he had been in the open air lets get along it was very slow going but fortunately the police met them halfway on their way to the caves mr thomas had telephoned them and they had come along immediately they took ray in hand and the little party made better progress put that pig down anne you must be tired of carrying it said dick you look like alice in wonderland she carried a pig too anne laughed i think its gone to sleep just like alices pig she said and so it had they were all very thankful when at last they arrived at billycock farm what a welcome they had from mrs thomas her husband and benny the little boy dragged his pigling from annes arms and hugged it you runned away youre bad you runned fast he scolded and set it down it immediately scampered over to the barn with benny in pursuit and anne went to fetch them back now well all have tea ive got it ready hoping that everyone would be back in time from their extraordinary adventures said mrs thomas i know jeff and ray must be starved you look quite thin in the face jeff they all sat round the big table toby next to his hero cousin jeff they gazed with pleasure at the food there surely never never had there been such a spread before mother said toby his eyes gleaming mother this isnt a meal its a banquet jeff what will you have everything said jeff some of every single thing ill start with two boiled eggs three slices of ham two thick pieces of bread and butter and some of that wonderful salad my word its almost worth being down that hole for ages to end up with a feast like this it was a most hilarious tea and for once benny sat at the table throughout the whole meal and didnt slip from his chair to go and find curly why didnt they have parties like this every day why even his father was there roaring with laughter what a pity the two policemen hadnt been able to stop to tea too benny had a lot of questions to ask policemen where was timmy yes he was under the table benny could feel him with his foot and yes binky was there too just by toby he slid his hand down with a large piece of cake in it and immediately it was taken gently from his hand by a hairy mouth timmy was having a wonderful time too everyone was sorry when the grand meal was over jeff and ray now had to report to the airfield and mr thomas offered to take them in his car the children went to see them off it will seem awfully dull now up in our camp on the hillside said dick so many things have happened in the last few days and now nothing will happen at all rubbish said jeff i promise you something will happen something grand what asked everyone eagerly i shall see that youre all given a free flight in a plane as soon as possible perhaps tomorrow said jeff and i shall pilot it now then anyone want to loop the loop with me what shouts and squeals from everyone jeff made a face and put his hands to his ears me too me too and curly came bennys little high voice where is curly said jeff looking out of the car i really must shake hooves with him hes been a wonderful friend to me and ray wherever is he i dont know said benny looking all round he must have runned away chorused everyone and timmy barked at the sudden shout he put his paws up on the car and licked jeffs hand thanks old boy said jeff we couldnt have done without you either so long everybody see you tomorrow and then whoooops up in the clouds well go
