 prologue when the sun dipped low in the sky dripping the last of its fire the children huddled together to hear the next part of the tale for the old man their eager faces and wide eyes brought the light into the room the story hed begun on a rainy afternoon would continue now as twilight settled over the land the fire crackled in the grate the only sound as he sipped his wine as he searched his mind for the right words you know now a beginning of hoyt the sorcerer and the witch from beyond his time you know how the vampire came to be and how the scholar and the shifter of shapes from the world of geall came through the dance of the gods into the land of ireland you know how a friend and brother was lost and how the warrior came to join them they gathered together one of the wideeyed children said to fight to save all the worlds this is truth and this happened these six this circle of courage and hope were charged by the gods through the messenger morrigan to fight the army of vampires led by their ambitious queen lilith they defeated the vampires in battle one of the young ones said and the old man knew he saw himself as one of the brave lifting sword and stake to destroy evil this too is truth and this happened on the night the sorcerer and the witch were handfasted the night they pledged the love theyd found in this terrible time the circle of six beat back the demons their valor could not be questioned but this was only one battle in the first month of the three theyd been given to save worlds how many worlds are there they cant be counted he told them any more than the stars in the sky can be counted and all of these worlds were threatened for if these six were defeated those worlds would be changed just as a man can be changed into demon but what happened next he smiled now with the firelight casting shadows on a face scored by the years well now ill tell you dawn came after the night of the battle as dawn will a soft and misty dawn this was a quiet after the storm the rain had washed away the blood human and demon but the ground was scorched where fire swords had flamed and still the mourning doves cooed and the stream sang in that morning light leaves and blossoms wet from rain glimmered it was for this he told them these simple and ordinary things they fought for man needs the comfort of the simple as much as he needs glory he sipped his wine then set it aside so they had gathered to preserve these things and so now gathered did they begin their journey chapter clare the first day of september t hrough the house still as a grave larkin limped the air was sweet fragrant with the flowers gathered lavishly for the handfasting rite of the night before the blood had been mopped up the weapons cleaned theyd toasted hoyt and glenna with the frothy wine had eaten cake but behind the smiles the horror of the nights battle lurked a poor guest today he supposed was for rest and more preparation it was a struggle for him not to be impatient with the training with the planning at least last night theyd fought he thought as he pressed a hand to his thigh that ached from an arrow strike a score of demons had fallen and there was glory in that in the kitchen he opened the refrigerator and took out a bottle of coke hed developed a taste for it and had come to prefer it over his morning tea he turned the bottle in his hand marveling at the cleverness of the vessel so smooth so clear and hard but what was inside it this was something hed miss when they returned to geall he could admit he hadnt believed his cousin moira when shed spoken of gods and demons of a war for worlds hed only gone with her that day that sad day of her mothers burial to look after her she wasnt only blood but friend and would be queen of geall but every word shed spoken to him only steps away from her mothers grave had been pure truth theyd gone to the dance theyd stood in the heart of that circle and everything had changed not just the where and when they were he mused as he opened the bottle and took that first bracing sip but everything one moment theyd stood under the afternoon sun in geall then thered been light and wind and a roar of sound then it had been night and it had been ireland a place larkin had always believed a fairy tale he hadnt believed in fairy tales or monsters and despite his own gift had looked askance at magic but magic there was he admitted now just as there was an ireland and there were monsters those demons had attacked them springing out of the dark of the woods their eyes red their fangs sharp the form of a man he thought but not a man vampyre they existed to feed off man and now they banded together under their queen to destroy all he was here to stop them at all and any costs he was here at the charge of the gods to save the worlds of man he scratched idly at his healing thigh and decided he could hardly be expected to save mankind on an empty stomach he cut a slab of cake to go with his morning coke and licked icing from his finger so far through wile and guile hed avoided glennas cooking lessons he liked to eat that was true enough but the actual making of food was a different matter he was a tall lanky man with a thick waving mane of tawny hair his eyes nearly the same color were long like his cousins and nearly as keen he had a long and mobile mouth that was quick to smile quick hands and an easy nature those who knew him would have said he was generous with his time and his coin and a good man to have at your back at the pub or in a brawl hed been blessed with strong even features a strong back a willing hand and the power to change his shape into any living thing he took a healthy bite of cake where he stood but there was too much quiet in the house to suit him he wanted needed activity sound motion since he couldnt sleep he decided hed take cians stallion out for a morning run cian could hardly do it himself being a vampire he stepped out of the back door of the big stone house there was a chill in the air but he had the sweater and jeans glenna had purchased in the village he wore his own boots and the silver cross glenna and hoyt had forged with magic he saw where the earth was scorched where it was trampled he saw his own hoofprints left in the sodden earth when hed galloped through the battle in the form of a horse and he saw the woman whod ridden him slashing destruction with a flaming sword she moved through the mists slow and graceful in what he would have taken for a dance if he hadnt known the movements the complete control in them were another preparation for battle long arms and long legs swept through the air so smoothly they barely disturbed the mists he could see her muscles tremble when she held a pose endlessly held it for her arms were bared in a snug white garment no woman of geall would have worn outside the bedchamber she lifted a leg behind her into the air bent at the knee reaching an arm back to grasp her bare foot the shirt rose up her torso to reveal more flesh it would be a sorry man larkin decided who didnt enjoy the view her hair was short raven black and her eyes were bluer than the lakes of fonn she wouldnt have been deemed a beauty in his world as she lacked the roundness the plump sweet curves but he found the strength of her form appealing the angles of her face the sharp arch of brows interesting and unique she brought her leg down swept it out to the side then dropped into a long crouch with her arms parallel to the ground you always eat that much sugar in the morning her voice jolted him hed been still and silent and thought her unaware of him he shouldve known better he took a bite of the cake hed forgotten he held its good bet blair lowered her arms straightened earlier rising for you than usual isnt it i couldnt sleep know what you mean damn good fight good he looked over the burned ground and thought of the screams the blood the death it wasnt a night at the pub entertaining though she looked as he did but with a hard light in her eyes we kicked some vampire ass and what could be a better way to spend the evening i can think of a few hell of a rush though she rolled any lingering tension from her shoulders as she glanced at the house and it didnt suck to go from a handfasting to a fight and back again as winners especially when you consider the alternative theres that i suppose i hope glenna and hoyt are getting a little honeymoon time in because for the most part it was a pretty crappy reception with the long almost liquid gait hed come to admire she walked over to the table they used during daylight training to hold weapons and supplies she picked up the bottle of water shed left there and drank deep you have a mark of royalty say what he moved closer touched a fingertip lightly to her shoulder blade there was the mark of a cross like the one around his neck but in bold and bloody red its just a tattoo in geall only the ruler would bear a mark on the body when the new king or queen becomes when they lift the sword from the stone the mark appears here he tapped a hand on his right biceps not the symbol of the cross but the claddaugh put there its said by the finger of the gods cool excellent she explained when he frowned at her i myself have never seen this she cocked her head and seeings believing he shrugged my aunt moiras mother had such a mark but she rose to queen before i was born so i didnt see the mark become i never heard that part of the legend because it was there she swooped a fingertip through the icing of his cake sucked it off i guess everything doesnt trickle down how did you come by yours funny guy blair thought curious nature gorgeous eyes danger will robinson she thought that sort of combo just begged for complications she just wasnt built for complications and had learned it the hard way i paid for it a lot of people have tattoos its like a personal statement you could say glennas got one she took another drink watching him as she reached around to tap herself on the small of the back here a pentagram i saw it when we were helping her get dressed for the handfasting so theyre for women not only why you want one i think not he rubbed absently at his thigh blair remembered yanking the arrow out of him herself and that hed barely uttered a sound the guy had balls to go with the gorgeous eyes and curious nature he was no slouch in a fight and no whiner after the battle leg giving you trouble a little stiff a little sore glennas a good healer yours she bent her leg back heel to butt gave it a testing pull its okay i heal fast part of the family package not as fast as a vamp she added but demon hunters heal faster than your average human she picked up the jacket shed tossed on the table put it on against the morning cool i want coffee i dont like it i like the coke then he smiled easy charming will you be making yourself the breakfast in a little while ive got some things i want to do first maybe you wouldnt mind making enough for two maybe clever guy too she thought you had to respect his finagling you got something going now it took him a moment but he tried to spend a little time each day with the miraculous machine called the television he was proud to think he was learning new idioms im after taking the horse for a ride then feeding and grooming him plenty of light today but you shouldnt head into the woods unarmed ill be riding the fields ah glenna she asked if id not ride alone in the forest i dont like to worry her were you wanting a ride yourself i think i had enough of one last night thanks to you amused she gave him a light punch in the chest youve got some speed in you cowboy well youve a light and steady seat he looked back out at the trampled ground youre right it was a good fight damn right but the next one wont be so easy his eyebrows winged up and that one was easy compared to whats coming bet your ass well then the gods help us all and if youve a mind to cook eggs and bacon with it thatd be fine might as well eat our fill while we still have stomachs cheery thought blair decided as she went inside the hell of it was hed meant it that way shed never known anyone so offhand about life and death not resigned shed been raised to be resigned to it just a kind of confidence that hed live as he chose to live until he stopped living she admired the viewpoint shed been raised to know the monster under the bed was real and was just waiting until you relaxed before it ripped your throat out shed been trained to put that moment off as long as she could stand and fight to slash and to burn and take out as many as humanly possible because under the strength the wit and the endless training was the knowledge that some day some way she wouldnt be fast enough smart enough lucky enough and the monster would win still thered always been a balance to it demon and hunter with each the others prey now the stakes had been raised skyfrickinghigh she thought as she made coffee now it wasnt just the duty and tradition that had been passed down through her blood for damn near a millennium now it was a fight to save humankind she was here with this strange little band two of which vampire and sorcerer turned out to be her ancestors to fight the mother of all battles two months she thought until halloween till samhain and the final showdown the goddess had prophesied theyd have to be ready she decided as she poured the first cup because the alternative just wasnt an option she carried her coffee upstairs into her room as quarters went it had it all over her apartment in chicago where shed based herself over the last year and a half the bed boasted a tall headboard with carved dragons on either side a woman could feel like a spellbound princess in that bed if she was of a fanciful state of mind despite the fact the place was owned by a vampire there was a wide mirror framed in thick mahogany the wardrobe would have held three times the amount of clothes shed brought with her so she used it for secondary weapons and tucked her traveling wardrobe in the chest of drawers the walls were painted a dusky plum and the art on them woodland scenes of twilight or predawn so that the room seemed to be in perpetual shadow if the curtains were drawn but that was all right she had lived a great deal of her life in the shadows but she opened the curtains now so morning spilled in and then sat at the gorgeous little desk to check her email on her laptop she couldnt prevent the little flicker of hope or stop it from dying out as she saw there was still no return message from her father nothing new she reminded herself and tipped back in the chair he was traveling somewhere in south america to the best of her knowledge and she only knew that much because her brother had told her it had been six months since shed had any contact with him and there was nothing new about that either his duty to her had been in his opinion fulfilled years ago and maybe he was right hed taught her hed trained her though shed never been good enough to merit his approval she simply didnt have the right equipment she wasnt his son the disappointment hed felt when it had been his daughter instead of his son whod inherited the gift was something hed never bothered to hide softening blows of any sort just wasnt sean murphys style hed pretty much dusted her off his hands on her eighteenth birthday now shed embarrassed herself by sending him a second message when hed never answered the first shed sent that first email before shed left for ireland to tell him something was up something was twitching and she wanted his advice so much for that she thought now and so much for trying again after her arrival to tell him what was twitching was major he had his own life his own course and had never pretended otherwise it was her own problem her own lack that she still coveted his approval shed given up on earning his love a long time ago she turned off the computer pulled on a sweatshirt and shoes she decided to go up to the training room and work off frustration work up an appetite lifting weights the house shed been told had been the one hoyt and his brother cian had been born in in the dawn of the twelfth century it had been modernized of course and some additions had been made but she could see from the original structure the mac cionaoiths had been a family of considerable means of course cian had had nearly a millennium to make his own fortune to acquire the house again though from the bits and pieces shed picked up he didnt live in it she didnt make a habit out of conversing with vampires just killing them but she was making an exception with cian for reasons that werent entirely clear to her he was fighting with them even bankrolling their little war party to some extent added to that shed seen the way hed fought the night before with a ruthless ferocity his allegiance could be the element that tipped the scales in their favor she wound her way up the stone stairs toward what had once been the great hall then a ballroom in later years and was now their training room she stopped short when she saw larkins cousin moira doing chest extensions with fivepound free weights the geallian wore her brown hair back in a thick braid that reached her waist sweat dribbled down her temples and more darkened the back of the white tshirt she wore her eyes fog gray were staring straight ahead focused blair assumed on whatever got her through the reps she was by blairs gauge about fivethree maybe a hundred and ten pounds after youd dragged her out of a lake but she was game having game held a lot of weight on blairs scale what blair had initially judged as mousiness was in actuality a watchfulness the woman soaked up everything thought you were still in bed blair said as she stepped inside moira lowered the weights then used her forearm to swipe her brow ive been up for a bit youre wanting to use the room yeah plenty of room in here for both of us blair walked over selected tenpound weights not hunkered down with the books this morning i on a sigh moira stretched out her arms as shed been taught she might have wished her arms were as sleek and carved with muscle as blairs but no one would call them soft any longer ive been starting the day here before i use the library usually before anyones up and about okay curious blair studied moira as she worked her triceps and youre keeping this a secret because not a secret not exactly a secret moira picked up a bottle of water twisted off the cap twisted it back on im the weakest of us i dont need you or cian to tell me that though one or the other of you make a point to let me know it with some regularity something gave a little twist inside blairs belly and that sucks im going to tell you im sorry about that because i know how it feels to get slammed down when youre doing your best my best isnt altogether that good is it no im not looking for sorry she said before blair could speak its hard to be told youre lacking but thats what i am for now so i come up here in the mornings early and lift these bloody things the way you showed me i wont be the weak one the one the rest of you have to worry about you dont have much muscle yet but youve got some speed and youre a frigging genius with a bow if you werent so good with it things wouldnt have turned out the way they did last night work on my weaknesses and on my strengths on my own time thats what you said to me and it made me angry until i saw the wisdom of it im not angry youre good at training king washe was more easy on me i think because he was a man a big man at that moira added with sorrow in her eyes now who had affection for me i think because i was the smallest of us blair hadnt met king cians friend whod been captured then killed by lilith then turned and sent back as a vampire i wont be easy on you blair promised b y the time shed finished a session with the weights and grabbed a quick shower blair had worked up that appetite she decided to go for one of her favorites and dug up the makings for french toast she tossed some irish bacon into a skillet for protein selected green day on her mp player music to cook by she poured her second cup of coffee before breaking eggs in a bowl she was beating the batter when larkin strolled in the door he stopped stared at her player and what is it its a how to explain a way to whistle while you work no its not the machine im meaning there are so many of those i cant keep them all in my brain but whats the sound oh um popular music rock of the hard variety he was grinning now head cocked as he listened rock i like it who wouldnt not going for eggs this morning doing up french toast toast disappointment fell over his face erasing the easy pleasure of the music just cooked bread not just besides you get what you get when im manning the stove or you forage on your own its kind of you to cook of course his tone was so longsuffering she had to swallow a laugh relax and trust me on this ive seen you chow down cowboy youre going to like it as much as rock especially after you drown it in butter and syrup ill have it going in a minute why dont you flip that bacon over im needing to wash first been mucking out the stall and such and im not fit yet to touch anything she lifted a brow as he strolled right out shed seen him slip out of all manner of kitchen duties already and she had to admit he was slick about it resigned she turned the bacon herself then heated a second skillet she was about to dunk the first piece of bread when she heard voices the newlyweds were up she realized and added to the batter to accommodate them effortless style it was something glenna had in spades blair thought she wandered in wearing a sage green sweater and black jeans with her bold red hair swinging straight and loose the urban take on country casual blair supposed when you added the pretty flush of a woman whod obviously had her morning snuggles you had quite a package she didnt look like a woman who would rush a squad of vampires while she bellowed war cries and swung a battleax but shed done just that mmm french toast you must have read my mind as she moved to the coffeepot glenna gave blairs arm an absent stroke give you a hand no i got this youve been taking the lions share of kp and im better at breakfast than dinner didnt i hear hoyt right behind me hes talking to larkin about the horse i think hoyts a little put out he didnt get to vlad before larkin did coffees good howd you sleep like id been knocked unconscious for a couple hours blair dipped bread then laid it to sizzle then i dont know too restless wired up she slanted glenna a look and nowhere to put the excess energy like the bride i have to admit im feeling pretty loose and relaxed this morning except wincing a little glenna massaged her right biceps my arms feel like i spent half the night swinging a sledgehammer battleax has weight you did good work with it work isnt the word that comes to mind but im not going to think about it at least not until ive gorged myself turning glenna opened a cupboard for plates do you know how often i had a breakfast like this fried bread fried meat before all this started nope never absolutely never she added with a half laugh i watched my weight as if the well as if the fate of the world depended on it youre training hard blair flipped the bread you need the fuel the carbs if you put on a few pounds i can guarantee its going to be pure muscle blair glenna glanced toward the doorway to ensure hoyt hadnt started in yet youve got more experience with this than any of us just between you and me for now anyway how did we do last night we lived blair said flatly she continued to cook sliding fried bread onto a plate dunking more thats bottom line but glenna ill tell you straight blair turned leaning back on the counter for a moment while bread sizzled and scented the air ive never been in anything like that before but youve been doing this hunting them for years thats right and ive never seen so many of them in one place at one time never seen them organized that way glenna let out a quiet breath that cant be good news good or bad its fact its not never been in my experience the nature of the beast to live work fight in large groups i contacted my aunt and she says the same theyre killers and they might travel hunt even live together in packs small packs and there might be an alpha male or female but not like this not like an army glenna murmured no and what we saw last night was a squad a small slice of an army the thing is theyre willing to die for her for lilith and thats powerful stuff okay okay glenna said as she set the table thats what i get for saying i wanted it straight hey buck up we lived remember thats a victory good morning to you hoyt said to blair as he came in then his gaze went straight to glenna they shared coloring blair thought she and her howevermanytimes greatuncle she the sorcerer and his twin brother the vampire shared coloring and ancestry and now this mission she supposed fate was certainly a twisty bastard you two sure have the glow on she said when glenna lifted her face to meet hoyts lips practically need my shades they shield the eyes from the sun and are a sexy fashion statement hoyt returned and made her laugh have a seat she turned off the music then brought the heaping platter to the table i made enough for an army seeing as thats what we are it looks a fine feast thank you just doing my share unlike some of us whore a little more slippery she met larkins perfectly timed appearance with a shake of her head right on time his expression was both innocent and affable is it ready then it took me a bit longer to get back as i stopped to tell moira there was food being cooked and a welcome sight it is you look you eat blair slapped four slices of french toast on a plate for him and you and your cousin do the dishes chapter m aybe it was the postbattle itches but blair couldnt settle after another session with glenna everyones injuries were well on the mend so they could train they should train she told herself maybe the sweat and effort would work off the restlessness but she had another idea i think we should go out out glenna checked her chart of household duties and noted god help them hoyt was next up on laundry detail are we low on something i dont know blair scanned the charts posted prominently on the refrigerator you seem to have the supply and duty lists under control quartermaster ward mmm quartermaster glenna sent blair a twinkling look i like it can i get a badge ill see what i can do but when i say we should go out im thinking more a little scouting expedition than a supply run we should go check out liliths base of operations now theres a fine idea larkin turned from the sink where soap dripped from his hands and he was not at all happy give her a bit of a surprise for a change attack lilith moira stopped loading the dishwasher today i didnt say attack throttle back blair advised larkin were outnumbered by a long shot and i dont think the locals would understand a bloodbath in broad daylight but the daylights the key here go south to chiarrai hoyt said quietly to the cliffs and caves while we have the sun there you go they cant come out nothing they can do about us poking around taking a look and itd be a nice followup to routing them last night psychological warfare glenna nodded yes i see that blair agreed and maybe we gather some intel we see what we see we map out various routes going and coming and we make a point of letting her know were there or were there if we could lure some of them out or go in just far enough to give them some trouble fire larkin said there should be a way to set a fire in the caves not altogether a bad idea blair thought it over bitch could use a good spanking well go prepared for that and armed but we go quiet and careful we dont want some tourist or local calling the cops then having to explain why weve got a van loaded with weapons leave the fire to me and to glenna hoyt pushed to his feet why in answer glenna held out her hand a ball of flame shimmered in her cupped palm pretty blair decided and cian moira continued to deal with the dishes he wouldnt be able to leave the house then he stays back blair said flatly larkin if youre done there lets go load up some weapons we have some things in the tower that might be useful glenna brushed her fingers over hoyts arm hoyt we cant just leave him without letting him know what were about you want to wake up a vampire this time of day blair shrugged okay you go first c ian didnt care to be disturbed during his rest time he figured a closed and locked bedroom door would be a clear signal to anyone that he wanted his privacy but such things never seemed to stop his brother so he sat now awake in the dim light and listened to the plan for the day so if i have this right you woke me to tell me youre going out down to kerry to poke at the caves we didnt want you to wake find us all gone my fondest dream cian waved that lazily away apparently the good bloody fight last night isnt enough for the hunter its good strategy going there didnt work out so very well did it the last time we went there hoyt said nothing for a moment thinking of king and the loss of him nor for you or me the time before that cian added you ended up barely able to walk away and i took a fucking header off a cliff not one of my happiest memories those times were different altogether and you know it its daylight now and this time she wont know were coming and being its daylight youll have to stay behind if you think ill sulk about that youd be wrong ive plenty to keep me busy calls and emails which ive largely neglected these past weeks i still have businesses that need my attention which might as well be tended to since youve pulled me out of bed in the middle of the damn day let me add itll be a pure pleasure to have five noisy humans out of the house a few hours that i can promise you he rose walked to his desk and wrote something on a notepad since youll be out and about ill need you to go here theres a butcher in ennis hell sell you blood pigs blood cian said with a bland smile as he handed his brother the address ill ring him up so he knows someones coming payments not a problem as i have an account his brothers writing hand had changed over all this time hoyt noted so much had changed doesnt he wonder why if he does hes wise enough not to ask and hes no doubt pleased to pocket the extra euros thats the coin here now aye glenna explained it to me well be back before sunset better hope you are cian warned when hoyt left him o utside blair tossed a dozen stakes in a plastic bucket swords axes scythes were already on board all of the fiery variety it was going to be interesting explaining things if they got stopped but she didnt scout out a vampire nest without going fully loaded who wants the wheel she asked glenna i know the way blair checked the need to take control climbed in the back took the seat behind glenna as the others joined her so hoyt have you ever been in the caves i dont figure that kind of thing changes much in a few hundred years many times but theyre different now weve been in them glenna explained magically hoyt and i did a spell before we left new york it was intense fill me in blair listened one part of her brain marking the route landmarks traffic patterns in any part she saw what glenna described a labyrinth of tunnels chambers blocked with thick doors bodies stacked like so much garbage people in cages like penned cattle and the sounds of it blair could hear that in the back of her mind the weeping the screaming the praying luxury vamp condo she murmured how many ways in i couldnt say in my time the cliffs were riddled with caves some small barely big enough for a child to crawl through others big enough for a man to stand there were more tunnels wider taller than i remember so she excavated shes had plenty of time to make it all homey if we could block them off larkin began and moira turned to him in horror there are people inside people held in cages like animals bodies tossed aside without even the decency of burial he covered her hand with his and said nothing we cant get them out thats what hes not saying to you but it had to be said blair thought even if a couple of us wanted to try a suicide run thats just what it would be wed die theyd die a rescue isnt an option im sorry a spell moira insisted something to blind or bind just until we free those whove been captured we tried to blind her glenna flicked a glance in the rearview to meet moiras eyes we failed maybe a transportation spell she looked at hoyt now would it be possible for us to transport humans ive never done it the risks theyll die in there many have already moira scooted up in her seat to grip hoyts shoulder what greater risk is there than death we could harm them to use magicks that may harm you could save them what choice do you think they would take what choice would you shes got a point if they could do it blair thought if they could save even one it would be worth it and it would be a good hard kick in liliths ass is there a chance you need to see what you move from one place to another hoyt explained and its more successful if youre close to the object this would be through rock and wed be all but blinded not necessarily glenna countered lets think about this lets talk it through while they talked argued discussed blair let it all stew around in the back of her mind pretty day she thought absently the sun shining on all that green the lovely long roll of land with cows grazing lazily tourists would be out taking advantage of the weather after yesterdays storm shopping in the towns or driving out to gawk at the cliffs of mohr getting their snapshots and videos of the dolmen in the burren shed done the same thing herself once upon a time so does geall look anything like this quite a bit really larkin told her its very like home except well the roads the cars most of the buildings but the land itself aye it is its very like home what do you do back there about what exactly well a guys got to make a living right oh we work the land of course and weve horses for breeding selling fine horses ive left my father shorthanded he may not be too pleased with me right at the moment odds are hell understand if you end up saving the world she should have known he worked with his hands blair realized they were strong and hard and he had the look she supposed of a man who spent the bulk of his time outdoors all those sunstreaks in his hair the light golden haze on his skin whoa settle down hormones he was just another member of the team shed been pulled into it was smart to learn all you could about who was fighting beside you and stupid to let yourself get little tingles of lust over them so youre a farmer at the bottom of it how does a farmer know how to use a sword the way you do ah he swiveled around to face her more directly for a moment just a short moment he lost his trend her eyes were so deep and blue sure we have tournaments games i like to play in them i like to win she could see that as well though it was probably more hollywood than geallian yeah me too i like to win so then do you play games there was a teasing playfully sexy undercurrent in the question shed have had to have been braindead to miss it braindead for a month she decided not to feel the little buzz not so much but i win when i do he draped an arm over the back of her seat in a casual move in some games both sides are the winner maybe mostly when i fight im not playing around play balances out the fighting dont you think and our tournaments well theyll have served as a kind of preparation for whats to come there are many men in geall and some women besides who have a good hand with a sword or a lance if the war goes there as were told it will well have an army to meet these things well need it what do you do glenna says that women must work for a living here or that most do are you paid in coin to hunt demons no he wasnt touching her and she couldnt say he was putting moves on her but she felt as if he were its not the way it works theres some family money i mean were not rolling in it or anything but theres a cushion we own pubs chicago new york boston like that pubs is it i like a good pub who doesnt anyway i do some waitressing and some personal training his brows knit training for battle not really its more for health and vanity ah helping people get in shape lose weight tone up i dont need a lot of money so it works out okay gives me some room too to take off when i need to she glanced over moira was staring out the side window like a woman in a dream in the front hoyt and glenna continued to talk magic blair leaned closer to larkin lowered her voice look maybe our magical lovebirds can pull this transportation bit off maybe not if they cant youre going to have to handle your cousin i dont handle moira sure you do if weve got a shot at executing a little cavein or firing up those caves we have to take it their faces were close now their voices down to whispers and the people inside we burn them alive or bury them the same way she wont accept it neither can i do you know what torment theyre in now its not of our doing caged and tortured she kept her eyes on his and her voice was low and empty forced to watch when one of thems dragged out of the cage and fed on terrified or well beyond that while they wonder if theyll be next maybe hoping they will just so it ends there was no playfulness now in his face in his tone i know what they do you think you know maybe they dont drain them not the first time maybe not the second they just toss them back in the cage it burns the bite if you live through it it burns flesh blood bone a reminder of the impossible pain when those fangs sank into you how do you know she turned her wrist over so he could see the faint scar i was eighteen pissed off about something and careless in a cemetery up in boston waiting for one to rise i went to school with the guy went to his funeral and heard enough to know hed been bitten i had to find out if hed been turned so i went and i waited he did this larkin traced a finger over the scar he had help no way a fresh one wouldve managed it but the one who sired him came back older smarter stronger i made some mistakes and he didnt why were you alone hunting alone is what i do she reminded him but in this case i was out to prove something to someone doesnt matter except that it made me careless he didnt bite me the older one he held me down while the other one crawled over toward me wait can you tell me is that the way of it with a sire to provide food aye that would be the word for it wouldnt it it was a good question she decided good that he wanted to understand the phychology and pathology of the enemy sometimes not always depends id say on why the sire chose to change instead of just drink they can form attachments or want a hunting partner even just want a younger one around to do the grunt work you know sort of work for them i see that so the sire held you down so the younger could feed first and how terrifying he thought would that have been to be restrained probably injured to be eighteen and alone while something with a face youd once known came for you i could smell the grave on him he was that fresh he was too hungry to go for the throat so he got me here that was the mistake for both of them the pain woke me up its unspeakable she said nothing for a moment it threw her off her stride the way he laid his fingers on that scar now as if to ease an old wound she couldnt remember the last time anyone had touched her to comfort anyway i got a hand on my cross and i jabbed it right into that bastards eye the one holding me down christ did he scream the other ones so busy trying to eat he doesnt worry about anything else he was an easy kill they were both easy after that you were just a girl no i was a demon hunter and i was stupid she looked larkin in the eye now so he would see that comfort sympathy couldnt stand in front of sense and strategy if hed gone for the throat id be dead yeah probably id be dead and we wouldnt be having this conversation i know what i felt when i saw that thing coming for me in the good black suit his mother had picked out for him to be buried in i know what those people inside those caves feel at least i know a part of it if they cant be saved deaths kinder than whats waiting for them he closed his hand over her wrist completely covering the scar surprising her with the gentleness of the touch did you love the boy yeah well the way you do when youre that age shed almost forgotten that nearly forgotten how sad shed been even through the pain all i could do for him was take him out and take out the one whod killed him it cost you more than this larkin lifted her hand brushed his lips over the scar more than the pain and the burn shed nearly forgotten too she realized what it was like to have someone understand maybe it did but it taught me something important you cant save everyone thats a sad lesson dont you think even when you know you cant you should try anyway thats amateur talk this isnt a game or a contest somebody beats you in this you die well cians not here to dispute the matter but would you want to live forever she let out a short laugh hell no t here were others along that lonely stretch of cliff and sea but not as many as blair had expected the views were amazing but she supposed there were others equally dramatic and more easily accessible they parked and took what weapons and tools they could most easily conceal someone might spot her sword in its back sheath under the long leather coat blair decided but theyd have to be looking and then what were they going to do about it she studied the lay of the land the road the other cars parked along it a middleaged couple had climbed to some of the tabletop rocks at the base of the cliff where it now met the road looking out to sea and completely oblivious to the nightmare that lived below okay so its over the seawall and down gonna get wet she concluded looking down at the narrow strip of shale then the teeth of the rocks where the water swirled and plumed she glanced back at the others can you handle this as an answer larkin rolled over the wall she started to shout at him to wait to wait one damn minute but he was already heading down the jagged drop that faced the sea he didnt change into a lizard she observed but he could sure as hell climb like one she had to give him as for balls and agility okay moira take it slow if you slip your cousin should break your fall as moira went over blair looked at glenna never did any rock climbing glenna muttered never could figure out the damn point until now so i guess theres always a first time youll be fine but blair watched moiras progress and was relieved she was proving nearly as agile as her cousin the drops not that bad from here it wont kill you she didnt add that bones would be broken she didnt have to hoyt and glenna went over together and blair followed there were some reasonably good handholds she discovered as long as you werent worried about your manicure she concentrated on getting the job done ignored the cold spray as she worked her way down hands gripped her waist lifted her down the last couple of feet thanks she told larkin but ive got it a bit awkward with the sword he glanced up to the road grinned fun though lets keep the party moving they probably have guards maybe some human servants though it has to be tough keeping humans on tap if theres as many vampires in there as you said i didnt see anyone alive outside of cages glenna told her not when we looked before this time its live and in person so if theyve got any thats who theyll send out hoyt youd better take point since you know the area its different you see its different than it was some of what he was feeling leaked into his voice the emotion and the sorrow nature and man have done it that road above us and the wall the tower with the light looking up over he saw his cliffs the ledge that had saved his life when hed fought with what cian had become once he thought hed stood up there and called the lightning as easily as a man calls his hound it had changed he couldnt deny it but still in the heart of it it was his place he made his way through the rocks over them through the spray there should be a cave here and theres nothing but he laid his hands on the earth and rock this is not real this is false maybe youre a little turned around blair began wait glenna made her way over to him put her hands next to his a barrier conjured hoyt agreed to look and feel like the land but it isnt the land this isnt earth and rock its illusion can you break it down larkin thumped a fist against the rock testing hold on frowning blair slicked back her damp hair shes got enough mojo for this or has someone in there with enough we dont know what else she has this is smart blair tested the wall herself really smart nobody gets in unless she wants them in nobody gets out unless she wants them out so we just walk away larkin demanded i didnt say that there are more openings pockets in the wall were hoyt corrected this is a powerful spell and nobodys curious people who come here live here about what happened to them blair nodded thats powerful too she wants her privacy were going to have to disappoint her hands on hips she turned around searching hey hoyt can you and glenna carve a message into that big rock over there it can be done whats the message glenna asked her gotta think of one since up yours bitch seems a little too ordinary tremble moira murmured and blair gave her a nod of approval excellent short to the point and just a little cocky take care of that will you then well get started on the rest what is the rest larkin wanted to know he gave the wall a frustrated kick a stronger message would be to break this spell yeah it would but right now im thinking she doesnt know were out here that could be an advantage she heard something like a small blast of gunpowder and turned to see the word tremble deeply carved into the rock below it was another carving of what she assumed was lilith with a stake through her heart hey nice job i really like the artwork a little flourish glenna dusted off her hands i paint and i couldnt resist the dig what do you need to try the transportation spell glenna blew out a breath time space focus and a hell of a lot of luck not from here hoyt shook his head the cliffs are mine the caves are hers however much time has passed the cliffs are still mine well work the spell from above he turned to glenna we have to see first we cant transport what we cant see its likely shell sense us and do whatever she can to stop us maybe not right away we wont be looking for her this time but for people she may not realize what were doing and give us the time we need hoyts right its better done on the cliffs glenna told blair if we can get anyone out we wouldnt want to bring them out here in any case good point maybe they wouldnt get any solid intel out of this trip blair mused but they might not walk away emptyhanded so what do we do with them if it works get them to safety glenna lifted her hands one step at a time i can try to help you i havent much magic moira added but i could try to help every little bit helps glenna said okay the three of you go up larkin and i will stay here incasewell in case anything that comes out this way to give us trouble has to be human well handle it it could take a while glenna warned her blair studied the sky plenty of daylight left she waited until theyd started up before she spoke to larkin we cant go in if this magic deal opens up the caves we cant go in i mean it she punched his arm i can see what youre thinking oh can you now rush in grab a maiden in distress or two run out the hero youre wrong about the hero end of it that wouldnt be what im looking for but now a pretty maiden in distress is hard for a man to resist resist it you dont know the caves you dont know where shes holding the prisoners and you dont know their numbers or how theyre equipped listen im not saying a part of me wouldnt like to go charging in there if it opens up do some damage maybe save some lives but wed never make it out alive and neither would anyone else we have the swords hoyt and glenna charmed the fire swords she struggled with frustration it was so damn irritating to have to explain basic strategy and wed take some vamps with us no question then theyd have us and the swords i know the sense of what youre saying but its hard to stand by and do nothing if the magic team pulls this off it wont be nothing youre too good in a fight for us to lose you trying something that cant work oh a compliment not many of those spill out of your lips he grinned at her while drops of sea spray glinted in his hair i wont go in i give you my word on it he held out a hand for hers when she took it he gave it an easy squeeze but there wouldnt be anything stopping us from slapping some fire in the hole should this bloody rock open it would be what you call making a statement wouldnt it guess it would just dont get cocky larkin sure i was born that way im afraid whats a man to do after all he turned to face the wall and leaned back on one of the wet rocks as the spume sprayed and looked relaxed enough blair noted that he might have been sitting in the parlor by the fire well likely weve got some time on our hands just now so tell me how did you first know youd be a demon hunter you want the story of my life now he moved his shoulders might as well pass the time and ill admit to some curiosity about it before i left geall i wouldnt have believed any of this not at the heart of it and now well he stared thoughtfully at the wall of rock and sod whats a man to do he repeated he had a point she decided she moved over to join him angling her body so that she could scan one sweep of the cliff face while he took the other i was four young young to have any understanding of matters that dark that theyre real im saying and not just the shadows a child imagines are monsters things are a little different in my family i thought it would be my brother i was jealous i guess thats natural enough the sibling rivalry she slid her hands into the pockets of her coat idly toying with the plastic bottle of holy water shed shoved in there before theyd left hed have been six six and a half my fatherd been working with him simple tumbling basic martial arts and weaponry lots of tension in the house back then my parents marriage was falling apart how it happens maybe in his world the sky was rosy pink and love was forever people get dissatisfied feelings change added to it my mother was sick of the life the things that took my father away she wanted normal and it was her mistake shed married someone whod never give it to her so she was busy picking fights with my father and he was busy ignoring her and working with my brother which would mean larkin thought that no one was paying attention to her poor little lamb so i was always after my father to train me too or trying to do some of the stuff my brother was doing my younger brother trailed after me like a shadow when we were children this is the same in all worlds i suppose bug you bother you she amended oh drove me mad some of the time others i didnt mind so much if he was close by it was easier to devil him and others yet well it wasnt so bad as company so pretty much the same as with me and my brother then this one day they were down in the training area a space most people would have a family room but you had to have a family to rate a family room we had equipment weights a pommel horse uneven bars rings one whole wall was mirrored she could still see it perfectly and the way theyd reflected her father and her brother so close together while shed been off to the side and alone i watched them in the mirrors they didnt know i was there my father was giving mick my brother a rash of grief because mick just couldnt get this move back flip she murmured dive shoulder roll throw the stake into the target mick just couldnt get it and my father was dead set he would finally mick got pissy himself and he threw the stake across the room it had almost brushed her fingers she remembered as if it had been meant for her hand it rolled right to me i knew i could do it i just wanted to show my father i could do it i just wanted him to look at me so i did i called his name watch me daddy and i did it the way id watched him do it over and over trying to get mick to understand the rhythm she closed her eyes a moment because she could still see herself still feel it in her as if the world had stopped and only she was in motion for those few seconds hit the heart mostly luck but i hit the heart i was so happy look what i did micks eyes just about fell out of his head thenthere was this little smile in them just a little i didnt know what it meant then i thought hed just gotten a kick out what i did because we mostly got along pretty well my father didnt say anything not for a few seconds seemed like an hour and i thought he was going to yell at me for doing something well getting in the way and not yell really he never raised his voice thats all about control i figured he was going to tell me to go back up with my mother you know dismiss me but he didnt he told mick to go upstairs and it was just him and me just me and my father and he was finally looking at me he must have been very proud very pleased hell no her laugh was short and without any humor he was disappointed thats what i saw when he finally looked at me he was disappointed that it was me and not mick now he was stuck with me surely he larkin trailed off when she turned her head met his eyes im sorry sorry his lack of vision hurt you cant change what you are another lesson shed learned hard so he trained me and mick got to play baseball that was the smile relief joy mick hed never wanted what my father wanted for him hes got more of my mother in him when she left filed for divorce i mean she took mick and i stayed with my father i got what i wanted more or less she stiffened when larkin put an arm around her shoulders but when she would have shifted away he tightened his grip in the comfort of a onearmed hug i dont know your father or your brother but i do know id rather be here with you than either of them you fight like an avenging angel and you smell good he surprised a laugh out of her a genuine laugh and with it she relaxed against the wet rock with his arm around her shoulders chapter o n the cliffs the circle was cast now and again there was the sound of a car passing on the road below but no one walked here or snapped their pictures or stood on his headland perhaps hoyt thought the gods did what they could its so clear today moira looked skyward barely a cloud so clear you can see across the water all the way to gaillimh galway glenna stood gathering strength and courage ive always wanted to go there to see the bay to wander along shop street and so we will hoyt took her hand now after samhain now we look and we find youre sure of the location where well send any if we can transport glenna nodded id better be she took moiras hand in turn focus she told her and say the words she felt it from hoyt that first low rumble of power the reaching out glenna pushed toward it pulling moira with her on this day and in this hour i call upon the sacred power of morrigan the goddess and pray she grant to us her grace and prowess in your name mother we seek the sight ask you to guide us into the light lady hoyt spoke show us those held beneath this ground against their will help us find what is lost blind the beasts that seek to kill moira struggled to focus as the air began to swirl around her that no innocents will pay the cost goddess and mother they said together our power unite to bring into day what is trapped in the night now we seek and now we see as we will so mote it be darkness and shadows and dank air fetid with the foulness of death and decay now a shimmer of light glimmers of shapes in the shadows there was the sound of weeping so harsh so human and the moans and gibbering of those who had no tears left to shed they floated through the maze of tunnels felt the cold as if their bodies walked there and even the mind shuddered at what they saw cages stacked three deep four high jammed into a cave washed in a sickly green light but their minds saw through the gloom of it to the blood pooled on the floor to the faces of the terrified and the mad even as they watched a vampire unlocked one of the cages dragged the woman inside it out the sound she made was a kind of keening and her eyes seemed already dead loras bored it said as it pulled her across the filthy floor by the hair she wants something to play with in one of the cages a man began to beat the bars and scream you bastards you bastards the tear that spilled down glennas cheek was cold hoyt well try him the one whos shouting hes strong and it may help see him see nothing else because she needed the words as well as the sight glenna began to chant moiras voice joined her and the ground trembled l arkin was singing something about a blackhaired maid from dara blair didnt mind listening he had a clear easy voice the sort she thought of a man used to raising it in a pub or while he walked the fields and it was calming to have the tune the steady roar of the sea and the warm beam of the sun added to it the simple companionship was a change for her usually when she waited she waited alone you wouldnt have the little thing the little thing with the music in it with you no sorry next time i get a chance im buying myself a pair of those oakley thumps got the mp player built in sunglasses she mimed the shape of them over her face and it occurred to her larkin would look damn hot wearing a pair himself with the little thing with the music inside them you can wear the music his whole face lit up what a world of miracles this is i dont know about miracles but its jammed with technology wish id thought to bring the player along music would be easier than all this conversation she was used to waiting alone damn it not hanging around with a companion exchanging small talk and life stories it was making her itchy well thats all right be nice if i had my pipe pipe she turned her head couldnt quite fit the idea of a pipe with that gilded irish god face you smoke a pipe smoke no no he laughed shifted his weight as he lifted his hands in front of his mouth wiggled his fingers play the pipe now and again oh okay his eyes were the color of good dark honey might look hot in a pair of oakleys she mused but it would be a shame to put lenses over those eyes that works do you play anything musically me no never had time to learn unless you count beating out a tattoo on vampires she mimed again it seemed they did a lot of charades between them punching her fists in the air well now your sword sings thats for certain he gave her a friendly little shoulder bump dont know as ive heard the like of it and this would be a fine place for a battle im thinking he tapped fingers rhythmically on the hilt of his sword the sea the rocks the bright sun aye a fine spot sure if you like not having an escape route or losing your footing on slick rocks drowning he gave her a pitying look and a sigh youre not considering the atmosphere the dramatic tone of it all can vampires drown he wondered not so much theydid you feel that she pushed off the rock as the ground under her vibrated i did maybe the spells breaking down he drew his sword scanned the cliff wall maybe the caves behind it will appear now if they do youre not going in you gave your word i keep my word irritation flickered over his face this was the soldier now she noted and not the pipeplaying farmer but if one of them sticks its head out just a bitdo you see anything im not seeing anything different than it was no nothing maybe its the magic trio on the cliffs seems like theyve had enough time to do something she kept her hand on the stake in her belt as she worked her way as far toward the crashing surf as she dared cant see from here can you like be a bird like a hawk or something take a look up there i can of course i dont like to leave you alone down here irritation rippled down her spine here she was explaining herself again im in the sun vamps cant come out besides ive worked alone for a long time lets get a status report on magic time i dont like not knowing where we stand he could do it quickly he thought he could be up and back in a matter of minutes and from the sky he could see her and anything that came at her as well as the group on the cliffs so he passed blair his sword and thought of the hawk of its shape of its vision and of its heart the light shimmered into him over him in that change as arms became wings as lips formed a beak as talons sprang and curled there was a sudden and breathless pain then freedom he soared up a gold hawk that took the air and circled once over blair with a cry like triumph wow she stared up watching his flight the sheer power and majesty of it shed seen him change before had ridden on his back when hed taken the shape of a horse into battle and still she was dumbstruck that is so sexy while the ground continued to shake she gripped larkins sword drew her own and with the sea roaring at her back faced the blank wall of the cliff overhead the hawk swept through the air over the cliffs he could see keenly enough to pick out individual blades of grass the petals of the rugged wildflowers that forced their way through fissures in rock to seek the sun he saw the long ribbon of the road the wide plate of the sea and all the way to where the land met it again the hawk yearned to fly and to hunt the man inside it pitted his will against that yearning even as he skimmed the sky he could see them below his cousin the witch and the sorcerer hands linked as they stood on the quaking ground there was light wild and white in them around them a spinning circle that rose up in a tower to shake the air even as the ground the wind caught at him plucked at his wings like greedy fingers in it he could hear their voices blended together as one and could feel their power a hot stream that washed the whirling air then that wind slapped at him and sent him into a rolling spinning dive blair heard the hawk cry saw it spiral her heart rolled up into her throat lodged there as larkin tumbled through the air it stayed there a hot hard ball even as the hawk sheered up wings spread then dived to land gracefully at her feet for a moment she saw the melding of them hawk and man then larkin stood facing her his breathing labored his face pale what the hell was that what the hell happened i thought you were going to splat your nose is bleeding her voice was tinny to his ears so he shook his head as if to clear it not surprising he swiped at the blood somethings happening up there something very big from the feel of it the light damn near blinded me and the winds a bloody wicked one i couldnt tell not for certain if theyre in trouble but i think wed best go up and make certain okay she started to hand him his sword and the ground heaved offbalance she pitched forward he managed to catch her but the momentum threw him back against the rock and nearly sent both of them into the water sorry sorry but it was brace against him or fall you hurt knocked the bleeding breath out of me again is all the next spume of surf soaked them both screw this wed better get out of here im for that steady now they linked their arms around each others waists struggling to stay upright rock and sod began to spill down the cliff face making the idea of climbing up it again unappealing if not impossible i can get us up to the others he told her youll just have to hold on and ill he broke off as the wall itself began to waver to change to open well now he murmured what have we here spell broke down or was broken down could be trouble im hoping right there with you even as he spoke they rushed out big and burly and armed with swords how can they not vamps blair pushed away from larkin planted her feet she figured the quaking ground was as much a problem for the enemy as it was for her and larkin fight now explain later she swung her sword up blocked the first blow the force rippled down her arm even as the ground buckled under her feet she used it going down blocking again as she snatched one of the stakes out of her belt she jammed it through his leg he stumbled howled and she came up with her sword one down she thought and refused the pity she pivoted nearly went down as the ground came up and clashed steel with the one who sprang behind her out of the corner of her eye she saw larkin taking on two at once bear claw she shouted theres an idea his arm thickened lengthened with the keen black claws that curled out he swiped even as his sword swung in his other hand they were holding their own blair thought but no more than that there was no room to maneuver not when a wrong step could have them tumbling into the sea bashed on the rocks swept away worse than the sword still they couldnt climb not now there was no choice but to stand and fight she fell rolled and the sword plunged into the rocky ground an inch from her face she kicked up pumping hard and sent her opponent into the sea too many of them too many she thought as she gained her feet and staggered but it could be worse it could the light changed dimmed with the false twilight came the first splatters of rain christ jesus christ shes bringing the dark with it vampires began to slink out of the cave the sea and a hard drowning death suddenly seemed the better alternative calculating quickly she sent fire rippling down her blade they could block them with fire hold some back destroy others but too many would get through we cant win this larkin make like a hawk get to the others get them out of here ill hold them off as long as i can dont be foolish get on he threw her his sword hold on he changed but it wasnt a hawk that stood beside her the dragons gold wings spread and as it reared back its tail sliced down the first that came out of the caves she didnt think just leaped on its back locking her legs around its serpentine body she sliced out to the left hacking at one that charged then she was rising up streaming through the gloom and the mist and she couldnt help it couldnt stop it she let out a wild cry of sheer delight throwing back her head as she stabbed the swords into the sky and set them both to flame the wind rushed by her and the ground rushed away she sheathed one sword so that she could run a hand over the dragon the scales glimmering gold felt like polished jewels sunwarmed and smooth looking down she saw earth and sea and swirling pockets of mists that blanketed the jaws of the rocks then she saw on the high cliff three figures sprawled on the tough wet grass get down there get down there fast she knew he could hear and understand her in any form but she might have saved her breath the rush of speed slapped her back as he arrowed toward the ground she was jumping off even as he landed and began to change back the fear was bright silver in her belly but she saw hoyt push himself up to sit saw him reach for glenna his nose was bleeding as hers was when larkin reached moira turned her over blair saw blood on her lips weve got to move weve got to go they could follow us and if they want to they can move fast she pulled glenna to her feet lets move faster im woozy sorry i lean on me larkin but hed already chosen his own way she shoved at her wet hair as she pushed glenna toward the horse hed become get up you and moira hoyt and i are right behind you can you walk she asked hoyt i can if his legs were shaky he still moved and quickly as larkin galloped off so much time passed its dusk no she made it lilith did it shes got more power than i figured no no not her hoyt was forced to brace a hand on blairs shoulder for balance she has someone something with the power to do this well figure it out she half carried half dragged him to the van where larkin was already helping the other women inside glenna keys ive got the wheel glenna fumbled them out of her pocket just need a minute a few minutes to recover that wasit was rugged moira im all right just a bit dizzy is all and a bit sick in the stomach ive neverive never touched anything like that blair drove fast enough to cover some distance and kept an eye on the rearview for a tail earthquakes false dusk a little lightning hell of a ride she slowed as the sun began to break through again looks like she gave up on us for now nobodys hurt just shook up not hurt no hoyt gathered glenna against him brushed the tears from her face with his lips dont a ghra dont weep there were so many so many of them screaming blair took two careful breaths dont do this to yourselves you tried you gave it your best it was always a long shot youd be able to get anyone out of there but we did glenna turned her face into hoyts shoulder five we got five out then we couldnt hold it any longer stunned blair pulled off to the shoulder turned around you got five out where are they hospital i thought glenna she thought if we could get them out we could transport them to a place where they would be safe and be cared for moira looked down at her empty hands smart really smart it gets them medical attention fast and keeps us from having to answer awkward questions congratulations glenna lifted her head and her eyes were ravaged there were so many of them so many more and five people are alive and safe i know youre right i know she straightened rubbed her face dry with her hands im just shaken up we did what we came to do more than what were they larkin asked her what were they you and i fought back there not vampires you said halfvamps still human theyve been bitten probably multiple times but not drained and not allowed to mix blood not changed then why would they fight us theyre controlled the best term i guess is thrall theyre under a thrall and do as theyre ordered i counted seven all big guys we took out four she probably doesnt have any more or not many its got to be tough to keep them under control there was a fight glenna asked blair pulled back onto the road the caves opened she sent out the first wave the halfvamps then she did her little weather trick you thought i would leave you there larkin broke in you thought i would leave you to them first priority is to stay alive that may be but i dont desert a friend or a fellow soldier what manner of man do you think i am thats a question the answer isnt a coward he said tightly its not and a long way from it would she have left him no she admitted couldnt have and would have been insulted to be told to go it was all i could think of to keep the rest of us alive to keep her from winning how was i supposed to know you had a dragon on your repertoire in the back seat glenna choked a dragon sorry you missed it it was wild but jesus larkin a dragon someone must have seen it of course everyone else will think theyre nuts but still why why because you know dragon and how they dont exist fascinated now he swiveled in his seat you dont have dragons here blair shifted her gaze toward him no she said slowly sure thats a pity moira did you hear that theyve no dragons here in ireland moira opened her tired eyes i think shes meaning they dont have them anywhere in this world well that cant be can it no dragons blair confirmed no unicorns or winged horses no centaurs ah well he reached over to pat her arm you have cars and theyre interesting im starved he said after a moment are you starved that many changes it just empties me out could we stop somewhere do you think buy some of those crisps in the bag i t wasnt exactly a victory feast munching on saltandvinegar chips and chugging soda from a bottle but it got them home when they arrived blair stuck the keys in her pocket you three go inside larkin and i can take care of the weapons youre still pretty pale hoyt lifted the bag holding the blood hed bought at the butchers ill take this up to cian blair waited until they were inside were going to have to talk to them she told larkin set up some parameters some boundaries aye we are he leaned on the van as he looked toward the house it was good he thought and somewhat curious how they understood each other at times with no words are we agreed they cant use that kind of magic at least not often not unless theres no choice nosebleeds queasiness headaches she pulled weapons out of the cargo area you had a team she thought you had to worry about its members no choice i could just look at moira and see the headache it cant be good for them that kind of physical toll i thought at first when i saw them on the ground i thought yeah she let out a long unsteady breath so did i ive come to feel a great deal for hoyt and glenna cian too come to that its stronger deeper even than friendship maybe its even more than kinship moirashes always been mine you know i dont know how i could live if anything happened to her if i didnt stop it setting the weapons aside blair boosted herself up on the rear of the van it cant be like that that if the worst happened to her to any of us that you didnt stop it its up to each of us to do what we have to do to survive and to do all we can to watch each others backs but you dont understand his eyes were fierce when they met hers shes part of me no i dont understand because ive never had anyone like that in my life but i think i understand her well enough to know shed be hurt maybe even pissed off if she thought you felt responsible for her not responsible that makes it an obligation and its not its love you know what that is dont you yeah i know what that is annoyed she started to jump down but he moved turning his body until it blocked hers do you think i felt nothing for you nothing when we stood with our backs to the sea and those demons coming out of the dark did you think i felt nothing so would go would save myself because you said to i didnt know you were going to pull a dragon out of your hat so she broke off went rigid when he reached out gripped her chin in his hand did you think i felt nothing he said again and his eyes were deep and gold and thoughtful feel nothing now and hell she thought shed boxed herself in im not asking about your feelings she began im telling you whether you ask or not he moved in a little closer his legs planted on either side of hers his eyes on her face curiously i cant say i know what i feel as i dont think ive felt it before but theres something when i look at you now when i see you in battle or when i watched you just this morning watched you moving like magic in the mist as shed felt something she admitted when shed ridden on his back into battle when shed watched him light up over music this is a really bad idea i havent said i had an idea as yet but ive feelings so many of them i cant seem to pick one out from the others and have a good look at it and so her head jerked back as his bowed to hers her hand slapped on to his wrist oh be still a moment he said with a half laugh and let me have a try at this you cant be afraid of something as easy as a kiss not afraid but certainly wary certainly curious she sat as she was the fingers of one hand curled loosely on the back edge of the van the others around his wrist his lips were soft on hers just a whisper of contact a brush a rub a light and teasing nip she had a moment to think he was very good at this particular game before the mists floated over her mind strong he thought hed known thered be strength and it was a lovely jolt to the system but there was sweetness as well he hadnt been sure of that so that kissing her was like having wine running through his blood and there was need what seemed to be a deep simmering well of need in him he hoped in her the kiss deepened so he heard the sound of her pleasure purr in her throat so he felt that wonderful body of hers press press and yield to his when he would have laid her back back beside the swords the axes she put a hand to his chest and held him away no i hear it plain enough but no isnt what i felt maybe not but its what im saying he traced a finger from her shoulder to her wrist while his eyes searched her face why im not sure why im not sure so its no she turned began to gather weapons im wanting to ask a question he smiled when she glanced over her shoulder do you wear your hair so short so ill be enchanted by the nape of your neck the way it slopes there it make me just want tolick at it no just listen to the way he uses that voice she thought the women of geall must scamper after him like puppies i wear it short because it doesnt give the enemy much to grab and pull if he wants to fight like a girl she turned back and it looks good on me it does that it does like a faerie queen i always thought if they existed theyd have strength and courage in their faces he leaned toward her again and she laid the blade of a sword against his chest he looked down at it up at her this time his smile was full of fun thats a good bit more than no i was just going to kiss you again i wouldnt ask for anything else just one more kiss youre awful damn cute she said after a minute and id be lying if i said i wasnt tempted but because youre awful damn cute and tempting were going to leave it at one all right then if thats the way it has to be he reached past her picked up an ax the bucket of stakes but im just going to be thinking about another one and so are you maybe she started toward the house arms loaded with weapons a little frustration will give me a nice edge he shook his head as he looked after her she was he thought the most fascinating of women chapter b lair went straight up to put the weapons in the training area then went down the back stairs to the kitchen larkin could clean the swords she decided work off some of that sexual energy she found glenna there and the kettle on im making some tea a blend that should take the edge off the day ive heard alcohol does that and considering it blair opened the refrigerator for a beer thats for later for me my systems a little twisted up yet hoyt went up to see cian fill him in good we need to talk glenna could i take you through the steps and stages of the spells later if you need them its all a little too hard and bright just now no i dont need them thats your territory blair boosted herself onto the table watched glenna keep her hands busy i mean that when it comes to this area im a civilian there are some magically inclined and fairly skilled people in my family but nowhere near what you guys have i have more than i did before maybe im more open to it now taking a few pins out of her pocket glenna efficiently bundled her hair up maybe its the connection with hoyt the connection we all have to each other but whatever it is im finding power inside me i never imagined looks good on you too you need to know to accept to understand what the three of you did today was amazing and it was powerful and it saved lives and regardless of that you have to know accept and understand it isnt something you can do again at least not anytime soon we could get more i think glenna said without turning around maybe only one or two at a time we were greedy we wanted to get all we could and we burned it all too long glenna its your territory like i said but im the one who was looking at the three of you after the serious whammy went down the fact is both larkin and i thought for a minute there you were dead what you were was all but emptied out yes thats exactly right exactly the right term for it you may not come back from it the next time isnt that why were here glennas hands were steady now as she measured the tea leaves to risk it all isnt it true that any one of us might not come back each time we walk out the door each time we pick up a weapon how many times have you picked up a weapon and the gift you have and risked it all i couldnt count the times this is different you know it larkin and iwe need you we need the rest of you strong and healthy you nearly died today didnt you thanks to dragonboy blair glenna turned took the steps over and closed her hand tight over blairs connections glenna had said and blair felt it now you didnt evade the truth blair decided with someone you were so closely connected to okay yeah it was bad bad enough i wasnt sure wed get out of it but it couldve been worse we all did our jobs and now im having a beer and youre making tea good for us youre better at this than i am glenna murmured no im not just more used to it being used to it i can have a beer because i know we not only beat her today glenna we insulted her and that feels tingly right down to my toes and you know what id like i think i do i think youd like to go back there and do it all again bet your ass i would nothing better thats the pure truth but it would be stupid selfindulgent and it would probably get us all killed take the victory glenna cause you sure as hell earned it and accept you may not be able to do it just that way again i know it glenna walked back to the stove when the water began to boil i know youre right its hard to accept youre right in the past few weeks ive held magicks stronger than anything i ever dreamed existed it thrills and it costs i know well need more time more preparation if we try to do what we did today again she poured the water into the pot i thought wed lost moira she said quietly i felt her falling away slipping shes not as strong magically as i am certainly not as strong as hoyt as the tea steeped she turned back to face blair we let her go we let her go only an instant before it exploded i dont know what would have happened to her if wed held her in with us would you have gotten so many out without her no no we needed her take the victory it was a good day one question though how did you know where to send them not the magic stuff just the logistics oh i had a map glenna smiled a little id already calculated the quickest routes to hospitals in case any of us needed one so it was just a matter of well of following the map a map after a laugh blair took a deep drink youre something glenna you are something else vampire bitch had you on her team i think wed be sunk hell of a day she said with a sigh i rode on a freaking dragon it was cute wasnt it how surprised he was we didnt have any chuckling now easier now glenna got down cups and saucers what did he look like i paint them sometimes like youd expect i guess he was gold long wicked tail took a couple of them out with it and the bodys more sinuous than snakelike yeah long and sinuous the body the tail the head gold eyes god he was beautiful and the wings wide peaked translucent scales big as my hand that went from pale gold to dark and all the shades between and fast holy god hes fast its like riding the sun i was just she trailed off when she saw glenna leaning back against the counter smiling what i was just wondering if you have that look in your eye over the dragon or over the man were talking dragon but the mans not half bad gorgeous fairly adorable and with the heart of a champion blair raised her eyebrows hey didnt you recently get married to somebody else it didnt strike me blind just fyi larkin gets that look in his eye now and again when he turns in your direction maybe he does and maybe ill think about taking him up on it one of these days but right now she slid off the table im going to go upstairs and take a really long really hot shower blair sometimes the heart of a champion is tender im not looking to bruise hearts i was thinking of yours too glenna replied when she was alone blair heard voices from the library as she passed and veered just close enough to identify them satisfied that larkin was speaking with moira she rerouted for the steps to head upstairs she wanted nothing more than to wash away the sea salt the blood and the death she paused at the top of the steps when she saw cian in the shadows of the hallway she knew her fingers had reached down to skim over the stake in her belt and didnt bother to pretend she hadnt it was kneejerk hunter vampire theyd both have to accept it and move on a little early for you to be up and around isnt it my brother has no respect for my sleep cycle there was something preternaturally sexual she thought about a vampire staring out from the cloaked light or there was with this one hoyt had a rough one so i could see for myself he looked ill but then the smile was slow and deliberate hes human do you work on that kind of thing the silky voice the dangerous smile born with it died with it too are we going to come to terms you and me i think we have she saw his gaze slide down to her hand and the stake under it cant help it but she lifted the hand away hooked her thumb in her belt its ingrained do you enjoy your work i guess i do on some level im good at it and you have to like doing what youre good at its what i do its what i am yes we are what we are he stepped closer you look as she must have when she was your age younger i suppose shed have been younger our nola when she looked as you did women wore down faster then a lot of times vampires look to family for their first kills homes the place you go where they have to take you in do you think any of the others in this house would be alive if i wanted them otherwise no so it was time for honesty i think youd have played along with them for a few days maybe a week get some jollies out of it and wait until they trusted you let their guards down then youd have slaughtered them you think like a vampire he acknowledged its part of your skill so why havent i slaughtered the lot of them she kept her eyes on his struck suddenly by the fact it was nearly like looking into her own same color same shape we are what we are i guess thats not what you are or not anymore i killed my share in my day but excepting that i once tried to kill my brother i never touched my family i cant say why except i didnt want their lives youre family whether either of us is comfortable with that you come from my sister you have her eyes and once i loved her quite a lot she felt something not pity it wasnt something he asked for but she felt a kind of understanding following the feeling she drew the stake out of her belt keeping the point toward her and handed it to him a look of bemusement passed over his face as he studied it im not going to have to start calling you uncle cian am i he managed to grin and looked pained at the same time please dont they parted ways with cian going downstairs then into the kitchen he found glenna fussing with tea trays she looked a little hollowed out he thought and shadowed around the eyes have you ever considered having someone else play mother she jerked at his voice clattering the cup she was holding onto the tray guess im jumpy she reset the cup carefully in its saucer what did you say i wonder why one of the others cant deal with food now and then they do well larkins slippery but the others do anyway it keeps me busy from what im told youve been busy with things nondomestic hoyt spoke to you he seems to enjoy waking me in the middle of the day which is why i want coffee he added as he moved to the counter to make it when he saw her frowning at the stake he set beside the pot he shrugged a sort of peace offering you could say from blair oh well thats good isnt it he shifted caught her chin in his hand go lie down red before you fall down thats what the teas about its a restorative we need it batteries dead low here she managed a smile but it faded quickly she brought a storm cian she has someone with her who has enough power to call a storm to block the sun so we need to recharge those batteries hoyt and i have to work and we need to work with moira we need to pull out what she has help her hone it she turned back began to arrange cookies on pretty little plates anything to keep her hands moving we were separated today the three of us on the high cliffs blair and larkin below they couldve been killed and we couldnt have helped them couldnt have stopped it we didnt see it coming because we were so focused on the transportation spell and when it came when the power whipped around and slapped us down we were already tapped out suffering for it now he thought humans always would suffer for what theyd done and for what they hadnt now you have a better idea of your limits were not allowed to have limits oh bugger that glenna he snatched up a cookie of course you have limits youve expanded them and likely youll push the box a bit wider before youre done she has limits as well and thats what youre forgetting lilith has weaknesses and is neither invulnerable nor omnipotent which you proved today by slipping five of her trophies out from under her he bit into the cookie as he got down a mug i know i should think of the five we saved blair said to take the victory and shed be right i know i know but oh god i wish i didnt see the ones we left behind i wish their faces their screams werent in my head we cant save them all and i said as much to hoyt when we were in new york it was easy to say it then she shook her head and youre right i need some rest i have to take this tray up see that the others get some of it inside them you could do me a favor i probably could you could take this one into the library moiras in there shell likely think its poisoned if i take it into her oh stop all right all right but dont blame me if she pours it down some drain he hefted the tray muttering to himself as he left the kitchen im a vampire for gods sake creature of the damn night drinker of blood and here i am playing butler to some erstwhile geallian queen mortifying is what it is and hed wanted to pass some time in the library with a book and the fire he stepped in leading with his irritation and a scathing comment rolling up to the tip of his tongue which would have been wasted he decided as she was curled up on one of the sofas sleeping now what the hell was he supposed to do leave her be wake her and pour the damn tea into her undecided he stood where he was studying her pretty enough he thought with a potential for true beauty if she put any effort into it at least when she slept it didnt seem as though her eyes would swallow her face and whoever she aimed those long large gray beacons toward with it there was a time hed have found it entertaining to corrupt and defile her kind of innocence to peel it away slowly layer by layer until there was nothing left of it these days he preferred the simplicity of the more experienced women who were in it for no more than he was a few hours of heat in the dark creatures like this took a great deal of effort he couldnt remember the last time hed been stirred enough to play with one in the end he decided to leave the tray on the table if she woke shed drink it if she didnt well sleep itself would go a long way to restoring her either way hed have done the chore he moved to the table laid the tray down with barely a click of china on wood but she stirred nonetheless a low moan a little tremor he backed away his eyes on her face and was careless enough to step into a thin slant of sunlight the quick searing pain in his shoulder had him cursing under his breath even as he moved quickly out of the beam annoyed with glenna with himself with the sleeping queen he turned to go she began to twitch in her sleep small sounds of fear gurgling in her throat her body rolled up into a tight ball as she shuddered and in sleep she began to speak breathlessly no no no again and again until she fell into unintelligible gaelic she thrashed rolling to her back going stiff as she bowed up exposing the line of her throat he moved quickly stepping between the couch and the table and leaning down gave her a hard shake wake up he ordered snap out of it now i havent the patience for this she moved fast and he faster slapping the stake she stabbed out with from her hand it clattered on the floor ten feet away dont do that he gripped her wrist felt her pulse striking like an anvil against his fingers next time you do ill snap this like a twig i promise you i i i very succinct are you understanding me her eyes huge and glassy with fear darted around the room she was here she was here no no not here moira came up to her knees gripping his arm with her free hand where is she where i can still smell her too sweet too heavy stop he released her wrist to take hold of her shoulders another shake had her teeth chattering you were asleep you were dreaming no i waswas i i dont know its not dark its not dark yet but it was she put her hands on his chest but instead of pushing him away as he expected she simply dropped her head there im sorry im sorry i need a moment he caught himself reaching back to stroke her hair that long thick braid the color of dark oak he dropped his hand to the side you fell asleep here on the couch he said in a flat almost businesslike voice you had a dream now youre awake i thought lilith she reared back i nearly staked you no not even close i didnt mean i wouldnt have meant she closed her eyes in an obvious effort to find some composure when she opened them her eyes were clearer and very direct im very sorry but why are you here he stepped to the side gestured now it was simple shock that moved over her face youyou made me tea and biscuits glenna he corrected surprisingly embarrassed at the very thought im just the delivery boy um its very kind of you all the same i didnt mean to sleep i thought i would read after larkin went upstairs but i have your tea then youll likely be the better for it when she only nodded made no move he cast his eyes to the ceiling then he poured out a cup of tea lemon or cream your highness she tipped her head to look at him youre annoyed with me and who could blame you for it you brought me tea and i tried to kill you then dont waste my time or the bloody tea here he pushed the cup into her hands drink it down glennas orders still watching him she took a sip its very nice then her lips trembled her eyes filled his belly tightened ill leave you with it then and with your tears i wasnt strong enough the tears didnt fall just glimmered in her eyes like rain over fog i couldnt help them hold the spell i couldnt do it so it broke away it shattered and it was like shards of glass ripping through us we couldnt get any of the others any of the others from the cages he wondered if he should tell her that lilith would only replace the ones they took likely twice the number in her fury now you waste your own time blaming yourself and feeling sorry for yourself with it if you couldve done more you would have in the dream she said she wouldnt bother to drink me being the smallest the weakest i wouldnt be worth the trouble he sat on the table facing her helped himself to one of her biscuits shes lying how do you know creature of the night remember the smallest is very often the sweetest a kind of appetizer if you will if i were still in the habit of it id bite you in a heartbeat she lowered the tea cup to frown at him is that in some strange way a kind of flattery take it as you like well thank youi suppose finish off your tea he got to his feet ask glenna for something to block the dreams shes bound to have it cian she said as he started toward the doorway i am grateful for everything he only nodded and continued out a thousand years he thought and he still didnt really understand humans and women in particular b lair drank glennas tea and decided shed stretch out for an hour with her headphones ideally the music would rest her mind give it time to clear and recharge but it all circled around with patty griffins soulful voice the sea the cliffs the battle that moment when the sky darkened of absolute certainty that shed come to the end and that tiny cold seed of relief inside her that it would finally be over she didnt have a death wish she thought she didnt but there was that small secret place in her that was tired so horribly tired of being alone of having what she was and what she had to do dictate she would stay alone alone with blood and death and endless violence it had cost her the love of a man shed wanted so much and the future shed believed they would have together was that when it had started she wondered was that when that little seed had planted itself inside her the night jeremy had walked away from her pitiful she thought and pulled off the headphones pathetic was she going to let her psyche be twisted up by a man and one who hadnt been man enough to deal with her would she come to accept death just because he hadnt accepted her for who and what she was that was just bullshit she turned to her side hugging her pillow as she studied the fading light through the window she only thought of jeremy because larkin had gotten her juices going again she didnt want to go soft again for a man to feel herself being taken over and swept off by all that emotion sex was okay sex was fine as long as it didnt mean anything more than relief and release she couldnt go through the pain again and that awful feeling of abandonment that left the heart a quivering bleeding mass inside the chest no one stayed she thought as she closed her eyes nothing was forever she drifted off the music from the headphones shed neglected to turn off tinny and distant it filled her head the music that was her own excited blood pumping it was nearly dawn the nights work over but she was so full of energy so fired up she knew she could go for hours yet she looked down at herself as she walked the last block toward home shed ruined another shirt the job she thought was hell on the wardrobe it was torn and bloody and her left shoulder was a mass of bruises and throbbing pain but she was so juiced the suburban street was quiet and pretty everyone tucked up in bed and safe and as the sun came up the dogwoods and tulip trees were so showy and pink she could smell hyacinths and took a deep breath of soft sweet spring it was the morning of her eighteenth birthday so she was going to clean up rest up then spend a lot of time making herself irresistible for a very hot birthday date as she unlocked the front door of the house where she lived with her father she slung her bag off her good shoulder dumped it she needed to clean her weapons but first she wanted about a gallon of water then she spotted the suitcases sitting near the door and the leading edge of thrill dropped away he came down the steps already wearing his coat he was so handsome she thought tall and dark that chiseled face and bold eyes just the slightest glint of silver in his hair a world of love and misery opened inside her so youre back he glanced at her shirt if youre going to let them bloody you take a change of clothes youll draw attention to yourself walking around like that no one saw me where are you going romania to research primarily romania couldnt i go id really like to see no ive left a checkbook there should be enough to run the house for several months months butwhen are you coming back im not he picked up a small carryon bag slung it over his shoulder ive done all i can for you youre eighteen youre of age but you cant please dont just go what did i do nothing ive put the house in your name stay or sell it go where you like its your life why how can you just walk out on me this way youre my father ive trained you to the best of my ability and yours theres nothing else i can do for you you could stay with me you could love me just a little he opened the door picked up the suitcases it wasnt regret she saw on his face but an absence he was she understood already gone i have an early flight if i need anything else ill send for it do i mean anything to you he looked at her then full in the face youre my legacy he said and walked out the door she wept of course stood there alone with spring wafting in on the pretty breeze she cancelled her date spent her birthday alone in the house a few days later she sat alone again in the cemetery preparing to destroy what the boy shed cared for had become for the rest of her life she would wonder if shed kept that date would he have lived now she stood in the bedroom of her boston apartment facing the man in whom shed poured all her love and her hopes jeremy please lets sit down we need to talk about this talk there was still dull shock in his eyes as he shoved clothing into a duffle i cant talk about this i dont want to know about this nobody should know about this i did it wrong she reached out had him shrug her away in a gesture so sharp and dismissive she felt it cut her to the bone i shouldnt have taken you out shown you but you wouldnt believe me when i tried to tell you that you kill vampires what was i thinking not believing you i had to show you we couldnt get married if you didnt know everything it wasnt fair to you fair he whirled toward her and she saw it clearly on his face not just the fear not just the rage disgust this is fair you lying and deceiving me all this time i didnt lie i omitted and im sorry god im so sorry but it wasnt something i could tell you when we firstand then i didnt know how to tell you what i was what i do what you are is a freak she jerked her head back as if hed slapped her im not a freak i know youre upset but upset i dont know who you are what you are christ what ive been sleeping with all these months but i know this i want you to stay away from me away from my family my friends you need time i get that but ive given you all the time youre going to get it makes me sick to look at you thats enough its past enough do you think i could be with you that i could touch you again after this whats wrong with you she demanded what i did saved lives it would have killed people jeremy it would have hunted and killed innocent people i stopped it it doesnt exist he dragged the duffle off the bed theyd shared for nearly six months when i walk out of here it doesnt exist and neither do you i thought you loved me looks like we were both wrong so you walk out she said quietly and i cease to be thats right not the first time she thought no not the first the only other man shed loved had done the same slowly she drew the diamond from her finger youd better have this back i dont want it i dont want anything thats touched you he strode to the door glanced back once how do you live with yourself im all ive got she said to the empty room then she set the ring on the dresser lowered to the floor and wept men are vile creatures really using women up casting them aside leaving them alone and broken better to leave them first isnt it better yet to pay them back and leave them bleeding sick and tired of being the one left behind arent you and all the fighting all the death i can help you with that id so like to help you why dont we talk about it you and me just us girls lets have a few drinks and trash men why dont we arent you going to ask me in blair stood at the window and the face behind the dark glass smiled at her her hands went to the window started to lift it hurry now open up ask me in blair thats all you have to do she opened her mouth the words already in her mind then something flew at her from behind sent her sprawling across the room chapter t here was a scream of rage from what floated outside the window the glass seemed to vibrate from it almost to bow in from the pressure then it was gone a blur of motion blair felt the room spin oh no you dont therell be none of that larkin took a firm grip on blairs shoulders pulled her up to her knees what the bloody hell were you doing his face shimmied in and out of focus im going out sorry the next thing she knew she was coming to on her own bed with larkin tapping her cheeks ah there you are stay with us this time will you muirnin im going to fetch glenna no wait give me a minute i just feel a little sick she swallowed hard pressed a hand to her shaky stomach like ive had entirely too many margaritas i mustve been dreaming i thought iwas i dreaming you were standing at the window about to open it she was outside somehow standing out there the french one lora i was going to ask her in she turned horrified eyes to larkin oh my god i was going to ask her in how can that be you lookedwrong id have said you were asleep but your eyes were open sleepwalking a trance they got into my head and they did something the others he pressed her back down when she started to jump off the bed downstairs the lot of them in the kitchen where glennas put a meal together god bless her she asked if id fetch you i knocked but you didnt answer he looked toward the window now and his face went grim i nearly went away again thinking you were sleeping and could probably use that as much as food but i thought i heardi heard her talking to you if id let her inive never heard of them being able to do mind control if you havent been bitten something new wed better get down tell the others he brushed lightly at her hair youre shaky yet i could carry you bet you could it made her smile maybe next time she sat up leaned toward him touched her lips to his thanks for the save youre very welcome he took her hand to help her off the bed then wrapped his arms around her when she swayed whoa head rush they worked something on me larkin they used memories and emotions private stuff that seriously pisses me off youd be more so if shed managed the invitation good point okay lets go down and she wobbled again cursed my way then after all he scooped her off her feet just need another minute need to find my balance you feel balanced enough to me he looked down smiled slowly youve a lovely shape to you i like that the clothes you wear dont hide it away and just now youve got a pretty scent to go with it a bit like green apples are you distracting me from the fact i nearly invited a vampire in for dinner is it working for you a little lets try for a little more then he stopped lowered his head and covered her mouth with his a quick jolt not so playful as it had been before and she realized there was a great deal of anger and fear in him for her she didnt know the last time anyone had been afraid for her she responded to it before she could stop herself turning into him tangling her fingers in his hair filling up with him that aching loneliness that had followed her out of the dream fairly effective she murmured when he lifted his head again well sure it put some of the color back in your cheeks so thats fine for now youd better put me down if you carry me in there itll scare them theyll be scared enough when we tell them what happened he shifted her so her feet touched the ground but kept his arms around her steady enough yeah better really still he kept a hand on her arm as they walked the rest of the way to the kitchen i f this can be done why is it they havent done it before hoyt sat at the head of the table in the dining room the fire crackling at his back he looked down the length of it to cian ive never heard of it being done before with a shrug cian sampled the fish glenna had prepared with a personal connection between the vampire and the human yes an invitation can be seduced or cajoled but thats most often due to the humans instinctive denial of what it sees this is a different matter and from what both you and larkin said you were sleeping first time for everything with no appetite blair ate because she needed fuel weve got magical types on our team so obviously does she some sort of spell i fell asleep in the library and moira sipped water to wet her throat there was something not what happened to you blair not exactly but it was as if she was there with me lilith more that i was with her and it wasnt in the library at all we werent in the library she was with me in my bedchamber at home in geall what happened blair asked her do you remember i moiras gaze stayed on her plate as her color came up id been asleep you see and it seemed she was just there as real as you are she climbed into the bed with me shetouched me my body i felt her hands on me thats not unusual blair toyed with her fish the dream the clarity of it maybe but the content vampires are sexual creatures and very often bisexual it sounds like she was testing things out with you playing at it i had an experience right after we came here glenna said afterwards i took precautions protected myself in sleep it was stupid stupid of me not to think to protect everyone else well thats going on your permanent record blair wagged her fork in glennas direction glenna doesnt think of everything i appreciate the save by levity but i should have thought of this well figure it out now because theres no way theyre going to put the whammy on one of us and waltz in this house they have someone of power not a vampire moira glanced toward cian for confirmation and got a slight nod ive read that there are some vampires who can cause a trance but they must be there physically there with their victim or have bitten them before this bite causes a connection a bond between them so that person the human may be put under the vampires control clear of bites here blair pointed out aye and you were sleeping as i was as glenna was before you couldnt be caught in their eyes while you slept it takes a lot of juice for a vamp to whammy a human a lot of energy blair explained and practice true enough cian confirmed so theyve turned a witch or sorcerer hoyt said no moira bit her lip i think not if what ive read is the truth the vampire can gain power by drinking blood of power but it becomes diluted and if this person of power is turned he would lose most if not all of his magic its the price for the immortality the demon he becomes loses the gift or retains only the dregs of it so its more likely she has witches or whatever on her payroll so to speak blair considered it as she ate someone whod already turned to the dark side well say or someone she has in thrall a halfvamp a potent one i dont know if that has to be unlike the others larkin had already cleared his plate and was going for more ive been listening to all of this how can your ears work when your mouth is so busy blair wondered he only smiled as he scooped up more fish more rice its good food he said to glenna if i dont eat it how would you know i appreciated it id like to know where you put all that appreciation but you were saying blair added gesturing these things happened in sleep so it would seem to me the spell doesnt work on the conscious mind wouldnt it take more power to he fell back on blairs term to whammy someone when they were awake and aware it would hoyt nodded of course it would and not just sleeping not this day moira was all but ill with exhaustion from what she was part of today blair was worn through as well i dont know what it was like when it happened to you glenna but i was beat worn out upset it was one of the reasons i didnt think to take any precautions before i fell into bed there you have it then im thinking not just sleep but sleep when the body is weak and the mind at its most vulnerable so it seems to me that whatever whoever she might be using isnt as strong as what we have right here at this table you have been listening blair considered him dragonboy here makes a good point she hit us when our defenses were down and she came damn close to getting lucky what do we do about it hoyt and i will work on protection ive been using the most basic shield to this point glenna looked at hoyt well pump it up be good if we could do something for the house too blair pointed out some sort of general woowoo so they cant get inside even with an invite you cant block an invitation cian sat back with his wine you can withdraw it with the right spell but it cant be blocked okay maybe not maybe something that extends the perimeters creates a safe area around the house itself weve tried hoyt laid his hand over glennas we havent been able to find the way something to work on it would be another layer the more layers they have to get through the better think vampfree zone perhaps i should move into a nice b and b cian suggested and had blair frowning at him until she understood oh oh right sorry forgot cant have a vampfree zone with a vamp in residence we havent been able to find a way to exclude him from it glenna explained we have a few ideas more like concepts than actual ideas she admitted and hoyts been working for some time on conjuring a kind of shield for you cian so that you could go outside during the day in the sun others have tried and failed on that it cant be done people used to believe the world was flat blair pointed out true enough cian shrugged but id think if it could be done it would have been in the thousands of years since our existence and experimenting with it at this point isnt the best use of time its my time hoyt said quietly we could have used you today glenna spoke after a long beat of silence in kerry at the cliffs its worth the time we think wed have more success if we had some of your blood oh cian said dryly is that all think about it still our first priority will be protection hoyt and i will put that together she gave his hand a squeeze why dont we get started meanwhile nobody sleeps until we have protection ive got some extra crosses some holy water in my gear blair got to her feet cian unless youre planning to go out id like to set up basic precautions at doors and windows have at it but those kind of trinkets wont supercede an invitation layers blair said again ill help you larkin pushed his plate aside theres a lot of doors and windows all right so it looks like we split into teams hoyt and glenna magic time larkin and i will do what we can to block entrances that leaves cian and moira on kp i t wasnt that she didnt trust hoyt and glenna she did as much as shed ever trusted anyone it wasnt that she wasnt open to magic she had to be but even with the charm under her pillow the candle lit and the second charm hanging with the cross at her window blair slept fitfully that night and the night after the training helped the sheer physical exertion of it and the purpose she pushed and pushed hard no one including herself ended any day without bruises and sore muscles but no one including herself ended any day without being just a little stronger just a little faster she watched moira blossom or thought of it that way what moira didnt have in strength she made up for in speed and flexibility and sheer determination there was no one who could compete with her when she had a bow in her hands glenna polished the skills she already had the canniness the solid instincts and she was coming along with a blade and an ax hoyt brought an intensity to everything whether he fought with a blade with a bow or with his own hands he had an almost unwavering focus she thought of him as the most reliable of soldiers and cian as the most elegant and vicious he had the superior strength of his kind and the animals cunning but he added style to it all he would kill blair thought with violent grace she thought of larkin as the utility player in handtohand he was a scrapper and simply didnt give up he lacked hoyts intensity and cians elegance with a sword but he fought tirelessly until he downed his opponents or they simply dropped from exhaustion he had a good eye with the bow not moiras but who did and you never knew when hed pull out one of his little tricks so youd end up battling with a man who had the head of a wolf or the claws of a bear the tail of dragon it was handy and effective and damn sexy there were times he made her impatient he was a bit too impulsive and often showy errol flynning it she thought and showoffs often ended up in the ground but when it came down to it if she had to pick the people shed want fighting beside her in the battle to save the world she wouldnt have chosen differently but even soldiers in the war to end wars needed to eat to do laundry and take out the trash blair took the supply run because she wanted desperately to get out of the house two days of rain had limited outdoor activities and made her edgy if one person just one said that the rain is what made ireland green shed split their head open with an ax added to it since the night of her close encounter with lora thered been no sign of the enemy the lull ruffled that edge and added twitchy something was brewing bound to be brewing she had preferred to go alone to have a couple of hours to herself with her own thoughts her own company but she hadnt been able to argue it was an unnecessary risk but shed drawn the line at giving larkin a driving lesson on their way into ennis i dont know why i couldnt do it he complained ive watched glenna drive the thing and shes taught hoyt hoyt drives like an old blind man from florida i dont know what that means except its an insult of some kind i could do better than he does with this or the beauty cian keeps in the stable garage you keep cars in a garage and cians made it clear hell bite and drain anyone who touches his jag you could teach me on this one he reached over to trail his finger down the side of her neck id be a fine student charm wont work she flipped on the radio there listen to the music and enjoy the ride he cocked his head that sounds a bit like home irish station traditional music its wonderful isnt it that you can have music at the snap of a finger or move so fast from one place to another in a machine not in chicago traffic you do a lot of sitting and cursing instead of moving tell me about your chicago its not my chicago just where ive been based the last couple of years it was the boston before that yeah but boston was jeremy and shed had to get away from it chicago its ah its a city major city in the midwest of the us on a lake bigass lake do you fish in it this lake fish me no i guess people maybe do ahthey sail on it water sports and stuff its wicked cold in the winter wind like you wouldnt believe lake effect a lot of snow bonechilling cold but i dont know its got a lot happening restaurants great shopping museums clubs vampires a big city bigger than ennis a lot bigger she tried to think what hed make of the el and just couldnt how is it that if its such a large city with so many people they havent banded together to fight against the vampires they dont believe in them or if some do they pretend they dont if somebody gets attacked or gets dead they put it down to gangs or sick bastards mostly the vamps keep a low profile or they did until recently prey on the homeless or runaways transients people other people dont miss there were legends in geall of creatures that haunted the night preyed on humans long ago i never believed them until the queen my aunt was killed by them and even then its hard to believe what youve been taught is fantasy or the impossible so you put up the shield its natural but not you he studied her profile it was strong yes but with such a pretty curve of cheek and that dark dark hair such a lovely contrast to the white of her skin youve always known do you ever wish it otherwise that you were one of the people with the shields who never knew no point in wishing for what you cant have whats the point of wishing for what you can and do he countered he had a point blair decided he usually did if you listened long enough she found a spot in a car park dug out the money for the ticket larkin just stood hands in the pockets of the jeans glenna had bought him on some earlier trip looking at everything it was a relief not to be asked a dozen questions she knew hed been to town before but imagined every visit was a little like a walk through disney world for him just stick close okay i dont want to have to go hunting for you i wouldnt leave you he took her hand tightening his grip a little when she started to shake him off you should hold on to me he said with absolute innocence in his eyes i could get lost thats bullshit not in the least he linked fingers with hers and set out at a stroll why with all these people and the street and the sounds and sights i could lose my way any moment at home the village isnt nearly as big as this and there arent so many in it on market day now it can be crowded and colorful but i know what im about there you know what youre about everywhere she said under her breath he had good ears and his lips twitched at the comment on market day people come into the village from all over the land theres wonderful food which would be your first priority a man has to eat but theres cloths and crafts and music lovely stones from the mountains and shells from the sea and you bargain you see thats the fun of it when were at home again ill buy you a gift on market day he stopped to study the souvenirs and jewelry in a shop window i have nothing here to trade and hoyt tells me we cant use the coin i brought with me you like baubles he flicked a finger at one of the drops in her ears so ill buy you a bauble on market day i think we might be too busy to shop for baubles come on she gave his hand a tug were here for supplies not shiny things theres no need to hurry we can have a bit of fun while were about it from what i see you dont have enough fun if were still alive in november ill do cartwheels in the street ill do naked cartwheels he shot her that quick grin thats a new and important reason for me to fight i havent thought of the cartwheels but i have thought about you naked a time or two oh look there cakes sex and food she thought if hed tossed in a beer and a sporting event hed be the ultimate guy no she rolled her eyes halfheartedly dug in her heels as he pulled her across the street were not here for cakes either ive got a list a really long list we can see to it soon enough ah would you look at that one see the long one with the chocolate eclair eclair he repeated making the word sound like a particularly pleasurable sex act you should have one of those and so should i he turned those long tawny eyes on her be a darling wont you blair ill pay you back you ought to be fat as a pig she muttered but she went inside the bakery to buy two eclairs and came out with a dozen cupcakes as well she had no idea how hed talked her into them or the detour into half a dozen shops to browse she was usually hell she was always stronger than that then she noticed the way the female clerks other browsers women on the street looked at him tough to be stronger than that she decided he managed to nudge her into whittling away more than an hour doing nothing before she dragged him with her to finish the supply list okay thats it foot firmly down we haul this stuff straight back to the car and head for home no more window shopping no more flirting with shop girls sure it was shameful the way you poured your charm over that dear woman blair gave him a bland look youre a real card she gestured with her chin that way no detours you know the way this village is built im meaning the way the roads are its very like my own and how the shops are huddled up together and here this is very like home too before she could stop him hed opened the door of a pub ah theres a familiar smell and theres music so well stop for a moment larkin we need to get back so we will but we should have a beer first i like beer since her arms were loaded she didnt put up much resistance when he nudged her inside its nice he said after all the walking to sit and have a tankard its not a tankard he remembered a pint they usually say a pint here it was the walking she decided that made her give in the man was exhausting and exhilarating she dumped purchases on and around one of the chairs at a low table sat one beer she held up a finger and thats it i dont want any more trouble from you have i been trouble to you he took her hand lifted it to kiss her fingers sure i dont mean to be her eyes narrowed wait a minute wait a minute have you been playing me is this whole thing been your idea of a date his brows drew together i dont know the date i cant keep track of the days no i meantnever mind pint of guinness she told the waitress who came over glass of harp and hows it all going then he asked the waitress and had her beaming him a smile very fine and thank you and for you a lovely day its been do you live in the village in ennis i do yes are you visiting we are my lady is from chicago oh i have cousins there well then welcome to ireland i hope youre enjoying your stay ill get your beer right away idly blair tapped a finger on the table as she studied him you dont even have to turn it on do you its just there all the time i dont understand what youre meaning no you probably dont do the girls back home lap up your cream that way blush and flutter he put his hand over hers no need at all to be jealous darling ive no thought for any woman but you save it she had to laugh i wouldnt fall for that one even if it wasnt possibly the end of the world theres no one here or back home whos caught my eye as youve caught it i wonder if any will now that ive seen you youre not like the women i know im not like women anyone knows the easy smile faded you think thats a flaw in you a fault ora barrier he decided something that makes you less appealing than other women thats false when i say youre not like other women i mean youre more interesting more exciting more alluring stop the sudden and unexpected irritation in his voice put her back up stop what you put that face on the one that says bullshit i like charming the ladies for it doesnt do a bit of harm he waited and this time blair could see he had to put some effort into smiling at the waitress when she served them thanks for that then he lifted the pint glass took a long slow sip youre pissed she murmured recognizing the glint in his eye what have you got to be pissed about i dont like the way you demean yourself demean my are you whacked just be quiet i said i like charming the ladies and i do i enjoy a flirt here and there and a tumble when i can get one but i dont hurt women not with my hands not with my words i dont lie so when i tell you how i see you its the simple truth of it i think youre magnificent he drank again nodding when she only stared at him well that put the cork back in you right enough magnificent he repeated in face and form in your heart and your mind magnificent because of what you do every day and have done for years since you were all but a babe ive never known another like you and never will im telling you that if a man looks at you and doesnt see what a wonder you are its his vision thats at fault and not a bit of you chapter t hey fell back into routine training strategizing from the rumbles and flashes coming from the tower blair knew there was magic in the work as well but what they were doing under it all she thought was waiting we have to make a move she plowed rapid punches into the heavy bag theyd hung at one end of the oncegrand ballroom were caught in a loop and its time to do something shake things up im for that larkin watched her wondering how many levels of frustration she worked through by beating up a big hanging sack a daylight attack on the caves is what i was thinking been there she pummelled left left right done that no we went there but we didnt do the attacking now did we annoyed because he was right worse because he wasnt mentioning the fact shed been the one to be so nearly used after the mission to kerry she shot him a glance we go in were dead or most of us that may be but were likely to die in any case before the end of this thing hard truth she thought she had to respect it yeah odds are so there could be a way to give them something to think about without actually going inside and hastening that eventuality though id like a chance at that deviling them on their own ground for a change he picked up a stake hurled it at the practice dummy she understood the sentiment and felt the same but knew better whenever possible you dont fight on their terms or their turf the caves are suicide could be for them if we lit them up she pulled the next punch turned to him lit them up fire but it would have to be the two of us the others moira in particular would never agree to it intrigued she began to unwrap her hands i meant to ask you before the dragon suit you breathe fire he goggled at her breathe fire yeah dragons breathe fire right no why would they want to do that how could they that begs the question how can a man turn into one but okay another fantasy crushed so how do you intend to fire up the caves he lifted a sword it would only take one of us to get close enough a few feet in id enjoy that but he set the sword down again a more practical manner would be flaming arrows shooting flaming arrows into caves in broad daylight well that shouldnt draw too much attention im not shutting you down she added before he could speak an earthquake and a dragon flight barely made anyone blink people have blinders but theres another factor there are still people in there i know it can we save them highly unlikely if i were locked in a cage waiting to be a meal for one of those things or changed into one id rather burn you said the same before i dont think youre wrong but wed need a fullon attack to make a dent and youre not wrong either when you say wed never talk the others into it she walked over to study his face and youre saying it but you couldnt do it not when it came down to it he strode over to yank the stake from the dummy he wanted to be able to do it in his head but in his heartthat was another thing altogether could you yeah i could then id have to live with it and i would ive been fighting this war all my life larkin you dont get through it without casualties innocent casualties collateral damage if i thought we could end it this way or put a serious hurt on lilith id have already done it and you think i cant i know you cant because im weak no because youre not hard he pivoted hurled the stake hit the heart of the practice dummy and you are i have to be you havent seen what ive seen and for all you know you still dont know what i know i have to be hard what i am makes me hard what you are a warrior a hunter is a gift and a duty to harden around it thats a choice i can do what needs to be done and if this was the way this sacrifice of men i would live with it it would hurt me and it would weigh on me but i would do what needed to be done enough weight she thought as he left her you get hard or you break under it and this is why she worked alone she reminded herself why she was alone so she didnt have to explain herself or justify herself why shed accepted after jeremy that the only way to do what shed been born to do was to stay alone she heard a muffled boom from overhead in the tower glanced up sure some people found it that intimacy that unity and made it work but they had to understand each other first and accept all the dark places to not just tolerate them but embrace them and that when it came to her and her life just wasnt in the cards she rewrapped her hands and went back to pummelling the heavy bag someone you know cian asked from the doorway she barely spared him a glance she was using her feet now as well as her hands side kicks back kicks double jumps shed worked up enough of a sweat that her breath was short and choppy tenthgrade algebra teacher im sure she deserves a good hiding ever found a use for that the algebra business not a one he watched her get a running start and hit the bag with a flying kick that nearly snapped it off its chain nice form oddly i see larkins face on that bag he smiled a little when she stopped to catch her breath and gulp down water i just passed him going down he looked annoyed a rarity for him as hes an affable sort isnt he i bring annoyance out in people true enough hes a likable boy i like him okay hmm cian crossed over to pick up several knives then began to throw them at the target across the room when youve been around humans as long as i have you recognize traits and signals and if youre me you have a curiosity about their choices so i wonder why the two of you dont just have at each other dangerous times possible end of days and so on her back went up she could literally feel the shift in her spine i dont just roll with any guy whos handy if its any of your business your choice of course he walked over tugged out the knives when he came back he handed them to her in an easy almost companionable gesture but i think its a bit more than him being in the vicinity and available she gave the knife a testing toss in the air then hurled it at the target hit dead center why this sudden interest in my sex life just a study of human reactions my brother walked out of his world and into this one the goddess pointed the direction and he followed he didnt just follow the goddess no cian said after a moment he came to find me were twins after all and the attachment runs deep added to it hes by nature dutiful and loyal this time she walked over to retrieve the knives hes also powerful and courageous he is yes cian took them threw them the odds are ill watch him die thats not something id choose even if he survives this hell grow old his body will shut down and hell die cheery arent you it could be peacefully in his sleep after a long full life maybe after a last bout of really great sex cian smiled a little but it didnt reach those cool blue eyes whether its by violence or nature the result is the same ive seen more death than you more than you ever will but still youve seen more than most humans have or will and that separates us you and me from the rest we dont have any choice about that of course we do i know a bit about loneliness and what can chase it back even for the short run so i should jump larkin because im lonely that would be one answer cian retrieved the knives again and this time replaced them the other might be to take a closer look at him and at what he sees when he looks at you meanwhile the tension and repression gives you a nice edge want to go a round or two wouldnt say no s he felt better bruised but better nothing like a good grapple with a vampire even one who didnt want to kill you to clear the head shed just go down and grab something to eat before the evening training session but first she was going to stop by her room and rub some of glennas magic cream into the bruises she walked into her room and onto the rise above the valley of silence oh crap crap crap i dont need to see this again you do morrigan stood beside her pale blue robes fluttering in the wind you need to know it every rock every drop every blade of grass this is your battleground this will be the stand of humankind not the caves in kerry so we just wait there will be more than waiting you are hunter and hunted now what you do what you choose to do brings you closer to this one battle suddenly weary blair raked a hand through her hair everything else is just another skirmish leading here its all about this will it end it morrigan turned those emerald eyes to blairs it never ends you know this in every part of you you know this single truth but if she defeats you on this ground worlds will be tossed into chaos there will be suffering death and torment for a time beyond imagining got that whats the good news everything you need to take this ground is within you your circle has the power to win this war but not end it blair looked over the ground again the misery of it its never going to end for me the choice is yours child has always been yours i wish i could walk away some days i wish that and othersothers i think wow look what im doing what i can do and it makes me feel well righteous i guess right anyway but some days when i go home after a hunt and theres no one there it all seems too hard and too empty you should have been cared for and were not morrigan said gently now and still all that came before all that comes now has made you you have more than one battle to win more than one quest and always child more than one choice turning away isnt a choice for me so well come here and well win because thats what we have to do im not afraid to die cant say i look forward to it but im not afraid she looked back at the ground the way the mists filled the pockets in the earth the way the rocks speared up through it now as always the look of it shuddered through her now as always she saw herself lying bloody there ended she nearly asked if what she saw was truth or imagination but knew the god wouldnt answer so if i go blair decided im taking a hell of a lot of them with me in one week you the circle of six will go to the dance of the gods and from there to geall blair turned away from the drop now to look into morrigans face one week one week from this day youve done what needed to be done here youve gathered together and now together youll make this journey to geall how youll know in one week you must trust those with you and what you hold inside you if the circle doesnt reach geall and come to this place at the appointed time this world yours and all the others are plunged into the dark the sun went out in the black blair heard the screams the howls the weeping the air suddenly stank with blood youre not alone morrigan told her not even here she snapped back and stared into larkins eyes she felt his fingers digging into her shoulders there you are there you are now she was too stunned to evade when he pulled her into his arms wrapped them around her like bands as he pressed his lips to her hair there you are he repeated was it the vampire no wow you need to turn me loose in a minute or two youre shaking i dont think so i think thats you it may be i know you scared six lives out of me he drew her back barely an inch you were just standing there just standing staring you didnt hear me when i spoke to you didnt see me when i was right in front of you and your eyes he pressed his lips to her forehead now firmly the way she imagined parents checked a child for fever so dark so deep it was morrigan she took me on a little excursion im okay do you want to lie down to rest steady yourself a bit ill stay with you no i said im fine i thought you were mad at me i was am a bit youre a frustrating creature blair and ive never had to put so much work into wooing a woman woo something snapped shut in her throat i dont like the whole woo thing thats clear enough but i do and a man has to please himself as well as the woman whos caught his eye doesnt he but in any case whether or not im annoyed and frustrated i wouldnt leave you alone they always do a little voice whispered in her head sooner or later im okay just a little wigged out at getting a message from the land of the gods what is the message better get everyone together and deliver it all at once in the library she decided its the best setup s he paced waiting for hoyt and glenna apparently magic couldnt be interrupted even by messages from gods struggling against impatience she toyed with the two crosses around her neck one shed worn nearly all her life it had come down through her family through nola and all the way back to hoyt morrigans cross one of those given to him at the onset of this battle while he was still in his own time the second he and glenna had forged with silver and fire and magic a team emblem she supposed as much as a shield which each of them but cian wore at all times the first had saved her life once she remembered so magic she supposed had priority over impatience still when moira offered her tea she shook her head already she was going over in her mind what had to be done and she didnt like most of it still it was movement and thats what they wanted what they needed there are two outside moira said quietly we havent seen any for days but there are two out there now just at the edge of the trees blair moved to the window beside her scanned yeah i see them just barely should i get my bow thats a long shot in the dark then blair shrugged sure why not even if you dont hit one itll show them were not sleeping blair glanced around as moira went out cian was sprawled in a chair with a glass of wine and a book larkin sat on the couch sipping at a beer and watching her she didnt want the tea moira had brought in didnt want to be soothed by it nor did she want alcohol to dull the edge so she paced a little more stood at the window again she saw the vampire on the left poof she hadnt even seen the arrow but she saw the second vamp fade back into the trees no were not sleeping she thought sorry that took so long but we couldnt leave that in the middle tea perfect glenna went directly to the table when they came in poured a cup for herself and for hoyt is something up yeah moira will be right back she just went up to take out one of the vamps outside oh glenna let out a little gush of breath as she sat so theyre back well it was nice while it lasted i could only get one moira came in with her bow it was too dark to see the second and id have likely wasted an arrow but she propped the bow and her quiver by the window in case she had another chance okay were all here morrigan paid me a visit or had me pay her one however it works you had a vision hoyt demanded i had whatever it is at the battleground it was empty just wind and fog her a lot of cryptic god stuff the bottom line being she said were to leave for geall a week from today we go back moira stepped to larkin squeezed a hand on his shoulder we go back to geall thats what the lady said blair confirmed weve got a week to get ready for it to figure out what we need pack it up finish up whats going on up in the magic tower we go to the stone circle the way you got here she said nodding at larkin and moira the way hoyt came through i dont know how it works but we have keys moira told her morrigan gave me a key and one to hoyt id say travel arrangements are up to you guys well take all the weapons we can carry potions lotions whatever hoyt and glenna figure we can use best major glitch that i see is that for cian to get there we have to hope for a cloudy day or leave the house after sunset since weve got watchers again theyll know were on the move theyll try to stop us no question and theyll tell lilith weve gone glenna added shell know where when we go to geall we take her there moiras hand tightened on larkins shoulder id bring that plague to my people it cant be helped blair began you say that because youve grown used to living with this i want to go home moira said i want to go home more than i can say but to bring something so evil with me what if the battle didnt take place if we found her portal sealed it off somehow we could change destiny destiny in blairs opinion wasnt something you messed around with then the battle takes place here where its not meant to and id have to say our chances of winning drop moira larkin rose moving around the couch until he faced her i dont love geall less than you but this is the way its what was asked of you and what you asked of me larkin the plague you speak of has already infested geall it took your mother would you ask me to leave my own now to break this trust to risk all no im sorry im not afraid for myself not any more but i see the faces of those people in cages and they take on the faces of those i know from home and im afraid she steadied herself its more than geall i know well go in one week once were there well raise an army hoyt looked at moira youll ask your people to fight to unify under this circle theyll fight its going to involve a lot of training blair pointed out and its going to be more complicated than what weve been doing were just six wed better be able to pull together hundreds and its not just putting a stake in their hands its teaching them how to kill vampires with one exception cian lifted his glass in half salute no one will lay hands on you moira told him and he answered with a lazy smile little queen if i thought otherwise id toss some confetti and wish you all bon voyage okay heres another thing blair passed by the windows again just to see if any vampires had chanced coming toward the house for all we know lilith may be on the move too she may even get there before we do anyway can we rig up the circle some spell so well know if its been used toopen the door there should be glenna looked at hoyt yes i think we can work that you wouldnt have to she cant use the dance of the gods larkin reached for his beer again didnt you say moira when we came through that a demon couldnt enter the circle its pure she agreed what they are cant enter the ring much less use it to go between worlds okay bigger problem cian acknowledged blairs comment with another lift of his glass looks like ill be tossing that confetti after all thats a kick in the arse isnt it id forgotten larkin pursed his lips before drinking again so well find a way around it as i understand it we six must go so there must be a way to do it we just need to find it we go together hoyt said and set his tea aside or we dont go at all aye larkin nodded in agreement we leave no one behind and were taking the horse this time he remembered himself smiled easily at cian if its all the same to you we work the problem any magical solutions spring to mind blair asked hoyt the goddess must intercede she must if we attempt glenna and i to open this ourselves to let cian through we could change it all disrupt the power close it altogether so no one gets through or out again every time you change the nature of something glenna explained you risk repercussions magic has a lot in common with physics really the circle is a holy place sacred ground and we cant mess with that but at the same time cians meant to go and at the goddesss behest so well work on the loophole if theres another way another portal that lilith needs to use maybe cians supposed to use that blair frowned at him itd be my second choice i dont like separating especially on moving day added to the fact he reminded her that i dont know where in the bloody hell that portal or window might be yeah theres that but maybe we can find out another search spell glenna reached for hoyts hand we can try no i wasnt thinking of spells not exactly blair angled her head studied larkin any living thing right he set down his beer smiled slowly thats the way of it what do we have in mind y oure sure you want to do this blair stood in the tower with larkin i know it was my idea but and a fine one it is ah now are you worried for me a stor sending you out into a fortified vamp nest one with magical shields sending you unarmed no whats to worry about i wont need a weapon and it wouldnt be easy to carry one the way im going anything seems off you get out dont be a hero i was born to be a hero im serious larkin no grandstanding her stomach was already jittering this is just for information any signs shes getting ready to move numbers if you can get a clear idea a look at their arsenal sure youve been over this with me already a time or two do i strike you as being addlebrained we should wait for the morning then we could drive you as far as the cliffs wed be there if you ran into trouble and its more likely than not theyve got the caves blocked off again during the daylight hours as you said yourself theyd be less likely to expect anything like this at night as i said so myself if im to be a soldier in this war blair i have to do what i can do just dont do anything stupid giving in to the need to the worry she grabbed his hair with both hands yanked his face to hers she kept her fear out of the kiss it wasnt fear she wanted to send with him instead she poured out hope and heat and held on to him as the punch of the kiss vibrated down to her toes not so fast he said when she started to back away and spun her around so her back was pressed to the tower wall not all of us are done as yet this was what hed looked for this fire like liquid flames that sparked from her to run into his blood he let it scorch him as he gripped her hips then ran his hands up her body down again so he could take the shape of her with him cian lured them to the front of the moira stopped short eyes going wide at the sight of her cousin and blair locked in each others arms im sorry its not a problem just getting myself a fine kiss goodbye he cupped blairs face in his hands ill be back by morning then he turned opened his arms to moira she rushed into them be careful i couldnt lose you i couldnt bear it larkin remember that remember were all waiting for you and come back safe by first light he kissed each one of her cheeks keep a candle burning for me well be watching blair made herself turn and open the window in glennas crystal for as long as we can i wouldnt mind having that french toast when i return he looked straight into her eyes they changed first she hadnt noticed that before blair realized his eyes changed first pupil and iris then came the shimmer of light the hawk looked at her as the man had then it flew into the night silent as the air hell be fine blair said under her breath hell be fine moira reached for her hand and together they watched until the hawk flew out of sight chapter h e soared with his height and the hawks vision he could see the things that slunk around the house he counted eight a small party then and likely just watchers as blair had said regardless he took another circle to be sure it was a scouting expedition and not an attack force widening the circle he spotted the van at the end of the lane just beyond the turnoff of course he thought they would need a way to get back and forth from the caves wouldnt they but it was nervy and a bit insulting come to that for them to leave their machine so close to the house he circled again considering the situation then dived for the ground he remembered what glenna had said about how the van worked how a key was needed to spark the what was it ignition wasnt it a shame they hadnt left it hanging in there in the lock of the thing but he remembered too that shed explained that the wheels it rolled on were filled with air if the wheel was punctured and the air got out and then the wheel was called a flat it was a pain in the ass shed said he thought it would be fruitful and fun as well to give the vampires a pain in the ass he changed to a unicorn with a pale gold wash over its white hide and lowering his head plunged his keentipped horn into the tire there was a satisfying little pop then the hiss of escaping air wanting to be thorough he pierced it a second time pleased larkin trotted around the van puncturing each tire until he saw the van sat on four flat wheels lets see you try to get this machine to roll now you bastards he thought then he rose up again on wings and flew south there was enough moonlight to guide him and a cool wind to aid his speed he could see the land below the spread and roll of it the rise of hills the patchwork of fields lights glimmered from the villages and the larger towns he thought of the lively pubs with the music playing with the scents of beer and pretty women the voices in conversation and the rise of laughter one evening when all this was done he wanted to sit in a pub with his friends those five who were so vital to him and lift a pint with all those voices all that music around them it was a good image to hold on to during a long flight to a nest of monsters below he saw the long lovely sweep of river they called shannon it was beautiful land he thought as green as home and with the sea close he could hear the rumble of it as he angled southwest the dragon would be faster he knew but it was the hawk hed agreed to he wished he could fly here again in the dragon with blair on his back she could tell him the names of what he saw below the towns and the ruins the rivers and lakes would she know the name of that waterfall he soared over the one as high and powerful as his own faerie falls back home he remembered the feel of her legs locking around him as they rose up into the air the way shed laughed hed never known another like her warrior and woman with such strength and vulnerability a ready fist and a tender heart he liked the way she talked quick and confident and the way her lips quirked up on one side then the other when she smiled there was a longing in him for her which he thought as natural as breath but there was something tangled with it something sharp that he didnt recognize it would be interesting to find out what it all meant he winged over the waterfall and a dense forest that framed it he skimmed over the quiet glimmer of lakes with starshine glinting on the water and he aimed for the slicing beam of the lighthouse on the cliffs he flew down silent as a shadow on the narrow strip of shale he saw two figures a woman he realized and a young boy alarm tightened his heart inside his chest they would be captured wandering here near the caves in the dark imprisoned then used then killed and he had no weapon to defend them he landed in the shadow of rock and nearly changed into a man to do what he could but the woman turned to laugh at the child and the cold white moonlight struck her face he had seen her only once before standing on the high cliffs but he would never forget her face lilith the selfproclaimed queen of the undead please mama please i want to hunt now davey remember what i told you we dont hunt near our home weve plenty of food inside and since youve been so good she bent down to tap a finger to his nose a gesture of amused affection you can have your pick but its no fun when theyre just there i know she sighed ruffled his glossy gold hair its more like a chore than a thrill but it wont be much longer when we move on to geall you can hunt every night when soon my precious lamb im tired of being here voice petulant he kicked at the shale larkin could see he had the face of a little imp round and sweet i wish i had a kitty please cant i have a kitty cat i wouldnt eat it like last time thats what you said about the puppy she reminded him with a quick gay laugh but well see but how about this ill let one out for you and it can run through the caves you can chase it down hunt it down wont that be fun when he grinned moonlight sent the dusting of freckles on his chubby cheeks into relief and glinted on his fangs can i have two so greedy she kissed him and not larkin saw with a sick revulsion in the way a mother kisses a son thats what i love about you my own true love lets go inside then and you can pick out the ones you want behind the rock larkin changed a sleek dark rat darted inside the caves behind the sweep of liliths long skirts he could smell death and see the things that moved in the dark things that bowed when lilith glided by there was little light only a scatter of torches clamped to the walls here and there but as they moved deeper there was a faint green tinge to the light he felt was unnatural magic he knew just as he knew this magic wasnt clean and white she drifted through the maze of it holding the boys hand as he trotted at her side vampires scuttled up the walls like spiders or hung from the ceiling like bats he could only hope they werent overly interested in snacking on rat blood he followed the swish of liliths robes and kept to the dark corners the sounds of unspeakable human suffering began to echo what sort do you want my darling lilith swung his arm with hers as if they were on an outing to a fair and a promised treat something young and lean or perhaps something with a little more flesh i dont know i want to look in their eyes first then ill know clever boy you make me proud there were more cages than hed imagined and the sheer horror had him struggling to stay in form he wanted to spring into a man grab a sword from one of the guards and start hacking he would take down a few of them and that might be worth dying for but he would never get any of the people out blair had warned him but he hadnt fully believed the boy had dropped his mothers hand and now strolled hands behind his back pacing up and down the length of the cages a child eyeing treats at the bakers larkin thought davey stopped pursing his lips as he studied a young woman huddled in the corner of a cage she seemed to be singing or perhaps she was praying for the words were unintelligible but larkin could see her eyes were already dead this one wouldnt be any fun to hunt even when davey poked at her through the bars she sat passively shes not afraid anymore sometimes they go mad their minds are weak after all like their bodies lilith gestured to another cage what about this one the man in it was rocking a woman who was either asleep or unconscious there was blood on her neck and her face was pale as wax bitch you bitch what have you done to her ill kill you now this ones got some life left in him with a broad grin lilith tossed back her gilded mane of hair what do you think my sweetie davey cocked his head then shook it he wont run he wont want to leave the female why davey youre so perceptive she crouched down kissing his cheeks with obvious pride such a big boy and so wise i want this one he pointed at a woman whod pressed herself to the back of the cage her eyes darted everywhere shes afraid and she thinks that maybe maybe she can still get out so shell run and run and run and him davey gestured up hes mad he wants to fight see the way he shakes the bars i think those are excellent choices she snapped her fingers at one of the guards both of whom wore light armor and skullcaps release those two and pass the word except for preventing them from leaving the caves theyre not to be touched they belong to the prince davey jumped up and down clapped his hands thank you mama do you want to play with me ill share with you thats so sweet but i have some work to see to now and remember to wash up when youre finished eating she turned to one of the guards again tell lady lora i want her to join me in the wizards cave that one first davey pointed to the woman she screamed and struggled as the guard dragged her out of the cage while another guard beat back at the ones with her who tried to pull her back inside everything inside larkin strained to do something anything davey bent down sniffing at the shuddering woman to imprint her scent youre mine now and i get to play with you as long as i want isnt that right mama thats right my darling let her go davey ordered the guard then his eyes flashed red as he looked at the woman run run run hideandseek he shouted when she stumbled out he leaped onto the wall clung there as he shot a grin over his shoulder at lilith and he slithered out into the dark its nice to see him having such a good time turn the other loose in oh fifteen minutes ill be with the wizard for the time being he could come back larkin told himself once hed done what hed come to do he could go back create a diversion unlock the cages at least give the prisoners a fighting chance to escape to survive but now blocking out the moans and screams along with his own needs he followed lilith the prison was separated from what he supposed were living quarters storage and work areas by a long tunnel shed built a kind of mansion under the ground he realized chamber flowed after chamber some of them richly furnished some sealed off with doors and guarded two a man and female both in black jeans and sweaters carried fresh linens down the tunnel obviously servants he decided and thought they were likely human servants both stopped as lilith approached bowed deeply lilith glided on as if they werent there he heard the sounds of combat and paused to looked down a tunnel a training area not that dissimilar from what they used at cians here the creatures male and female practiced with sword or mace dagger or bare hands two prisoners unarmed and shackled were being used much as he and his circle used practice dummies he saw the one called lora clashing steel with a male of superior size they wore no protective gear and the swords he saw were honed to a killing edge lora leaped up and over her sparring partner the movement so fast it was merely a blur even as he pivoted she ran the sword through his chest and as he fell she leaped on him you miss that one every time she leaned down playfully lapped at the blood if you were human mon cher youd be dead no one can best you with a sword his breathing was ragged but he reached up to stroke a hand down her cheek i dont know why i try if lilith didnt need me wed go another round she trailed a finger down his check licked the blood from it perhaps latertoward dawn if the queen doesnt want me ill come to you she leaned down again and the kiss was long ferocious she sheathed the bloody sword and strode out with larkin behind her she barely paused as the woman whod been freed to run fell in front of her weeping lora merely stepped over her glanced up to the pair of red eyes glowing in the dark playing tag davey i wanted to play hideandseek but she keeps falling down make her get up lora make her run some more i havent finished the game yet lora let out a longsuffering sigh ca va she crouched down lifted the womans head by the hair if you dont run and keep our darling davey amused ill cut off your fingers one at a time then your toes she got up dragging the woman with her now allez scamper when the woman ran off weeping lora looked back up at davey why dont you give her more of a head start its more sporting and the game will last longer itd be more fun if you played its always more fun with you and theres nothing id like better but your mother wants me now perhaps later we can have another game she blew him a kiss and continued on sick to the depths larkin followed her she entered a chamber larkin felt the ripple of magic even as he darted in after her the door shut with a hollow thud ah lora weve been waiting for you i was finishing up a bout with lucius then i ran into davey hes having such a good time hes been pining for a game lilith held out a hand lora walked over slipped hers into it together nearly cheektocheek they looked at the man who stood in the center of the room he wore black robes edged in red his hair was a thick mane of silver around a face that boasted eyes dark as onyx a long hooked nose a thin unsmiling mouth there was a fire behind him that burned without hearth or log or turf suspended above it was a cauldron that spilled out pale green smoke the same color as the light that glowed sickly through the caves two long tables held vials and jars whatever swam in them looked viscous and alive midir lilith gestured toward the man with a wide sweep of her arm i wanted lora with us when we had this discussion she keeps me calm as you know ive needed time to compose myself after that disaster a few days ago she wandered over picked up a carafe poured the red liquid from it into a glass sniffed fresh she asked him yes my lady tapped and prepared for you she sipped offered the glass to lora i should ask if youre fully recovered from your injuries i am well my lady id apologize for losing my temper but you disappointed me midir extremely your punishment would have been more severe if lora hadnt cooled that temper they snatched those cows out from under my nose they left an insulting message on my very doorstep it was for you to protect my home from such matters and you failed miserably i am prostrate my lady he knelt bowed his head i was not prepared for the attempt nor for the force of the power they held it will never happen again it certainly wont if i give you to lora do you know how long she can keep a man alive she glanced over at her companion with a soft and knowing smile there was the one in budapest lora recalled i kept him six months i could have gone longer but i got bored with him i dont think midir would bore me for years but lora ran her hand up and down liliths back hes of use chérie he has great power and hes bound to you nestce pas he made me promises a great many promises dont speak she snapped when midir lifted his head again because of those promises hes yet to feel my bite but youre my dog midir and never forget it slowly now he raised his head i serve you majesty and only you i sought you out my lady to give you the portal so you may walk between worlds and rule them all and so you can walk between them wizard plucking power like daisies with my army at your back and still this power broke when struck by what the mortals wielded they should never have gotten by him its true again lora soothed he allowed them to humiliate you and that is unforgivable still we are more with him than without him with him well have all by samhain see she keeps me calm lilith took the goblet back from lora as they stood arms circling each others waists youre alive because of what she said as i agree with her and because you at least had the good sense to bring on the dark once we understood we had been breached oh stand up stand up he rose my lady may i speak i left the tongue in your mouth i have pledged my power and my life to you and have dedicated that life and power for more than two hundred years to you i have made this place for you as you commanded under the ground and cloaked it from the human eye it is i who carved the portal so that you and your army may travel between worlds so that you my queen may go to geall and ravage and reign she angled her head and a pretty smile curved her mouth yes but what have you done for me lately even my power has limits my lady and it takes a great deal to hold the cloak the magic these others hold is strong and still in the end i felled them true true but after they picked my pockets they are formidable my lady he folded his hands so they disappeared within the wide sleeves of his robes less would hardly be worthy of you and your triumph will be only greater when you destroy them sweet talker he did nearly get me into the house lora said so close i could almost taste her it was a good spell a strong one to bend the hunters will we could try it again we could midir agreed but it is only two weeks until we reopen the portal i will need my strength for that majesty and another sacrifice another lilith rolled her eyes how tedious and a virgin again i assume if you would my lady in the meanwhile i have a gift which i hope pleases you more diamonds she tapped a hand in front of her mouth in a delicate yawn i grow weary no my lady not diamonds more precious i think he picked a small hand mirror by its bone handle offered it do you toy with me such a trinket only she let out a gasp as she twirled it by the handle is this my face stunned she touched a hand to her own cheek stared into the glass it was as if she looked through a thin mist but she could see the shape of her face her eyes her mouth the joy of it brought tears to her eyes oh oh i can see who i am im beautiful see my eyes are blue such a pretty blue let me lora squeezed close her eyes widening as she saw herself in the little glass with lilith oh cest magnifique je suis belle look at us lora oh oh see how wonderful we are so much better than a photograph or a drawing see we move look how our cheeks press together i am here lilith murmured so long ago before i was given the gift i saw my face in polished glass in the clear water of a lake the shape of it and how my hair tumbled down to frame that shape she touched her hair now watching her fingers move through it the way my lips my cheeks would move with a smile the way my eyebrows will lift and fall and last the last time i saw this face it was in the eyes of the one who sired me two thousand years have passed since ive looked into my own eyes a tear trickled down her cheek and its reflection enchanted her im here she said quietly a voice thick with emotion im here youre pleased your majesty midir lowered his folded hands to his waist i thought it your fondest wish i have never had such a gift look how my mouth moves when i speak i want a great one midir a big one so i can see the whole of me at once i believe it can be done but it would take time and power the portal of course of course lilith angled the mirror from overhead to try to see more of herself im as greedy as davey demanding more even as i hold a treasure in my hands midir youve pleased me beyond measure ill have what you need brought to you when he bowed she walked to him touched his cheek beyond measure she repeated i wont forget that you troubled to touch my heart larkin scurried out after them since they spoke of nothing now but the mirror and their own beauty he veered off to look for their arsenal to get a clearer idea of their numbers he streaked down darkened tunnels squeezed under doors in one chamber he found three vampires feasting on a man when the man moaned larkins shock made him careless one of them spotted him and lifted its bloody face in a smile wouldnt mind a little rat for dessert as he pounced larkin shot under the doorway again and across to the next streaking between the feet of the guard and under into the arsenal weapons for a thousand he realized for a thousand and more sword and lance bow and ax all stored with a military precision that told him this was indeed an army and not just a pack of animals and this they would take to geall to destroy it well hed give them some trouble first turning into a man he took the single torch from the wall to set the tables the chests the cabinets to light distraction and destruction he thought tossing the torch aside before turning back into the rat again as fast as he could he went back to the area where the prisoners were kept he saw the man the boy had chosen was no longer in his cage so he was too late to save him or the woman but there were others more than twenty others and he would give them a chance at least there was only one guard now leaning up against the wall and despite the moans and pleas he seemed to be half dozing it would take speed and it would take luck larkin thought he was counting on having both he changed into a man grabbed the sword at the vampires side swung it hard as the dust exploded the screams from the cages were deafening you have to run he grabbed the keys from the hook on the wall and began to unlock cages he shoved the sword into the hands of a man who looked at it blankly you can hurt them with that larkin said quickly kill them if you cut off the head kill them with fire there are torches in the tunnels use them here he shoved the keys into another pair of hands unlock the rest then run some of you may get out im going to do what i can to keep the way clear though he knew he risked draining his energy he changed once more as the chaos whirled around him into a wolf that sprang out of the doorway he veered left hoping to buy time and charged the first vampire he saw he took it by surprise ripped out its throat muzzle dripping he ran hed hoped the fire hed set in the arsenal would keep many of them busy but he heard no alarm as yet he saw two carrying bodies to a stack of more dead tossed he thought like offal as he ran he changed and as he changed he reached for a sword he took them both with one blow there was shouting now not the human screaming but sounds of alarm and fury once more he changed into the wolf to use its speed he could do no more than he had done he swung down a tunnel and he saw the boy he was crouched on the ground feasting on the man whod been in the cage the childs shiny hair was streaked with blood and it dripped from his fingers from his lips the low growl that rumbled out of larkins throat had the boy looking up doggie davey grinned horribly none for you until im finished im done with that one so you can have it if you want he gestured toward the woman who lay facedown a few feet away she wasnt as much fun as this one so i finished quick beyond rage larkin bunched to spring davey there you are the one whod sparred with lora clipped quickly down the tunnel your mother wants you in your chambers some of the humans are loose and theyve managed to set a fire but i havent finished yet youll have to finish later are these both your kills he crouched down to give davey a congratulatory pat on the back good for you but if you eat any more youll just get sick ill send someone down have these taken to the heap but for now you need to come with me he glanced over as he spoke eyeing larkin one of your mothers wolves i thought shed sent them all larkin saw the change on its face the sudden bracing of its body he leaped but missed the throat as the vampire blocked the charge the force of the blow hurled larkin against the wall but he was up quickly charging again before the thing could clear its sword there was screaming horrible screaming and his own snarls and snaps the part of him that was wolf lusted for blood as much as the man inside it lusted for vengeance he sank his claws into the things shoulder its chest then there was pain unspeakable pain as the child leaped on his back and used his fangs with a howl larkin reared back managed to shake the boy off but he was up quickly and the one on the ground was reaching for its sword the wolf was done and larkin prayed he had enough left in him to get out and away his light sparked shimmered weakly there was more pain and with it now a dragging weakness but he became the mouse small and quick slipping into shadows and hunting the sound of the sea the fire in the back of his neck burned to the bone the caves echoed with screams running feet he was nearly trod on as his strength and his speed wavered but continued to head toward the thin wash of moonlight the roar of the sea there were people running clawing their way up the cliff wall some carried the weak the wounded larkin knew if he attempted a change again hed need to be carried himself he could do nothing more with what he had left he dragged his small body to a rock wedged himself behind it the last thing he saw was the flicker of stars going out as dawn crept closer chapter h e should have been back by now from the window in the parlor blair watched dawn break through the long night on his way back anyway maybe you should start again she turned around to hoyt and glenna just start again blair glenna crossed over ran a hand up and down blairs arm i promise you as soon as he can be seen well see it was a stupid idea reckless and stupid what was i thinking i sent him in there no now glenna gripped both of her arms he went in and we all agreed were all equal in this none of us bears all the burden he went in there without a weapon without a shield she closed her hand over her crosses he could hardly fly or crawl or slither around a nest of vampires with a cross around his neck cian pointed out a beacon like that he wouldnt have lasted five minutes so what he lasts ten going in naked hes not dead moira spoke quietly and continued to sit on the floor staring at the fire id know i think wed all know the circle would be broken she looked over her shoulder at hoyt isnt that so i believe it is yes it may be as simple as he needed to rest maintaining other shapes must take considerable energy and concentration it does thats why he eats like a plow horse scooting to face the room moira managed a weak smile and hes never that i know held a shape above two or three hours another nightmare blair thought to imagine him skulking around the caves as the rat theyd agreed on then whoops hes a human without so much as a popsicle stick to defend himself alive she could hold on to that it made sense that theyd feel it if hed been killed but he could be in a cage hurt being tortured im going to go make some food glenna gave blairs shoulder a comforting pat ill do it i should practice more with the cooking moira said as she got to her feet and i need something to do besides sit and worry ill give you a hand glenna draped an arm over moiras shoulders ill bring out some coffee in a few minutes im going out hoyt pushed himself out of the chair it may be i can draw something sense something outside the confines of the house ill go with you but he shook his head at blair id do better alone what was she supposed to do she wasnt used to standing and waiting she was the one who went out did the job risked her skin she wasnt supposed to stand and wring her hands while someone else was on the line would you mind closing those other drapes lights coming in from that side baffled she looked back cian was sprawled lazily in a chair and the slant of light coming in the east windows was barely a foot from the tips of his boots she imagined most of his kind would have been scampering back in a fast hurry from that spread of light not cian she doubted theyd get a scamper out of him if they gave him a boot in front of a sunny window sure she moved over drew them and plunged the room into gloom she didnt bother with a lamp just then the dark was a comfort what will they do to him dont lie dont soften it if they have him what will they do to him you know cian thought you know already shell have him tortured for the entertainment value and for the practical purpose of getting information he wont tell her of course he will impatience whipped into cians voice it was infuriating that he was attached enough to larkin to worry about the boy she can do things to a man no human being can withstand and keep him just this side of alive while shes at it hell tell her anything so would you so would any of us and does it matter maybe not she came over gave in to her weak legs and sat on the table in front of his chair he was giving her the truth naked and without sentiment it was what she needed shell change him wont she thats the big coup siring one of us that would be two of us right right she dropped her head in her hands because it felt sick as sick as her gut as sick as her belly cian ifwell have to yes we will i dont think i can stand it i dont think i could go on with this if hes just dead i can because otherwise it would be like we wasted his life but if she sends him back here changed and we have to she lifted her head now rubbed her hands over her damp cheeks how did you get through it after king glenna told me you and king were tight and you had to end him how did you get through it i got pissfaced for a couple of days did it help not particularly i grieved and i drank then i let the anger in its because of what was done to king more than any other reason that ill see this through to the end he angled his head studying her youve fallen for him what its not i care about him of course all of us were a unit humans are so strange their reactions to what they feel the expressions of emotions for you it seems to be embarrassment why is that youre both young healthy and caught in a situation filled with passion and jeopardy why shouldnt you form an attachment its not that simple not for you apparently he glanced over as hoyt strode back in and blair sprang to her feet theres a van on the lane there the wheels are all ripped there are some weapons in it blair didnt bother with a jacket but went out jogged down the lane the drivers door was open she noted with the key dangling from the ignition as if someone had tried to start it then abandoned it in a hurry there were a couple of swords and a cooler holding several packets of blood in the cargo area well its theirs she said to hoyt no question of that and the chances of all four tires going flat come in at zero she hunkered down stuck her finger in the wide hole in the rubber larkin did this somehow they must have abandoned it taken to the woods id think to hide from the sun yeah her smile showed grim purpose at last i have something to do ill go get armed ill go with you she went into the forest with crossbow and stake seeking out the shadows moving like one at the fork of a path she and hoyt separated each moving deeper into light that was dappled and dim she found one cowering curled on mossy ground in deep shade a boy she noted no more than eighteen when he died from his clothes holey jeans and a faded sweatshirt she imagined hed probably been a student doing the backpacking thing sorry about this she told him he hissed at her crawled over to hide behind the trunk of a tree oh come on like i cant still see you dont make me come up there she didnt hear the one coming behind her but sensed it blair did a half pivot lowered her right shoulder so when it leaped at her back she flipped it over this one was about the same age a girl and looked a lot more frisky you two a couple thats cute and really bad luck the female charged and blair lowered the crossbow she didnt just want a kill she realized she wanted a fight she dodged the kick taking the brunt of it on the side of the hip and the second in the small of the back there was enough force to pitch her forward she landed on her hands sprang over and planted the heel of her boot in the vampires face kickboxing classes huh she saw something in the eyes when it came back at her when they traded blows it hadnt fed she realized remembering the cooler in the van it was desperate and prolonging the kill was only torturing it this time when it charged blair pulled her stake and put it through the heart bitch stupid bitch the one behind the tree shouted it out and the heavy dose of new jersey in the voice nearly amused her which one of us when he leaped up she rolled to her toes but he began to run away oh for gods sake she snatched up the crossbow and put an arrow in him coward she whirled at the sound behind her then relaxed when she saw hoyt coming along the path only one he told her two here there may be more but theyll have gone deeper we should get back see if theres any word on larkin i couldnt sense anything but neither could i sense his death hes a clever man blair resourceful as you can see by what he did with the wheels on the van yeah hes nobodys jackass even if he can change into one i know what it is to care about someone and to worry for their life as they walked hoyts eyes tracked through the trees alert and watchful we can defend each other in this but we cant protect each other glenna taught me the difference i never had to worry about anyone before i dont think im very good at it i can tell you that the skill of it comes entirely too easily when they stepped out of the woods moira was running out of the house as if it had burst into flame the light of absolute joy on her face had all the fear inside blair dropping away hes coming back she shouted larkin hes coming home there now hoyt put at an arm around blairs shoulders as relief shook them so you neednt use that worry skill any more today i t took everything he had to stay the hawk to stay in the air pain and fatigue warred inside him each threatening to break through and shatter the strength he had left hed lost blood he knew that but how much he couldnt say he only knew the bite at the back of his neck was a constant searing fire there had been no one human or vampire in sight when hed come to after dawn in his own shape thered been blood on the shale not all his own not enough he comforted himself not enough of it to mean all hed freed had been slaughtered surely some had made it even one he felt himself falter felt his wing try to tremble itself into an arm he bore down calling the hawk to hold him there the river he thought there the shannon he was well toward home now he brought blairs face into his mind that twopointed smile the strong blue of her eyes the quick music of her voice he would make it he would make these last miles he could feel his heart the hawks racing too fast even breathing was a vicious strain and his vision was no longer sharp there was something else inside him something the demon in a childs form had put in him inside him pumping into his own blood poisoning it a weakness the dark of it whispered slyly that he should just let go then he heard something else stronger youre almost home birdboy keep going youre almost back were waiting for you going to make you the breakfast of champions allyoucaneat buffet come on larkin come home blair he held on to the sound of her voice and flew there were the woods and the pretty stream and the stone house and stables and beyond them the graveyard where he was damn well determined not to end up now that he was so close there there was blair outside the house with her face tipped up to the sky so he could see it her eyes and there was moira his sweetheart and the others save cian he gave one heartfelt prayer of thanks to all the gods then his strength simply dissolved he fell the last ten feet to the ground as a man oh god oh god blair sprinted to him reaching him a full stride before the others wait be careful we have to see if he broke anything she began to run her hands over him even as glenna did the same then she felt the raw skin at the back of his neck and slowly brushed his hair aside she stared up into moiras brimming eyes hes been bitten oh god sweet god but hes not changed moira lifted one of his limp hands to her lips he couldnt be out in the sun if hed been changed no not changed and not broken banged up pretty good his pulse is really thready glenna lets get him inside he needs food moira hurried ahead as hoyt and blair lifted larkin it would be like one of us going without food for days food and liquids ill get something the sofa in the parlor glenna ordered ill go get what i need once theyd laid him on the sofa blair crouched by his head he was white as death and bruises were already gathering its okay youre home now thats what counts youre home cian cian said to start with this moira rushed in with a large glass of orange juice to get the fluids and the sugar into him yeah good gotta bring him around come on flyboy here let me try this glenna knelt at the side of the sofa she dipped her thumb into a jar of balm smeared it first on the center of his forehead on the chakras she explained as she worked a little chi balancing moira take his other hand push some of your strength out you know how blair talk to him again the way i told you to when he was flying itll reach him hoyt yes hoyt laid his hands on either side of blairs head tell him to come back come on larkin youve got to wake up cant just lie around all day besides breakfast is ready please wake up now ive been waiting for you she pressed his hand to her cheek watching for you his fingers moved all the way out larkin thats enough damn drama for the day his eyelids fluttered why are women always nagging a man guess thats just what it takes she managed here we are now here moira moved around the couch to lift his head to hold the glass to it he drank like a camel then managed to smile at her theres my sweetheart look at this what a picture three beautiful faces id give you all my worldly goods and a lifetime of devotion if youd get me something to eat it was cian who stepped in holding a small plate with two pieces of dry toast youll need to start slow he exchanged a look with blair she met it then squeezed her eyes shut nodded dont bolt it down she warned just bread cant i have meat i swear i could eat a whole side of venison or that lovely dish you make glenna with the balls of meat and the noodles ill make it tonight you need to have just enough to take the edge off blair began to get a little strength back you eat a full meal youll just boot it vomit she explained when were taking care of the bite it was the little one her boy little bastard i was a wolf at the time so it didnt go as deep as it might have glenna has balm she used it on me when i was bitten moira stroked larkins hair its a terrible burn i know but the balm cools it you werent bitten cian said flatly a scrape not a puncture what difference does it make quite a bit blair straightened theres infection and theres also considerable risk of the one who bit you having some control over you aye larkin frowned closed his eyes i felt something working in me but well take care of it it needs to be purified with holy water thats fine then if i could have the lovely balm moira spoke of and a meal id be good as new but for the fact every bone of my body feels as if its been hit with a hammer straight truth blair thought straight hard truth do you know the burn you felt when it sank into you the burn youre feeling now i do this will be a lot worse im sorry she walked out hurried up the steps and moira rushed out behind her there must be another way how can we hurt him again hes still so weak and already in pain i can see the pain in his eyes you think i cant she swung into her room there is no other way i know it says there isnt in the books ive read them but with glenna and hoyt blair pulled a bottle of holy water from her kit and her face was set when she whirled around there is no other way hes infected that puts him and all of us at risk she shot out her arm turned up her wrist to show the scar i know what its like if there was another way dont you think id try it moira shuddered out a breath what can i do you can help hold him down she took down towels bandages she made herself walk to larkin look straight into his eyes this is going to hurt its going to hurt cian added like a motherfucker oh well larkin licked his lips thats heartening i might be able to block some of the pain glenna began i dont think you can or should blair shook her head its part of it its the way its done here we need to get him on the floor facedown get those towels under him cian youd better take his feet wouldnt want any to splash on you larkin winced as they shifted him what would he need to take my feet for were going to hold you down blair told larkin i dont need yes you will he met her eyes again saw what was in them you do it then i trust you to see it through with cian at his feet hoyt on one side and both women on the other blair opened the bottle she brushed his hair clear exposed the raw bite under these circumstances its not considered unmanly to scream brace yourself she warned him and poured the blessed water on the wound he did scream and his body arched up bucked the wound itself seemed to boil and she let the viscous liquid that bubbled out run as she continued ruthlessly to douse it with water she flashed back to the night shed had to go to her aunt less than a week after her father had left her and how her aunts tears had run down her face as she poured the water over the bite on blairs wrist how it had felt as if the flesh the bones were being seared with a burning knife when the wound ran clear and he was gasping for breath she used towels to wipe it clean to dry it the balm would probably help now white as a sheet glenna fumbled for the jar now her tears fell on him im sorry larkin im so sorry can i help him sleep now even for an hour blair swiped the back of her hand over her mouth sure its done he could use a little sleep again she rushed upstairs she dashed into her room slamming the door behind her then she dropped down on the floor at the foot of her bed wrapped her arms around her head and sobbed she cringed away when an arm came around her but it only wrapped tighter you were so brave moira crooned like a mother lulling a child so strong and so brave i try to be and its so very hard i want to believe i could have done what you did for i love him so much im sick i feel sick i know so do i can we hold on to each other for a bit do you think i cant feel like this it doesnt help i think it does to care even to hurt cian fixed him juice and toasted bread i couldnt have imagined it but he cares its impossible not to care for larkin and if you love him blair lifted her head brushed at tears i dont want to go there again well if you were to love him youd have a happy and unusual life would you show me how to make the french toast hed be pleased to have it when he wakes up yeah yeah sure ill just go splash some water on my face and be right down they got up moira i cant be good for him im not good for anyone moira paused at the door that would be up to him wouldnt it as much as you h e was still pale when he woke but his eyes were clear he insisted on eating at the table within easy reach he said of food he plowed through french toast eggs and bacon with a slow and studied pace as he ate he told them what hed done and seen and heard so many changes larkin you know you shouldnt now dont scold me moira its all come out all right hasnt it could i have more of the coke he sent a sweet charming smile with the request it wasnt a rescue mission since she was closer blair yanked open the refrigerator grabbed another bottle of coke we specifically talked about that youd have done the same oh dont shake your head and glower at me he snagged the bottle i had to try and any of us would have done the same you didnt see you didnt hear it couldnt be walked away from not without some attempt to help and the truth of it is ive been wanting to light a blaze in there for some time he looked at cian now since king hed have appreciated the gesture it nearly killed you blair pointed out wars meant to kill isnt it i should have left the boy be what looked like a boy but what it was doingi lost the sense of it then no denying that and only wanted to end him that was useless and stupid he reached around to touch his fingers to the bandage at the back of his neck and i wont forget what it cost me then he shrugged scooped up more eggs soshe wasnt happy with this wizard this midir i know the name hoyt put in he was infamous before my time he added black magicks raising demons to do his bidding larkin guzzled coke from the bottle hes doing her bidding now it was said he was devoured by his own power in a way i suppose he was i think she intended to punish him or to let the other one lora have a go at him but when he gave her the mirror the magic one she went all soft and dazzled she and the other one mesmerized they were by their own faces theres considerable vanity there cian told him it would be a great thrill to see their reflections after so long it wasnt what i was expecting their well human reaction or so it seemed and the ah affection between the women seemed genuine hes being delicate cian said lilith and lora are lovers they both take others of course often at the same time but theyre mates and sincerely devoted to each other the relationship isnt without its dysfunction but has held for four hundred years how do you know blair asked him lora and i had what should we call it a fling this would have been hmm in the early s in prague if memory serves she and lilith were having one of their spats lora and i enjoyed ourselves for a few nights then she tried to kill me and i threw her out the window tough breakup blair murmured ah well shes liliths creature whoever else she might play with from time to time i knew it before she tried to stake me as for the boy i dont know about him a more recent addition to her cadre id say family larkin corrected i know theres something deviant between them but in some way she thinks of him as a son and he of her as his mother that makes them weaknesses hoyt nodded the boy and the french woman davey its what she called him larkin added hoyt nodded a name was always useful if we could capture or destroy either of them it would be a blow to her shes not leaving for geall as soon as we are blair mused maybe we can set up some traps we cant know where theyll come out on the other side not exactly but we may be able to do something anyway weve got a few days to think about it and we will now were all tired we all need some sleep glenna laid her hands on larkins shoulders you need to get your strength back handsome im feeling more myself thank you but its the pure truth i could use a bed he got to his feet there it seems my legs will hold me now would you come up with me blair id like to have a word yeah all right she went up the back way with him she wanted to keep her hands in her pockets but he seemed a little unsteady on the stairs so she took his arm pulled it around her shoulder here lean on me i wouldnt mind i wanted to thank you for taking care of me dont it made her stomach clench dont thank me for that you tended to me and i will thank you i heard your voice when i was flying home and i wasnt sure i could make it i heard your voice and i knew i could i thought she had you i imagined you in a cage and that was worse than thinking you might be dead i dont want to be that scared i dont want to feel that helpless i dont know how to keep that from happening he was out of breath when they reached his room grateful for the help to his bed would you lie with me she managed to get him down then gaped at him what oh not that way with a laugh he took her hand i dont think ive got that in me just yet but its a lovely thought for another time wouldnt you lie here with me a stór sleep with me for a while after the pain shed given him shed assumed shed be the last person hed want to be with but here he was holding out a hand for hers just sleep she laid down beside him turned in so she could see his face no fooling around is having my arm around you fooling around no and one kiss one she touched her lips to his close your eyes he did on a sigh its good to be home again are you in any pain not really a bit sore is all youre lucky he opened his eyes again couldnt you say i was skilled and courageous maybe that too and i can add smart unicorn horn versus goodyear i really like that one she laid her hand on his heart closed her eyes and slept chapter i t was the stiffness in his own bones that woke him larkin lay there a few minutes wondering if this was how hed feel every blessed morning when he was an old man sort of whifty in the head and heavy in the body maybe it was such a gradual thing that the mind adjusted so you forgot what it was to feel young and spry he swore he creaked when he rolled over of course she was gone he probably couldnt have managed to make love with her if shed stayed if hed been able to talk her into it she was a puzzler blair was so strong all but steely and a goddess in battle but there were all these layers inside soft ones bruised ones a man just wanted to peel off that hard edge and get to the heart of the matter and she was so interesting to look at the hair like a soft cap so dark against her white skin those deep eyes of magic blue that looked right at you no coyness at all sometimes he just liked to watch her mouth move whatever words were coming out of it to see all the shapes it could make then there was her form all lean and tight sleek really he couldnt say he minded overmuch her trouncing him in handtohand not when he had that body bumping up against his long legs and arms those strong shoulders that were often bare during training those lovely firm breasts hed thought quite a bit about her breasts and now he was stirring himself up with no place to go with it he got up wincing he supposed all things considered he was lucky to have gotten off just sore and bruised he had glenna to thank for that and maybe hed seek her out see if she could do a bit more now that he was rested he took a shower giving into the luxury of running the water hot as he could stand he would miss this that was the sheer truth he wondered if moira who was clever with figuring how things worked could build one in geall once he was dressed he wandered out the house was quiet enough he wondered if the others were still sleeping and considered going down to the kitchen he was hungry again and no surprise there but he doubted hed find blair in the kitchen he thought he knew well enough where shed be he heard her music before he reached the training room it wasnt the same music as shed been playing in the kitchen the other day there was a woman singing now in a rough fascinating voice about wanting a little respect when she came home well it didnt seem too much to be asking in larkins opinion and there was blair stripped down to the little white shirt and the black pants that sat low on her hips a personal favorite of his truth be known she was tumbling he noted and using most of the big room to do it handsprings kicks and flips at one point she rolled to a sword that lay on the floor and began to fight what must have been a multitude of invisible opponents he waited until she gave a last thrust her body posed in a deep warrior position well you slaughtered the lot of them only her head moved first turning until her eyes met his then she brought her feet together lowered the sword nothing but dust she walked over to set down the sword turned the music down then picked up a bottle of water drinking she took a good long look at him his face was bruised scraped along the temple which for some reason didnt make him less of a looker she decided in any case his color was good howre you doing well enough though idve been better if youd been beside me when i woke didnt know how long youd need to sleep hows the bite barely know its there he moved to her took her hand turned up her wrist well both have our scars now your hairs wet i got in the shower my bones were aching and i think i smelled fairly ripe after my night of it youll have soaked the bandage she frowned as she nudged him around let me have a look itches mostly he said enjoying having her fingers in his hair on his skin its healing fast glennas magic balm boy i wish id had some of that after my round guess youll do will i he turned gripped her waist then boosted her up so she sat on the table careful there bunky youre not off the disabled list i dont know what youre talking about doesnt matter so much i was thinking before how i like watching your mouth move he rubbed his thumb over her bottom lip its got such energy didnt you wake up all frisky i think youd better it was as far as she got before her mouth was very busy he didnt just taste this time but feasted didnt just sample but possessed this was more hunger more demand than shed been prepared for the sort that swamped mind and body and left her floundering with need she hadnt put her defenses up not in time now it was too late to do anything but meet the assault shed yielded just a little just enough then the heat flooded back into her he could feel it pouring out and up and through him a glorious scorching he ran his hands over her touching finally touching up the lean torso over firm breasts along strong shoulders and back again he felt her shudder of response heard the moan of it catch in her throat and knew shed belong to him but she pressed her hands to his chest wait wait lets step back a minute her voice was thick and breathy and made him want to lap her up like cream why i dont know but ill think of a reason in a minute as soon as my iq goes back up above the level of a turnip i dont know what your eye queue might be but the rest of you is perfect she managed a laugh but kept her hands firm so his mouth wouldnt take hers again and fry her brain a second time im not not nearly perfect and its not that i dont think diving into this would feel really good really good more than likely were going to end up doing just that eventually but its complicated larkin things are as simple or as complicated as you make them no sometimes things just are you dont even know me blair murphy demon hunter thats what youd think of first thats what youve been taught to think of first but its not nearly the whole of you strong for certain and full of courage she started to interrupt but he laid a finger on her lips but theres more in you than valor and duty youve soft places in your heart i saw them when glenna and hoyt handfasted you fussed with the flowers and the candles because you wanted them to have their moment you knew they loved and that its important there was sweetness in that larkin and youve been hurt the bruises are all inside all wrapped up where no one should see them hurting makes you think youre alone that you need to be but youre not i know youve fought your whole life against something horrible and youve never turned away from it and even so you can smile and laugh and get dewyeyed when two people in love make promises to each other i dont know your favorite color or what book you last read when you had a moment of leisure but i know you i dont know what to do about you she said when she could speak again i really dont thats not the way its supposed to be for me im always supposed to know and no surprises im happy to change that for you well since i dont think im going to be getting the clothes off you right at the moment why dont we have a walk ahhoyt and i did a sweep through the woods this morning took out three i didnt say a hunt a walk just a walk theres plenty of light left in the day oh ah youll need a shirt or a jacket well go down through the kitchen grab one for you that way we can get ourselves a box of biscuits j ust how strange was it she wondered to go walking over fields with a man in the lateafternoon sun with no real purpose but to walk no mission no scouting no hunt armed with sword and stake and sugar cookies did you know hoyt will be staying here with glenna after this is all done she bit into a cookie frowned at him here in ireland how do you know we talk of things hoyt and i when we tend the horse here in ireland yes in this place cian made them a gift of the house and land cian gave them the house she ate more cookie i cant figure him either i know some vampires or ive heard go off the juice human juice there are rumors legends mostly of some living among us passing for human going off the kill i never really believed any of it passing as human doesnt make them so and yet cians one id trust more than most men i wonder if living so long a life has something to do with it tell that to lilith shes got twice his years demons would have choices wouldnt they go this way or that i dont know the answers there and when this is done youll go back to your chicago i dont know there was an itch between her shoulder blades at the thought of it somewhere else i think maybe new york for a while where glenna lived she showed me pictures of it its a marvel maybe youll stay in geall for a while like a holiday holiday in geall she shook her head talk about marvels maybe a few days anyway it wasnt like she had anyone waiting for her to get back they walked to the cemetery and the ruined chapel flowers still bloomed here and the breeze whispered in the high grass these are my people its so weird to know that if it had been traced back this far no one ever told me does it make you sad i dont know a little i guess hoyt brought me here to show me where i came from thats nolas grave she gestured to a stone where the flowers shed laid days before were faded and dying she was the beginning of the family legacy the start of it one of her children would have been the first hunter i dont know which one and guess ill never know but at least one of them would you change it if you could no she looked over at him when he draped his arm over her shoulder would you give up what you can do not for all the gold in the green mountains especially now because it makes a difference now when you have your holiday in geall he said as they walked on ill take you to the faerie falls well have a picnic and back to food she dug out a cookie stuffed it in his mouth well swim in the pool the waters clear as blue crystal and warm as well after ill make love to you on the soft grass while the water tumbles down beside us and on to sex food and sex what could be more pleasant to think about she had to admit he had a point and couldnt deny that the simplicity of an afternoon walk had been an unexpected gift more precious than she would have imagined its blue she said my favorite colors blue he shot her a grin took her hand so they walked linked over the hill and down look there thats a pretty sight she saw glenna and hoyt in the herb garden caught in an embrace the garden thrived around them the sun showered down glenna held a basket of herbs shed harvested and her free hand lay on hoyts cheek hear the mockingbird call larkin asked and she did the happy little trill of it there was a quiet intimacy to the moment something that couldnt be captured and preserved yet was enduring and universal a miracle to find this she thought this normality this heart against heart in all the horror she realized until shed come here she hadnt believed in miracles this is why well win larkin said quietly what this is why they cant beat us were stronger than they are not to spoil the moment but physically theyve got it all over the average human physically but its not all about brute strength is it it never is they look to destroy and we to survive survivals always stronger and we have this he nodded toward hoyt and glenna love and kindness compassion hope why else would two people make promises to each other at such a time and mean to keep them we wont give all this up you see we wont have it taken from us well band together for this and well never stop he heard glenna laugh and the sound of it reached into him into that hope as she and hoyt walked toward the house youre thinking neither will they neither will they stop but that doesnt change it blair in the caves i saw them in the cages some were beaten down too tired too frightened to do more than wait to die but others rattled those cages and they cursed those bastards and when i let them out i saw more than fear even more than hope in some of the faces i saw bloody vengeance when he turned to look at her blair saw all of that in his face i saw the stronger helping the weaker he continued because thats what humans do terrible times do one of two things to us they bring out the worst or the best youre counting on the best weve already started on that havent we were six of us she let that play through her mind as they walked on the way i was trained she began was to depend on one thing yourself no one else youre in the battle alone beginning to end and it never ends so youre always alone what would be the point then winning coming out of the battle alive and your enemy dead black and white no grandstanding no mistakes no distractions who could live that way my father could did does after heafter i was on my own i spent some time with my aunt she had a different philosophy sure its about winning because if you dont win youre dead but its also about living family friends going to the movies sitting on the beach walking in the sun yeah it works for her for her family youre her family and she always made me feel that way but its not the way i was trained maybe thats why its never worked as well for me ithere was someone once and i loved him we made some promises to each other but we couldnt keep them he couldnt be with me i couldnt make it work because what i am didnt just shock and frighten him it disgusted him then he wasnt the man for you or in my thinking any kind of a man at all he was just normal larkin a normal average guy and i thought i wanted thought i could have that normal average she was made for better he thought she was made for more you could say jeremy that was his name taught me i couldnt have that its not that i dont have a life outside of what my father calls the mission i have some civilian friends i like to shop eat pizza watch tv but its always in there the knowing what comes out after sundown you cant shake it were not like other people she looked up suns getting low better go in set up for a training session she gave him a quiet look playtimes over i t wasnt a hardship larkin thought to sit and have a beautiful woman tend to you especially when the woman smelled lovely and had hands like an angel hows this glenna gently kneaded his shoulder down the arm and back again its good its fine you can stop anytime in the next hour or two she chuckled but worked her way across his back to his other shoulder you took some hard knocks pal but youre coming right along it wouldnt hurt for you to skip training tonight i think its best i keep up with it times short enough a few days and we leave she looked over his head out the window as she continued to work his back and shoulders strange how quickly this has become home i still miss new york but its not home anymore but youll go back from time to time oh yeah ill need my fix you can take the girl out of the city but she walked around him played her fingers over the bruising on the side of his ribs and made him jolt sorry im a bit ticklish suck it in and think of geall ill be quick it was torture really fearing at any minute he might giggle like a girl youll like geall at the castle there are fine gardens and herbs oh jesus youre killing me and the river where it runs behind the castle is nearly wide as a lake the fish all but jump out into your hands andthank god is that all of it youll do put your shirt on he rolled his shoulders first circled his head on his neck its better thanks for that glenna all in a days work she walked to the sink to wash balm from her hands larkin hoyt and cian have been talking thats good seeing as theyre brothers he got up pulled on his shirt but youre not meaning light family conversations no logistics strategies hoyts good with logistics he doesnt miss details but cians better with strategy i suppose anyway she turned drying her hands on a towel i asked that they not discuss all this over dinner so we could just have a meal a normalwell as normal as you can have with weapons everywhere and a fine meal it was i saw you and hoyt earlier kissing in the herb garden oh and that was normal the walk i took with blair or moira cuddled up with a book somewhere we need all that so you shouldnt worry im offended that i havent been part of a discussion on logistics and strategy you make it easy thanks the thing is were working out not only how to get weapons and the supplies well need from here to the dance but from here to geall and from the dance in geall to wherever were going once were there the castle would be the place for it the castle glenna gave a quiet laugh off to the castle the transportation might be a bit tricky and wed need you and moira to help with that meanwhile only you and moira know your way around once were there how are you at drawing maps t his would be the whole of geall in the library larkin drew it out this being the shape of it as ive seen on the maps at home a sort of ragged fan with these dips being inlets and bays and harbors and here would be the dance in the west hoyt murmured as it is here aye and a bit inland though if its a clear day you can see the coast and out to sea theres a forest as there is here but it spreads just a bit more to the north the dance is on a rise and the well of the gods here and here ah about here would be the castle he marked it drawing a kind of rook and flag its a good hours ride if youre going easy along this road thered be forks here and again here to this way youd go into the village geall city and this way down to dragons lair and onto knockarague my mothers people came from there and there are plenty who would come to fight and the battleground hoyt asked him here near the center of geall these the mountains in a kind of half ring running north curving east and down to the south the valley is here its wide and its rough land pocked with caves layered with rock its called ciunas silence as a man could wander there lost for hours and no one would hear in all of geall to my knowing its the only place nothing lives but the grass and the rocks no point in having an apocalypse in a meadow cian commented five days march isnt that what moira said hard march yes tricky for me even if i managed to get that far there are places along the way shelters cabins caves cottages well see you dont go up like a torch youre a comfort to me larkin a man does what he can there are settlements closer to the valley he continued sketching them in men can be called on there as well but i think there needs to be some fortification done the enemy would find those locations handy for their own shelter and preparations boys got a brain cian commented shed attack these cian tapped his finger on the map decimate the population turn those she felt would serve her best use the rest for food supply those would be her first strike then those will be our first defense hoyt nodded youd be wasting valuable time and effort we cant leave people undefended hoyt began get them out leave her without the food source or fresh recruits at least in that area id say burn the settlement to the ground but id be wasting my time and effort but youd be right blair stepped into the room leave her with no shelter no supplies nothing but ash its the cleanest quickest and most efficient method youre talking of peoples homes larkin shook his head at her of peoples homes and lives and livelihoods which they wont have when shes done in any case but they wont do it she said to cian and if they did or tried people would rebel and wed be fighting two fronts so clear out the population move the old the weak those who cant or wont fight to the castle or other fortifications but you agree with him larkin insisted on the surface of it burn it down the homes the farms the shops yes i do there are other ways hoyt held up a hand glenna and i havent been able to do a spell to repel the vampires from around this house because of cian but we could try one to protect these areas to keep them out of the homes there their wizard may be able to break through that but it would take time and have his focus and energies tied up that could work but she exchanged a look with cian understood he was thinking the same as she so they wouldnt burn the settlements lilith would so this is geall she leaned over the map and this is the place landlocked slapped up against the mountains lots of caves lots of hiding places and desolate for all that a goat would have a hard time beating a retreat out of there we wont be running larkin said tightly i was thinking of them without other shelter during the day theyll use the caves that gives us the high ground but gives them ambush advantage itll be night another advantage for them well use fire big advantage us but before we get there ive got some ideas about some surprises along the way now we dont know where shes going to come out but we have to figure the odds are its within this area blair placed a hand on the map battleground shelter castle shes not going to nip behind a rock during the day not her style so shes got it worked that she comes in at night and moves with some speed to shelter most likely shell send an advance to these settlements get it all taken care of for her arrival so we need to know the quickest routes from these points to these they worked debated discussed she could tell larkin had backed off from her stepped away on some basic level she told herself it couldnt be helped told herself she wouldnt be hurt what was between them was illusion anyway something framed in fantasy as transient as innocence the passion was fine it helped fill voids temporarily she knew very well that passion flickered out and died when things got tough however cold the comfort she held it to her kept it close when she went to her room alone moira bided her time all through training she could see there was something wrong between blair and larkin they barely spoke and if they did it was like strangers when most of the night was gone she caught him by the arm before he could leave the training room come on with me would you theres something i want to show you what in my room itll take a minute well be home in a few days she said before he could object i wonder if all this will seem like a dream a nightmare not all of it recognizing his poor mood she bumped him affectionately with her hip you know not all of it times moving so fast now for a while it seemed wed been here forever now its flying and its like we only arrived ill feel better when i get there when i know where i am what im about oh yes she thought something was wrong she opened the door to her room and didnt speak again until they were both inside and the door shut whats gone wrong between you and blair i dont know what youd be talking about what did you want to show me not a thing you said well i lied didnt i ive seen the two of you together for a while now and just today out walking handinhand and a look in your eye that im not mistaking and what of it tonight the air frosted between you every time one of you opened your mouth to the other you quarreled no she pursed her lips maybe you need to quarrel dont be foolish moira whats foolish about it she made you happy she brought something into you ive never seen and it seemed to me you were bringing the same to her he toyed with some of the pretty stones shed taken from the stream and put on the bureau i think youre wrong i think i was wrong why is that she said today i didnt really know her i didnt believe her but nownow i wonder if she didnt have the right of it maybe she does maybe she doesnt but its no question to me shes done or said something to upset you are you just going to leave it to lie there why dont you kick it to pieces or at least kick it back at her i dont and dont make excuses to me she snapped impatient whatever it is cant be bigger than what were facing anything else is petty now anything else i swear can be fixed so go and fix it why is it up to me to fix things you might as well because youll just be sulking and brooding instead of sleeping until you do and before you get to the sulking and brooding ill be badgering you about it until your heads aching all right all right youre a true pain in the arse moira i know she touched his cheek its because i love you go on now im going arent i he used his irritation with moira to carry him out of the room and down to blairs he knocked but didnt wait for an invitation he opened the door saw her sitting at the desk at the little computer thing he shut the door firm behind him ill have a word with you chapter s he knew that tone when i want to have a word with you really meant i want to have a fight with you and that was fine that was great she was in the perfect mood for a quick nasty brawl but that didnt mean shed make it easy for him she kept her seat obviously youve missed the fact im busy obviously youve missed the fact i dont give a bleeding damn my room she said coolly my choice toss me out then why dont you she swiveled toward him stretched out her legs casually in what she knew was an insulting gesture think i couldnt i think youd have considerable trouble with it right at the moment from the look of you you came looking for trouble fine she crossed her feet at the ankles just a little more insulting body language she thought idly she picked up a bottle of water to gesture with have your word then get out from the sound of you cara youve been expecting trouble i know youve got a problem with me you made that clear enough so spit it out larkin we havent got time and i havent got the patience for petty grievances is it petty to talk so callously of destroying peoples homes their lifes work everything theyve built and sweated for its a legitimate and proven strategy in wartime id expect to hear that from cian he is what he is and cant help it but not from you blair and it wasnt just the strategy but the way it was spoken and how you talked of those who would defend those homes rebel as you put it as a nuisance they would be creating a liability we couldnt afford but otherwise you could afford to burn them out she knew too well the look and sound of angry revulsion on a man all she could do was harden herself against it better to lose brick and wood than flesh and blood a homes more than brick and wood i wouldnt know i never had one but thats not the point in any case its moot its not being done so if thats it what do you mean you never had a home well say i never developed an emotional attachment to the roof over my head but if i had id rather see it go than me or anyone i cared about the muscles in the back of her neck had tightened like wire shooting a headache straight up into her skull and this is a ridiculous discussion because were not burning down anything no because were not the monsters here she lost her color at that he could see it just sink out of her face meaning youre not hoyts not but cian and i are another matter fine its not the first time ive been compared to a vampire thats not what im doing you expect it from him but not from me she repeated well expect it no strike that dont expect anything now get out im not finished i am she rose started for the door when he stepped in front of her took her arm she yanked free move or i make you move is that your solution threaten push shove not always she hit him her fist came up connected before the thought of doing it clicked in her brain it knocked him down and left her stunned shocked and shamed losing control with another person physically harming another person was simply not allowed im not going to apologize because you asked for it but that was crossing the line the fact that i did means im already over the line and this conversation has got to be over here get up she offered a hand she didnt see it coming another mistake the yank on her hand the sweep of his leg knocking her feet out from under her when she hit the floor he rolled on top of her before she countered she had an instant to think hed been training very well is that how you win arguments he demanded a fist to the face i was done arguing that was punctuation youre going to want to get off me larkin and fast ive got a slippery hold right now bugger that bugger you she flipped him off then sprang to a crouch to block anything he might throw at her i wont be played like this its all so easy when its walks in the sunshine and talking about picnics but when things get hard when i have to be hard then youre revolted im a fucking monster i never called you that and im not revolted im sodding mad is what i am he dived at her and they hit the floor again rolled their bodies rammed into a table tipping it over so the blown glass bowl on it shattered if youd stop trying to bruise and bloody me for five bloody seconds we could finish this if i wanted you bloody youd be pumping from an artery i dont need you passing judgment on me or giving me the big chill because ive shocked your sensibilities i dont need this bullshit from you or what you need is to shut the hell up he crushed his mouth to hers in an angry frustrated kiss even as her elbow found its way into his gut he had to lift his head to wheeze back in the air she stole dont tell me to shut up she grabbed his hair with both hands yanked his mouth back down to hers just as angry just as frustrated just as needy the hell with it she thought the hell with right and wrong with sense with safety screw control there were times you just took and let yourself be taken didnt mean anything she told herself as she dragged at his shirt it was only flesh it was only heat she wanted to weep and rage as much as she wanted to consume she shoved him over straddled him as she pulled her shirt over her head but he reared up clamping his arms around her as his mouth found her breast so she held on letting her head fall back letting him plunder now he was riding the dragon he thought flying on the power of it she was like trying to hold flame so the sheer burn of her made him delirious he used teeth and tongue gorging himself as her fingers dug into his shoulders his back his sides then she was under him again her hips grinding up while their mouths clashed he pulled the loose pants she wore down her hips and there was nothing beneath them but woman hot and wet hotter and wetter when his hand found her her harsh throaty moan seared across his lips when the orgasm ripped through her she could only think god thank god but the greed whipped back spun through like a cyclone that had her biting scratching tearing she would give no quarter here and ask none but only clamped strong legs around him held on to that exquisite shock when he plunged into her and drove her like a mad thing thrust upon urgent thrust until they were both burned out w hat had she done shed just had crazed kickyourass sex without a single thought of selfpreservation of consequences ofanything no thought none at all just brutal primal need he was still inside her and if felt as though their bodies had melted together in the heat how would she separate herself again how could she come out of this whole she wasnt supposed to feel like this she wasnt supposed to want something someone so much she forgot herself let herself be taken even as she took and in blind feral passion she hadnt stopped it she hadnt been able to stop it and now she would pay he murmured something she couldnt make it out then he nuzzled a kind of nose in the neck like a puppy before he rolled aside the simple sweetness of the gesture after the ferocity all but broke her into pieces crushing you he grabbed a couple of ragged breaths well that was fairly amazing and not at all the way id had it all planned out are you all right then careful she warned herself careful and cool no problem she sat up reached for her pants hang on a minute he patted her arm my heads still spinning here and i barely took the time to look at you seeing as we were both in a rush got the job done she hitched on her pants thats what counts he pushed himself up reached her shirt before she did look here at me would you im not big on postgame analysis and ive got things to do i dont remember a game a battle perhaps i thought wed both come out on the winning side of it yeah so like i said no problem she would start to tremble in a minute any minute i need my shirt he studied her face where did you go you have so many little hiding places i dont hide she ripped the shirt out of his hand aye you do someone gets too close you go sliding off into one of your shadows okay why do you want to piss me off she dragged on her shirt we had sex really good sex its been coming on for a while and now its done we can put the focus back where it belongs i dont think things are so very different here than in geall that what we just had between us would be just sex look cowboy if you want romance he got to his feet slowly it was the look in his eyes that warned her his temper was back that was fine in fact that was good theyd swipe at each other and hed go there wasnt anything romantic about it i thought there would be the first time we came together but things took a different turn and no complaints now youre trying to shove me away knock me back the way you did before with your fist let me say that the fist was more honest than this you got what you were after you know better you know it wasnt only this whats the point in anything else whats the goddamn point its got nowhere to go have you been looking into glennas crystal you see tomorrow now and the day after i know things like this are doomed before they start cians not the only one who is what he is larkin ah now we come to it just she lifted her hands shoved at the air turned away let it go if the occasional grope in the dark isnt enough for you look somewhere else so hed hurt her along the way he realized he was hardly the first and couldnt quite decide if he was sorry for his part of it as yet i dont know whats enough for me when it comes to you he scooped up his pants yanked them on but i know i care for you i know you matter oh please she grabbed the water from her desk gulped some down you dont even like me where does that fly from why would you say something so foolish and so false you seem to have forgotten what started this whole thing what you came in here for in the first place i havent but i dont see what that has to do with how i feel about you well for gods sake larkin how could you feel anything for someone when youre standing on the other side of a basic line he considered his words now he was he knew being compared to the jeremy shed spoken of before someone whod been unable or unwilling to love and accept who she was blair youre a hardheaded woman and ive my own streak of stubbornness my own stands and thoughts and what did you call it sensibilities and so what so you me she pointed to him tapped her own chest then swiped a finger between them line oh bollocks you think i cant disagree with you and passionately come to that and care for you respect you admire you even knowing inside my heart youre wrong about the thing were arguing over the same i wager as inside yours you believe im wrong im not he said with the barest hint of a smile but thats another matter if everyone has to believe the same if theres never any passionate differences how do people come together in your world they dont she said after a moment not with me then youre just stupid arent you and narrow in your thinking he added when she gaped at him hard in the head as well as i believe ive already mentioned she took another careful sip of water im not stupid just the rest of it then he nodded as he took a step toward her blair its not always where you end up is it thats the most important thing its the journey itself and what you find what you do along the way now ive found you and thats an important thing where were going matters it does but so does where we are i have feelings for you feelings ive never had for anyone they dont always fit comfortably inside me but i have a way of shifting things around until i find the fit you maybe im not good at this as i am youll just have to follow my lead how did you manage to turn this around on me he only smiled then kissed her cheek her brow her other cheek i just managed to get you faced toward me thats the right direction s he had to keep her mind focused on the job the work if she didnt blair found it tended to wander in that direction larkin had spoken of then shed catch herself daydreaming smiling for no reason or remembering what it was like to wake up beside a man who looked at her in a way that made her feel so much like a woman there was too much to do to take time indulging in fantasies you have to be practical glenna we all do now blair tapped glennas storage chest with her foot whats essential in here all of it glenna blair glenna folded her arms are we or are we not going into battle against über evil yes we are which means we go in lean stripped down mobile no which means we go in loaded these are my weapons glenna swept out a hand a bit blair thought like one of those game show models showing off fabulous prizes are you leaving your weapons behind no but i can also carry mine on my back which you cant do with this twoton chest it doesnt weigh two tons seventyfive pounds tops glennas lips trembled at blairs long cool stare okay maybe eighty the books alone may make all the difference whos to say ill worry about the transport this better be a damn big stone circle blair muttered you know youre taking more than the rest of us combined what can i say im a diva blair rolled her eyes stalked to the tower window to stare out into the rain there was little time here left she thought nearly moving day and while she could sense nearly see a few of liliths forces in the trees thered be no movement toward the house no attack shed expected something after what larkin had pulled off the sheer balls of it shed expected a reprisal it seemed impossible lilith would take such an insult such a loss without slapping back maybe shes too busy gearing up for geall too what lilith blair turned back to glenna nothing out of her for days now and larkins infiltration had to sting jesus when you think about it one man unarmed not only getting in but getting prisoners out its a kick in the face glennas eyes glinted i wish that was literal as well as figurative get in line but anyway maybe shes too busy preparing to move her front to bother harassing us right now very likely im going to head down to the war room we need to work out the fine details of the traps we want to set will it make a difference what do you mean ive been thinking about it all of it what weve done what theyve done glenna rubbed a hand over the top of her chest but the time and the place are set nothing we do will change that time that place no morrigan made that clear in our last little chat but what we do how we handle the time between now and then will set the tone for that time and place she was saying that too hey pal its okay to be nervous good with brisk efficiency glenna set vials shed replenished back in her healing case i called my parents today i told them id probably be out of touch for a few weeks told them what an incredible time im having i couldnt tell them about any of this of course i havent even told them about hoyt yet because its too hard to explain she closed the case and turned its not that im not afraid to die i am of course maybe more now than i was when this began i have more to lose now hoyt and happy ever exactly but im prepared to die if thats what it takes maybe more now than when this began for those exact reasons love sure can twist you up oh boy was glennas heartfelt agreement and i wouldnt change a single moment since i met him still its so hard blair i have no way of telling my family how or why if i dont make it through this theyll never know what happened to me and that weighs on me then dont die glenna gave a half laugh a better idea im sorry i dont mean to make light of it no its kind of bolstering actually butif anything happens to me would you take this to my family she held out an envelope i know its a lot to ask she began when blair hesitated no butwhy me you and cian have the best chance of coming through this i cant ask him to do it they wont understand even with this but at least they wont spend the rest of their lives wondering if im alive or dead i dont want to put them through that blair studied the envelope the artistic flare of the handwriting forming her parents names and address i tried to contact my father twice since this started email because i dont actually know where he is he hasnt answered me oh im sorry he must be out of reach for no probably not he just doesnt answer me thats fairly typical and i really need to get over it it isnt that he wouldnt care big vamp war hed care and if i died hed be sorry because he trained me not to and going down would be a reflection on him that sounds harsh he is she looked into glennas face cleareyed and he doesnt love me oh blair time to suck that up too past time youve got something else here she tapped the letter and its important it is glenna agreed but theyre not my only family i get that what weve got the six of us its one of the good things ive picked up along the way with a nod blair tucked the envelope into the back pocket of her jeans ill give this back to you november first thatd be good see you downstairs soon oh and blair its nice you and larkin its nice to see see what now glenna let out a genuine laugh what am i blind added to that i have the super xray vision of a newlywed im just saying i like the way you are together it seems like a nice fit its just its notim not looking for the big hollywood finish the one where the music crescendos and the light goes all pink and pretty why not just not the way it is ill take it a day at a time people like me look too far down the road they end up falling into the big hole somebody dug right in front of them if they dont look far enough or hard enough they dont see what they were really looking for right now ill settle for avoiding the hole she headed out no way to explain she thought not to a woman still floating on the wings of new love that there were some people who just werent built for it some people didnt have that strolling handinhand with the man of their dreams into the sunset in their destiny when she strolled into the sunset she went alone she went armed and she went looking for death not exactly the stuff of romance and hopeful futures shed tried it once and it had been a disaster that had blown up in her face larkin was no jeremy that was for damn certain larkin was tougher and stronger and sweeter for that matter but that didnt change the basics she had her duty the mission and he had his world those werent the elements for a longterm connection her particular branch of the old mckenna family tree would die out with her shed made up her mind to that when shed scraped herself up after jeremy she started to swing toward the stairs but the music stopped her cocking her head she strained to hear to recognize was that usher jeez was larkin up in the training room fooling around with her mp shed have to kill him she jogged up the stairs it wasnt that she couldnt appreciate the fact he enjoyed her music but shed spent a lot of time downloading and setting up that player he didnt even know how the damn thing worked listen cowboy i dont want you the room was empty the terrace doors firmly shut and music poured through the air okay weird she set her hand on the stake she always carried in her belt and sidestepped slowly toward the weapons the lights were on full nothing could hide in shadows but she closed her hand over the handle of a scythe the music shut off a switch flicked lora stepped through the wall of mirrors hello cherie nice trick one of my favorites turning a circle she seemed to study the room she wore heeled boots snug black pants with a fitted jacket that showed a flirty bit of frothy lace between the deep plunge of lapels so this is where you spar and sweat and prepare to die this is where we train to kick your ass so tough so formidable she floated around the room with the spiked heels of those boots gliding just above the floor not here blair told herself not really here just the illusion of her but to prove it she hurled a stake and watched it pass right through loras figure to embed itself into the wall that was rude lora turned with a little pout hardly a way to welcome a guest you werent invited no we were interrupted the last time before you could invite me in but still i brought you a present something picked just especially for you i went all the way to america for it all the way to boston she did a long sweeping turn with her eyes bright as suns wouldnt you like to see or would you like to guess yes yes you must guess three guesses to show complete lack of interest blair stood hipshot a hand hooked in the pocket of her jeans i dont play games with the undead fifi youre just no fun are you but one day well have fun you and i she floated closer running her tongue over fangs before she smiled i have so many plans for you men have let you down havent they poor blair withheld their love and you crying out for it inside the only thing im crying out for is an end to this conversation before it makes me sick what you need is a woman what you need she trailed a finger in the air a breath away from blairs cheek yes bien sur you need the power and the pleasure id give you i dont go for cheap blondes with silly french accents plus the outfit its so last week lora hissed her head snapping forward as if to bite ill make you sorry and ill make you grovel then ill make you scream deliberately blair widened her eyes golly does that mean you dont want to date me anymore with a laugh lora spun away i like you i really do you have ahflair thats why i brought you such a special present ill just go get it wait one minute she stepped backward through the mirrors fuck this blair muttered she grabbed a crossbow armed it with the bow in one hand the scythe in the other she began to move cautiously toward the door this was glennas area not hers time to call in the witch but lora slid through the wall again and what she pulled with her had blairs blood freezing no no no no he is handsome lora slid a tongue down jeremys cheek as he struggled against her hold i can see why you feel for him youre not here oh god his face was bleeding his right eye swollen nearly shut its not real not here but real say hello jeremy blair blair whats going on what are you doing here whats happening it was so easy lora clamped a hand on his throat choking him as she lifted him an inch off the floor and laughing when blair charged them flew through them and ran hard against the wall i just picked him up in a bar a few drinks a few suggestions men are deceivers ever thats shakespeare why dont we go to your place was all i needed to whisper into his ear and here we are she brought him down so his feet touched the ground but kept her hand around his neck i would have fucked him first but it seemed that would take the shine off the gift help me he choked it out wheezing each breath blair you have to help me help me lora mimicked and threw him to the ground why are you wasting your time with him blair felt her stomach twist as jeremy crawled toward her you want me come for me oh i will lora leaped falling on jeremy dragging him to his back she straddled him this weak yet attractive human broke your heart isnt that so he dumped me what do i care what you do to him youre wasting your time with him when you should be dealing with me no no its never a waste of time and caring chérie is what you do lora clamped a hand over jeremys mouth as he started to scream then watching blair scraped her nail down his cheek to draw fresh blood she licked it from her fingertip hmm fear always gives it such a nice kick beg for him if you beg ill let him live dont kill him please dont kill him he means nothing to you hes not important leave him there just leave him you got my attention ill meet you alone wherever you want just you and me well settle this the two of us we dont need men getting in the way dont do this ask for something in return just ask blair lora offered her a sweet sympathetic smile i dont have to ask i just take but you begged very well so illoh dont be ridiculous we both know im going to kill him watch she sank her teeth into him sliding her body down his as it convulsed in an awful parody of sex blair heard herself screaming and screaming and screaming chapter w hen larkin rushed in all he saw was blair stabbing a stake over and over into the floor she was weeping as she did it in wild screaming sobs and there was a madness on her face he ran to her but when he grabbed for her she struck out in a blow that bloodied his lip get away get away shes killing him theres nothing there he gripped her wrist and would have taken another punch if cian hadnt dragged her back she kicked twisted to attack cian slapped her twice hard enough to make the crack of it echo stop hysterics are useless enraged larkin leaped to his feet take your hands off her you think you can strike her he might have charged but hoyt pinned his arm hold on a bloody minute larkins answer was to rear back smash his head into hoyts jaw even as glenna sprinted over to stand between larkin and cian just calm down glenna held up her hands just everyone calm down but there was shouting accusations and blairs helpless sobbing ciunas moiras voice cut through the mayhem with a cold authority quiet all of you larkin he did what needed to be done so stop this nonsense let go of her cian glenna get her some water we need to find out whats happened here when cian released her blair simply melted to the floor shes killed him i couldnt stop her she brought up her knees wrapped her arms around her head as she lowered it oh god oh my god you have to look at me now moira crouched down firmly took blairs arms and brought them down again you have to look at me blair and tell me what happened here he never believed not even when i showed him it was easier to push me away to throw me away than to believe it now hes dead who is jeremy jeremys dead she brought him here so i would see her do it theres no one here blair no one here and no one in the house but the six of us there was glenna passed down the water i can feel it she looked at hoyt for confirmation a smear on the air he nodded a heaviness to it that comes from black magic she came through the wall and i thought now well fight you and me french bitch though blair fought to steady it her voice continued to hitch i threw a stake but it went right through her she wasnt really here she like on the subway it happened to me glenna explained in new york a vampire on the subway but no one else could see it he spoke to me it moved but it wasnt really there boston sick to the soul of her blair got to her feet she went to boston i used to live there its where i met him jeremy they were in his apartment she told me where she was cian do you have contacts there i do she gave him an address jeremy hilton someone needs to check maybe she was just messing with me but ifthey have to make sure she didnt change him ill take care of it she looked down to where shed hacked and drilled the steak into the floorboards sorry about the floor thatd be hoyts and glennas problem now cian touched her shoulder briefly before he left the room we should go down you should lie down glenna said or sit at least i can give you something that will help no i dont want anything she scrubbed the useless tears away with the heels of her hands i knew shed come back at us but i never considered i never thought glenna your family theyre protected hoyt and i saw to that blair im so sorry we didnt do something for yourfor your friend i never thought of him never considered they wouldim ah im going to take a few minutes before we get back to work all you need glenna told her blair looked at larkin im sorry im sorry i hit you its nothing letting her go letting her go alone was more painful than any blow s he didnt weep again tears wouldnt help jeremy and they certainly wouldnt do her any good she contacted her aunt relayed the details she could count on family to protect family in any case she doubted lilith or lora any of them would go after people who were prepared who knew them and could defend themselves theyd chosen the helpless for a very good reason it didnt waste time or effort was lowrisk and very very effective she was absolutely calm when she armed herself sliding the sword into the sheath on her back the stake into the one on her belt her mind her purpose were clear as glass when she went outside there wouldnt be many she thought it was poor strategy to waste more than a handful at this stage which was a pity they would expect her to be broken to be shaking and weeping under the covers that was a mistake she watched the two come toward her from the right and from the left hello boys you looking for a party the sword came out of its sheath with the slick sound of metal on metal she whirled a quick twohanded swing and decapitated the one coming at her from behind came to the right place when they charged she was ready slicing piercing blocking with a sword that sang like vengeance she took the nick on her forearm she wanted to feel it that sting they were clumsy she thought young and poorly trained fat and soft in the lives theyd led before theyd been turned not defenseless not like jeremy but far from seasoned she flipped out the stake eliminated one the one that was left dropped its sword began to run hey hey not done yet she chased it took it down with a flying tackle then holding the stake to its heart stared into eyes filled with fear got a message for lora you know her the french pastry good she said when it nodded tell her she was right about one thing it will be her and me and when i end her its going to beoh never mind ill tell her myself she plunged the stake down rising she tunneled her fingers through her dripping hair then picked up the scattered weapons and started back to the house the door swung open before she reached it and larkin stormed out have you gone mad they werent expecting it she tossed him one of the swords moved by him into the house only three anyway probably clears the ones shes stationed near the house she laid the other confiscated swords on the kitchen counter and those were lightweights youd go out alone risk your life this way i went out alone most of my life she reminded him and risking my life is part of the job description its not a job a jobs exactly what it is she poured herself a large mug of coffee hands still steady she noted mission accomplished im going to go dry off you had no right to take a chance like that minimal risk she countered as she walked out excellent results when shed changed her clothes she joined the others in the library she could see from their expressions larkin had informed the rest of the group of her little sortie they were stationed close to the house she began likely to try to hear or see something they could pass on that wont be a problem now it would have been a problem if thered been more of them hoyt spoke quietly but it didnt disguise the steel beneath the words it would have been a problem if theyd killed or captured you didnt happen we have to be ready to take opportunities not only the six of us but the people were going to be sending into battle they have to be trained how to kill when to kill not just with sword and stake but with their bare hands or whatever comes to hand because everythings a weapon and if theyre not trained if theyre not ready theyre just going to stand there and die like jeremy hilton yeah she nodded at larkin absorbed his anger along with the weight in her heart like jeremy cian were you able to find anything out hes dead she closed off the part of her that wanted to moan could he have been changed no there was too much trauma to the body for that its still possible he no cian bit off the word to cut her off she ripped him to pieces its one of her signatures hes just dead she let herself sit better to sit she decided than to fall over there was nothing you could do blair moira told her gently nothing you could have done to stop it no there was nothing that was her point look what i can do right in front of you and youre helpless we were engaged jeremy and i a couple years ago so i had to tell him in the end i had to show him what i am what i do he walked out because he wasnt going to believe it wasnt going to be part of it now its killed him she killed him larkin corrected who you are didnt kill him he waited until she shifted her gaze met his eyes she wants very much wants you to blame yourself will you give her that victory she wont win anything from me tears stung her eyes again but she willed them back im sorry all around this messes me up and i have to live with it awhile on my own before i can put it away well put off the meeting glenna glanced around at the others for agreement you can take some time appreciate it but works better thinkings better if she went upstairs now were alone now blair knew shed just fall apart again so okay if were going to set traps on the other side well need to calculate the best locations and determine how many well need on those details we have more immediate concerns hoyt interrupted the transportation to geall itself if cians barred from the dance he cant reach the portal there must be an exception moira laid a hand on blairs shoulder gave it one hard squeeze before moving aside morrigan chose us all of us maybe shes finished with me cian shrugged gods are fickle creatures youre one of the six moira insisted without you in geall the circles broken i could go back to the caves from the air larkin paced in front of the windows how could he sit at such a time scout i might be able to find where theyre going through we cant separate not this close to deadline we stick together now glenna scanned faces lingering on blairs we stay whole theres another thing i think i should mention moira glanced toward cian when larkin and i went to the dance in geall it was barely midday it seemed to happen so quickly the way we were swept up and away but when we came out here it was night i dont think we can know how long it takes or if times the same oror if we leave at night as we planned if it would still be night when we come to geall or high bloody noon cian cast his eyes up isnt that just perfect there has to be a way to protect him if theres sunlight easy for you to say red cian rose to get a glass of whiskey your delicate skin may burn a bit in strong sunlight but you dont go to ash do you some sort of block hoyt glenna began i dont think spfforty will do the trick cian countered well figure it out she snapped back well find a way we havent come this far to give up to leave you behind blair let them talk argue debate the voices just buzzed around her she didnt comment didnt contribute when hoyt finally harangued cian into giving him a sample of blood she left them to their magic h e didnt try to sleep a half dozen times he started to go to her room to offer what he wondered comfort she didnt want anger she didnt need she had suffered a terrible loss and a hard hard shock to her heart she hadnt perhaps couldnt turn to him not even he thought now as a fellow warrior he couldnt soothe hurts she refused to let him see or reach wounds she closed in to herself she had loved the man that much was clear and there was a small part of himself an ugliness he could despise that was jealous of the brutalized dead so he stood at the window watching the sun rise on his last day in ireland when someone knocked he assumed it was moira bi istigh he didnt turn when the door opened not until blair spoke my gaelics pretty crappy so if that was go to hell too bad she hefted the bottle of whiskey she held in one hand i raided cians supply going to get a little drunk have a wake for an old friend want to join me without waiting for an answer she walked over to sit on the floor at the foot of the bed resting her back against it she opened the bottle poured a generous two fingers into each of the glasses shed brought in heres to just being dead she lifted the glass tossed back the contents come on have a drink larkin you can be pissed at me and still have a drink he walked over lowered to the floor to sit across from her im sorry youre hurting ill get over it she handed him the second glass poured more whiskey in her own sláinte she tapped the glasses together but this time she sipped instead of gulped attachments my father taught me were weapons the enemy could use against you thats a hard and cold way to live oh hes good at hard and cold he walked out on me on my eighteenth birthday done she leaned her head back and drank you know hed hurt me so many times before cut my heart out i thought just by not loving me but it was nothing nothing that happened didnt happen before came close to what it did to me when he walked away thats how i got this she turned her wrist over examined the scar going out while i was still reeling trying to prove i didnt need him i did need him too bad for me he didnt deserve you she smiled a little hed completely agree with that but not the way you mean i wasnt what he wanted and even if i had been he wouldnt have loved me took me a long time to come around to that maybe hed have been proud maybe hed have been satisfied but he never wouldve loved me and still you loved him worshiped him for a moment blair closed her eyes as she let that part of her go that part was over i just couldnt rip that out and turn it to dust so i worked really hard until i was better than hed ever been but i still had that need inside me to love somebody to have them love me back then there was jeremy she poured more whiskey for both of them i was working at my uncles pub my aunt my cousins and i took shifts hunting or working the bar waiting tables just taking the night off my aunt called it having a life work as a family share the burden have some normal sounds like a sensible woman she is and a good one so im riding the stick working the bar when jeremy comes in with a couple of friends hes just copped this big account and theyre going to hoist a few hes a stockbroker she waved that away hard to explain anyway hes good looking great looking actually so he hits on me he struck you no no finding that wonderfully funny she snorted out a laugh its parlance slang he flirted with me i flirted back because he gave me the buzz you know what i mean that little zzzz you get inside i do larkin brushed a hand over hers i know that buzz he hung around till closing and i ended up giving him my number well we dont need every detail we started seeing each other going out together he was fun sweet normal the kind of guy who sends you flowers the day after your first date her eyes misted over but she shook her head downed more whiskey i wanted normal i wanted a chance at it when things got serious between us i thought yeah yeah this is the way its supposed to be the job doesnt mean i cant have somebody be part of somebody but i didnt tell him what i did on those nights we werent together or what i did some nights after he was asleep i didnt tell him did you love him i did and i told him that i told him i loved him but i didnt tell him what i was she drew a deep breath honestly i dont know if that was sheer cowardice or ingrained training but i didnt tell him we were together eight months and he never knew there had to be signs there had to be clues hey jeremy dont you wonder how i got these bruises why my clothes are trashed where the hell this blood came from but he never asked and i never let myself wonder why people you said have blinders love i think can thicken them bet your ass he asked me to marry him oh god he pulled out all the stops the wine the candles the music all the right words i just rode on it the big shiny fantasy of it still i didnt say anything not for days until my aunt sat me down she pressed the thumb and finger of one hand to her eyes you have to tell him she said to me you have to make him believe it you cant have a life can never build one with him not with lies or halftruths or without trust dragged my feet another couple of weeks but it ate at me i knew she was right but he loved me so it would be all right it would all work out fine because he loved me and hed see i was doing not just what i had to do but what was right holding her glass in both hands she closed her eyes i explained it to him as carefully as i knew how taking him through the family history he thought i was joking she opened her eyes now met larkins when he realized i wasnt he got hostile figured it was my sick way of breaking the engagement we went round and round about it i badgered him into going to the cemetery with me i knew one was supposed to rise that night and hey a pictures worth a thousand so i showed him what they were what i was she drank again one long sip he couldnt wait to get away from me couldnt wait to pack his things and get away to walk out on me i was a freak and he never wanted to see me again he was weak he was just a guy now hes a dead guy so its your fault is it your fault that you cared enough to share what you are with him to show him not only that there are monsters in the world but that youre strong enough courageous enough to fight them your fault that he wasnt man enough to see the wonder of you what wonder i do what im trained to do follow the family business thats bollocks and worse its selfpity i didnt kill him you were right about that but hes dead because of me hes dead because a vicious soulless demon killed him hed dead because he didnt believe in what was in front of his eyes and didnt hold on to you and none of that is your doing he left me like my father left me i thought that was the worst but thisi dont know what to do with the pain he took her glass set it aside reaching out he pulled her into his arms pressed her head onto his shoulder put a bit of it here for now shed your tears a stór youll feel better having given them to him he held her stroking her hair and soothing while she wept for another man s he woke tucked into his bed still dressed and grateful she was alone the hangover wasnt the clanging bell of a night of foolish indulgence but the dull gong that came from using whiskey as a cushion hed drawn the drapes so the sun wouldnt wake her she noted and checked her watch for the time the fact that it was already noon made her groan as she threw back the covers to sit on the side of the bed too much to do she told herself to coddle a halfassed hangover and a raging case of sorrow before she could gather the fortitude to stand larkin walked in he carried a glass that held something murky and brown id say good morning but it likely doesnt feel as such to you its not too bad she told him ive had worse regardless it isnt the day for having a head glenna says this will help it she looked dubiously at the glass because drinking it will make me throw up everything in my system she didnt say but youll be a brave girl now and take your medicine i guess she took the glass sniffed at the contents doesnt smell as bad as it looks she took a deep breath downed all of it then shuddered right down to her toes tastes a lot worse not just eye of newt but the whole damn newt give it a minute or two to settle she nodded then stared down at her hands i wasnt at my best last night to put it extremely mildly no one expects you should be at your best at all times certainly not me i want to thank you for the ear and the shoulder those seemed to be the parts of me you needed most he sat beside her were you clearheaded enough to understand what i said to you yeah its not my fault in my head i know its not my fault there are other parts of me larkin that have to catch up with my head on this they wasted you these men i wont he pushed to his feet again when she stared at him something else for you to catch up with come down when youre ready weve a lot of work she kept staring even after hed gone out and closed the door behind him i t helped to have the work they would carry the oldfashioned way as much of the supplies and weapons as possible to the circle hoyt and glenna would continue to work on a shield of some kind for cian with larkin in the form of a horse blair loaded him while moira loaded cians stallion sure you can ride that thing blair asked her i can ride anything moira glanced toward the tower window its the only way to get this done they need to concentrate on what theyre doing we cant risk trying to carry everything were taking the full distance after sunset nope blair swung onto larkins back keep your eyes open we may have company in the woods they started out single file can you really smell them moira called out its more that i sense them ill know if one gets close she scanned the trees the shadows nothing stirred but birds and rabbits sunlight she thought and birdsong it would be a different matter taking this route at night she and moira she decided on larkin with hoyt and glenna on the stallion cian she thought could move nearly as fast as a horse at a gallop if necessary it was a twisting and at times a barely trod path and at times the shadows over it were deep enough to have her fingers twitch toward the crossbow she felt the ripple of larkins muscles between her thighs nodded so he could sense them too she thought or the horse he was inside could sense them theyre watching keeping their distance but watching theyll understand what were about moira glanced back or get word to lilith and she will yeah pick up the pace a little lets get this done they came out of the woods crossed a short fallow field on the rise of it stood the stone dance it is big blair murmured not stonehenge big she thought but impressive and like stonehenge even before she moved into the shadow of the stones she felt them almost heard them strong stuff she dismounted in this world and in mine moira slid off the stallion then laid her head against larkins its our way home lets hope so within the dance blair began to offload weapons youre sure vamps cant come inside the circle no demon can pass between the stones and step on the sacred ground its that way in geall and from everything ive read on it that way in this world as well moira looked as blair did toward the woods but she thought of cian and what would become of him if they were forced to leave him behind well figure it out moira glanced over youre worried too its a concern weve got to get him there keep him from frying so make that two really major concerns handy this is a safety zone and were not going to come back in a few hours and find theyve raided our weapons stash but cians the downside without thinking she rubbed larkins flank when he turned his head eyed her she dropped her hand hoyt and glenna are on it we all go thats the deal so well figure it out the swish of larkins tail slapped her in the butt hey hes a playful sort moira commented in almost any form yeah hes a real jokester ought to be careful one of these days he might stick in one of the fourlegged varieties she came around to his head then where will you be he slurped his tongue from her jaw to her cheekbone eeww moiras laugh bubbled out as she stacked the last of the weapons he makes me laugh even in the worst of times ah well she said when blair scowled and swiped the slobber from her cheek you dont seem to mind his tongue on you when hes a man the sound larkin made was as close to a laugh as a horse could manage moira just grinned and swung back onto the stallion its hard to miss when two people are eager to get their hands on each other i once had a crush on him myself she reached over tugged larkins mane but then i was five ive gotten well over it now its the quiet ones youve got to watch out for blair muttered you she jerked her head toward moira as she mounted larkin quiet type into the books little shy around the edges i wouldnt have figured youd take the idea of me banging your cousin so casually banging moira pursed her lips as they rode through the stones that would be a term for sexual relations it fits doesnt it because she draped the reins over vlads neck so she could slap her hands together and this time blair laughed youre just full of surprises i know what happens between a man and a woman theoretically theoretically so youve never she caught moiras wincing glance toward larkin oh sorry big horses have big ears well i suppose its a small thing considering all the rest no ive never if im to be queen ill need to marry but theres time id want to find someone whod suit and who understands me id like best to love as my parents loved each other but at least id want to care for him and id hope hed be skilled at banging this time the sound larkin made was a kind of mutter why should you be the only one moira slid her foot from the stirrup to give him a light kick with her boot is he good at it then our larkin hes an animal beneath her larkin broke into a fast trot yes blair thought it was good to laugh even in the worst of times chapter c ian fingered the rough black material with mild distaste a cloak but its a magic cloak glenna tried a winning smile with hood black cloaks and vampires he thought with an inward sigh such a cliche and thisthing is supposed to prevent me from going up in flames in direct sunlight it really should work he sent her a mildly amused look should being the operative word your blood didnt boil when we exposed it hoyt began theres cheery news it happens im made up of more than blood bloods the key hoyt insisted bloods the heart of it youve said so yourself that was before my flesh and bone were on the line were sorry theres no time to test it glenna pushed a hand through her hair it took so long and until we were reasonably sure we couldnt ask you to put it on and step outside considerate of you he held it up couldnt you have made it a bit more stylish fashion wasnt our primary concern hoyt didnt quite snap out the words but it was close protecting your sorry self was ill be sure to thank you for it if im not a pile of inarticulate ash at the end of the day and so you should moira condemned him with one quiet look they worked through the night and all through this day with only you in mind and while youve slept the rest of us have been working as well i had work of my own your highness he dismissed her simply by turning his back well its unlikely to be an issue as your stone circle rejects my sort you have to trust in the gods hoyt told him im forced to remind you yet again vampire vampires and gods arent drinking buddies glenna stepped up to cian laid a hand over his wear it please for you red he tipped her face up kissed her lightly on the lips then he stepped back swirled it on feel like a bloody b movie extra or worse a sodding monk he didnt look like a monk moira thought he looked dangerous blair and larkin came in were as secure as were going to be blair said then lifted her eyebrows at cian hey you look like zorro i beg your pardon you know that scene where hes in the chapel with the girl and hes pretending to be the priest only jeez the kind of priest we used to call father what a waste anyway suns down if were going to go wed better hoyt nodded looked at cian youll stay close close enough blair might have wished theyd taken time to practice the maneuver but it was too late for wishes no more talk she thought no more discussion and no dress rehearsals it was now or never after a quick nod a quick breath she and larkin went through the door first even as he changed she was leaping up then reaching a hand down to help moira vault behind her they rode away from the stables at a hard run with the hope of drawing any that waited in ambush she barely saw cian streak out he was at the stable doors in seconds releasing the stallion then he was gone again and hoyt and glenna were on vlads back with barely a glimmer of moonlight to guide them a gallop was risky once they reached the trees blair kept larkin to a trot trusting him to watch the path as she scanned the woods nothing yet nothing if theyre around theyre hanging back can you see cian with her bow ready moira tried to look everywhere at once sense him no theres nothing blair shifted in the saddle to look over moiras shoulder at hoyt watch the flank they may come at us from behind they rode in absolute silence with only the sound of hooves on the path and that blair thought was a problem where were the nightbirds where were all the little rustles and peeps of the small animals in a night woods demon hunters she knew werent the only creatures who could sense vampires be ready blair said under her breath she heard it then the clash of steel a sudden scream she didnt have to urge larkin on with words or a nudge of her heels he was already at a gallop she sensed them seconds before they charged out of the trees foot soldiers this time she judged with some seasoning and wearing light armor she sliced down with her sword even as moiras arrows began to fly hooves struck out and trampled whatever fell beneath them but the enemy came from everywhere blocking the circle and barring the path to the dance blair kicked out knocking one back as it clawed at her leg too many she thought too many to make a stand better she thought better to charge break the line and get to the stones then the one that leaped down from a branch above her nearly unseated her knocking her back as she rammed up an elbow to block it moira pitched to the ground with a cry of rage blair smashed back with a fist shed nearly jumped down when cian flew across the path he swooped moira up all but threw her back on larkin go he shouted go now she charged the line the flames from her sword cutting a burning path she could only hope cian was out of harms way as a ball of fire whizzed by her she felt larkin vibrate beneath her and the form of him shift then she was soaring up on the dragons back with his claws raking across the line of vampires slashing out with his tail as hoyt and glenna galloped through the gap she could see the stones now though clouds covered the moon they glowed like polished silver shining against the dark she would have sworn even with the rush of wind the cries of battle she heard them singing as hoyt and glenna flew through them and into the circle larkin dived she leaped from his back favoring the leg the vampire had scored get ready she ordered cian she squeezed moiras shoulder hell come hoyt he drew out his key moira did the same we dont say the words until cians with us as with the stones themselves power seemed to pulse from hoyt as he took glennas hand we dont say the words until were a circle again blair nodded whatever the stones held whatever hoyt and glenna had been born with the full force of the power came from unity theyd wait for cian she turned to larkin nice riding cowboy how bad is it he pressed a hand to his bleeding side scratches you same clawed up a little everybody else well do glenna was already stanching a gash in hoyts arm hes coming moira murmured where hoyt clamped a hand on her arm i see nothing there she pointed hes coming he was a blur coming out of the trees a swirl of black up the rise wasnt that entertaining theyre regrouping for all the good it will do them there was blood on his face and more running down from a slice in his thigh come hoyt held out a hand to him its time i cant cian lifted his own hand and pressed it against the air between the stones its like a wall to me i am what i am you cant stay here hoyt insisted theyll hunt you down youll be alone im not such easy prey do what youre meant to do ill stay to make certain it works if you stay we all stay larkin stepped to the gap between two stones if you fight we all fight the sentiments appreciated cian told him but this is bigger than one of us and you have somewhere to be the other portal larkin began if i find it you can buy me a drink in geall go he met hoyts eyes whats meant is meant so youve always believed and so in my way have i go save worlds ill find a way hoyt reached through the stones to grip cians hand ill find a way i swear it to you good luck to you cian saluted them with his sword to you all with a heavy heart showing clearly in his eyes hoyt stepped back lifted the crystal light beamed in it and from it worlds wait time flows gods watch tears glimmering on her cheeks glenna took his hand and repeated the words its not right larkin spoke softly its not right to leave one of us maybe we can oh shit blair murmured as the ground began to rumble the wind swirled up and light began to pulse slan mo cara with one last look at cian larkin gripped her hand its a hell of a ride he told her best hold on to me moira she held her crystal she spoke the words and she stared into cians eyes as she felt the world shift then she reached out grabbed his hand we are one force one power this is meant and pulled him into the circle i t was like being sucked into a tornado blair thought impossible wind that seemed to pull you away from the earth spin you in mad circles while the light blasted your eyes would there be munchkins on the other side she could see nothing but that wild white light the spinning whirl of it could find no footing no solid ground so anchored herself with larkins hand then there was dark and utter stillness she rubbed her hand over her face tried to catch her breath and she saw now there was moonlight silver streams of it that speared down and struck the standing stones is this our stop oh my god glennas voice was giddy what a rush what awow and cian putting both her trembling hands on either side of cians face she kissed him soundly how did you do it she asked moira how did you bring him inside i dont know i justit was meant you were meant to be here she said to cian i felt it and moira seemed to realize she was still clutching his hand and pulled hers away and well here you are she pushed at hair that had come loose from its braid well then fàilte a geall larkin she made a laughing leap into his arms were home and handily enough its night if cian was shaken he hid it well merely glancing around him as he shoved back his hood not that i dont trust your magical powers theres still the matter of getting ourselves and all this stuff where were going blair gestured widely to encompass the chests the weapons and cases we can send men for most of it in the morning i think we carry what we need most moira suggested weapons then we dont know what were walking into sorry blair added but youve been gone well over a month we cant know i can carry three take the air larkin tugged moiras disordered braid i could see if theres anything to worry about and you can take one on the horse my horse cian reminded him before he looked at moira i can take you on my horse sounds like a plan lets get it in motion blair slung on her own duffle then grinned at hoyt and glenna you guys are going to love this across geall they flew with the stallion and its two riders galloping below as the moonlight dripped like magic hills and wedges of forest were edged with silver the river gleamed on its wandering journey through them blair saw cottages with thin smoke spiraling from chimneys the dots that were cattle or sheep lolling in fields the roads below were narrow and dirt and empty of travelers but for cian and moira no cars she thought no lights but for the occasional glimmer that might have been a candle or lantern just land she realized left to roll and spread and rise to the silhouettes of mountains a land she reminded herself that until a few weeks ago shed believed a fairy tale she turned her head saw the coast with its high steep cliffs that flowed down to graceful inlets the sea spread out velvet black and cupped a trio of rough little islands on its journey to the horizon she heard glenna give a quick gasp behind her and looked over again the fantasy rose from the high hill a wide curl of river at its back its stones gleamed like jewels in the moonlight rising up into towers and turrets stretching out into crenelated walls a castle blair thought dumbfounded and what castle would be complete without a drawbridge or peaked caps on towers that held silky white flags a claddaugh on one she noted as they waved in the breeze a dragon on the other glenna leaned forward to speak in her ear a hell of a lot to take in for a couple of twentyfirstcentury girls i thought nothing was going to surprise me there was wonder in her voice blair could hear it herself but wow a freaking castle larkin circled it so they could keep the horse and riders in view below then he glided down to a wide courtyard instantly blair found herself surrounded by men in light armor swords already drawn she held her hands up in plain sight as she and her companions slid to the ground your name and your purpose one of the guards stepped forward larkin shed the dragon thats hardly a warm welcome tynan larkin the guard sheathed his sword then grabbed larkin in a onearmed hug thank the gods where the devil have you been all these weeks wed all but given up on you and the princess where open the gates the princess moira is waiting to come home you heard lord larkin tynan snapped he lacked an inch or two of larkins height but his voice boomed with command raise the gate you must tell all your father will want to be waked theres much to tell wake the cook while youre about it give welcome to my friends the warrior blair glenna the witch hoyt the sorcerer weve traveled far today tynan farther than you can know he turned reaching up to lift moira down from the horse the men bowed blair noted when moiras feet touched the ground tynan your face is a welcome sight she kissed his cheek this is cian and this fine fellow is his vlad would you have one of the men take him to the stables see hes housed and tended me or the horse cian murmured but she pretended not to hear have my uncle told weve come home and we wait upon him in the family parlor at once highness moira led the way through the courtyard toward a wide archway the doors were already open for them nice summer house youve got here blair murmured lord larkin he shot her a grin tisnt much but its home in truth my own family home isnt far from here my father would be acting as ruler until moira is crowned if its meant moira said over her shoulder if its meant he agreed torches were being lit in the great hall so blair assumed word of the return was already spreading in the floor fashioned of some sort of tile the two symbols from the flag here inlaid so that the claddaugh seemed to float over the dragons head they flew again in the glass dome curved into the high ceiling she had the impression of heavy furnishings of colorful tapestries caught the scent of roses as they started up a curve of stairs the castle has stood more than twelve hundred years larkin told her built here at the order of the gods on this rise known as rioga royal all who have ruled geall since have ruled from here blair glanced back at glenna makes the white house look like a hovel blair wouldnt have called the room they entered any sort of parlor it was huge and highceilinged backed by a hearth tall and wide enough for five men to stand in the fire already roared inside and over it was a mantel of lapis blue marble overhead a mural depicted what she assumed were scenes of geallian history there were several long low seats with jeweltoned fabrics chairs with high ornate backs stood at a long table where servants were already placing tankards and goblets bowls of apples and pears plates of cheese and bread paintings and tapestries covered the walls while patterned rugs spread over the floor candles flamed in chandeliers in tall stands in silver candleabras one of the servants a curvy one with a long spill of gold hair curtseyed in front of moira my lady we thank the gods for your return and yours my lord there was a glint in her eye when she looked at larkin that had blairs eyebrows raising isleen im happy to see you moira took both her hands your mother is well she is my lady already weeping with joy will you tell her ill see her soon and we need chambers prepared for our guests moira took her aside to explain what she wanted larkin was already heading for the table and the food he broke off a hunk of bread hacked off a wide chunk of cheese then mashed them together ah this tastes like home he said with his mouth full here now blair have some of this before she could object he was stuffing some in her mouth good she managed good why its brilliant as starshine and whats this he lifted a tankard wine it is glenna youll have some wont you boy wont i little changes came a voice from the wide doorway the man who stood there tall well built his dark hair liberally threaded with gray stared at larkin surrounded by food and pretty women da they met halfway across the room and with bear hugs blair could see the mans face the emotion that held it then she could see larkin in the eyes of tawny gold the man caught larkins face in his big hands gave his son a hard kiss on the mouth i didnt wake your mother i wanted to be sure before i lifted her hopes ill go to her as soon as i can youre well you look well a bit tired sleep hasnt come easy these past weeks youre injured its not to worry i promise no its not to worry youre home he turned and he smiled and again blair saw larkin in him moira sir then her breath hitched and she was running to him her arms clamped around his neck as he lifted her off the ground im sorry im sorry i took him from you im sorry i worried you so youre back now arent you safe and whole and you bring guests he set moira back on her feet youre welcome here this is larkins father and the brother of my mother prince riddock sir i would present my friends to you the best ive ever known as moira introduced them larkin stood behind his fathers back signalling the others that they should bow or curtsey blair went with the bow feeling foolish enough theres so much to tell you moira began if we could sit larkin the doors please we should be private riddock listened interrupting occasionally to ask moira to repeat or expand now and then he directed a question to his son or to one of the others blair could almost see the weight of the words press down on his shoulders and the grim determination with which he bore it there have been other attacks at least six since riddock hesitated briefly since you left us i did what i could to heed what you wrote to me moira to warn the people to stay in their homes after sunset to not welcome strangers in the dark but habits and traditions die hard as did those who followed them these weeks riddock studied cian across the long table you say we must trust this one though he is one of them a demon inside a man trust is a large word idly cian peeled an apple tolerate might be smaller and more easily swallowed he fought with us larkin began bled with us he is my brother if he isnt to be trusted hoyt said flatly neither am i nor any of us glenna finished youve banded together these weeks this is to be understood riddock took a small sip of his wine as his gaze remained watchful on cian but to believe a demon could and would stand against his own kind to tolerate such a thing is more than a swallow cian only continued to peel his apple even as hoyt started to his feet uncle moira laid a hand over riddocks i would be dead if not for him but beyond that he stood with us within the dance of the gods traveled here by their hands chosen by them will you question their will every thinking man questions but i will abide by the will of the gods others may find it more difficult the people of geall will follow your orders sir and your lead mine he turned to her the sword waits for you moira as does the crown they will wait awhile longer ive only just come home and theres much to be done much more important matters than ceremony ceremony you speak of the will of the gods one moment and dismiss it the next not dismiss only ask that it waits you have the trust and the confidence of the people im untried i dont feel ready not in my heart or in mind her eyes were grave as they searched her uncles face awhile longer please i may not be the one to lift the sword but if i am i need to know im ready to carry it geall needs and deserves a ruler of strength and confidence i wont give it less well talk further on it now youre weary you must all be weary and a mother waits to see her son riddock got to his feet well speak more in the morning and well do all that needs to be done in the coming days larkin he rose at his fathers bidding i wish you good night larkin said to the others and soft dreams on your first night in geall he looked briefly at blair then followed his father from the room your uncles an imposing man blair commented and a good one with him well raise an army that will send lilith back to hell if youre ready ill show you to your chambers i t was a little hard to settle down and sleep blair decided when she was spending the night in a castle and in a room that was suited to royalty before theyd arrived shed been expecting something a little more dark ages she supposed tough stone fortress on a windy hill smoky torches mud animal droppings instead she got something closer to cinderellas castle instead of a cramped room something like a barracks with rushes whatever they were exactly on the floor and a lumpy cot she had a spacious chamber with whitewashed walls the bed was big soft and draped in a blue velvet canopy the thick rug had images of peacocks worked into its soft wool a check out the windows showed her she looked down on a garden with a pretty spurting fountain the window seat was padded with more velvet there was a small writing desk pretty she thought not that shed be making much use of the crystal inkwell or the quill the fire was simmering and its surround was blueveined white marble it was all so fine she could nearly overlook the lack of modern plumbing the closest the place came to it was the chamber pot tucked behind a painted screen she had a feeling shed be making use of the great outdoors in that area quite a bit she stripped down to her underwear and used the basin of water provided to clean the scratches on her leg before dabbing on some of the balm glenna had given her she wondered how the others were doing she wished it were morning so she could be doing when the door opened she picked up the dagger shed set beside the basin then put it down again when larkin stepped in didnt hear you knock i didnt i thought you might be sleeping he closed the door quietly behind him took a quick scan of the room does this suit you then the room its rock star feel a little weird thats all like i walked into a book i understand that as i felt the same not long ago your wounds do they trouble you theyre nothing yours my mother fussed over them that made her happy as did weeping all over me shes anxious to meet you all of you i guess awkward blair thought why was it all so awkward i ah it never really computed before you being royalty oh well thats not much to do with me really its more ceremonial than anything honorary you could say he cocked his head as he moved toward her did you think i wouldnt come to you tonight i dont know what i thought its all pretty confusing confused are you a smile flirted around his mouth i dont mind that ill just confuse you a bit more seduce you he traced his finger along the edge of her tank just teasing the skin you spend a lot of time on seductions say working that on the blonde with the breasts what was her name isleen flirtation all in good fun never seduction its not proper or fair to take advantage of one who serves you he leaned to her brushed his lips over her shoulder nudged the strap down and while i might have dallied in the past you werent here for its the gods truth theres not another woman in geall to compare to you he brought his lips to hers just to nibble blair murphy he murmured warrior and beauty he played his hands down her back deepening the kiss just a little then just a little more and when his lips cruised over her face along her throat he all but crooned to her in gaelic the sound of it the feel of him nearly had her eyes rolling back in her head i keep thinking this is a mistake but it feels so damn good not a mistake he caught her chin with his teeth while his thumbs slid up circled her nipples not at all part of the journey she told herself as she melted into him theyd take something good something strong for themselves along the way so she met his lips with hers now sank herself into him the warm solid flesh there was sweetness in those easy strokes of his hands and a shivering thrill whenever they found her secrets when he lifted her into his arms she didnt feel like a warrior she felt conquered i want you she pressed her face into the curve of his throat as he lay her on the bed and just breathed him in how can i want you so much its meant he lifted her hand kissed the cup of her palm ssh he said before she could speak just feel for tonight lets both of us just feel she could be so soft he thought so pliant so giving in surrender she made him feel like a king those eyes the drowning blue watched him as they moved together they blurred with pleasure as he touched her tasted her those hands so firm on the hilt of a sword trembled a little when she drew his shirt aside to find him her lips pressed against his chest against the heart that was already lost to her they took each other slowly quietly while the firelight shimmered over their bodies there were murmurs and sighs instead of words and a long lazy climb instead of the frantic race when he slipped inside her he watched her face watched her as they moved together as everything in him gathered for that final leap he watched her still and at the end of it he thought hed simply fallen into her eyes chapter t he guy was a snuggler he just curved in body to body with an arm hooked around her waist the way she imagined a kid might hold on to a teddy bear blair just wasnt used to having someone hang on to her at night and couldnt decide if she liked it or not on one hand it was sort of sweet and sexy to wake up with him wrapped all over her everything was all warm and soft and cozy on the other if she had to move fast get to a stake or a sword he was dead weight maybe she should practice breaking loose rolling out reaching the closest weapon and maybe she should relax it wasnt as if this was a permanent situation it was justconvenient and that was a stupid attitude sunk in bullshit she admitted if she couldnt be honest inside her own head her own heart then where they were more than a convenience to each other more than compatriots more she was afraid than lovers at least on her side still in the light of day she had to be realistic whatever it was they were to each other it couldnt go anywhere not beyond this cian had spoken the pure truth in ireland outside of the dance the problems they faced were a lot bigger and more important than one person or their personal needs and wishes and so their personal needs had to be by definition temporary after samhain it would be over she had to believe theyd win that was essential but after the victory dance the backslapping and champagne toasts there would be hard facts to face larkin lord larkin was a man of geall once this was done and shed completed the mission geall would be for her in a very real sense a fairy tale again sure maybe she could hang around for a few days have that picnic hed talked about bask a little but in the end shed have to go she had a birthright she had a duty she thought as she touched her fingers to morrigans cross turning her back on it wasnt an option love if thats what she was feeling wasnt enough to win the day who knew better he was more than shed ever expected to have even in the short term so she couldnt and wouldnt complain about her luck or her destiny or the cold will of gods he accepted her cared for her desired her he had courage a bonedeep loyalty and a sense of fun shed never been with a man who possessed all that and who still looked at her as if she were special she thought maybe it wasnt impossible he loved her for her larkin was a kind of personal miracle he would never walk away from her without a backward glance he would never shove her aside simply because of what she was so when they parted there could be no regrets if things were different they might have been able to make a go of it at least give it a good solid try but things werent different or more accurately things were too different so theyd have a few weeks theyd have the journey and theyd both take something memorable away from it she kissed him a soft and warm press of lips then she poked him wake up his hand slid down her back to rub lazily over her ass not that way s the best way feel how firm you are smooth and firm i dreamed i was making love with you in an orchard in the high days of summer for you always smell of tart green apples makes me want to take a good bite of you eat enough green apples you get a bellyache my bellys iron his fingers trailed up and down the back of her thigh in the dream there was no one but us two and the trees ladened with fruit under a sky painted the purest of blues his voice was all sleepy and slurry she thought sexy like paradise adam and eve an apple got them in big bad trouble if memory serves he only smiled hed yet to open his eyes you look on the dark side of things but i dont mind that in the dream i gave you such pleasure you wept from the joy of it she snorted yeah in your dreams and sobbed my name again and again begging me to take you use this body you pleaded take it with your strong hands with your skilled mouth pierce it with your mighty okay youre making that up he opened one eye and there was such laughter in it her belly quivered in response well yes but im enjoying it and see there youre smiling thats what i wanted to see when i opened my eyes blairs smile tenderness swamped her youre such a goof she murmured and rubbed her hand over his cheek the first part of the dream was true we should look for the orchard one day he closed his eyes again started to snuggle in hold on there shuteyes over we have to get started in a hurry are you well all right then he rolled onto her i didnt mean and slipped into her the pleasure was so deep so easy that her breath caught even as she laughed i shouldve known your mighty would be up and ready and always at your service a fter a later start than shed planned she pulled on clothes we need to talk about some basics well break our fast in the little dining hall ive never known you to have a fast to break and i wasnt talking about food oh he looked mildly interested as he belted his tunic what else then to get really basic bathroom facilities elimination hygiene the chamber pot deals okay for emergencies but im going to have a problem with it on a regular basis ah brows knit he scratched his head over it there are toilets of sorts in the family wing and latrines for the castle guards but theyre not what youd be used to ill make do bathing the shower he said it wistfully i miss it already i can have a tub brought up and water heated or theres the river okay thats a start she didnt need plush blair thought she just needed well reasonable now we have to talk about training lets talk about it over food he took her arm pulling her from the room so she wouldnt argue while his stomach was rumbling t here were spiced apples larkin seemed particularly fond of and chunks of potatoes fried in she assumed the fat of the thick slices of ham that accompanied them the tea was black as pitch and nearly had the same kick as coffee i miss the coke as well he commented going to have to suck that one up while the room was smaller than the parlor had been it was still large enough to fit the big oak table a couple of enormous servers and chests she imagined held linens and dishware does a drawbridge work like a door she wondered to keep them out she explained when larkin gave her a questioning smile do they need an invitation to come into the castle compound wed better deal with that cover our ass hoyt and glenna should be able to come up with something we have a few days if lilith sticks to the schedule either way weve got our work cut out for us organizing getting civilians transported from the battle area hoyt and glenna might want to try that vampfreezone spell but i have to say i dont see it working were not talking about one house or even a small settlement she shook her head as she ate too much area too many variables and most likely a waste of their time and energies that may be moving people to safety is more important my father and i spoke of it last night before i came to you even now runners are out so the word spreads good were going to need to put most of our focus on training the troops youve got guards and knights maybe aye they have your basic combat skills but this is a different matter then your general population needs to be prepared to defend themselves we need to get to work on setting those traps and im going to want a firsthand look at the battleground itself her mind clicked off its list while she plowed through breakfast were going to need to set up multiple training areas military and civilian then theres weapons supplies transportation we probably need an area where hoyt and glenna can work it will all be seen to something in his tone the calmness of it reminded her this was his ground now he knew it and its people she didnt i dont know the pecking order the chain of command she said whos in charge of what he poured them both more tea for a moment he thought how nice it was even if the talk was of war to sit just the two of them over the morning meal until the sword is drawn from the stone my father rules as the head of the first family of geall he isnt king he will not be king but moira i think understands that the menthe military as you call it trust him theyll follow the ruler the one whose hand lifts the sword but this is giving them time its letting them follow orders and absorb the idea of this war from a man whos been proven to them i get it moiras smart to wait a little longer to take command she is yes shes also afraid that she wont be the one to lift the sword he shook his head that she will that shell be the queen who must order her people to war to shed their blood cause their deaths it haunts her its lilith who sheds their blood causes their death and it will be moira who tells them to fight the farmers and the shopkeepers the tinkers and the cooks for generations geall has been ruled in peace shell be the first to change that it weighs on her it should it should never be easy to send a world to war larkin what if its not her what if shes not the one through destiny or just because she doesnt have it in her to pull that sword out of stone she was the queens only child theres no other in her line so lines can shift theres you bite your tongue when she didnt smile he sighed there would be me my brother my sister my sisters children the oldest is but four my brother hes hardly more than a boy himself and its the land that calls to him my sister wants nothing more than to tend her babies and her home they could never do this thing i cant believe the gods would put this into their hands but yours he met her eyes ive never wanted it to rule war or peace people would follow you they know you and they trust you that may be and if it comes to it what choice would i have but the crown isnt my wish blair nor was it his destiny of that he was sure he reached over took her hand you must know what i wish wishes dreams we dont always get what we ask for so we have to take what there is and whats in your heart in mine i want im sorry moira stopped at the doorway im sorry to disturb you but my uncle has spoken to the guards and to the inner circle of knights youre to come to the great hall then wed better get started blair said s he felt underdressed in jeans and a black sweater for the first time since blair had met her moira wore a dress a gown whatever the term it was simple and elegant in a kind of russet tone that fell straight down her body from a high gathered waist her silver cross hung between her breasts and a thin circlet of gold sat on her head even glenna seemed polished up but then again her favorite witch had a way of giving a casual shirt and pants an air of style and grace the cavernous room was heated by fires on either side and fronted by a wide platform up two steps where a deep red carpet ran on it stood a throne an actual throne blair mused in regal red and gold riddock sat on it now with moira standing at his side to the other side sat a woman her blond hair was bound back in what blair thought was called a snood a younger woman obviously pregnant sat beside her two men stood at their backs the first family of geall blair decided larkins family and at a glance from his father he touched blairs arm murmured itll be fine then he left her to go up the steps and stand between his parents please riddock gestured take your ease he waited until theyd taken chairs at the base of the platform moira and i have talked at length at her request i have spoken to the guards and many of the knights to tell them of the threat and the coming war it is moiras wish that you and the other who came with you be given the authority of command to recruit to train to forge our army he paused studied them you are not geallian sir larkin objected they are proven this war is brought to our soil and it will be paid in our blood i ask why those from outside should lead our people may i speak hoyt got to his feet waited until riddock nodded morrigan herself has sent us here just as she sent two geallians to ireland to us so that we would gather into the first circle we who have come here have left our worlds and our families and have pledged our lives to fight this pestilence that comes to geall this pestilence murdered our queen my sister before ever you came riddock gestured toward them you are two women a demon and a man of magic and you are strangers to me i have seasoned men who are proven to me men whose names i know whose families i know men who know geall and are unquestioned in loyalty men who i know will lead our people strong into battle where theyll be slaughtered like lambs though riddocks stare at the interruption was frigid blair pushed to her feet sorry but thats the way it is we can dance around it play protocol waste time but the fact is your seasoned warriors dont know squat about fighting vampires when hoyt laid a hand on blairs arm she shook it off testily and i didnt come here to be shuffled aside because i wasnt born here or because im a woman and i didnt come here to fight for geall i came here to fight for it all well said glenna murmured and ditto my husband is accustomed to matters of court and princes were not so youll have to forgive us mere women mere women of power she held out a hand and a ball of fire then flicked the ball into the hearth on the side of the room testily mere women who have fought and bled and watched friends die and the demon you spoke of is my family hes also fought and bled and watched a friend die warriors you may be riddock acknowledged with what could only be termed a regal nod but to lead takes more than magic and courage it takes experience a cool head and cold blood riddock glanced back to blair with a slight lift of eyebrows these aye and the trust of the people you would lead they have mine larkin said they have moiras earned every hour of every day these past weeks sir have i not earned yours you have he said nothing for a moment then again gestured to hoyt glenna and blair i would ask that you instruct and that you take your commands from lord larkin and the princess moira we can start with that blair decided will you fight she asked riddock now the look in his eye had a kinship with a wolf to the last breath then youre going to need instruction too or that last breaths going to come sooner than you think larkin cast his eyes heavenward but laid a hand on his fathers shoulder and spoke lightly blair has a warriors spirit and an unruly tongue the gaming area then riddock decided for our first instructions y our father doesnt like me thats not so larkin gave blair a friendly elbow nudge hes merely working his way around to understanding you and all of this uhhuh she looked at glenna as they walked outside do you think we should tell riddock how our people felt about kings i think we could let that one alone but running up against what we did in there makes me realize its not going to be a snap convincing a bunch of macho geallian men that women should teach them how to fight a war ive got some thoughts on that and i think you should work with the women anyway excuse me dont get a wedgie you have more diplomacy and patience than i do probably blair thought anyone did and the women will probably relate better to you they have to be trained too glenna to defend themselves their families to fight someone has to do it and someone has to know which ones should stay home and which ones should go oh god were going to have the same deal with men the ones who dont measure up have to be put to other use treating the injured protecting the kids the elderly supplying food weapons and what do you suggest i do cian do hoyt asked while the two of you are so busy his nose is out of joint because we mouthed off to riddock glenna murmured my nose is fine and well thanks all the same hoyt spoke with unwavering dignity he needed to be told though there could have been considerably more tact if we offended him it only takes more time and effort to repair the damage hes a reasonable man larkin insisted he wouldnt let a few breaches of protocol interfere with what needs doing frustrated himself larkin raked a hand through his hair he hasnt been in a position to rule before this the queen was crowned very young and hes had only the position as an adviser now and then hed have to be a fast learner blair thought men were already gathered in what blair saw was an area they held their jousts their tournaments and games there was a long rope where colored hoops hung scoreboard she decided and the royal box the rougher seats for the masses paddocks for horses tents where competitors readied themselves for whatever sport was on the ticket you ever see that movie knights tale blair muttered we will we will rock you glenna responded and made blair grin sure helps having you here coming up on show time pick out one you figure you can take what why what both of you blair said adding hoyt just in case larkin stepped up to the lines of men my father has told you what it is we face and what is coming we have until samhain to prepare and on that day we must be in the valley of silence to do battle we must win to win you must know how to fight and how to kill these things that are not human they are not men and cannot be killed as men can be killed hanging back as larkin spoke blair studied the men most of them looked fit and able she spotted tynan the guard both larkin and moira had greeted on arrival he blair decided looked not only fit and able he looked ready i have fought them larkin continued as the princess moira has fought them as those who came with us from outside this world have fought them we will teach you what you need to know we know how to fight a man who stood beside tynan called out what can you teach me i havent taught you on this very field this wont be a game blair stepped forward this one was a big bruiser she noted looked cocky with it good strong shoulders tough built hard attitude perfect you wont get the consolation prize and a pat on the back if you come in second in this youll be dead his face didnt sneer at her but his tone did women dont instruct men on the art of combat they tend the fires and keep the bed warm he got some appreciative male laughter and a look of pity from larkin niall he said with cheer youve stepped full into the bog with that one these women are warriors i see no warriors here with his hands on his hips niall elbowed toward the front of the line but two women dressed as men and a sorcerer who stands with them or behind them ill go first blair murmured to glenna ill take you on she told niall here and now your choice of weapons he snorted do you expect me to spar with a girl choose your weapon riddock ordered sir at your command he was snickering as he strode away immediately the wagers began hey now larkin gave blair a quick pat on the shoulder moved into the men ill have some of that niall strode back with two thick fencing poles blair studied the way he held them the way he moved full swagger now this will be quick he assured blair yeah it will its a good choice of weapon she called out over the voices still calling out odds and wagers wood kills a vampire if you have the strength and the aim to get it through the heart you look strong enough she eyed niall up and down hows your aim he grinned wide ive not yet had a woman complain of it well lets see what you got big guy she gripped the pole lengthwise nodded ready ill give you the first three hits out of fairness fine she took him down in two ramming the end of the pole in his gut then sweeping down to crack it hard against his legs ignoring the laughter and whoops she stood over him the pole pressed to his heart now if you were a vampire id put this right through you till it came out the other side then youd be dust she stepped back i think you should hold your bets guys that was just practice she cocked her head at niall ready now he got to his feet and she saw the shock and embarrassment at being knocked down by a woman had lit a fire in him he came in hard the force of his pole against hers shooting up her arms she leaped up and over when he aimed for her legs then cracked her stick against his chest he fought well she decided and with a bullish strength but he lacked creativity she used her pole like a vault planting it in the ground swinging up over her opponent when she landed she spun a kick into the small of his back caught her pole and tripped him with it this time she held it to his throat as he panted for breath three out of five she suggested he let out a roar knocking at the pole she let his forward motion carry her back then pumped up with her feet to flip him over her and flat onto his back again his eyes were still dazed as she pressed the pole to his throat again the last fall had knocked the wind out of him and stolen the color from his cheeks i can do this all day and youll end up on your ass every time she got to her feet and now planted her pole beside him to lean negligently against it youre strong but so am i plus youre heavy in the feet and you werent thinking on them just because youre bigger doesnt mean youll win and it sure as hell doesnt mean youll live id say you got close to a hundred pounds on me but i knocked you flat three times the first didnt count niall sat up rubbed his sore head but ill give you the two when he grinned at her blair knew shed won larkin come take this pole niall called out ill fight you for her for this ones a woman for certain blair held out a hand hed beat you too i helped train him then youll teach me and them he jerked his chin toward hoyt and glenna can they fight like you im the best but theyre pretty damn good she turned to the group of men waited while money finished changing hands tynan she noted was one of the few besides larkin that collected any anyone else need a demonstration wouldnt mind one from the redhead someone called out and had more laughter rolling glenna fluttered her lashes added a coy smile then drew her dagger from its sheath and shot a line of fire from it men scrambled back en masse my husbands is bigger she said sweetly aye hoyt swept forward perhaps one of you would like a demonstration from me instead of my lovely wife sword lance he turned up his palms let the fire dance above them bare hands for i dont stand behind these women but im proud and honored to stand with them down boy blair murmured fires a weapon against them powerful weapon as is wood if used right steel will hurt them slow them down but it wont kill them unless you cut off the head theyll just keep coming until they rip out your throat she tossed her fencing pole to niall it wont be quick and clean like this little bout she told them it will be bloody and vicious and cruel beyond the telling of it many of them maybe most will be stronger and faster than you but youll stop them because if you dont they wont just kill you the soldiers who meet them in combat theyll kill your children your mothers those they dont kill theyll change theyll turn into what they are or enslave them for food for sport so youll stop them because theres no choice she paused because now there was silence now every eye there was on her were going to show you how chapter b lair debated between the river and the tub the river was very likely freezing and that would be a bitch but she just couldnt resign herself to having some servant haul up steaming buckets of water to pour them into what essentially would be a bigger bucket then after shed bathed theyd have to repeat the whole deal in reverse it was just too weird still after several hours working with a bunch of men she needed soap and water was that too much to ask you did very well moira fell into step beside her i know this must be frustrating for you like starting over and with men who feel in some ways they already know as much if not more than you but you did very well youve made a fine start most of those guys are in good to excellent shape and thats a plus but the bulk of them still think its a game for the most part just dont believe thats a big strike in the minus column because they havent seen they know of my mother but many still believe need to believe it was some sort of wild dog it might be if i hadnt seen myself what killed her i could refuse to believe it its easier to refuse refusing is one of the reasons jeremys dead now aye thats why i think people need to see need to believe we need to hunt down the ones that killed the queen the ones that have killed others since that night we need to bring at least one of them back here you want to take one alive i do moira remembered how cian had once pulled a vampire into the training room then stood back so the rest of them would have to fight it and understand it it will make a point not impossible to refuse whats in front of your face but harder blair thought it through quickly okay ill go out tonight not alone dont dont moira said wearily when blair started to argue youre used to hunting alone capable of hunting alone but you dont know the land here they will by now ill go with you youve got a point and a strong one but no youre not the one for this hunt im not saying youre not capable either but youre not the best when it comes to closein fighting itll have to be larkin and ill need cian in a gesture of annoyance moira tugged a blossom from a bush now you have the strong point i feel ive done nothing but matters of state since ive come home youve got my sympathy but i think that kind of thing has to be important too statesmen women people they raise armies youve already taken steps to move people out of whats going to be a war zone thats saving lives moira i know it i do but whos going to stir up the general population fire them up into putting their lives on the line well train them moira but youve got to get them to us youre right i know ill get you a vampire two if i can manage it you get me people i can teach to kill one but right now ive got to wash up a vamp could smell me a half a mile away ill have a bath readied for you in your chambers i was thinking id just use the river are you mad finally moiras face relaxed into a smile the rivers freezing this time of year i t was never comfortable for moira to speak with cian not just because of what he was as shed reconciled herself to that she thought of it when she thought of him as a condition a kind of disease at their first meeting he had saved her life and since had proven himself again and again his kind had murdered her mother and yet he had fought beside her had risked his life or more accurately his existence in doing so no she couldnt hold what he was against him still there was something inside her something she couldnt quite see clearly or study or understand whatever it was made her uneasy even nervy around him he knew it or sensed it she was sure for he was so much cooler to her than the others it was so rare that he would spare her a smile or an easy word after the attack on their way to geall hed swooped her up off the ground his arms were the arms of a man flesh and blood strong and real hold on hed said and that was all shed ridden with him to the castle and his body had been that of a man lean and hard and her heart had been raging for so many reasons shed been afraid to touch him what had he said to her then in that sharp impatient voice of his oh yes get a grip on me before you fall on your ass again i havent bitten you yet have i it had made her embarrassed and ashamed and grateful he couldnt see the color flame into her cheeks likely hed have had something cutting to say about her virginal blushes as well now she had to go to him to ask him for help it wasnt something she would pass off to blair or larkin certainly not to a servant it was her duty to face him to speak the words ask the boon she would ask him to leave the castle the comfort and safety of it and go out into a strange land to hunt one of his own and he would do it she knew already she knew he would do it not for her the request of a princess the favor of a friend he would do it for the others for the whole of it she went alone the women who attended her wouldnt approve of course and would consider the idea of their princess alone in a mans bedchamber unseemly even shocking such matters were no longer an issue for moira what would her ladies think if they knew shed once fed him blood when he was wounded she imagined they would shriek and hide their faces those who didnt swoon away but they would have to look straight on at such things very soon or face much worse her shoulders went tight as she stepped to the door of his chamber but she knocked briskly then stood to wait when he opened the door the lights from the corridor washed over his face and plunged the rest into shadow she saw the faintest flicker of surprise come and go in his eyes as he studied her well look at you i barely recognized you your highness it reminded her she was wearing a dress and the gold mitre of her office and remembering she felt foolishly exposed there were matters of state to attend to im expected to attire myself appropriately and fetchingly too he leaned lazily on the door is my presence required yes no why did he forever make her clumsy may i come in i would speak with you by all means she had to brush against him to step inside the room was like midnight she thought not a single candle lit nor the fire and the drapes were pulled tight at the windows the suns gone down yes i know would you mind if we had some light she picked up the tinderbox fumbling a bit i cant see so well as you in the dark the quick flare of light did quite a bit to calm her jumping stomach theres a chill she continued lighting more candles should i light the fire for you suit yourself he said nothing while she knelt in front of the hearth set the turf but she knew he watched her and his watching made her hands feel cold and stiff are you comfortable here she began the room isnt so large or grand as youre used to and separate enough from the general population so they can be comfortable stunned she turned kneeling still while the turf caught flame at her back she didnt flush instead her cheeks went very pale oh but no i never meant its no matter he picked up a glass hed obviously poured before shed come in and now he drank deliberately of the blood with his eyes on hers i imagine your people would be put off by some of my daily habits distress hitched into her voice it was never a concern the room it faces north i thoughti only thought there would be less direct sun and youd be more comfortable i would never insult a guest a friend i wouldnt insult someone who welcomed me into their home when they have come to mine she got quickly to her feet i can have your things moved right away i he held up a hand theres no need and i apologize for assuming it was rare for him to feel the discomfort of guilt but he felt it now its a considerate choice i shouldnt have expected less why are wei dont understand why we seem to be so often at odds dont you he murmured well thats likely for the best so to what do i owe the honor of your presence you make fun of me she said quietly youre so hard when you speak to me she thought he sighed just a little im in a mood i dont rest well in unfamiliar places im sorry and im here to impose again ive asked blair to hunt the vampires now in geall to bring at least one of them back here alive contradiction in terms i dont know how else to express it she snapped my people will fight because its asked of them but i cant ask them to believe cant make them believe what seems impossible so they need to be shown it would be a good queen he thought who didnt expect to be followed blindly and see how she stood there now he noted so still so serious when he knew a war raged inside of her you want me to go with her i do she does i do god i am forever stumbling with you she asked that you and larkin go with her she doesnt want me she feels and so do i that im of more use gathering the forces helping lay the traps she devised ruling i dont rule yet your choice aye for now id be grateful if you would go with her and larkin if you can find a way to bring back a prisoner id rather be doing than not but theres the matter of knowing where to look i have a map ive already spoken with my uncle and know where the attacks the known attacks took place larkin knows the land of geall you can have no better guide and you know you can have no better companion in leisure or in battle ive no problem with the boy or with a hunt then as soon as youre ready if youd come to the outer courtyard i can have someone show you the way i remember the way well ill go see to your mounts and provisions she went to the door but he was there before her without seeming to have moved at all she looked up into his face thank you she said and slipped quickly out those eyes he thought as he shut the door behind her those long gray eyes could kill a man it was lucky he was already dead but he could do nothing about the scent shed left behind her the scent of woodland glades and cool spring water not a bloody thing he could do about that w ell be watching glenna laid a hand on blairs leg when blair mounted her horse if you get into trouble well know well do what we can to help dont worry ive got thirteen years of this under my belt not in geall glenna thought but she stepped back good hunting they rode through the gates and turned south it was a good night for it blair thought clear and cool it would be easier to track them by night when they were active than by day when they would have gone to nest somewhere in any case she wouldnt have cian which she considered an advantage if they hunted by day she rode between the two men at an easy trot i didnt want to ask moira she began but her mother was the first attack reported aye the queen was the first death we know of and there were no other attacks that night no one taken no larkin shook his head again that we know of targetspecific then blair mused they came for moiras mother we assume we dont know how they got in ive thought of it larkin admitted before the queens death there would have been no reason to stop someone from coming in a wagon of supplies perhaps or any reasonable bit of business they would have been passed through plays blair nodded after a moment come in shortly after sundown stay in a bolt hole until everyone settles in for the night lure the queen outside kill her she glanced at larkin we dont have more specifics moira wont speak of it really im not sure she remembers the details of it maybe it doesnt matter for our purposes so they kill the queen then they stay maybe they cant get back through except at specific times but they dont rampage she pointed out a handful of deaths in all these weeks thats pretty low profile for the breed there will have been more cian commented travelers whores those not as quickly missed as others but theyve been careful and avoided what were doing now the hunt i dont think theyre only hiding from us who then larkin glanced over and saw blair was studying cian thoughtfully he means lilith you think theyre trying to stay off her radar why because it could be youre only half right in your theory targetspecific yes cian agreed but i doubt the target was the queen its moira who was chosen as a link in the first circle moira there was alarm in larkins voice as he swiveled in the saddle to look back at the castle growing smaller with distance if they tried to kill her once theyve tried to kill all of us more than once cian pointed out without success shes as safe as she can be where she is blair outlined it in her mind youre thinking lilith tried an endrun take one of us out before she was essentially one of us its a possibility a strong one why waste the time and what must have been some effort to send a couple of assassins here if youre going to buy in to the whole destiny business cian went on its moira and not moiras mother who was the threat they screwed up blair mused took out the wrong target so it may not be a matter of them not being able to get back but not wanting to lilith isnt particularly tolerant of mistakes having a choice of being tortured and ended by her or going to ground snacking on the locals here which would you do door number two blair said and if you buy in to the whole destiny business her first mistake was in turning you all those years ago youre a more formidable enemy as a vampire than you might be as a man no offense none taken then you get hoyt fired up and start the whole morrigans cross thing thoughtfully blair fingered the two crosses she wore around her neck youve got glenna connected to hoyt maybe if you want the romantic destined to find and love each other and by doing so exponentially increasing each others power youve got larkins connection to moira and due to it his coming with her through the dance and into ireland so makes a nice tidy circle cian concluded convoluted but thats gods for you she was meant to die the queen larkin took a steadying breath meant to die in moiras place if moira comes to this herself it will hurt her immeasurably with her clever and questing mind id be surprised if she wasnt already dealing with it and dealing with it is what shell do cian added what other choice is there larkin let it lie in his heart on his head as they crossed a field the next attack was here im told the man who farms this land thought wolves had been at his sheep it was his boy who found him next morning my father came here himself that day to see the body and it was as the queens had been blair shifted in the saddle about two miles due south of the castle no place to hide around here just open fields but a couple of experienced vamps could cover a couple of miles fairly quickly they can go in and out of the castle grounds as theyve had an invite but not a good place to nest cian agreed easy pickings certainly but too much exposure no it would be caves or deep forest why not a house or cabin larkin suggested if they chose with any care they could find one out of the way where its not as likely someone would come by possible cian told him but the trouble with a cottage a building is daylight attack your enemy has one more weapon against you and only has to pull a covering from a window to win the day all right then larkin gestured across the field the next two attacks reported were just east of here theres forest but the huntings good there are plenty who track deer and rabbit there and might disturb a vampires daytime rest you know that blair told him they may not have theyre strangers here its a good place to start they rode in silence for a time she could see sheep or cattle lolling in the fields more easy pickings if a vampire couldnt take down a human there were flickers of light she assumed were candles or lanterns in cottages she could smell the smoke the rich tang of peat rather than seasoned wood she smelled grass and animal dung a deeper loamy scent from fields planted and waiting for the coming harvest she could smell the horses and larkin and knew how to separate cians scent from others like him but when they came to the edge of a wood she couldnt be sure horses have been through here and not long ago she looked at larkin with eyebrows raised well listen to tonto here tracks he slid off his horse to study the ground not shoed gypsies likely though i dont see signs from a wagon and they travel that way theyre leading out in any case how many it would be two two horses coming out of the woods here to cross the field can you follow them in she asked him see where they came from i can he mounted if theyre on horseback they could cover considerable distance it would take the gods own luck for us to track them down in one night we backtrack the riders here see what we see the other attacks were east right straight through these woods out the other side aye another three miles at most this would be a good hub she looked at cian as she spoke if they have decent shelter in here its a good spot to nest during the day spread out for food at night leaves are still thick this time of year he agreed and thered be small game as well if they needed to make do larkin took the lead following the trail until the trees thickened to block the light he dismounted again tracking now on foot by signs blair assumed she couldnt see then again shed done the majority of her hunting in urban forests and suburban trails but larkin moved with the confidence of a man who knew what he was doing pausing only to crouch down now and then studying the tracks more carefully wait she said abruptly just wait you get that she asked cian blood its not fresh and death older yet better get back on your horse larkin she told him i think weve got some of the gods luck after all we can track it from here i cant smell a thing but the woods you will she murmured and drew her sword from the sheath on her back as they walked the horses down the path the wagon was pulled into the trees off the path and sheltered by them it was a kind of small caravan blair thought covered in the back with its red paint faded and peeling and the smell of death seemed to soak it tinkers larkin told them and shed been right he could smell the death now gypsies who travel the roads selling whatever wares they might make the wagons harnessed for two horses a good nest blair decided mobile if you need it to be and you could drive around at night no one would pay any attention you could take it right into the village larkin said grimly drive it up to someones cottage and ask for hospitality in the normal course of things youd get it he thought of the children who might run outside to see if there would be toys for sale they could beg their parents to buy or trade for and the thought sickened him even more than the stench he dismounted with the others moved to the rear of the wagon where the doors were tightly shut and bolted from the outside they drew weapons blair slid the bolt free tested the door when it gave she nodded to her companions mentally counted to three then yanked it open the fetid air came first crawling into the throat pouring into the eyes she heard the hungry hum of flies and fought against the need to gag it leaped out at her the thing with the face of a pretty young woman whose eyes were red and mad the stink rolled off her where it was matted in her dark hair streaked over her homespun dress blair pivoted aside so it landed in the brush on its hands and knees snarling like the animal it had become it was larkin who swung his sword and ended it oh god sweet jesus she couldnt have been fourteen he wanted to sit just sit there on the ground while his belly heaved they changed her how many others unlikely more cian said cutting him off then theyd have to compete for food worry about keeping it under control she didnt come through with them larkin insisted she wasnt one of them before she was geallian and young pretty female food isnt the only need blair saw when the full impact of cians words hit larkin she saw not just by the shock but the sheer outrage on his face bastards bloody fucking bastards she was hardly more than a child and this surprises you because he whirled on cian and would blair was sure have vented some of that horror and outrage perhaps cian was giving him a target for it but there wasnt time for indulgences she simply stepped between them and shoved larkin back a full three paces close it down she ordered him just settle it down how can i how can you because you cant bring her back or the ones that are in there she jerked a chin toward the wagon so we figure out how to use this to capture the ones who did it burying her own revulsion she pulled herself up into the wagon into a nightmare what must have been the girls parents were shoved together under a kind of bunk on one side of the wagon the man had probably died quickly as had the younger boy whose body lay under the bunk on the opposite side but the woman theyd have taken more time there no point in tearing off her clothes if you didnt intend to play with her first her hands were still bound and what was left of her was covered in bites yes theyd taken time with her she could see no weapons but one of the bunks was stained with blood fresher than what was staining the other bunk the floor and the walls that was where the girl had died she assumed and had waked again the womans only been dead a couple of days cian said from behind her the man and boy longer a day or more longer yeah jesus she had to get out had to breathe she climbed out of the back to draw in air she hoped would clear the smear in her throat in her lungs theyll come back for her she bent over bracing her hands on her thighs so the nausea the dizziness would fade bring her something so she can feed she was new probably only woke tonight we need to bury them larkin said the others they deserve to be buried it has to wait look be pissed at me if you have to but im not im sick in my heart but im not angry with you or you he said to cian i dont know why it should be this way inside me i saw what was in the caves back in ireland i know how they kill how they breed but knowing they made a monster of that girl only so they could use her between them it makes my heart sick she didnt have any words any real ones to offer she wrapped her fingers around his arm squeezed lets make them pay for it theyll be back before sunrise well before if they can find what theyre after quickly enough and get it back they know shell have risen tonight and need to feed thats why they thats why they left the bodies inside larkin said when she cut herself off so shed have something until they could bring her fresh blood im not slowwitted blair they left her own family for her to feed on nodding she looked back toward the wagon so we close up the wagon and we wait will they be able to smell us the human hard to say cian told her i dont know how old they are how experienced enough so lilith thought they could handle this assignment which they bungled but its possible theyll catch the scent of live blood even through all this then theres the horses okay ive got that covered most likely theyll come back to the wagon from the same direction they left it well take the horses farther into the woods downwind tether them all but mine if im walking him when they see me theyll figure he came up lame and theyll be too happy with their luck of coming across a lone female to think beyond that so you think youre going to be bait larkin began with a look on his face that warned blair they were in for a fight about it ill just take the horses back while you two argue this out cian took the reins melted into the trees calm blair ordered herself reasonable she should remember it was nice to have someone who actually cared enough to worry about her if they see a man theyre more likely to attack a woman theyre going to want me alive temporarily gives them each a playmate its the most logical way that was the end of her calm and reasonable and heres what if your ego has a problem with the fact that if i were out here alone i could still handle two of them youll just have to deal with it my ego has nothing to do with the matter its just as logical for the three of us to lay back and wait then move on them as one no because if they scent either you or me we lose the element of surprise moira wants them or at least one of them alive thats why were out here instead of having a nice glass of wine in front of a roaring fire if we have to go full scale attack well probably have to kill them both surprise gives us a better chance of capture there are other ways probably a dozen of them but while they may not be back for five hours they could also be back in five minutes this will work larkin because its simple and its basic because they wouldnt expect a woman by herself to be any kind of threat i want to bag these two as much as you do lets make sure we do cian slipped back out of the trees have you settled it then or will we be debating this much longer it seems to be settled larkin brushed a hand over blairs hair ive just been wasting my breath then he tipped back her chin if you have to speak to them to hold the illusion until we move in theyll know youre not from geall sure you think i cant manage a bit of an accent she slathered on the brogue and gave him a wideeyed helpless look and give every appearance of being a defenseless female thats not altogether bad he lowered his lips to hers but for myself id never believe the defenseless part of it chapter a n hour passed then another then a third there was little for her to do but eat some of the bread and cheese moira had provided for them wash it down with the water in her bag at least larkin and cian had each other for company while all she had was her own head she frowned when that thought passed through she was used to hunting alone to waiting alone in dark quiet places strange it had only taken a matter of weeks for her to break that lifetime habit in any case the waiting was taking longer than shed hoped and blair hadnt factored in the boredom it made her think of her first night in ireland this time around and the luck fate of getting a flat on a dark lonely road thered been three vampires that time and the element of surprise had added to her advantage mostly vamps didnt expect to get clocked with a tire iron especially by a woman who was a hell of a lot stronger than theyd calculated they sure as hell hadnt expected her to pull out a stake and dust them these two if they ever got back wouldnt be expecting it either only she had to remember dusting them wasnt the mission a tough one to swallow for a bred in the blood demon hunter her father wouldnt approve of this little adventure she mused in his book you ended them period quickly efficiently no flourishes no conversation of course hed have done his best to end cian by now she decided family connection and will of the gods be damned he would never have worked with cian or fought beside him trained with him and one of them possibly both of them would be dead now maybe that was why shed been brought here instead of her father why she could admit now as she waited on the rutted forest path she hadnt told him about cian not that her father bothered to actually read her emails but still she hadnt brought up an allegiance to the undead in the ones shed sent him there simply were no allegiances in demon hunting not to her fathers mind it was you and the enemy black and white live and die only another reason shed never earned his approval she realized it wasnt only because she wasnt his son but because shed seen the gray and had questioned because like larkin she had felt more than once a pity and regret for the things she ended she knew what her father would say that an instant of pity or regret could mean an instant of hesitation and an instants hesitation could kill you hed be right she thought but not completely no not absolutely as there were shades of gray there too she could feel that pity and still do her job she had wasnt she standing here now alive and she damn well intended to stay alive she only wondered for the first time since jeremy if it was possible to have a life along with a heartbeat shed stopped letting herself wish or want or ask if she could have someone to love her now there was larkin and she believed he did or close enough to love to care for and want in time maybe it could be love the kind shed never had before the kind that crossed all the lines and accepted it was brutal she thought just brutal that there couldnt be enough time there just wasnt enough of the commodity to span entire worlds but when she went back to her own she would know there was someone who had looked at her had seen who and what she was and still had cared if she did make it back if they won this thing and the worlds kept spinning she would tell him what hed given her tell him that hed changed something inside her so much for the better but she wouldnt tell him she loved him words like that would only hurt them both she wouldnt tell him what she was finally able to admit to herself that she would always love him she felt the movement rather than saw it and turned toward it braced for attack but it was cian the shape and scent of him off the path and in the shadows heads up he murmured two riders starting into the woods theyre dragging a body behind them alive yet she nodded and thought curtain up she began to walk the horse slowly in the direction of the wagon so theyd come up behind her so it would seem she thought that shed ridden into the woods before her horse had come up lame she felt them first something that was beyond scent it was more a knowledge which covered all the senses but she waited until she heard the hoofbeats shed taken off her coat she didnt think geallian women walked around in black leather against the chill she wore one of larkins tunics belted snugly enough to show she had breasts her crosses were tucked under the cloth out of sight she looked like an unarmed woman hoping for some help she even called out as the sound of the horses grew closer making sure her voice was blurred with brogue and a little fear hello the riders im having a bit of trouble here ahead on the path the hoofbeats stopped oh yeah blair thought talk it over for a minute figure it out she called out again increasing the quaver in her voice are you there my horse picked up a stone im afraid im on my way to cillard they were coming again slowly and she fixed what she hoped was a mixture of relief and concern on her face well thank the gods she said when the horses came into view i thought id end up walking the rest of the way to my sisters and alone in the dark for all that which serves me right doesnt it for starting out so much later than i should one dismounted he looked strong blair judged solidly built when he pushed back the hood of his cloak she saw a tangle of white blond hair and a deep vshaped scar above his left eyebrow there was no sign of anyone being dragged behind the horses so she assumed theyd dropped their prey off for the moment youre traveling alone slavic she thought just the faintest of accents russian ukrainian maybe i am its not so very far and i meant to leave earlier in the day but one thing and another and now this she gestured to her horse im beal of the o dubhuir family would you be heading toward cillard by chance the second dismounted to hold the reins of both their horses its dangerous to be out in the woods alone in the dark i know them well enough but you you dont sound like you come from this part of geall she backed up a step as a frightened woman might are you a stranger to the area then you could say that and when he smiled his fangs glimmered she gave a little shriek decided such things couldnt be overplayed he laughed when he grabbed for her she brought her knee up hard between his legs then topped it off with a solid roundhouse when he went down to his knees she kicked him full in the face then planted her feet to meet the second attack the second wasnt as toughly built as the first but he was faster and hed drawn his sword blair flipped back landing on her hands to kick out at his sword arm it gave her time and a little distance when the first gained its feet larkin burst out of the woods lets see how you do against a man blair took the fast running steps she needed to give the flying kick momentum she hit the first midbody as larkin clashed swords with the other she grabbed her sword from its sheath on her saddle as all three of the horses shied instinct had her whirling bringing the blade up twohanded to block the down sweep of her enemys sword shed been right about his strength she discovered as the force of the blow rippled straight down to her toes because he had her in reach she went in close his advantage was she didnt want to kill him but he didnt know that she stomped hard on his instep brought the hilt of her sword up in a vicious blow to his chin the hit knocked him back into her mount all three horses whinnied in alarm as they scattered he just kept coming hacking and swinging until sweat rolled into her eyes she heard someone something scream but couldnt risk a look instead she feinted drawing his sword to the left then plowed her foot into his belly it took him down long enough for her to leap on him hold her sword across his throat move and youre dust larkin aye if youre done playing around with that one i could use a little help over here he stepped over then kicked the vampire in the head in the face several times yeah that ought to do it breathless she sat back on her haunches to look up at larkin blood was spattered over his shirt his face is much of that yours not a great deal of it it would be his for the most part he stepped back gestured so she could see the vampire hed skewered into the ground with a sword ouch she got to her feet we need to round up those horses get these two in chains and she trailed off as cian walked toward them leading the horses he glanced at the vampires bleeding on the path untidy he decided but effective this ones not in the best of shape he nodded toward the bleeding man slung over one of the horses but hes alive nice work she wondered not for the first time how hard it was for him to resist the smell of fresh human blood but it didnt seem like the time to ask wed better get these two contained this one wakes up hes trouble blair circled her aching shoulder that ones like a goddamn bull while the men chained the prisoners she examined the unconscious man he was bloodied and battered but unbitten going to take him back to the wagon she thought share him with the female have a little party we need to bury the dead larkin said to her we cant take the time now were not just leaving them listen just listen she gripped his hands before he could turn away that mans hurt and hurt bad he needs help as soon as we can get it for him or he might not make it then wed be digging another grave added to it we need to get cian back and inside before sunrise were going to be cutting it close as it is ill stay behind deal with it myself larkin we need you if we dont make good time cians going to have to go ahead or go to ground and that leaves me with two vampires and one wounded human i could handle it alone if i had to but i dont well send someone back to bury them ill come back with you and well do it ourselves if youd rather but we have to leave them for now we have to go he said nothing only nodded then strode to his horse hes taking the female he ended to heart cian murmured some are harder than others you have that cloak thing right in case i do but ill be frank and tell you id rather not risk my skin on it cant blame you if and when you have to ride ahead you ride she looked over where the two vampires were shackled gagged and tied across one of their horses we can handle them you could handle them on your own we both know that larkin shouldnt have to deal with whats back there in that wagon by himself she swung onto her horse lets get this done they rode in silence through the dark of the woods across the fields dappled with pale moonlight once just ahead a white owl swooped over a gentle rise with only the whisper of wings blair thought for an instant she saw the glitter of its eyes green as jewels then there was only the murmur of the wind through the high grass and the hushed silence of predawn she saw the vampire she fought lift its head when its eyes met hers she saw the blood lust and the fury but over them both she saw the fear he struggled against his chains eyes wheeling toward the east the one beside him lay weakly and blair thought the sounds he made behind his gag were sobs they feel dawn coming cian said from beside her the burn of it go larkin and i can handle it oh theres time yet a bit of time yet we should only be a couple miles out less larkin told her a bit less the wounded mans coming around some i wish he wouldnt the ride couldnt be doing him any good blair thought but they couldnt afford to keep it slow and smooth any longer the stars had faded out lets pick up the pace she kicked her horse into a gallop and hoped the man slumped over the horse she led would live another mile she saw the lights first the flicker of them candle and torch through the rising mists and there the silhouette of the castle high on the rise with its white flags waving against a sky that was no longer black but a deep dense blue go the vampires bucked and jerked making sounds far from human as the first streaks of red bled over the horizon behind the castle but cian rode straight in the saddle hair flying i so rarely see it from out of doors there was pain the rip and the burn of it and there was wonder and a faint regret as he galloped through the gates and into the shadow of the keep moira was there her face tight and pale go inside please your horse will be tended please she repeated the strain cutting through the word as cian slowly dismounted be quick she gestured for the men with her to take the prisoners got a handy dungeon blair asked her we dont no riddock watched the men drag the chained prisoners away arrangements have been made as moira requested theyll be held in the cellars and guarded leave the chains on them larkin ordered hoyt and glenna are waiting inside moira told him well add magic to the chains youre not to worry you need food and rest all of you this ones human and wounded blair stepped over laid her fingers on the pulse in the mans throat alive but he needs attention right away sir well send for the physician riddock signalled to some men see to him he ordered before turning to his son are you hurt no i have to go back there are some we had to leave back in the forest on the path to cillard larkins face was pale and it was set they need to be buried well send a party out i have a need to see to it myself then you will but come inside first you need to wash break your fast he slung an arm around larkins shoulders its been a long night for all of us inside cian stood speaking with hoyt and glenna he broke off when the others entered and lifted a brow at moira you have your prisoners what do you intend to do with them well speak of it all of it ive ordered food to the family parlor if we could meet there we have much to discuss she swept away with two of her women hurrying behind her blair went to her own room where a fire was lit and fresh water waited she washed away the blood changing the borrowed tunic for one of her own shirts then she braced her hands on the bureau and studied her face in the mirror shed looked better she decided she needed sleep but wasnt going to get it nor for a while yet shed have paid a lot for an hour in a bed but that wasnt in the cards any more than a couple days at a nice spa instead she was going to take half the day to ride back out bury three strangers there wasnt time for it not when she should have been working with the troops devising strategies checking on weapon production a dozen practical and necessary tasks but if she didnt go larkin would do it alone she couldnt let that happen he was already in the parlor when she walked in and he was alone by the window watching morning strike mist you think im wasting valuable time he said without turning around with something unnecessary and useless so he read her she thought and damn clearly it doesnt matter you need to do it so well do it families should be safe on the roads of geall young girls should not be raped and tortured and killed should not be turned into something that must be destroyed no they shouldnt youve lived with it longer than i and perhaps you can face it more callously no he turned now he looked older she thought in the hard light with the violence of the night still on him that wasnt the word and would never be one id use for you coolly perhaps practically for certain so you must i wont hold you to going with me because he wouldnt she knew she could do nothing else but go i said i would and i will yes you will so thanks for that can you understand that im stronger for knowing youll do this thing with me that youd understand my need to do it enough to take the time i think it takes a strong man to need to do whats human and humane thats enough for me theres so much i have to say to you so many things i want to say but today isnt the day i feel he looked down at his sword hand stained do you know what im saying yeah i know what youre saying ah well come well drink strong tea and wish it was coke he smiled a little as he walked to her then he laid his hands lightly on her shoulders pressed his lips to her brow you are so beautiful your eyes must really be tired he eased back i see you he told her exactly as you are he pulled her chair out for her something she couldnt remember him doing before as she sat hoyt and cian came in cian flicked a glance toward the windows then moved away from them to the table moira had had set away from the light glenna will be along hoyt said she wanted to check on the man you brought in the prisoners are secured he looked at his brother and very unhappy they havent fed cian poured his own tea the castle boasts a fine wine cellar which you didnt mention he said to larkin a corner of it is nicely dark and damp enough to keep them but unless your cousin simply intends to starve them to death theyll need to be fed if theyre chained in there above another day i have no intention of starving them moira came in she wore riding gear now with a feminine flare in forest green and neither will they be fed theyve had enough geallian blood animal and human my uncle and i will ride out shortly to rally the people and spread the word as many as can manage will come here by sundown and when the sun has set what is in the cellars will be shown to them then destroyed she looked directly at cian do you find that hard cold with no drop of human emotion or mercy no i find it practical and useful i hardly thought you had us hunt them down to bring them here for counseling and rehabilitation well show the people what they are and how they must be killed were sending troops out now to lay the traps you want blair larkin ive asked phelan to take charge of the task my sisters husband larkin explained aye hed be up for that you chose well the man you brought back is awake though the physician wishes to dose him glenna agrees he told us he went outside hearing what he thought was a fox in his henhouse they set upon him he has a wife and three children and shouted for them to stay in the house it was all he could do and we can thank the gods they obeyed were sending for them until larkin and blair return glenna and i can help with the training and cian perhaps hoyt added if theres somewhere inside thank you id hoped that would suit you ah we have the village smithy and two others forging weapons well have more but some who come will have their own arms youve got trees blair pointed out youre going to want to start making stakes out of some of them more arrows lances spears yes of course yes i need to go as my uncle and our party is waiting i want to thank you for your nights work well be back before sundown shes starting to look like a queen blair said when moira left worn out is what she looks blair nodded at larkin being a queens bound to be hard work add a war and its got to be brutal cian you okay to fill the others in on our party last night ive already given them the highlights ill fill in the details then why dont you and i get started she said to larkin she went to the stables with him where he gathered the tools theyd need i could fly us there quicker than we could ride would that suit you thatd be good he led the way around to the courtyard garden she recognized from her window the bags heavy hang it round my neck once ive changed he passed it to her became the dragon he dipped his head so that she could work the strap over it then she looked into his eyes stroked his jeweled cheek you sure are pretty she murmured he lowered so she could mount his back they were rising up above the towers the turrets over the waving white flags the morning was like a gem of blue and green and umber spreading around her she tipped her head back let the wind rush over her let it blow away the fatigue of the long night she saw horses below on the road now and carriages wagons people walking the little village shed yet to explore was a spread of pretty buildings bright colors busy stalls the people who looked up raised caps or hands as they flew over then went back about the business of the day life blair thought didnt just go on it insisted on thriving she turned her face toward the mountains with their mists and their secrets and their valley called silence where in a matter of weeks there would be blood and death they would fight she thought and some would fall but they would fight so life could thrive they reached the woods and circled before larkin wove delicately through the trees to the ground she slid off him took the bag when he was a man again he took her hand its beautiful she said before we do this i want to tell you geall is beautiful together they walked through the trees then stopped to dig three graves in the soft mossy ground the work was physical and mechanical and they did it without conversation going back into the wagon removing the bodies was a horror neither spoke but simply did what needed to be done she felt the weariness dragging back into her bones and the sickness that sat deep in the belly as they closed the ground over the bodies larkin carried stones for each of the graves then a fourth for the young girl he couldnt bury when it was done blair leaned on the shovel do you want to i dont know say some words he spoke in gaelic taking her hand as he said the words then saying them again in english so she could understand they were strangers to us but to each other they were family they died a hard death and now we give them back to the earth and the gods where they will have peace they will not be forgotten he stepped back drawing her with him ill pull the wagon into the field away from the trees well burn it everything theyd owned she thought as they set the wagon to light everything theyd had these people who had no name for her the idea of it was so sad as the wagon burned and the smoke rose that when she climbed onto the dragons back again she laid her head on his neck closed her eyes and dozed as they flew over the ashes chapter s he heard thunder and thought groggily that theyd have to outrace a storm straightening more than a little amazed shed dozed off on the back of a dragon she opened her eyes shook her head to clear it not thunder she realized and gaped at the towering fall of water that gushed over twin spires of rock into a wide blue pool there were trees here still leafy and green and the surprising tropical touch of palms lilies floated on the pool pink and white as if theyd been painted there beneath the surface of blue she could see the dart of fish bright and elegant as jewels the air smelled of flowers and clear water she was so stunned she stayed where she was when he landed the dragons head bent down so the strap of the bag slid off and she was sitting piggyback on larkin what we take a wrong turn he turned his head to smile into her dazzled eyes i told you i would bring you here faerie falls it is theres no picnic this time but i thoughti wanted an hour alone with you somewhere theres only beauty ill take it she jumped off his back turned a circle there were starry little flowers in the grass and a tangle of vines blooming purple winding right up the rocks almost like frames for that plunge of water the pool itself was clear as a mirror blue as a pansy while the cups of lilies floated over it and overhead the falls spilled fifty feet down its incredible larkin a little slice of paradise and i dont care how cold that water is im having a swim she yanked off her boots started on her shirt arent you sure he kept grinning at her ill be right behind you she stripped tossing her clothes carelessly on the soft ground poised on the bank she sucked in her breath braced for the shock and dived when she surfaced she let out a joyful yell oh my god its warm its warm and its silky and its wonderful she did a surface dive came up again if i were a fish id live here some say the faeries warm it every morning with their breath larkin sat pulled off his own boots others less fanciful talk of hot springs under the ground faeries science i dont care it feels so damn good he jumped in and as men were prone to do hit the water hard so it would splash her as much as possible she only laughed and splashed him back they went under together tugging each other deeper or pinching bare flesh playing like seals she swam under cutting through with strong strokes until she felt the vibration of water striking water she sprang off the bottom and into the tumble it beat on her shoulders the back of her neck the base of her spine she shouted out with a combination of relief and joy as it pummeled away the aches and fatigue when he joined her wrapped his arms around her they laughed as the water plunged over them the force pushed them back toward the heart of the pool where she could simply float with him i was thinking earlier how much id like a couple days at a good spa this is better she sighed and let her head rest on his shoulder an hour here is better than anything i wanted you to have something unspoiled i needed i think to remind myself there are such places not only graves to be dug he thought not only battles to be fought there isnt another woman i know but moira who would have done what you did with me today for me today there arent many men i know who would have done what you did today so were even he brushed his lips over her temple her cheek found her mouth the kiss was soft and warm as the water his hand that stroked over her as gentle as the air it seemed that nothing beyond this place beyond this precious time existed here for now they could just be while they drifted she saw a white dove soar overhead and circle she saw the sparkle of its green eyes so the gods do watch she thought remembering the white owl in the good times and in the bad then she turned her lips to his what did she care for gods now this was their time this was their place she sank into the kiss letting the water and his arms carry her i need you his eyes were on hers as he took her mouth again do you can you know how much it is i need you take me in he murmured it as he cupped her hips slid into her they watched each other as they joined fingers stroking faces lips brushing lips it was more than pleasure that moved through her more even than the joy of life if it was truth she thought this need this sharing then she could live on it the rest of her life she wrapped herself around him gave herself to that truth and knew the name of that truth was love i t was probably possible to be more tired to be more frustrated but glenna hoped she never found out shed done what moira had asked and taken a group of women to one end of the gaming fields to try to give them the first basic lesson of selfdefense they were more interested in gossiping and giggling or trying to flirt with the men hoyt worked with across the field than moving their asses shed taken some twenty of the younger ones assuming theyd be more enthusiastic and in better physical shape and that she decided might have been her first mistake time she thought to get mean be quiet the sharp edge of her voice silenced the group into a single gasping breath you know i like to ogle beefcake as much as the next girl but were not here so you can pick out your date for the harvest ball were here so i can teach you how to stay alive you she chose one at random pointed at a pretty brunette who looked sturdy step over here there were a few giggles and the woman smirked as she strutted up to glenna whats your name dervil lady then she squeaked and stumbled back when glennas fist swung up and stopped a bare inch from her face is that what youre going to do when someone tries to hurt you dervil are you going to squeal like a girl gulp like a fish she grabbed dervils arm yanked it up so that it blocked dervils face as glenna shot her fist out again their forearms rammed together that hurt dervils mouth fell open in shock you have no right to hurt me hurting someone isnt about rights its about intent and a forearm block hurts less than a barefisted punch in the face theyll like the look of you dervil block no dont throw your arm up like its a dishrag firm strong again she worked dervil backward with each punch youve got some meat on you and all that blood swimming in your veins squealing and flapping wont help you what will you do when they come for you run someone called out and though there was some laughter at this glenna stopped and nodded running could be an option there might be a time its the only option but youd better be fast a vampire can move like lightning we dont believe in demons dervil thrust up her chin rubbed her bruised forearm from the mutinous set of her mouth the glitter in her eyes glenna understood shed made her first enemy in geall so be it you can bet they believe in you so run end of the field and back run like the demons of hell are after you goddamn it i said run to get them moving she spurted a little fire at their feet there were some screams but they ran like girls glenna thought in despair waving arms mincing feet flapping skirts and at least three of them tripped which she considered an embarrassment for all females everywhere since she calculated shed lose half of them if she made them run back she jogged after them okay from here a couple of you actually have some speed but for the most part youre all slow and silly so well run every day one length of the field youre going to have to wear what are they tewes or leggings pants she said patting her own sweats mens attire for training skirts are only going to trip you up be in the way a lady one of them began only to freeze when glenna lasered a stare at her youre not ladies when im training you youre soldiers a different tack she decided who here has children several raised hands so she chose one she thought was at least watching her with some interest you your name ceara what would you do ceara if something came after your child i would fight of course i would i would die fighting to protect my child show me im after your baby what do you do when ceara looked blank glenna pushed down her own impatience ive killed your husband hes dead at your feet now the only thing that stands between me and your child is you stop me ceara lifted her hands fingers curled into claws and made a halfhearted lunge at glenna and the breath went out of her as she was flipped over glennas shoulder to land on her back how does that stop me glenna demanded your childs screaming for you do something ceara got into a crouch sprang up glenna let herself be tackled then simply flipped ceara over pressed an elbow to her throat that was better that was positive but it was too slow and your eyes your body told me just what you were going to do when glenna stood ceara sat up rubbed the back of her head show me she said to glenna by the end of the session glenna put her first students in two camps the ceara camp consisted of those who showed at least some interest and aptitude then there was the dervil camp which not only showed neither but a strong resistance to spending time doing something that wasnt traditionally a womans task when they were gone she simply sat down on the ground moments later hoyt dropped down beside her and she had the pleasure at least of resting her head on his shoulder i think im a poor teacher he told her that makes two of us how are we going to do this hoyt how are we going to pull this together turn these people into an army we have no choice but to do it but godss truth glenna im tired already and weve only begun it was different when we were in ireland the six of us we knew we understood what wed be facing at least youre dealing with men and some of them are already well trained with a sword or a bow ive got a gaggle of girls here merlin and most of them couldnt fight off a blind onelegged dwarf much less a vampire people rise when they have no choice we did he turned his head to kiss her hair we have to believe we can do this thing then well do it believing counts she agreed a lot of them dont believe what were telling them he watched two of the guards carrying iron posts watched as they began to hammer them into the ground they soon will he got to his feet reached for her hand we should see if the others are back b lair didnt know that shed ever been sent for unless you counted the occasional summons to the vice principals office in high school she doubted moira intended to give her detention but it was weird being escorted to the princess moira answered the door herself and the smile she gave blair was quiet and serious thank you for coming that will be all dervil thank you you should go now secure your place in the stands my lady i want you there i want everyone there blair please come in she stepped back to allow blair inside then shut the door in dervils face you sure come over all royal i know it must seem that way moira rubbed a hand up and down blairs arm before she turned to walk farther into the room but im the same she might have been wearing what blair considered moiras training gear the simple tunic pants and sturdy boots but there was something different about her the room might have added to it it was blair assumed a kind of sitting room and plush for all that cushions of richly worked tapestries velvet drapes the lovely little marble hearth with its turf fire simmering all spoke of position i asked you here to tell you how the demonstration will be done to tell me blair repeated i dont imagine youll like what ive chosen to do but the decision is made theres no other way for me why dont you tell me what youve chosen to do then ill tell you if i like it or not she didnt and she argued she threatened and she cursed but moira remained both implacable and immovable what have the others said about this blair demanded i havent told them ive told you thinking they could both use it moira poured them each a glass of wine put yourself in my position please these are the monsters who killed my mother they murdered the queen of geall and the idea was is to show people they exist what they are how they need to be fought and destroyed aye thats an essential point moira sat a moment to sip wine to settle all through the worries of the night the duties of the day shed been gathering herself for what was to come in a few days ill go to the stone again before the people of geall whove gathered there ill take hold of the sword if i lift it i will be queen and as queen ill lead my people into war the first war in geall can i send them into battle can i send them to their deaths when im unproven moira you dont have to prove anything to me not to you but to others and to myself do you understand i wont take up sword and crown until i feel worthy of both from where im standing you are i wouldnt tell you that if i thought otherwise you wouldnt no thats why i asked for you and not one of the others youll speak to me plainly and i can speak plainly to you it matters that you think im ready for the sword and the crown it matters a great deal but i have to feel it dont you see yeah shit because she did see blair raked her hands through her hair yeah blair im afraid of whats been asked of me of what i need to do of whats to come im asking you to help me do this thing tonight as a friend a fellow warrior and as a woman who knows how cold the path of destiny can be and if i refuse youll do it anyway of course now a glimmer of a smile but id feel stronger and surer with your understanding i do understand i dont have to like it but i can understand moira set her wine aside got to her feet to take blairs hand thats enough t heyd made it into a kind of party blair thought torches blazed lining the field of play flames rose up toward the sky where the nearly full ball of moon beamed like a spotlight people crammed into the stands jostled for position behind wooden barriers theyd brought children she noted right down to babies and the mood was festive she was armed sword stake crossbow and heard the murmurs as she passed through on her way to the royal box she slipped in next to glenna so what do you think the insurance would go for on a gig like this fire wood all this flammable clothing glenna shook her head as she scanned the crowd they dont understand it theyre like fans waiting for the concert to begin for gods sake blair there are vendors selling meat pies never underestimate the power of free enterprise i tried to get to moira before we were brought here we dont even know the plan i do and youre not going to like it before she could elaborate there was a blare of trumpets the royal family came into the box just dont blame me blair said over the cheers of the crowd riddock stepped forward raising his hands to quiet the crowd people of geall you are here to welcome home her highness the princess moira to give thanks for her safe return to us and that of larkin lord of macdara there were more cheers as moira and larkin stepped up to stand on either side of riddock larkin shot blair a quick cocky grin he doesnt know she thought and felt her stomach twist you are here to welcome the valiant men and women who accompanied them to geall the sorcerer hoyt of the family mac cionaoith his lady glenna cailleach dearg the lady blair gaiscioch dorcha cian of the mac cionaoith and brother to the sorcerer they are welcome to our land to our home to our hearts the cheers rolled give them a few hundred years blair thought and thered be little witch and wizard action figures if the world survived that long people of geall we have known a dark time one of heartbreak and of fear our beloved queen was cruelly taken from us murdered by what are not men but beasts on this night on this ground you will see what has taken your queen they are brought here by order of her royal highness and through the valor of lord larkin the lady blair and cian of the mac cionaoith riddock stepped back and by the way his jaw tightened blair thought he knew the drill and wasnt happy about it moira moved forward waited for the crowd to subside people of geall i have come home to you but not to bring you joy i come to bring you war i have been charged by the goddess morrigan herself to fight what would destroy our world the world of my friends all the worlds of humankind i am charged with these five whom i trust with my life with my land with the crown i may one day bear if the gods deem it to lead you into this battle she paused and blair could see she was judging the tone of the crowd the murmurs pacing herself it is not a battle for land or wealth not for glory or vengeance but for life itself i have not been your ruler i have not been a warrior but a student a dutiful daughter a proud citizen of geall yet i would ask you to follow me and mine to give your lives for me and for all that come after for on the night of the feast of samhain we will face an army of these the vampires were dragged onto the field blair knew what the people saw they saw men in chains murderers yes but not demons there were shouts and gasps there were calls for justice there were even tears but there was no true fear the guards fixed the chains to the iron posts and at moiras nod left the field these that killed my mother that murdered your queen have a name it is vampire in her world the lady blair has hunted them destroyed them she is the hunter of this demon she will show you what they are blair let out a breath turned briefly to larkin sorry before he could speak she vaulted out of the box and crossed the field what is this larkin demanded you will not interfere moira gripped his arm this is my wish more this is my order you wont interfere none of you as blair began to speak moira left the box vampires have one purpose to kill blair circled them letting them draw her scent the scent that would stir the terrible hunger they feed on human blood they will hunt you and drink you if food is their only purpose youll die quickly in pain in horror but quickly if they want more theyll torture you as they tortured the family larkin cian and i found dead in the forest on the night we hunted these down the larger one tried to lunge at her his eyes were red now and those closest to the field would see the fangs he exposed vampires arent born they arent conceived they dont grow inside a womb theyre made made from humans a bite from a vampire if not fatal infects some that are infected become halfvampires slaves to them others are drained almost to the point of death the very edge of life then theyre fed the blood of their sire and they die only to rise again not as a human but as a vampire she continued to move circling just out of reach your child your mother your lover can be turned like this they wont be your child your mother your lover anymore theyll be a demon like these with the blood lust that drives them to feed to kill to destroy she turned and behind her the vampires strained against their chains howling in frustration and hunger as she stood just out of range this is whats coming for you hundreds maybe thousands of them this is what you have to fight steel wont kill them it hurts them she whirled sliced the tip of her sword across the chest of the larger one they bleed but they heal and a wound like this will barely slow one down these are the weapons that destroy a vampire wood she drew a stake and when she feinted toward the smaller one he cringed back hunching to defend his chest through the heart fire she grabbed a torch and when she flourished it in the air both of them shrieked theyre night feeders because the direct light of the sun will end them but they can lurk in the shadows walk in the rain kill when the clouds block the sun the symbol of the cross will burn them and if youre lucky hold them back holy water burns them if a sword is used it must cut through the neck taking their head she too could judge the mood of the crowd blair thought excitement confusion those first whiffs of fear and a great deal more disbelief they still saw men in chains these are your weapons these are what you have along with your wits your courage against creatures that are stronger faster and harder to kill than you are if we dont fight if we dont win a little more than a month from now theyll devour you she paused while moira walked across the field to her be sure blair murmured i am she gripped blairs hand briefly then turned to the crowd where voices rippled with concern confusion moira lifted her voice over it morrigan is called the queen of the warrior yet it is said she has never fought in battle still i bow to her command this is faith i cannot will not ask that you have the faith in me that you would in a god i am a woman mortal as you are but when i ask you to follow me into battle you will follow a warrior proven whether or not i wear a crown i will carry a sword i will fight beside you she drew her sword lifted it high tonight on this ground i will destroy what took your queen and my mother what i do here i do for her by her blood i do for you for geall and all humankind she faced blair do it if you have any love for me she said when blair hesitated warrior to warrior woman to woman its your show she chose the smaller of the two though she judged he still had thirty pounds on moira on your knees she ordered holding her sword to his throat easy for you to kill when im in chains he hissed it but he dropped to his knees yeah it would be and i already regret im not getting a piece of you she held the sword against his throat as she moved behind him then taking the key moira had given her unlocked the chains with pride and fear she plunged the sword into the ground beside him and walked away what have you done larkin demanded when blair took her position in front of the box what she asked me to do what id want her to do for me if the situation were reversed she looked up at him now if you cant trust her why should they she reached up for his hand if we cant trust her how can she trust herself she released his hand and facing the field prayed shed done the right thing pick up the sword moira ordered with a dozen arrows pointed at me it demanded none flies unless you try to run are you afraid to fight a human on equal ground would you have run that night if my mother had held a sword she was weak but her blood was rich his eyes slanted to the left to his companion still chained and staked too far away to be of any help it was meant to be you the knife from that had already been in her heart the words only twisted it aye and you killed her for nothing but now it could be me will lilith have you back if you taste my blood tonight you want it deliberately she cut a shallow slice across her palm its so long since you fed she watched his tongue flick out to lick his lips as she held up her hand so the blood would drip down her arm and onto the ground come strike me down and feed he yanked the sword free and raising it charged she didnt block the first blow but pivoted aside kicked out to send him sprawling a good move blair decided add some humiliation to the fear and the hunger he came up rushed moira with that eerie preternatural speed some of them possessed but she was ready for him maybe blair thought shed been ready all of her life sword struck sword and blair could see that while he had more speed more strength moira had the better form moira drove his sword up aside then plunged her own into his chest she danced back once more took her stance showing the crowd blair knew that while such a wound might be mortal in a human it barely broke a vampires stride she ignored the screams the shouts even the sounds of panic and running feet and watched the combat on the field the vampire cupped a hand on his wound brought the blood from it to his mouth from behind her blair heard the sound of a body hitting the ground as someone fainted he came at her again but this time he anticipated moiras move his sword nicked her arm and he cracked the back of his hand across her face she stumbled back blocking the next blow but was driven back toward the second vampire blair lifted her crossbow prepared to break her word instead moira dived down rolled aside she came up with her legs pistoning in a hard double kick that simply made blairs heart sing atta girl atta girl now take him out stop fooling around but it had gone beyond that beyond merely showing the people what a vampire was capable of withstanding in battle moira brought her sword down to cleave a gash in its shoulder and still she moved back rather than strike a killing blow how long did she live moira demanded how long did she suffer she continued to block to drive even when the hand that gripped the hilt of her sword was slick with her own blood longer than you will or the coward who sired you he charged through her shock she barely saw the move would never know how she defended herself against it there was pain the sting as the sword grazed her side there was her own scream as she swung her sword through the air and took its head she went to her knees as much with the sudden tearing grief than from any wounds she shook from it and the roars of the crowd were like a distant ocean she gained her feet turned to blair unlock the other no thats enough moira its enough thats for me to say she strode over yanked the key from blairs belt its for me to do all sound dropped away as she started across the field moira saw the sudden light a kind of glee in the vampires eyes as she approached it the hunger and the pleasure of what was to come then she saw the arrow whizz by and strike its heart moira whirled the rage of betrayal ripping through her but it wasnt blair who held the bow it was cian he tossed it down enough was all he said before he walked away chapter m oira didnt think she didnt wait she didnt take her place back in the royal box to speak to her people again as she rushed away she could hear larkins voice lifted strong and clear he would stand in for her and that would have to do she still carried her bloody sword as she sprinted after cian how dare you how dare you interfere he continued reaching the courtyard now moving across it i dont take orders from you im not one of your subjects not one of your people you had no right she spun ahead of him to block him from entering the castle and seeing his face saw cold rage im not concerned about rights couldnt you stand it watching me fight one of them torment it destroy it you couldnt stand by and see me beat down a second if you like he didnt push past her but changed direction to continue across the courtyard and through an archway you will not turn from me this time when she rounded him she laid the flat of her sword on his chest her rage wasnt cold but hot bubbling through her like the wrath of gods youre here because i wish it because i permit it you arent master here didnt take long did it for you to drape on the mantle but understand this princess im here because i wish it and your permission is less than nothing to the likes of me now either use that sword or lower it she threw it aside so it clattered on the stones it was for me to do for you to die in front of a roaring crowd youre a bit small for the gladiator title i would have given a hungry vampire his last meal cian snapped you couldnt have bested the second of them maybe just maybe youd have stood a small chance against him if you were fresh and not wounded but blair chose the smaller of them to begin with because it was your best chance at proving your point and so you did be satisfied with that you think you know what i can do he simply squeezed a hand to the cut on her side releasing it when she went dead white and swayed back against the wall yes and so did he hed have known exactly where to come at you cian lifted the bottom edge of her tunic wiped the blood from his hand you wouldnt have lasted above two minutes before you were as dead as the mother youre so hellbound to avenge her eyes went from fog to smoke dont speak of her then stop using her her lips trembled once before she firmed them i would have beaten him because i had to bollocks you were done and too proud too stupid to admit it we cant know can we because you ended it you think you could have stopped him from sinking his teeth into this cian skimmed a finger down the side of her throat barely lifting an eyebrow when she slapped his hand aside stop me then youll need more than a peevish slap to manage it he stepped back picked up the sword shed tossed down smiled grimly when she winced at the pull in her side as he threw it to her there you have a sword i dont stop me ive no intention of stop me he repeated and moved quickly to give her a light shove back against the wall you wont put your hands on me stop me he shoved her again then simply batted the sword aside she slapped him hard across the face before he gripped her shoulders pressed her back against the wall she felt something that might have been fear that might have been as his eyes held hers transfixed for gods sake stop me when his mouth crushed down on hers she felt everything too much it was dark and it was bright it was hard and unbearably soft all that was inside her rushed toward it reckless and crazed then he was standing aside a foot away from her and it seemed all the breath had left her body thats not the way hed have tasted you cian left her trembling against the wall before he compounded an already enormous mistake he scented rather than saw glenna she needs to be seen to he said and continued away i nside blair sat in front of the fire in the family parlor trying to get her bearings just dont start on me she warned larkin she wheedled my word out of me and the fact is i understood why she needed to do it why didnt you tell me because you werent there because she left it for the last minute ambushed me which was damn good strategy if you want my opinion i argued with her and maybe i could have argued harder but she was right mostly right and jesus she made her point didnt she in spades he handed her a cup of wine crouched in front of her you think im angry with you im not with her a bit with her because she didnt trust me with this because it wasnt just her mother those things killed but my aunt and i loved her it wasnt just her people she sought to rally with this business tonight but mine and i can promise you moira and i will speak of it okay okay she drank looked at hoyt have you got two cents to put into this if youre meaning do i have an opinion on it i do she shouldnt have taken this on herself shes too valuable to risk and were meant to be a circle no one of us should make such important decisions without the others well if youre going to be logical blair sighed youre not wrong and if thered been time id have insisted she bring everyone in on it we wouldnt have stopped her but wed have all been prepared she went all queen on me sighing again blair rubbed at the tension at the base of her neck man she took some hits and glenna will tend to her hoyt answered she would have taken more if cian hadnt acted i wouldnt have let it happen im not going to kick at him for jumping in grabbing the crossbow out of my hands but i wouldnt have let her take on number two she was finished she drank again but im not sorry shes tearing the skin off his hide instead of mine his is thick enough idly hoyt poked at the fire well have our army now we will larkin agreed none can doubt what well come to face were not a people of war but were not cowards well have an army come samhain lilith will be here any day blair pointed out weve got a lot of work ahead of us wed better get some sleep get an early start on it tomorrow but as she started to get up dervil came to the doorway i beg your pardon but im sent for the lady blair my mistress wishes to speak with her another command performance blair muttered ill wait in your chambers larkin laid a hand on her arm youll come tell me how she is ill let you know blair started out glanced at dervil i know the way now im asked to bring you at the door of moiras chambers dervil knocked it was glenna who answered let out a breath of relief when she saw blair good thanks for coming my lady when glenna lifted a brow dervil cleared her throat i would apologize for my poor behavior today and ask at what time you wish to have the women gathered for instruction an hour past dawn can you teach me to fight i will teach you glenna corrected dervils smile was hard and tight well be ready something i missed blair asked glenna when dervil left them just part of a very long day something else you missed she kept her voice low i found moira arguing with cian at the edge of the courtyard not a big surprise it was when he finished the argument with his lips come again he kissed her hard steamy passionate ho boy she was pretty shaken glenna glanced over her shoulder and not in my opinion due to insult and outrage i repeat ho boy im telling you because i dont want to be worried about this all by myself thanks for sharing what are friends for glenna stepped back finish that potion moira she said lifting her voice now to conversational level i mean it i am i will youve fussed enough moira sat near the fire she wore robes now with her hair loose down her back the bruising on her face stood out against her pallor blair thank you for coming i know you must be tired but i didnt want you to go to bed before i thanked you how are you holding up glennas fussed and tended and dosed me she held up the cup drank the contents down i feel well enough it was a good fight you had some nice moves out there i toyed with him too long moira lifted her shoulders then winced as the wound in her side objected to the movement that was foolish and prideful more foolish more prideful to tell you to release the second you were right not to yeah i was blair came over to sit on the hassock at moiras feet im not going to tell you i know anything about being a queen but i do know that being a leader doesnt mean doing it all yourself being a warrior doesnt mean fighting when the fight isnt necessary i let my needs cloud my judgment i know that i wont do so again well alls well that ends she patted moiras knee youre the best friends ive known save larkin and the closest women to me but my mother i saw by your faces when you stood in the door that glenna told you what she saw between me and cian unsure how to answer blair rubbed her hands on her thighs okay i think we might have some wine when moira started to rise glenna laid a hand on her shoulder to stop her ill get it i didnt tell blair to talk behind your back or gossip i know that as well it was concern as a friend as another woman theres no need for concern i was angry no enraged moira corrected as glenna came back with the wine that he would take it upon himself to end what i wanted to do he only beat me to it by a couple seconds blair told her well well i went after him when it was my duty to stay to speak to my people but i went after him and i deviled him hed done what he did to stop me from making a foolish and perhaps fatal mistake and he told me as much but i wasnt ready to listen to accept he showed me as much and its all of a piece what happened at the end of it he only showed me that i wasnt strong enough to stop any sort of attack it meant nothing more than that okay blair searched for words if youre satisfied with that its difficult for a woman to be satisfied when shes kissed in such a way then coldly rejected still moira lifted a shoulder but it was done in anger on both sides i wont apologize to him nor do i expect he will to me well simply go on remembering there are more important things than pride and temper moira glenna stroked a hand over moiras hair do you have feelings for him as if to search inside herself moira closed her eyes there are times it seems im nothing but feelings but i know where my duty lies ive agreed to go to the stone take hold of the sword not tomorrow theres much to do tomorrow but by weeks end ive shown my people they have a warrior in me soon if the gods will it ill show them a queen when they stepped out moira remained in the chair watching the fire what i gave her will help her sleep and soon i hope blowing out a breath glenna dug her hands into her pockets this could get complicated what isnt i should have seen something like this coming time to turn in your crystal ball on a newer model oh well they walked together toward their own rooms should we talk to cian about this sure you go first with a half laugh glenna shook her head okay we leave it alone stay out of it at least for now you know im a firm believer in full disclosure in relationships but im not going to say anything to hoyt about this if you think im going to blab to larkin think again weve all got enough on our minds t he morning was soggy and cold but there were a flock of women on the gaming field most of them wore pants what the locals called braes and tunics more than twice the turnout i had yesterday glenna told blair thats moiras doing she sure as hell drove the point home last night look ill give you an hour get them started then im going to want to get my pet dragon up in the air whether it was the gloom of the morning or the dregs of the tension from the night before blair was antsy i want to check out the battlefield firsthand make sure those settlements near it are cleared out and i want to swing by make sure the traps are up and running just another day in paradise well i guess we ought to move this indoors hands on hips glenna turned a circle see if theres a space we can work with why in case you havent noticed its raining yeah i got that with all the water dripping off my hair point is we dont know what conditions will be like on samhain for that matter we dont know what theyll be like if any of these women have to tangle with a vamp before that might as well get used to fighting dirty so to speak crap buck up soldier blair gave her a friendly punch in the arm at the end of an hour blair was filthy mildly bruised and in the best of moods a little downanddirty training had gone a long way toward smoothing down the restlessness she started across the courtyard with the goal of finding larkin then stopped short when she recognized his mother and sister coming her way perfect she thought aces she was covered with mud and sweat and about to cross paths with the mom of the guy she was sleeping with just her lucky day since there was nowhere to duck out of sight she toughed it out good morning and to you i am deirdre and this is my daughter sinann blair nearly extended a hand before she remembered herself since she didnt think she could pull off a curtsey under current conditions she simply nodded its nice to meet you ive ah been training some of the women we watched in the way of pregnant women sinann folded her hands over the mound of her belly you have skill and energy she smiled when she said it so blair ordered herself to relax theyre coming along my son speaks well of you oh blair looked back at deirdre cleared her throat relax hell thats good to know thank you i was just looking for him we need to do a little scouting hes in the stables deirdre gave blair a long quiet look do you think i dont know he shares your bed before blair could speak could think to speak sinann made a sound that might have been muffled laughter im his mother after all deirdre continued in that same mild tone im aware hes shared beds of other women before you but hes never spoken to me of them as he speaks of you so that changes the matter ill beg your pardon from what hes said i believed youd prefer plain speaking i do i would oh boy im sorry ive just never had a conversation like this and not with someone like you a mother for starts i dont want you to think i just share my bed with anyone whos could this be more embarrassing blair wondered as deirdre simply continued to study her with what looked like amused interest hes a good man hes well hes an amazing man youve done your job very well no compliment is dearer to a mothers heart and i certainly agree with you the amusement faded now this war comes to us and hell do battle ive never faced such a thing so i have to believe deep in my heart that he does what he must and will live i believe it if that helps it does i have other children deirdre touched a hand to her daughters arm another son the husband of my daughter who is a son to me ill have the same faith in them but my daughter cant fight like the women you teach the child is to be born before the yule sinann told blair my third my children are too young to fight and this one not yet born how do i protect them blair thought of the crosses hoyt and glenna had made she believed the others would agree larkins pregnant sister should have one theres a lot you can do blair assured her ill help you now she turned to deirdre but you shouldnt worry about your daughter your grandchildren your sons your husband my friends and i will never let whats coming here get this far you give me peace of mind and im grateful we may not be able to fight but we wont be idle there are many things women who are no longer young and women who carry life can do well do them now you have work so we wont keep you longer good day to you and gods protect thank you blair stood a moment watching them walk away women with spine she thought lilith was going to be so out of her league satisfied she hunted larkin down in the stables where he was stripped down to the waist slicked with sweat and helping forge weapons her mood only improved what could be better than watching a halfnaked greatlooking guy beat hot steel into a sword she could see theyd made a good start from the number of weapons set aside to cure the anvil rang with hammer strokes and smoke billowed as a redhot blade was plunged into a vat of water was it a wonder she asked herself that her mind clicked over to sex can i get one of those engraved she called out something like to the woman who pierced my heart corny yet amusing he looked up grinned you look like youve been rolling in the mud have been i was about to go clean up he handed his hammer off to one of the other men then picked up a cloth to scrub the sweat from his face as he walked to her well have every man and woman in geall armed by samhain cians remark some time ago about beating the plowshares into swords isnt that far off words gone out good it needs to can you break away from here he used his finger to rub some of the mud from her cheek what did you have in mind a couple of flybys weathers crappy i know but we cant wait for sunshine and rainbows i need to see the battlefield larkin i need a firsthand look all right then he grabbed the tunic hed discarded earlier and called out a quick stream of gaelic to the men working behind them theyll push on well enough without me have you seen moira this morning aye we had a discussion with considerable heat then cooled off and made up shes gone into the village to speak to people the merchants to bargain for more horses wagons supplies whatever it is shes scribbled down on her list of things well need in the coming weeks its good thinking and smart to make sure shes seen after last night anyone who wasnt there would have heard by now the more visible she is the better in the coming weeks blair thought as she went inside to clean up the shopping listmaking supplygathering were all something women like deirdre and sinann could deal with keep them busy she mused and keep the royal family visible she scraped off the mud changed into a reasonably fresh shirt then strapped on her standard weapons when she met larkin in the courtyard she took the sheaths for his sword his stakes got something for you she picked up the harness shed set on the ground slid the sheaths into the loops put this together for you so you can carry your weapons when youre zipping around up there well isnt this fine he grinned like a kid presented with a shiny new red wagon this was thoughtful of you blair he leaned over to give her a kiss do your thing and well try it out i owe you a gift he kissed her again when hed become the dragon blair looped the harness over his body gave it a quick cinch not bad if i do say so myself she vaulted onto him lets fly cowboy shed never get used to it even in the rain it was a thrill to feel the wonder of what was beneath her and rise up and up into mists now drenched with wet that curtained the land below it was like flying inside a cloud she thought where the sound was muffled and there was nothing but the flight she decided shed never be satisfied with anything as ordinary as an airplane again the rain thinned and as the sun struggled to carve beams through the clouds she saw the rainbow it arched a bleeding blur of delicate colors that seemed to drip through the rain with a lazy sweep of wings larkin turned so that the arch glimmered like a doorway ahead and the colors deepened seemed to shine like wet silk as shafts of sunlight cut through the clouds the rain and those soft arching colors turned the sky to wonder there was a trumpeting call a kind of joyful blare then the sky was filled with dragons she lost her breath literally felt it whiz out of her lungs as beautiful winged beasts soared beside her in front of her behind in more colors than the rainbow she realized with their emeralds and rubies and sapphires she felt larkins body ripple as he answered their call and grinned like a fool when he turned his head and fixed a laughing gold eye on her she was flying with a flock of dragons herd pack pod what did it matter the wind from their wings blew over her face and hair sent her coat billowing as they soared through the rainbow sky the other dragons circled looped somersaulted in playful dances anticipating she gripped the harness shouted for larkin to do it do it and screamed with excitement as he dived and rolled hanging upside down as he soared bellyup she could see the mists tear and reveal the sparkling green and deep deep brown of the land of geall he skimmed the treetops dipped over the rush of a river then climbed climbed climbed into air that gleamed now with the strengthening sun they flew on past rainbows and jeweled wings until it was only the two of them and the sky overcome she lowered to him laid her cheek on his neck hed said hed owed her a gift she remembered he had given her one beyond price they flew through sunlight now and occasional and surprising showers of rain below she could see small villages or settlements the rough roads that joined them the tangle of streams or narrow rivers tough little knuckles of forest but ahead lay the mountains dark and mistshrouded and somehow foreboding she could see the edge of the valley that lay at their feet broken land scarred with rock the first shudder rippled down her spine as she looked down on what shed too often seen in dreams the sun didnt sparkle here it was as if the light was absorbed just sucked away into the dark belly of gullies and chasms rejected by the dull grass that fought with the spears and juts of weatherpocked rock the land dipped and rose tightened in on itself into folds and the looming mountains cast great shadows across it shadows that seemed to cause the land itself to move and shift it was more than a shudder that ran through her now it was an unreasonably atavistic fear a fear that this hard and forbidding land would be her grave as larkin veered off she closed her eyes and let the fear have its way for a moment because it couldnt be beaten off she thought couldnt be battered down by fists or weapons it had to be recognized and accepted once it had she could control it if she were strong enough she could use that fear to fight and to survive when he touched down she slid off legs a little shaky she admitted to herself but they held her up and thats what counted her fingers might have felt stiff but they worked and she used them to uncinch the weapon harness then larkin stood beside her its an evil place it was almost a relief to her to hear him say it yeah oh yeah it is you can almost feel that evil rising up out of the ground ive been there before and it always seemed to me to be a place out of geall not quite a part of it but it never felt as it did today as though the ground itself wanted to open up and swallow you whole oh boy it got to me ive got to be honest turned my blood cold she rubbed her hands over her face then glanced around where are we just a ways off from it i didnt want to set down there its an easy walk from here and i wanted a few moments first ill take them he touched her cheek a long way from rainbows here the wrong side of them id say and i want to say something else before we head back and face that place that flight the rainbow the other dragons the whole ball of it it was the most incredible experience of my life is that the truth of it he cocked his head i thought the most incredible experience of your life would be making love with me oh yeah right well next to that all right then he tipped up her chin to kiss her im glad you enjoyed it it was more than enjoyment it was just flat down amazing the best gift anyones ever given me handy for me that rainbow dragons cant resist one really theyre so gorgeous i thought my eyes would pop out of my head happens youve seen a dragon before he reminded her and youre the most gorgeous and handsome of them blah blah but honestly larkin theyre extreme all those colors and the powerhold on do people ride them the way ive been riding you no one rides like you a stór and they dont no theyre not horses after all but if they could you talked to them its not what youd call conversation its a kind of communication to be sure a sort of expression of thought of feeling and something i can only do when im in the dragon so to speak aerial warfare would give us a big fat advantage i want to think about this theyre gentle creatures blair so for the most part are the women glenna and i are training to fight when worlds are on the line pal you use everything that comes to hand she could see the resistance clearly enough on his face let me just play with it in my head awhile its this way right it is they walked the narrow road framed in hedges and lined with spears of orange lilies he bent plucked one then passed it to her blair stared down at it delicate petals in a strong and vibrant color something wild and lovely she talked of war she thought and he gave her a flower maybe it was foolish maybe both of them were but she slid its stem into one of the buttonholes of her coat and she breathed in its sweet scent as they walked toward the battleground chapter t heyd walked only minutes when blair heard the sound of horses and a rattle she assumed was a wagon or cart when they cleared the curve in the road she saw shed been right there were two wagons both loaded with people and possessions there were riders on horseback as well some no more than children mules were tethered to the back of each wagon and clopped along with a look she could only describe as extreme irritation the first wagon pulled up with the man driving it lifting his cap to blair then addressing himself to larkin its the wrong way youre traveling he said for by orders of the royal family all in this province are to go into dunglas or farther even into geall city itself if they can manage it there are demons coming its said and war with them beside him the woman clutched the baby she carried closer to her breast it wont be safe here she told them all are leaving their homes behind the princess moira herself has decreed that every citizen of geall must be indoors by sunset youre welcome to a seat in the wagon and to ride with us as far as my cousin in dunglas its kind of you mistress and thank you for the offer of hospitality but were on business here for the royal family and for geall well make our way we had to leave our sheep our crops the man looked behind him but the riders who came from the castle said there was no choice in it theyd be right the man turned back to study blair and its said too that warriors and wizards have come from beyond geall to fight this war and drive the demons out of the world its truth but larkin saw both fear and doubt ive gone out of this world and back into it id be larkin lord of mac dara my lord now the man removed his cap altogether its our honor to speak with you this is the lady blair a great warrior from beyond geall the boy who sat on horseback beside the wagon all but bounced in the saddle have you killed demons then have you fought and killed them lady seamas the woman obviously his mother spoke sharply you havent been given leave to speak much less to pester with questions its all right blair stroked a hand over his horse the boy had a wideopen face she thought where freckles had exploded like ginger over cream he couldnt have been more than eight i have fought them and killed them so has lord larkin and so will i she hoped not she hoped to god he was safely tucked into bed by nightfall and every night after a strong boy like you has another job to stay inside every night until the wars over guarding his mother his brothers and sisters keeping them safe will take courage no demon will touch them best make your way now and safe travels larkin said and to you my lord my lady he clicked to the horses snapped the reins blair watched them until both wagons had rumbled by thats a lot of faith in your family to pack up leave your home thats another strong weapon that kind of faith you spoke well to that boy made him see that staying inside with his mother was a duty liliths whelp was about that age a bit younger actually larkin reached under his hair traced the scar on the back of his neck with his fingers sweetfaced too he was some mothers son before she turned him into a monster shell be paying for that and a lot more that bite give you any trouble she asked as they started to walk again it doesnt not something i forget though thats for certain as im sure you know for yourself he lifted her hand turned her wrist over and kissed her scar still pissed as you say that the little bugger got a taste of me hardly more than a baby and damn near killed me kiddie vampires arent any less lethal than the full grown variety and actually in my opinion more creepy the hedgerows dropped away and the valley of silence lay before them and speaking of creepy she murmured its no less goosebumping from down here im no sissy but i wouldnt be insulted if you held my hand i wouldnt be insulted if you held mine so they stood clutching hands on what seemed to blair to be the end of the world the land fell off in a steep jagged anklebreaking incline it heaved up in nasty hillocks or rippled tables of rock acres of it she thought acres of misery and shadows with only the undulating moan of a cold wind through the wild grass lots of places to hide she commented we can use that as well as they can most of the fightings going to have to be done on foot only the best riders could handle a mount on that ground she narrowed her eyes wed better go down take a look at what were dealing with how do you feel about riding a goat unenthusiastic but she gave his hand a squeeze besides if we cant negotiate it now daylight no pressure were not going to do very well at night in the heat of battle plenty of footholds she discovered as they started down and the ground was too mean and stubborn to crumble away under her boots maybe shed have preferred a nice flat field for the mother of all battles but there were ways to use what they had to their advantage some of these crevices shallow caves could be useful hiding men and weapons they would larkin crouched down peered into a small opening theyd think of that as well as you said back in ireland so we get here first block off some strategic points magically maybe we can talk to hoyt and glenna about that or with crosses he nodded straightened wed want the high ground there and perhaps there he gestured as he studied the lay flood down on them thats what wed do flood down on the bloody bastards keeping archers on the high ground blair climbed up on a shelf of rock well need light thats essential we cant count on the moon glenna conjured some sort of light the night we went headtohead with lora in that skirmish back at cians place theyll slaughter us like flies if we fight in the dark thats their turf we cant lay traps here she added with a thoughtful frown cant risk our own men stumbling over or falling into one larkin held up a hand for her as she prepared to jump down shell come here as well at night to study to work out her strategy she may have been here before before we were born before those who birthed us were born spinning out her web and dreaming of that single night to come yeah shell have been here but what so have i ive seen this place in my head as long as i can remember from up there from down here in sunlight and silence in the dark with the screams of battle i know this place she whispered ive been afraid of it all my life yet you come to it you stand on it feels like ive been pushed here closer and closer every day i dont want to die here larkin blair no im not afraid to die or not obsessed with the idea of it but oh god i dont want to end here in this hard lonely place drowning in my own blood stop he took her shoulders stop this her eyes were huge now and deep deep blue you see i dont know if ive seen it or just imagined it because of the fear i dont know if ive watched myself die here damn gods anyway for their mixed messages and unreasonable demands she patted her hands on his chest to ease him back give herself a little space its okay im okay just a little panic attack its this place this evil place slides under the skin and freezes the blood so advantage them but you know what you know something that tips onto our side the people wholl come here wholl take this ground and fight on this place theyll have something inside them whatever it is itll already have given evil the finger what finger she hadnt thought it possible not in this awful silence not in this nightmare place but she laughed until her sides ached she explained as they walked the broken ground and it seemed easier then to cross it study it to think clearly when they climbed back up she felt more steady more sure she brushed off her hands started to speak then simply froze the goddess stood in a stream of light it seemed to pulse from her white robe and still it was dim compared to her luminous beauty im awake blair thought so this is new wide awake and there she is larkin do you see but he was going down on one knee bowing his head my lady my son you would kneel before what you have never truly believed i have come to believe in many things then believe this morrigan said you are precious to me each of you all of you ive watched you travel here through the light and the dark and you daughter of my daughters will you not kneel is that what you need no and she smiled i only wondered rise up larkin you have my gratitude and my pride would either of those come with an army of gods blair asked her and earned a shocked hushing sound from larkin you are my army you and what you both carry inside you for tomorrow and tomorrow would i ask this thing of you if it were not possible i dont know blair answered i dont know if gods only ask the possible and yet you come you prepare you battle so you have my gratitude my pride and my admiration this the second month the time of learning is nearly done so will come the time of knowing you must know if you are to win this thing what my lady must we know you will know when you know see blair spread her hands cryptic why does it always have to be cryptic it frustrates you i know there might have been a laugh in morrigans eyes as she stepped closer but there was no doubt of the affection in the brush of her fingers warm and real over blairs cheek mortals may see the path the gods have carved but its up to them to chose a direction and follow it i will tell you that you are my hope you and the four with you who forged the circle you are my hope the hope of mankind you are my joy and the future she touched larkins cheek now and you are blessed she stepped back the laughter gone in its place was a sorrow and a kind of steely strength what is coming must come there will be pain and blood and loss there is no life without its price the shadows will fall dark upon dark and demons rise from it a sword flames through it and a crown shines magic beats like a heart and what was lost can be regained if that heart is willing give these words to all the circle and remember them for it is not the will of gods that will win the day but the will of humankind she vanished with the light so blair stood with larkin on the edge of the cursed ground remember it blair lifted her hands let them fall how are we supposed to remember all that did you get it ill remember it its my first conversation with a goddess so i can promise you i wont be forgetting the details of it t hey flew again away from the valley to the first of the three points blair had devised for traps they set down in a green glade with a pretty river winding through it standing beside the river she took out the map the six of them had worked on okay if we go by the fact that our portal stands in nearly the same spot here as it does in ireland then we make the big leap of faith that the same would hold true for liliths way in the cliffs are roughly twenty miles west they are as you see here he traced his finger on the map along the coastline and caves as well which she could use for her base could blair agreed and she might put some troops there but it makes more sense to base closer to the battleground even if she doesnt at some point shell have to move west to east and if shes taking the most direct route shed have to cross this way and this river she nodded toward the water smarter to cross it near this point where it narrows moira said she took care of the mojo she had the holy man brought here as you wanted the water was blessed not to question your holy man but id feel better if i checked it out she dug in her pocket for a vial of blood courtesy of the vampire you skewered into the ground the other night lets try a little chemistry larkin took the water bag to the river to fill it while he was there he cupped his hand sampled straight from the river itself fresh and cool in any case pity its not deep enough for a swim just here or id talk you out of your clothes again on the clock here pretty boy she crouched down beside him and opened the vial just a couple of drops its either going to work or its not he tapped a few drops into the vial and the blood bubbled and steamed with the water mixed with it all right youve got yourself a happening holy man look at that boil she straightened to do a quick happy dance picture this along marches the evil vampire army gotta cross the river if not at this point at some point crap going to get our feet wet but were the evil vampire army were not afraid of a little stinking water then they start across man i can just hear it yipe yipe shit fuck splashing across splashing back just making it worse wet feet hell searing burning feet worse if some of them panic and knock each other down slip oh joy oh rapture larkin stayed in his crouch grinning at her pleasure it was damn clever of you it was freaking brilliant high five she grabbed his hand slapped her palm to his its a thing he got up yanked her to him and kissed her long and deep its a thing i like better who could argue wouldnt it be great oh wouldnt it be sweet if lilith was leading the way starts her strut across the stream the ultimate hot foot im just loving this she took a huge breath okay thats enough fun and frivolity lets go check out the others a good day blair thought as they headed toward the second location rainbows dragons goddesses shed faced one of her personal nightmares by walking in the valley and shed come out of it again now she was seeing her guerilla warfare tactics take shape liliths army was going to take a few hard kicks in the ass long before samhain since vamps werent known for tending their wounded without a strong connection between them she was likely going to lose a nice chunk of troops on the march toward destiny when larkin started his descent she prepared herself for another pat on the back then he changed directions puzzled she looked down and saw the overturned wagon there was a man lying beside it and a woman standing with a toddler in her arms and another at her skirts the youngest let out a squeal that might have been delight might have been terror as a gold dragon with a woman on its back soared down to the road the young mother went pale as a sheet and stumbled back when the dragon shifted shape into a man oh blessed mother dont be frightened larkin spoke gently added what blair thought of as his thousandwatt smile just a bit of magic is all im larkin son of riddock my lord her cheeks remained colorless but she managed a curtsey youve some trouble here your man is hurt its me leg the man struggled to sit up but could only moan i fear its broke let me have a look blair knelt down his face was gray she noted with a goodsized bruise along his jawline the axle it broke thank the gods my family wasnt hurt but i took a bad fall then the bloody horse runs off might have a small fracture here blair gave him a bolstering smile its not as bad as your axle but youre not going to be walking for a while hes going to need help larkin larkin studied the wheel theres no fixing that without some new wood where are you bound he asked the woman my lord we were going to stop at the wayfarers on the road to geall city then travel on from there on the morrow my husband has relations in geall city his brother niall is with the castle guards i know niall well if youd get what you feel you cant do without for the evening well see you to the wayfarer the older child a girl of about four tugged on larkins tunic where did your wings go ive just tucked them away for now but ill show them to you again help your mother now he gestured to blair can he ride he asked her youd have to go at a walk we can put a temporary splint on that leg but i dont think it should be jostled around hes in a lot of pain all right then itll have to be flying its only a few miles to the inn you take them two adults one of them hurt a couple of kids thats about all you can manage i dont like leaving you alone broad daylight she reminded him and im armed i can head over check out the next trap its what about a quarter mile that way right it is but you could wait here i wouldnt be much above a half hour kick my heels by a broken wagon i can check it out and be back here by the time you make the round trip then we can swing by the last of them and maybe do a sweep of the area see if there are any stragglers that need a hand well be back home before sunset with time to spare all right then for youll go anyway the minute ive gone nice to be so well understood i t took time not just to load the family on but to first convince the woman that it could be done that it had to be done now dont worry a bit breda larkin gave her fullpower charm ill be staying as low to the ground as im able well have you and your family at the inn quick as a wink and send off for help for your man here ill see that someone comes and fixes your wagon in the morning and delivers it straight to you cant ask better than that no my lord no youre so kind still she stood all but wringing her hands ive heard of course of your gift all of geall knows of it but to seeand the idea of riding a dragon wont your daughter have stories to tell come now your husband needs help aye well of course of course he changed before she could balk and left it to blair to deal with the rest she helped the injured man up taking his weight as larkin bellied to the ground using rope from the wagon she tied him on im grateful to you he said to blair i dont know how wed have managed if youre anything like your brother youd have figured something hes a good man you get on behind him blair instructed his wife keep the kids between you im going to tie you on his back youll be secure i promise you i like his wings the girl clambered on before her mother could make a peep they shine when it was done larkin picked up the pack of possessions in his jeweled legs then turned his head to give blair a nuzzle on the arm and he was rising up blair heard the little girl shouting with absolute delight as they skimmed down the road and away know just how you feel blair said with a laugh with the map in hand she crossed the road and started across the first field it felt good to walk and to have a little alone time not that she wasnt nuts about the guy blair thought as she brushed her finger over the flower in her buttonhole but she was so used to being on her own this whole business had all but eliminated her solo time since it started shed been part of a team a circle she corrected people she respected and believed in no question but people who needed to be consulted all in all she was better at teamwork than shed imagined she would be maybe she decided it was all a matter of who was making up the team and somehow through that team shed ended up being half of a couple she hadnt believed that was in the cards for her not again certainly not with a man who knew everything there was to know about her and not only got it but valued it she already knew it was going to rip her to pieces when they went their separate ways no choice there that she could see so there wasnt much point in brooding about it less point in wasting the time they had feeling sorry for herself in any case they both had to live first before they could be miserable and alone it was better all around better to enjoy and to cherish the time they had when that time was done she could look back at it and know shed loved and had been loved she glanced up at the sky wondering how the farmer and his family were faring with their first and if she was any judge of the mother of the brood their last dragon flight larkin would take care of them it was one of the things he was good at taking care when you added the fairytaleprince looks the kickass attitude in battle that quick grin and the excellent stamina in bed he was just about perfect she checked her map again hopped over a low stone fence to the next field beyond it were a few trees and the most direct route from the coast to the valley theyd move through here blair thought two maybe three hours before they reached the stream with the blessed water and at night go quickly through this open area toward the shelter of woods another few miles inland this route was logical and it was efficient add in the scatter of farms cottages sprinkled through there was the possibility of fresh food oh yeah blair mused this is the way shell come has to in stages maybe leaving some at the caves at various safe points along the way for hunting for ambushes quick raids its what id do blair murmured and with a last check of the map headed southeast into a small thin grove of trees she saw it almost immediately and her first thought was some kid or passerby had stumbled over the trap and into it her heart bounced straight into her throat she sprinted toward the wide hole terrified shed see bodies impaled on the wooded spikes below what she saw was a scatter of weapons and one very dead horse moved up the schedule she said softly and despite the sunlight reached behind her to draw her sword moved things up blair decided when the reports came in that theyd gone to the dance with supplies and weapons and vanished shed have known where theyd vanished blair thought so liliths army was already in geall already on the march and had already passed this point the trap had worked from the weapon count it looked to have taken out at least a dozen and the very unlucky horse she crouched down wishing she had some of the rope shed used earlier they needed to retrieve those weapons waste not want not and get that poor horse out of there she was puzzling over how she and larkin might do that when she realized the light had changed looking up she saw the sky overhead was black with clouds as twilight fell in a fingersnap she got to her feet oh shit she backed up backed away from the hole and thought it wasnt just a dozen vamps whod walked into a trap shed just walked into one herself and they came up out of the ground chapter s he took two out fast an instinctive and wide sweep of her sword before they were fully disinterred but there were alarms shrilling in the back of her mind that said she was in big bad trouble eight she counted after the two shed dusted they had her surrounded cutting off any chance of retreat and shed walked right into it all but whistling a tune if she managed to live and the odds were against it shed curse herself for it later right now since flight wasnt an option fight was all that was left the one thing she had blair reminded herself was a lot of fight in her she pulled her stake blocked the first blade with her sword even as she pumped out a back kick she spun swinging out with the sword scoring flesh buying time spotting an opening she rammed the stake one more down but these werent green recruits whod make many sloppy and fatal mistakes what she was facing were trained and seasoned soldiers and it was still seven against one she envisioned the fire sending it rippling down the sword glenna had charmed yeah come on come on hacking out she sent one falling back his arm ablaze then went flying as one caught her foot on the next kick and hurled her into the air she slammed hard into the trunk of a tree saw stars floating on a gray field edged with sickly red but the one that charged her met fire and steel and fell screaming into the trap she rolled and with pain bursting through her struck out with the flaming sword her left arm was numb from the shoulder down and shed lost the stake she hacked thrust sliced took a hard punch to the face that nearly sent her into the trap she managed to spring over it fight for footing and with vicious screaming blows beat back the next attack one went for her throat so she cracked the hilt of the sword on the bridge of his nose she felt the chain that held her crosses snap as he fell back no stake no cross and five of them left she wasnt going to make it no longer hoped she could hold them back until larkin got to her to even the odds so she wouldnt die in the valley but here and now but by god shed take as many as she could with her first so that when larkin came for her he could finish the rest her left arm was nearly useless but she still had her feet and kicked up kicked out as she sliced out fire theyd weakened her breaking her form her rhythm she blocked an oncoming sword but the tip of it scored a line down her thigh on the down swing her slight stumble left her open enough so that when another kicked the blow plowed into her belly stealing her breath as her body flew back she went down hard felt something tear inside her with what she had left she thrust up blindly had the grim satisfaction of seeing one burst into flame then the sword was knocked out of her hand and she had nothing left how many left she wondered three maybe three larkin could take three hed be all right head swimming she struggled back to her feet she didnt want to die on her back she fisted her hands fought to get her balance maybe maybe she could take one more just one more barehanded before they killed her but theyd stepped back she saw three four her vision was doubling on her but she willed it to focus and saw lora glide over the ground werent going to kill me blair thought dimly just working me over wearing me down saving me for her worse than death she realized as her blood went cold she wondered if she could find a weapon and a way to end her own life before lora made her a monster if she could manage it she might be able to throw herself into the trap better staked than changed im so impressed clapping her hands together lightly lora smiled you defeated seven of our seasoned warriors ive lost a bet with lilith i wagered youd take out no more than four happy to help you lose well you did have a slight advantage they were ordered not to kill you that pleasure will be mine you think know and that coat ive admired that coat since i first saw you on the side of the road in ireland its going to look marvelous on me so that was you sorry all of you smell the same to me i can say the same about you mortals lora beamed out a gay smile speaking of mortals i have to say your jeremy was absolutely delicious still smiling she touched her fingertips to her lips flicked them out as if reliving the moment dont think about jeremy blair ordered herself dont give her the satisfaction so she said nothing meeting loras laugh with stony silence but where are my manners weve met of course but havent been formally introduced im lora and ill be your sire blair murphy and ill be the one dusting you and the coat looks better on me than it would on you youre going to be the most delightful playmate i can hardly wait because i have admiration and respect for you well fight this out just you and i lora pointed a finger toward the trio of soldiers wagged it back back back now this is between us girls so you want to fight think think think blair ordered herself think over the pain swords knives handtohand i do love bare hands lora lifted hers wiggled her fingers its so intimate works for me blair spread her coat open to show she had no weapons can i ask you a question bien sur is that accent real or do you just put it on she unhooked the water bottle from her belt i was born in paris in the year fifteeneightyfive blair let out a snort come on all right lora said with a laugh fifteeneightythree but what woman doesnt fudge a little about her age you were younger than me when you died younger when i was given true life its all a matter of perspective blair lifted the water sack twisted it open mind your boys gave me quite a workout feeling a little dehydrated be my guest blair tipped the bag back drank the water felt like a miracle on her dry throat if i take you are your boys going to finish me off you wont take me blair angled her head said a quick prayer bet and swung the bag so the blessed water splashed over loras face and throat the screams were like rusty razors slicing through blairs brain there was smoke the nasty stench of burning flesh she stumbled away from it as lora ran shrieking a weapon blair thought fighting to see just to stay on her feet everything anything was a weapon she grabbed a low branch of the tree as much for support as a lastditch effort calling on whatever she had left she pulled at it felt it crack with something between a sob and a scream she swung it at the three vampires who charged toward her the dragon dived out of the sky tail lashing blair saw one of them fly headfirst into the trap as the man stood drawing the sword from the harness that spilled around his feet the last thing she saw before she fell was the bright flame of it cleaving through the dark he fought like a madman without a thought for his own safety if they landed blows he never felt them his rage and his fear were beyond pain there had been three but if thered been thirty he still would have cut through them like an avenging god his dragon had swept one into the stakes and now he hacked through the shoulder of another the arm that fell went to dust and the creature that was left ran screaming across the field the third rushed to retreat larkin swept up a stake on the run flung it and sent it to hell with his sword hand ready for however many more might spring out of the dark he crouched to blair the words poured out of him and were all her name her face had no color but the blood that streaked it and the bruises already going black when her eyes fluttered open he saw they were glassy with pain my hero her voice was barely more than a thick whisper gotta move gotta go could be more oh god oh god im hurt you gotta help me up just be still a moment i need to see how bad it is its bad justis the light coming back or am i heading into that stupid white tunnel people talk about the suns coming back its all right now ten there were ten and the french whore makes eleven my head damn it concussion vision keeps doubling on me but she couldnt bite back the scream when he moved her shoulder im sorry a stór a stór im sorry dislocated dont think broken just out of joint oh god you have to fix it i canti cant you have to take care of it okay thenjesus jesus go get a wagon i cant ride youll trust me now wont you my darling trust me to take care of you now i do i will but i need you to he did it quickly bracing her back against the tree pressing his body hard to her as he yanked her shoulder back into place she didnt scream this time but he was watching her face and saw her eyes roll up white before she slumped against him ripping the sleeve of his tunic he used the material to field dress the gash on her thigh before checking along her torso for broken ribs when hed done the best he could for her larkin laid her down gently before springing up to gather the weapons after securing them in the harness he draped it over himself and hoped it would hold shimmered from man to dragon he picked her up cradling her in his claws as if she were made of glass s omethings wrong glenna gripped moiras arm as they stood on the practice field working with a handful of the more promising students something bad big wake cian wake him now they both saw the black boil of the sky to the southeast and the rippling curtain of darkness that fell from it larkin blair get cian glenna repeated and began to run she didnt have to shout for hoyt he was already sprinting toward her lilith was all she said midir her wizard he took hold of her arm pulling her toward the castle this would be his work shes already here larkin and blair are out there out there in the dark we need to do something quickly counteract the spell there must be a way riddock should send riders out theyd never get there in time its miles off hoyt theyll go in any case when they rushed inside cian was already coming down moira hard on his heels he was already coming moira said i felt the change false night i can get there quicker than you or any mortal and what good will it do if the sun comes back moira demanded time i gave that bloody cloak a try we dont separate we cant risk it and sending riders hoyt glenna shook her head they wont help now we need a circle and a counter spell maybe a miracle she thought we need it fast it has to be outside under the sky hoyt looked into his brothers eyes will you risk it we can try it without you he said before cian could speak the three of us but the odds are better with me lets get it done they gathered what they needed hoyt and glenna were already outside making hurried preparations when cian came down again with the cloak moira stepped forward when he got to the base of the stairs i think faith in your brother will strengthen the spell do you i think she said in the same measured tones your willingness to risk so much for friends has already given you protection were about to find out he swirled the cloak on pulled the hood up nothing ventured he added and for the first time in nearly a thousand years stepped into the sun there was heat he felt it weigh down on him lead heated almost to burning it pressed on his chest shortened his breath but he crossed the courtyard i havent turned into a human torch yet he said but i wouldnt object if this didnt take long fast as we can glenna told him bright blessings on you cian lets keep the bright off it if its all the same carnelian for speed she began placing crystals in a pentagram pattern on the stones sunstone for light agates dendritic for protection plume for binding now she took up herbs dropping them into a bowl garlic for protection sorry she said to cian thats a myth okay good holly restoration of balance rose and willow power and love join hands keep yours inside the cloak cian well come to you focus hoyt ordered with his eyes on the black sky the bubble of night to the south and east draw out what you have both of you have power inside you draw it out and forge the circle guardians of the watchtowers glenna called out we summon you of the east of the south of the west of the north we call your fire to cast here this circle at hoyts words the yellow candles glenna had chosen to represent the sun sprang to light morrigan the mighty join with us now he continued we are your servants we are your soldiers casting her eyes to the sky glenna pulled everything she had inside her and pushed blessed are you and blessed are we who seek to fight this infamy magic against magic white and pure against the black here springs our power against this attack might and right push back the night with our power joined we raise our cry break this dark spell in the eastern sky hear our love and loyalty as we will so mote it be her hand trembled in hoyts as the power spun round the circle with her eyes still cast up she saw the battle rage flashing lights gushing black clashing together like swords to raise a thunder that sent the ground to quiver we refute the dark magicks hoyt shouted we cast them back we cast them out we call the sun to flame through the false night overhead the war between the black and the white raged on b lair swam dizzily toward consciousness and into the pain she felt the wind rush by her and thought she saw the blur of land below flying she was flying is this what happened after you were dead but if she was dead why the hell did she hurt so much she tried to move but she was tied down strapped in or maybe her body simply refused to work any longer then she managed to turn her head and she was looking up at a golden throat she thought larkin then floated away once more he felt her stir gently tightened his grip in hopes it would reassure her make her feel more secure he angled his head to look down at her but her eyes were already closing again she looked so pale she felt so fragile hed left her alone he would live all of his life he would live with the image of her bleeding left with nothing more than a tree branch for defense while monsters circled her like vultures if hed been even seconds later she would be dead because he hadnt been with her hed seen to the safety of others and hed tarried just a little longer so a young girl could pet his wings when the darkness had come he hadnt been with her the fear ate through him that no matter how fast hed flown to reach her no matter if hed stopped the three demons whod stalked her from feeding hed still been too late to save her life even when he saw the castle the fear gnawed he saw moira rush out and hoyt glenna his father and others but still he knew nothing but that fear hed barely touched the ground when he changed and held blair in his arms shes hurt shes hurt bring her in quickly sprinting alongside him glenna reached over to check the pulse in blairs throat up to her room ill get what i need moira go with him do what you can for her ill be quick how bad cian swung around to rush up the stairs beside glenna i dont know pulse is weak thready her faceshe took a beating bites i didnt see any she grabbed her healing kit from her room dashed out again larkin had laid blair on the bed and stood as moira laid hands on blairs face her shoulders her heart how long has she been unconscious glenna snapped as she swept in ii dont know she fainted larkin managed i had toher shoulder it was out of the joint i had toshe fainted when i snapped it back i think she came around once on the way back but i cant be sure the dark it came i wasnt with her and they set on her and she was alone you brought her back moira help me get her coat off her clothes i have to see where shes hurt cian stepped up himself to take off her boots the men should go moira began she isnt the first ive seen naked and i dont think shed be worried about it how many were there cian asked larkin she said ten ten and the french one as well there were only three when i got to her she made them pay cian gently tugged down her pants glenna bit back a sound of distress as she saw the bruising the cuts ribs she made her voice brisk probably kidney bruised shoulders bad too the gash on her leg is fairly shallow but god her knee not broken at least nothing broken she larkin reached down took one of blairs limp hands she said her vision was going double concussion she said now glenna spoke gently why dont you step out let moira and me take care of her no i wont leave her again she had pain a lot of pain you need to give her something that will take away the pain i will i promise ill give her what i can for it why dont you build up the fire then i want it warm for her blair could hear them the voices she couldnt quite separate one from the other or pick out words but the sounds were enough to assure her she was alive the pain spoke to her as well and that told her shed gotten her ass thoroughly kicked she caught scents as well now peat smoke glenna and something strong and floral but when she tried to open her eyes they wouldnt cooperate that had panic trickling into her chest like nasty little drops of acid coma she didnt want to be in a coma people fell into comas and sometimes they never climbed out shed rather be dead than trapped inside the dark hearing feeling but not being able to see or speak then she felt something slide over her like silk just a flutter over her skin under it then deeper deeper still to where the pain was clenched in fists then the silk heated then it burned oh god and the fire of it forced those fists open until the pain spread and broke into a thousand jagged pieces her eyes flew open in blinding light that had her flailing out son of a bitch in her mind she screamed it but it came out as a hoarse croak she sucked in breath to curse again but the worst of it ebbed and became a slow steady throbbing it hurts i know it hurts to heal can you look at me blair no stay up here now and look at me blair forced her eyes open again glenna swam into view her face close her hand cupped the back of blairs neck lifted it gently up drink a little of this just a little now i cant give you too much because of the head trauma but this will help blair swallowed winced tastes like liquid tree bark not that far off do you know where you are im back whats your name blair murphy do you want rank and serial number glennas lips curved how many fingers two and a half visions a little blurry but she struggled to use it to see the room was full of people she realized the whole team hey dorothy scarecrow the tin man she realized then her hand was gripping larkins probably hard enough to grind bone to bone she relaxed her fingers managed a smile thanks for saving my life back there it was no trouble youd taken care of most of it yourself i was done she closed her eyes again tapped out i shouldnt have left you alone cut that out blair would have given him a light punch to go with the words if shed had the strength its wrong and its useless why did you cian asked him why did you separate as larkin told them about the injured man blair closed her eyes again she could hear glenna and moira murmuring to each other floating a little she thought glenna had a voice like silk sort of sexy and sleek moiras was more like velvet soft and warm and that was a really strange thought she decided but at least she was having thoughts as they worked on her the pain bloomed then backed off bloomed and died she began to anticipate the rhythm of it before she made another realization am i naked she would have pushed up to her elbows at least tried to if glenna hadnt eased her back im naked oh man youre covered well enough with a sheet we had to see your injuries glenna told her youre pretty well covered with gashes and bruises too so i wouldnt worry about modesty right now my face blair lifted a hand to feel for herself how bad is my face modesty and vanity glenna said good signs you wouldnt make the finals of the miss demon hunter contest at the moment but you look damn good to me youre beautiful larkin took her hand kissed it you couldnt be more beautiful that bad huh well i heal fast not as fast as you guys she said to cian but fast enough can you tell us what happened when you and larkin were apart hoyt touched her ankle he said there were ten yeah ten and lora so thats eleven trap worked dead horse down there and weapons we should get those weapons they were in the ground the weapons hoyt prompted no the vamps dug into the ground trap in a trap it got dark bam like a solar eclipse but faster and they came up out of the ground i got the first two before they got all the way out realized after later they werent trying to kill me which to be honest is why im not dead they were just softening me up for her cowardly bitch but you killed her she shook her head at larkin and immediately regretted the movement no dont think so couldnt have taken her in a fight could barely keep my feet she knew it comes strutting out talking trash thinks shell make me her lesbian vamp lover as if shes hurting now too oh yeah and she doesnt look so good either water bag holy water larkin murmured arent you the clever one everythings a weapon i tossed as much as i could into her face hit her too face down the throat i heard her screaming when she ran off but that was it for me pretty much all i had left good thing you came you had a branch a branch of what a tree branch he told her kissing her fingers again you were swinging a tree branch yeah huh good for me its sort of blurry here and there thats enough for now glenna held the cup back to blairs lips a little more of this rather have a frozen margarita who wouldnt glenna passed a hand over blairs face now sleep chapter s he swam in and out and the pain was waiting each time she surfaced weakness would drag her under again but not before she heard whispers and murmurs not before she heard herself answering questions that seemed to be peppered over her every time she came back to the world why wouldnt they just let her sleep then someone would pour more tree bark down her throat and shed float away again sometimes when she floated she went back to that field and relived every blow every block every movement of what shed believed were the last moments of her life sometimes she simply floated into nothing larkin sat beside her watching as moira and glenna took turns tending her watching as one of them came in to light candles or add turf to the fire or just lay a hand over blairs brow to check for fever every two hours by the clock one of them would wake her ask questions of her because of the concussion glenna had said it was a precaution because shed suffered such hard blows to her head then he would think what might have happened if one of those blows had knocked her unconscious what they would have done to her while she was alone every time he thought of it imagined it hed take her hand to feel her pulse beat under the scar on her wrist he passed the time talking nonsense to her and for a time playing the pipe that moira had brought to him he thought he hoped she rested easier with the music you should go rest now for an hour or two moira stroked a hand down her hair as she spoke ill sit with her i cant no nor could i in your place shes so strong larkin and glenna so skilled i wish you wouldnt worry so i didnt know it was inside me that i could feel so much for one person that i could know without question without a single doubt that this woman iswell everything there is for me i knew it not that it would be her but that there would be someone and that when you found her shed change everything moira bent to press her lips to the top of his head im a little jealous do you mind no he turned her head pressed his face to her side ill love you all my life i think i could be a thousand miles from you and still reach out my hand and touch yours tears stung moiras eyes i couldnt have chosen better for you if id chosen her myself still shes the luckiest of women shes waking all right talk to her now well keep her with us a few moments then ill give her more medicine there you are larkin spoke quietly standing to take her hand mo chroi open your eyes what they fluttered open what is it give me your name now scarlett ohara cant you remember it for five minutes she said testily blair murphy i dont have brain damage im just tired and annoyed shes lucid enough moira decided and poured more of glennas potion into a cup i dont want any more of that hearing the petulance in her own voice blair closed her eyes a moment look i dont mean to be pissy or okay maybe i do so what but that gunk makes me feel foggy and out of it which wouldnt be so bad if someone wasnt waking me up every freaking ten minutes to ask me my name not at all displeased with the rant moira set the cup aside glenna said i should wake her if blair refused oh jeez dont go get nurse rachett ill be a moment larkin eased down on the side of the bed as moira slipped out of the room your colors come back you know its a relief to me i bet im all kinds of colors right now blue black purple that sicklooking yellow good thing its dark in here look you dont have to hang around im not going anywhere i appreciate it butlisten can we talk about something other than me and my severely kicked ass tell me something tell mewhens the first time you knew you could shapeshift oh id have been about three i wanted a puppy you see my father had his wolfhounds but they were too dignified to play with the likes of me to chase balls around and fetch sticks a puppy she relaxed with the sound of his voice what kind of puppy oh any sort would do but my mother said she wasnt after having another dog in the house and that she already had me and the baby to deal with that would be my brother who would have been barely more than a year old and i was unaware at the time she was already carrying my sister as well small wonder she wasnt up for housebreaking a dog shes been in to see you my mother twice tonight my sister my father as well oh blair patted her face imagined how she looked terrific so to continue the tale i begged for the pup relentlessly and to no avail she would not be moved i had a good sulk about it up in the nursery imagining running off with the gypsies where i could have as many pups as i pleased and so on and i kept thinking about the pup and then there was thismoving inside me and this light was spinning around i was frightened and called out for my mother and barked you turned into a puppy her eyes were clearer now he could see it see the fun in them as he told the story oh what terror and what a thrill with it i couldnt have a puppy so id made myself one and wasnt that an amazing thing id make some crack about being able to play with yourself but its a cheap shot keep going well now i went running out and down the stairs where my mother caught sight of me and thinking id gone and snuck a pup in the house despite her she set off chasing me i thought shed hide me good when she realized what id done and tried to run outside but she cornered me shes always been quick hauled me up she did by the scruff of the neck i must have whimpered and looked plain pitiful for she sighed deep and scratched my ears softie aye shes a good warm heart my mother i heard her speak plain as day that boy she said what am i to do with that boy and with you she said to me not knowing i was that boy she sat down with me in her lap when she began to pet me i turned back and when she regained consciousness oh shes made of sterner stuff than that my mam i remember her eyes popped wide but mine mustve been as big i threw my arms around her neck so glad to be a boy again she laughed and laughed her granny it seemed had the same skill excellent so its a family trait here and there it seems by the end of the week her granny who i swear was older than the moon itself came to stay with us and teach me what i needed to know and she brought with her a little spotted puppy i named conn for the warrior of a thousand battles thats a nice story her eyelids began to droop what happened to conn he lived twelve good years then went over the bridge of rainbows where he could be a puppy again and play all day in the sun sleep now a ghrá ill be with you when you wake he glanced over as glenna came quietly in and even managed a smile shes gone off to sleep again natural sleep that would be good wouldnt it yes no fever glenna said after laying her palm on blairs forehead if she refused the medicine id guess the pains lessened and her colors good moira says you wont leave her how can i if it were hoyt id say the same but why dont you lie down with her get a little rest yourself i might jostle her in sleep i dont want to hurt her you wont hurt her glenna moved to the windows drawing the drapes i dont want the sun to wake either of you if you need me come for me or send for me but i think shell rest easy enough for a few hours now she put a hand on larkins shoulder then leaned down to kiss his cheek lie down beside her for a while and do the same when he did blair stirred and turned just a little just enough so that her body curled toward his as gently as he could he took her hand shell pay for what she did to you i swear to you shell pay listening to her low steady breathing he closed his eyes and finally slept i n another room a fire blazed and the drapes were drawn tight against the glass against the dawn loras wild wails echoed through the room she thrashed as lilith once again slathered a pale green balm over the burns and the boils that covered loras face her neck even her breasts there there dont dont my darling my sweet sweet girl dont fight me this will help it burns it burns i know tears gathered in liliths throat in her eyes as she coated the vicious burns on loras neck oh my poor baby i know here now there now drink a little of this i dont want it lora turned her head away clamping her eyes and mouth tightly shut but you must though it scored her heart to cause lora more pain lilith took a firm grip on the back of loras neck to force some of the liquid down just a bit more just a bit good thats good my own darling she hurt me lilith she hurt me hush hush now well fix it she scarred me fresh tears spilled over the balm as lora once again turned her face away im ugly and scarred how can you even look at me after what she did to my face youre only more beautiful to me now more precious to me she laid her lips gently gently on loras lilith had allowed no one else to tend lora but herself no one she vowed would touch that burned skin but herself youre my sweetest girl my bravest i had to hide in the dirt ssh it means nothing you came back to me lilith took loras hand turning it palm up to press kisses there i have you back the door opened and davey came in he carried a crystal goblet on a silver tray his lips pressed hard in concentration i didnt spill any not one drop such a big boy lilith took the goblet ran her other hand down his hair once again lora turned her face away he shouldnt see me like this no he should know what theyre capable of these mortals come davey come sit with our lora gently now dont jostle her he climbed carefully onto the bed does it hurt very bad lora nodded very bad i wish it didnt i can bring you a toy in spite of the pain lora smiled perhaps later i brought you blood its still warm i didnt sneak any he added stroking her hand as hed seen lilith do mama said you need it all so you can be strong and well again thats right here now lilith held the goblet to loras lips drink it but slowly the blood calmed her and the drug lilith had given her earlier helped fog the worst of the pain it helps she laid back shut her eyes but i feel so weak i thought oh lilith i thought at first id been blinded it burned my eyes so she tricked me how could i have been so stupid you mustnt blame yourself no i wont have it you should be furious with me how could i be at such a time weve centuries together my love the good and the bad can i say you were foolish of course but i might have done the same what good is the kill without the flourish she lowered the bodice of her robes to reveal the pentagram scar between her breast dont i carry this because i toyed too long with a mortal once hoyt lora spat out the name you battled a sorcerer there was no magic in that bitch who scarred me when mama kills the sorcerer i can lap up his blood like a puppy does milk lilith laughed ruffled daveys hair thats my boy and dont be sure that demon hunter is without magic she reached for davey setting him on her lap i dont believe she could have hurt you so without it she was hurt at least perhaps mortally there you see always a bright side lilith kissed davey its midir who must do better didnt night slip through his fingers didnt the white magic defeat his lilith had to take a moment to calm herself over the outrage of her wizards incompetence id be rid of him if we had another nearly as powerful but i promise you this i swear this to you they will pay youll bathe in her blood come samhain my darling girl well all drink long and deep and when i rule youll be by my side comforted lora reached out will you stay awhile longer will you stay while i sleep of course were family after all b lair woke in stages her mind stirred first circling slowly around where she was what had happened her head began to ache in a low steady drumming then her eyes throbbed with it she became aware of other pain shoulder ribs belly legs as she lay quiet taking stock she realized there wasnt a spot on her that didnt hurt but it was manageable rather than the breath stealing pain that had flattened her the aftertaste of the potion glenna had poured down her coated her throat not horribly unpleasant she decided just sort of smoky and thick so that she wished for a gallon or two of water to clear it away cautiously she let her eyes open candlelight firelight so it was still shy of dawn she decided good she felt reasonably good all in all in fact she felt good enough to be hungry which had to be a positive sign she worked at sitting up just as she spotted larkin crossing back toward the bed from the far window hey go get some sleep he stopped just stared for a moment youre awake yeah and before you ask my names blair murphy im in geall and i got my ass whooped by a bunch of vampires do you think i could get something to eat youre hungry he all but sang the words as he rushed to the bed yeah maybe just a little midnight snack or whatever time it is youre having pain the grandmother of all headaches she admitted and some other twinges mostly i feel sort of groggy and dopey also she added with a quick wince i have an amazing need to pee so you know shoo for a minute instead he picked her up carried her to the chamber pot behind the painted screen i cant do this with you in here i just cant go outside the room and count to thirty she squirmed as her bladder strained make that forty come on give a girl a private moment he rolled his eyes but did as she asked in exactly forty seconds he was back in the room where she was taking a few hesitant steps he was at her side taking her arm in an instant glenna said you might be dizzy little bit little dizzy little wobbly and it hurts pretty much everywhere but it could be a whole lot worse in that i could be dead or craving a nice slug of blood at this moment i want to take a look with his help she limped to the mirror her left cheek was scraped from nose to temple and she was sporting two black eyes glenna had fashioned a kind of butterfly bandage to close the gash on her forehead she turned noted that while her shoulder was a mass of bruises they were already going the sickly yellowgreen of healing yeah couldve been worse she ran a hand down her own ribs pretty tender yet but nothing got busted theres a plus ive never been so frightened in all my life me either she met his eyes in the glass i dont know if i thanked you or dreamed i did on one of my trips to lala land but you saved me ill never forget watching you whip through those three vamps like they were nothing if id been sooner isnt this a lot about destiny this whole business if you were meant to be there sooner you wouldve been you were there in time and thats what counts blair he lowered his head to her good shoulder he spoke in a quiet murmur and in gaelic what was all that for later he straightened but for now ill get you some food i could use it feel like i havent eaten in days im not getting back in bed ill sit he helped her to the chair by the fire then brought over a blanket for her legs do you want the drapes open yeah sure listen after you get someone to throw some food together you should go catch some sleep for the rest of the night oh she blinked threw up a hand to block the glare of the sun through the glass i slept a bit he told her with a quick grin yeah well apparently so did i what time is it id say well past midday mid she blew out a breath guess my advanced healing powers have been getting a hell of a workout ill go see about some food if you promise to stay where ive put you gingerly she rubbed her aching knee im not going anywhere obviously he didnt take her at her word as glenna came in moments later you look better then i mustve looked like the wrath of god you did glenna set her case on a table opened it and blair gave it a long meaningful frown i really dont need any more of that magic tree bark well switch to something else double vision down to the regular kind head aches like a mother i can help with that glenna came over laid her fingers on blairs temples hows the shoulder achy worse than the ribs but theyre not too bad mustve cracked my knee pretty good too its a little wobbly considering it was about twice its normal size when larkin got you here a little wobblys good you know this is the first time hes left this room since he brought you back but he said he slept some i convinced him to lie down next to you for a while he blames himself its stupid its stupid i agree but thats only part of it hes watched over you all night because hes desperately in love with you hows the head now the what ohbetter she realized a lot better thanks oh god what am i going to do youll figure it out theyll be sending up some tea one of my infusions well add a little of this and that to it youll drink it all lets see what i can do about that shoulder if i stayed here in geall id be turning my back on what i was born for on what brought me to him in the first place glenna i cant whatever i feel whatever i want i cant not be what i am duty and love they can make their own nasty little wars cant they relax now try some yoga breathing youre a strong woman blair mind body heart a lot of people dont understand how difficult it can be to be a strong woman if i were taking bets id say larkins a man who does l ater when shed eaten and felt steadier she convinced larkin she needed to walk she sensed he was waiting to scoop her up at the first sign of weakness she did feel weak but in heart rather than body she had to tell him he deserved to be told that she couldnt make promises to him when what theyd been charged to do had been done she would have to leave him she knew what it was to be rejected and wished with everything inside her things could be different that she could be they walked to the courtyard with the fountain she could see from her window where the sun was strong and the air cool with the first brush of autumn only a month left he said and sat with her on a bench of deep blue marble well be ready aye we will in a few days moira will take her sword what if its not her what if its you it isnt he lifted his shoulder ive searched myself on that and id know if it was id have always known as in some part of her moira knows and thank god but your family this place youre tied to it by birth by blood true enough he took her hand idly toying with her fingers its the place of my birth and ill always miss it youllwhat miss it why were going to win just because i got slapped around doesnt mean theyre going to beat us no it doesnt and they wont he looked up from her fingers into her eyes and his were like gold steel because well fight to the last man to the last drop so why let me ask you a question one none of us have voiced as yet have all the vampires from your world come here to follow lilith no of course not then when this battles won the fight goes on youll have to hunt as youve always hunted here if some survive theyll be an army always to fight them the people of geall know what they are as the people of your world dont yes so he did understand i wish im sorry going back its not a choice for me if it werebut its not no it cant be a choice for you but it can be for me so ill be going back with you to fight beside you excuse me a stór did you think id let you get away from me you cant leave here why its moira who will rule and my father will advise her as need be theres my brother and my sisters husband to work the land and tend the horses she thought of his mother his sister brother of his father and the look on riddocks face when hed embraced larkin after his return you cant leave your family its hard yes to leave loved ones it should be hard i think and should only be done when it needs to be done it isnt could never be the way it was when your father left you blair the results the same its not no not when the leaving is with love all around and its true enough that a man often moves away from his parents its the way of things a natural order they move to the next town or across the country not to another world trying to talk me out of its a waste of breath my minds been made up to it for a while now moira knows it though we havent spoken of it right out as does my mother he looked straight into her eyes do you think i would fight risk everything then step aside from the one that matters most in this world in any world to me id give my life for this if thats whats needed but if i live youll belong to me and thats the end of it the end of it im thinking as you have no close family at home we could be married here we can do the whole business again in your chicago if you like married i didnt say i would marry you anybody of
