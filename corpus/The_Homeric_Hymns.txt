homeric hymns the dedication to henry butcher a little token of a long friendship preface to translate the hymns usually called homeric had long been my wish and at the publishers suggestion i undertook the work though not in partnership on this occasion with my friend mr henry butcher professor of greek in the university of edinburgh i have been fortunate in receiving his kind assistance in correcting the proofs of the longer and most of the minor hymns mr burnet professor of greek in the university of st andrews has also most generously read the proofs of the translation it is of course to be understood that these scholars are not responsible for the slips which may have wandered into my version the work of one whose greek has long rusted in disuse indeed i must confess that the rendering etin for greek text is retained in spite of mr butcher who is also not wholly satisfied with gledes of light and with shieling for a pastoral summer station in the hills but i know no word for it in english south of tweed mr a s murray the head of the classical department in the british museum has also been good enough to read and suggest corrections in the preliminary essays while mr cecil smith of the british museum has obligingly aided in selecting the works of art here reproduced the text of the hymns is well known to be corrupt in places impossible and much mended by conjecture i have usually followed gemoll die homerischen hymnen leipzig but have sometimes preferred a ms reading or emendations by mr tyrrell by mr verral or the admirable suggestions of mr allen my chief object has been to find in cases of doubt the phrases least unworthy of the poets too often it is impossible to be certain as to what they really wrote i have had beside me the excellent prose translation by mr john edgar thin edinburgh as is inevitable we do not always agree in the sense of certain phrases but i am far from claiming superiority for my own attempts the method employed in the essays the anthropological method of interpreting beliefs and rites is still of course on its trial what can best be said as to its infirmities and the dangers of its abuse and of systemmaking in the present state of the evidence will be found in sir alfred lyalls asiatic studies vol ii chaps iii and iv readers inclined to pursue the subject should read mr l r farnells cults of the greek states clarendon press mr j g frazers golden bough his pausanias and mr hartlands work on the myth of perseus these books it must be observed are by no means always in agreement with my own provisional theories essays introductory the socalled homeric hymns the existing collection of the hymns is of unknown editorship unknown date and unknown purpose says baumeister why any man should have collected the little preludes of five or six lines in length and of purely conventional character while he did not copy out the longer poems to which they probably served as preludes is a mystery the celebrated wolf who opened the path which leads modern homerologists to such an extraordinary number of divergent theories thought rightly that the great alexandrian critics before the christian era did not recognise the hymns as homeric they did not employ the hymns as illustrations of homeric problems though it is certain that they knew the hymns for one collection did exist in the third century bc diodorus and pausanias later also cite the poet in the hymns homer in the hymns and the pseudoherodotus ascribes the hymns to homer in his life of that author thucydides in the periclean age regards homer as the blind chian minstrel who composed the hymn to the delian apollo a good proof of the relative antiquity of that piece but not evidence of course that our whole collection was then regarded as homeric baumeister agrees with wolf that the brief hymns were recited by rhapsodists as preludes to the recitation of homeric or other cantos thus in hymn xxxi the poet says that he is going on to chant the renowns of men half divine other preludes end with a prayer to the god for luck in the competition of reciters this then is the plausible explanation of most of the brief hymns they were preludes to epic recitations but the question as to the long narrative hymns with which the collection opens is different these were themselves rhapsodies recited at delphi at delos perhaps in cyprus the long hymn to aphrodite in athens as the hymn to pan who was friendly in the persian invasion and so forth that the pisistratidae organised homeric recitations at athens is certain enough and baumeister suspects in xiv xxiii xxx xxxi xxxii the hand of onomacritus the forger of oracles that strange accomplice of the pisistratidae the hymn to aphrodite is just such a lay as the phaeacian minstrel sang at the feast of alcinous in the hearing of odysseus finally baumeister supposes our collection not to have been made by learned editors like aristarchus and zenodotus but committed confusedly from memory to papyrus by some amateur the conventional attribution of the hymns to homer in spite of linguistic objections and of many allusions to things unknown or unfamiliar in the epics is merely the result of the tendency to set down masterless compositions to a wellknown name anything of epic characteristics was allotted to the master of epic in the same way an unfathered joke of lockharts was attributed to sydney smith and the process is constantly illustrated in daily conversation the word greek text hymn had not originally a religious sense it merely meant a lay nobody calls the theocritean idylls on heracles and the dioscuri hymns but they are quite as much hymns in our sense as the hymn on aphrodite or on hermes to the english reader familiar with the iliad and odyssey the hymns must appear disappointing if he come to them with an expectation of discovering merits like those of the immortal epics he will not find that they stand to the iliad as miltons ode to the nativity stands to paradise lost there is in the hymns in fact no scope for the epic knowledge of human nature in every mood and aspect we are not so much interested in the homeric gods as in the homeric mortals yet the hymns are chiefly concerned not with men but with gods and their mythical adventures however the interest of the hymn to demeter is perfectly human for the goddess is in sorrow and is mingling with men the hymn to aphrodite too is homeric in its grace and charm and divine sense of human limitations of old age that comes on the fairest as tithonus and anchises of death and disease that wait for all the life of the gods is one long holiday the end of our holiday is always near at hand the hymn to dionysus representing him as a youth in the fulness of beauty is of a charm which was not attainable while early art represented the god as a mature man but literary art in the homeric age was in advance of sculpture and painting the chief merit of the delian hymn is in the concluding description of the assembled ionians happy seafarers like the phaeacians in the morning of the world the confusions of the pythian hymn to apollo make it less agreeable and the humour of the hymn to hermes is archaic all those pieces however have delightfully fresh descriptions of sea and land of shadowy dells flowering meadows dusky fragrant caves of the mountain glades where the wild beasts fawn in the train of the winsome goddess and the high still peaks where pan wanders among the nymphs and the glens where artemis drives the deer and the spacious halls and airy palaces of the immortals the hymns are fragments of the work of a school which had a great master and great traditions they also illustrate many aspects of greek religion in the essays which follow the religious aspect of the hymns is chiefly dwelt upon i endeavour to bring out what greek religion had of human and sacred while i try to explain its less majestic features as no less human as derived from the earliest attempts at speculation and at mastering the secrets of the world in these chapters regions are visited which scholars have usually neglected or ignored it may seem strange to seek the origins of apollo and of the renowned eleusinian mysteries in the tales and rites of the bora and the nanga in the beliefs and practices of pawnees and larrakeah yao and khond but these tribes too are human and what they now or lately were the remote ancestors of the greeks must once have been all races have sought explanations of their own ritual in the adventures of the dream time the alcheringa when beings of a more potent race gods or heroes were on earth and achieved and endured such things as the rites commemorate and the things thus endured and achieved as i try to show are everywhere of much the same nature whether they are now commemorated by painted savages in the bora or the medicine dance or whether they were exhibited and proclaimed by the eumolpidae in a splendid hall to the pious of hellas and of rome my attempt may seem audacious and to many scholars may even be repugnant but it is on these lines i venture to think that the darker problems of greek religion and rite must be approached they are all survivals however fairly draped and adorned by the unique genius of the most divinely gifted race of mankind the method of translation is that adopted by professor butcher and myself in the odyssey and by me in a version of theocritus as well as by mr ernest myers who preceded us in his pindar that method has lately been censured and like all methods is open to objection but i confess that neither criticism nor example has converted me to the use of modern colloquial english and i trust that my persistence in using poetical english words in the translation of greek poetry will not greatly offend i cannot render a speech of anchises thus if you really are merely a mortal and if a woman of the normal kind was your mother while your father as you lay it down was the well known otreus and if you come here all through an undying person hermes and if you are to be known henceforward as my wife why then nobody mortal or immortal shall interfere with my intention to take instant advantage of the situation that kind of speech though certainly longwinded may be the manner in which a contemporary pastoralist would address a goddess in a coming on humour but the situation does not occur in the prose of our existence and i must prefer to translate the poet in a manner more congenial if less up to date for one rare word etin greek text i must apologise it seems to me to express the vagueness of the unfamiliar monster and is old scots as in the tale of the red etin of ireland the hymn to apollo the hymn to apollo presents innumerable difficulties both of text which is very corrupt and as to the whole nature and aim of the composition in this version it is divided into two portions the first dealing with the birth of apollo and the foundation of his shrine in the isle of delos the second concerned with the establishment of his oracle and fane at delphi the division is made merely to lighten the considerable strain on the attention of the english reader i have no pretensions to decide whether the second portion was by the author of the first or is an imitation by another hand or is contemporary or a later addition or a mere compilation from several sources the first part seems to find a natural conclusion about lines the blind singer who is quoted here by thucydides appears at that point to say farewell to his cherished ionian audience what follows in our second part appeals to hearers interested in the apollo of crisa and of the delphian temple the pythian apollo according to a highly ingenious but scarcely persuasive theory of mr verralls this interest is unfriendly our second part is no hymn at all but a sequel tacked on for political purposes only and valuable for these purposes because so tacked on from line to the end we have this sequel the story of apollos dealings as delphinian and as pythian all this following on detached fragments of enigmatic character and containing also the intercalated myth about the birth of typhaon from heras anger in the politically inspired sequel there is according to mr verrall no living zeal for the honour of pytho delphi the threat of the god to his cretan ministers beware of arrogance or must be a prophecy after the event now such an event occurred early in the sixth century when the crisaeans were supplanted by the people of the town that had grown up round the oracle at delphi in them and in the oracle under their management the poet shows no interest mr verrall thinks none in the many mystic peculiarities of the shrine it is quite in contradiction with delphian tradition to represent as the hymn does trophonius and agamedes as the original builders many other points are noted such as the derivation of pytho from a word meaning rot to show that the hymnist was rather disparaging than celebrating the delphian sanctuary taking the hymn as a whole more is done for delos in three lines says mr verrall than for pytho or delphi in three hundred as a whole the spirit of the piece is much more delian ionian than delphic so mr verrall regards the cento as a religious pasquinade against the sanctuary on parnassus a pasquinade emanating from athens under the pisistratidae who being ionian leaders had a grudge against the dorian delphi a comparatively modern unlucky and from the first unsatisfactory institution athenians are interested in the farseen altar of the seamans dolphin god on the shore rather than in his inland pythian habitation all this with much more is decidedly ingenious if accepted it might lead the way to a general attack on the epics as tendenz pieces works with a political purpose or doctored for a political purpose but how are we to understand the uses of the pasquinade hymn was it published so to speak to amuse and aid the pisistratidae does such remote antiquity show us any examples of such handling of sacred things in poetry might we not argue that apollos threat to the crisaeans was meant by the poet as a friendly warning and is prior to the fall of crisa one is reminded of the futile ingenuity with which german critics following their favourite method have analysed the fatal casket letters of mary stuart into letters to her husband darnley or to murray or by darnley to mary with scraps of her diary and false interpolations the enemies of the queen coming into possession of her papers after the affair of carberry hill falsified the casket letters into their present appearance of unity of course historical facts make this ingenuity unavailing we regret the circumstance in the interest of the queens reputation but welcome these illustrative examples of what can be done in germany a fortunately all teutons are not so ingenious baumeister has fallen on those who in place of two hymns delian and pythian to apollo offer us halfadozen fragments by presenting an array of discordant conjectures as to the number and nature of these scraps he demonstrates the purely wilful and arbitrary nature of the critical method employed b thus one learned person believes in two perfect little poems two larger hymns three lacerated fragments of hymns one lacking its beginning the other wofully deprived of its end another savant detects no less than eight fragments with interpolations though perhaps no biblical critic ejusdem farinae has yet detected eight isaiahs there are about ten other theories of similar plausibility and value meanwhile baumeister argues that the pythian hymn our second part is an imitation of the delian by a follower not of homer but of hesiod thus the hesiodic school was closely connected with delphi the homeric with ionia so that delphi rarely occurs in the epics in fact only thrice i greek text greek text the local knowledge is accurate pythian hymn sqq these are local legends and knowledge of the curious chariot ritual of onchestus the muses are united with the graces as in a work of art in the delphian temple the poet chooses the hesiodic and unhomeric myth of heaven and earth and their progeny a myth current also in polynesia australia and new zealand the poet is full of inquiry as to origins even etymological as is hesiod like hesiod and mr max muller origines rerum ex nominibus explicat finally the second poet and here every one must agree is a much worse poet than the first as for the prophetic word of warning to the crisaeans and its fulfilment baumeister urges that the people of cirrha the seaport not of crisa were punished in olympiad grote ii turning to gemoll we find him maintaining that the two parts were in ancient times regarded as one hymn in the age of aristophanes if so we can only reply if we agree with baumeister that in the age of aristophanes or earlier there was a plentiful lack of critical discrimination as to baumeisters theory that the second part is hesiodic gemoll finds a hesiodic reminiscence in the first part line while there are homeric reminiscences in the second part thus do the learned differ among themselves and an ordinary reader feels tempted to rely on his own literary taste according to that criterion i think we probably have in the hymn the work of a good poet in the early part and in the latter part or second hymn the work of a bad poet selecting unmanageable passages of myth and handling them pedantically and ill at all events we have here work visibly third rate which cannot be said in my poor opinion about the immense mass of the iliad and odyssey the great alexandrian critics did not use the hymns as illustrative material in their discussion of homer their instinct was correct and we must not start the consideration of the homeric question from these much neglected pieces we must not study obscurum per obscurius the genius of the epic soars high above such myths as those about pytho typhaon and the apollo who is alternately a dolphin and a meteor soars high above pedantry and bad etymology in the epics we breathe a purer air descending as it did from the mythology of savages the mythic store of greece was rich in legends such as we find among the lowest races homer usually ignores them hesiod and the authors of the hymns are less noble in their selections for this reason and for many others we regard the hymns on the whole as posthomeric while their collector by inserting the hymn to ares shows little proof of discrimination only the methods of modern german scholars such as wilamowitz mollendorf and of englishmen like mr walter leaf can find in the epics marks of such confusion dislocation and interpolations as confront us in the hymn to apollo i may refer to my work homer and the epic for a defence of the unity of iliad and odyssey for example mr verrall certainly makes it highly probable that the pythian hymn at least in its concluding words of the god is not earlier than the sixth century but no proof of anything like this force is brought against the antiquity of the iliad or odyssey as to the myths in the hymns i would naturally study them from the standpoint of anthropology and in the light of comparison of the legends of much more backward peoples than the greeks but that light at present is for me broken and confused i have been led to conclusions varying from those of such students as mr tylor and mr spencer and these conclusions should be stated before they are applied to the myth of apollo i am not inclined like them to accept animism or the ghost theory as the masterkey to the origin of religion though animism is a great tributary stream to myself it now appears that among the lowest known races we find present a fluid mass of beliefs both high and low from the belief in a moral creative being a judge of men to the pettiest fable which envisages him as a medicineman or even as a beast or bird in my opinion the higher belief may very well be the earlier while i can discern the processes by which the lower myths were evolved and were attached to a worthier preexisting creed i cannot see how if the lower faiths came first the higher faith was ever evolved out of them by very backward savages on the other side in the case of australia mr tylor writes for a long time after captain cooks visit the information as to native religious ideas is of the scantiest this was inevitable for our information has only been obtained with the utmost difficulty and under promises of secrecy by later inquirers who had entirely won the confidence of the natives and had been initiated into their mysteries mr tylor goes on in the same sentence but since the period of european colonists and missionaries a crowd of alleged native names for the supreme deity and a great evil deity have been recorded which if really of native origin would show the despised black fellow as in possession of theological generalisations as to the formation and conservation of the universe and the nature of good and evil comparable with those of his white supplanter in the land a mr tylor then proceeds to argue that these ideas have been borrowed from missionaries i have tried to reply to this argument by proving for example that the name of baiame one of these deities could not have been borrowed as mr tylor seems inclined to hold from a missionary tract published sixteen years after we first hear of baiame who again was certainly dominant before the arrival of missionaries i have adduced other arguments of the same tendency and i will add that the earliest english explorers and missionaries in virginia and new england report from america beliefs absolutely parallel in many ways to the creeds now reported from australia among these notions are ideas of moral judgment and retribution after death which in australia mr tylor marks as imported b in my opinion the certainty that the beliefs in america were not imported is another strong argument for their native character when they are found with such striking resemblances among the very undeveloped savages of australia savages mr hartland says in a censure of my theory are guiltless of christian teaching if mr hartland is right mr tylor is wrong the ideas whatever else they are are unimported yet teste mr tylor the ideas are comparable with those of the black mans white supplanters i would scarcely go so far if we take however the best ideas attributed to the blacks and hold them disengaged from the accretion of puerile fables with which they are overrun then there are discovered notions of high religious value undeniably analogous to some christian dogmas but the sanction of the australian gods is as powerfully lent to silly or cruel or needless ritual as to some moral ideas of weight and merit in brief as far as i am able to see all sorts of ideas the lowest and the highest are held at once confusedly by savages and the same confusion survives in ancient greek belief as far back as we can trace him man had a wealth of religious and mythical conceptions to choose from and different peoples as they advanced in civilisation gave special prominence to different elements in the primal stock of beliefs the choice of israel was unique greece retained far more of the lower ancient ideas but gave to them a beauty of grace and form which is found among no other race if this view be admitted for the moment and for the arguments sake we may ask how it applies to the myths of apollo among the ideas which even now prevail among the backward peoples still in the neolithic stage of culture we may select a few conceptions there is the conception of a great primal anthropomorphic being who was in the beginning or at least about whose beginning legend is silent he made all things he existed on earth in some cases teaching men the arts of life and rules of conduct social and moral in those instances he retired from earth and now dwells on high still concerned with the behaviour of the tribes this is a lofty conception but it is entangled with a different set of legends this primal being is mixed up with strange persons of a race earlier than man half human half bestial many things in some cases almost all things are mythically regarded not as created but as the results of adventures and metamorphoses among the members of this original race now in new zealand polynesia greece and elsewhere but not to my knowledge in the very most backward peoples the place of this original race old old ones is filled by great natural objects earth sky sea forests regarded as beings of human parts and passions the present universe is mythically arranged in regard to their early adventures the separation of sky and earth and so forth where this belief prevails we find little or no trace of the primal maker and master though we do find strange early metaphysics of curiously abstract quality maoris zunis polynesians as far as our knowledge goes greek mythology springs partly from this stratum of barbaric as opposed to strictly savage thought ouranos and gaea cronos and the titans represent the primal beings who have their counterpart in maori and wintu legend but these in the greece of the epics and hesiod have long been subordinated to zeus and the olympians who are envisaged as triumphant gods of a younger generation there is no creator but zeus how we do not know has come to be regarded as a being relatively supreme and as on occasion the guardian of morality of course his conduct in myth is represented as a constant violation of the very rules of life which he expects mankind to observe i am disposed to look on this essential contradiction as the result of a series of mythical accretions on an original conception of zeus in his higher capacity we can see how the accretions arose man never lived consistently on the level of his best original ideas savages also have endless myths of baiame or daramulun or bunjil in which these personages though interested in human behaviour are puerile cruel absurd lustful and so on man will sport thus with his noblest intuitions in the same way in christian europe we may contrast dunbars pious ballat of our lady with his kynd kittok in which god has his eye on the soul of an intemperate alewife who has crept into paradise god lukit and saw her lattin in and leugh his heart sair examples of this kind of sportive irreverence are common enough their root is in human nature and they could not be absent in the mythology of savage or of ancient peoples to zeus the myths of this kind would come to be attached in several ways as a naturegod of the heaven he marries the earth the tendency of men being to claim descent from a god for each family with this claim a myth of a separate divine amour was needed where there had existed totemism or belief in kinship with beasts the myth of the amour of a wolf bull serpent swan and so forth was attached to the legend of zeus zeus had been that swan serpent wolf or bull once more ritual arose in great part from the rites of sympathetic magic this or that mummery was enacted by men for a magical purpose to secure success in the chase agriculture or war when the performers asked why do we do thus and thus the answer was zeus first did so or demeter or apollo did so on a certain occasion about that occasion a myth was framed and finally there was no profligacy cruelty or absurdity of which the god was not guilty yet all the time he punished adultery inhospitality perjury incest cannibalism and other excesses of which in legend he was always setting the example we know from xenophanes plato and st augustine how mens consciences were tormented by this unceasing contradiction this overgrowth of myth on the stock of an idea originally noble it is thus that i would attempt to account for the contradictory conceptions of zeus for example as to apollo i do not think that mythologists determined to find in apollo some deified aspect of nature have laid stress enough on his counterparts in savage myth we constantly find in america in the andaman isles and in australia that subordinate to the primal being there exists another who enters into much closer relations with mankind he is often concerned with healing and with prophecy or with the inspiration of conjurers or shamans sometimes he is merely an underling as in the case of the massachusetts kiehtan and his more familiar subordinate hobamoc but frequently this gobetween of god and man is like apollo the son of the primal being often an unbegotten son or his messenger andaman noongaburrah kurnai kamilaroi and other australian tribes he reports to the somewhat otiose primal being about mens conduct and he sometimes superintends the mysteries i am disposed to regard the prophetic and oracular apollo who as the hymn to hermes tells us alone knows the will of father zeus as the greek modification of this personage in savage theology where this son is found in australia i by no means regard him as a savage refraction from christian teaching about a mediator for christian teaching in fact has not been accepted least of all by the highly conservative sorcerers or shamans or wirreenuns of the tribes european observers of course have been struck by and have probably exaggerated in some instances the christian analogy but if they had been as well acquainted with ancient greek as with christian theology they would have remarked that the andaman american and australian mediators are infinitely more akin to apollo in his relations with zeus and with men than to any person about whom missionaries can preach but the most devoted believer in borrowing will not say that when the australian mediator tundun son of mungungnaur turns into a porpoise the kurnai have borrowed from our hymn of the dolphin apollo it is absurd to maintain that the son of the god the gobetween of god and men in savage theology is borrowed from missionaries while this being has so much more in common with apollo from whom he cannot conceivably be borrowed than with christ the tundunporpoise story seems to have arisen in gratitude to the porpoise which drives fishes inshore for the natives to catch neither tharamulun nor hobamoc australian and american gods of healing and soothsaying who appear to men as serpents are borrowed from asclepius or from the python of apollo the processes have been quite different and in apollo the oracular son of zeus who declares his counsel to men i am apt to see a beautiful greek modification of the type of the mediating son of the primal being of savage belief adorned with many of the attributes of the sun god from whom however he is fundamentally distinct apollo i think is an adorned survival of the son of the god of savage theology he was not at first a nature god solar or not this opinion if it seems valid helps to account in part for the animal metamorphoses of apollo a survival from the mental confusion of savagery such a confusion in greece makes it necessary for the wise son of zeus to seek information as in the hymn to hermes from an old clown this medley of ideas in the mind of a civilised poet who believes that apollo is allknowing in the counsels of eternity is as truly mythological as dunbars god who laughs his heart sore at an alehouse jest dunbar and the author of the hymn and the savage with his tale of tundun or daramulun have all quite contradictory sets of ideas alternately present to their minds the mediaeval poet of course being conscious of the contradiction which makes the essence of his humour such as it is to greece in its loftier moods apollo was despite his myth a noble source of inspiration of art and of conduct but the contradiction in the low myth and high doctrine of apollo could never be eradicated under any influence less potent than that of christianity if this theory of apollos origin be correct many pages of learned works on mythology need to be rewritten the hymn to hermes hermes with the boy dionysos statue by praxiteles found at olympia langjpg the hymn to hermes is remarkable for the corruption of the text which appears even to present lacunae the english reader will naturally prefer the lively and charming version of shelley to any other the poet can tell and adorn the story without visibly floundering in the pitfalls of a dislocated text if we may judge by line and if greek musical tradition be correct the date of the hymn cannot be earlier than the fortieth olympiad about that period terpander is said to have given the lyre seven strings as mercury does in the poem in place of the previous four strings the date of terpander is dubious but probably the sevenstringed lyre had long been in common use before the poet attributed the invention to hermes the same argument applies to the antiquity of writing assigned by poets as the invention of various mythical and prehistoric heroes but the poets were not careful archaeologists and regarded anachronisms as genially as did shakespeare or scott moreover the fact that terpander did invent the seven chords is not beyond dispute historically while mythically apollo and amphion are credited with the idea that hermes invented firesticks seems a fable which robs prometheus of the honour we must not look for any kind of consistency in myth the learned differ as to the precise purpose of the hymn and some even exclude the invention of the cithara to myself it seems that the poet chiefly revels in a very familiar subject of savage humour notably among the zulus the extraordinary feats and tricks of a tiny and apparently feeble and helpless person or animal such as brer rabbit the triumph of astuteness over strength a triumph here assigned to the infancy of a god is the theme hermes is here a rustic doublure of apollo as he was in fact mainly a rural deity though he became the messenger of the gods and the guide of souls outworn in these respects he answers to the australian grogoragally in his double relation to the father boyma and to men living and dead a as a gobetween of gods and men hermes may be a doublure of apollo but as the hymn shows he aspired in vain to apollos oracular function in one respect his behaviour has a singular savage parallel his shoes woven of twigs so as not to show the direction in which he is proceeding answer to the equally shapeless feather sandals of the blacks who go kurdaitcha that is as avengers of blood i have nowhere else found this practice as to the shoes which after all cannot conceal the direction of the spoor from a native tracker b the trick of driving the cattle backwards answers to the old legend that bruce reversed the shoes of his horse when he fled from the court of edward i the humour of the hymn is rather rustic cattle theft is the chief joke cattle theft by a baby the god divine as he is feels his mouth water for roast beef a primitive conception in fact throughout this hymn we are far from the solemn regard paid to apollo from the wistful beauty of the hymn to demeter and from the gladness and melancholy of the hymn to aphrodite sportive myths are treated sportively as in the story of ares and aphrodite in the odyssey myths contained all conceivable elements among others that of humour to which the poet here abandons himself the statues and symbols of hermes were inviolably sacred as guide of souls he played the part of comforter and friend he brought men all things lucky and fortunate he made the cattle bring forth abundantly he had the golden wand of wealth but he was also tricksy as a brownie or as puck and that fairy aspect of his character and legend he being the midnight thief whose maraudings account for the unexplained disappearances of things is the chief topic of the gay and reckless hymn even the gods even angry apollo are moved to laughter for over sport and playfulness too greek religion throws her sanction at the dishonesties of commerce clearly regarded as a form of theft hermes winks his laughing eyes line this is not an early socialistic protest against commercialism the early traders like the vikings were alternately pirates and hucksters as opportunity served every occupation must have its heavenly patron its departmental deity and hermes protects thieves and raiders minions of the moon clerks of st nicholas his very birth is a stolen thing the darkling fruit of a divine amour in a dusky cavern il chasse de race the hymn to aphrodite the hymn to aphrodite is in a literary sense one of the most beautiful and quite the most homeric in the collection by homeric i mean that if we found the adventure of anchises occurring at length in the iliad by way of an episode perhaps in a speech of aeneas it would not strike us as inconsistent in tone though occasionally in phrase indeed the germ of the hymn occurs in iliad b aeneas whom holy aphrodite bore to the embraces of anchises on the knowes of ida a goddess couching with a mortal again in e aeneas is spoken of as the son of aphrodite and the neatherd anchises the celebrated prophecy of the future rule of the children of aeneas over the trojans y probably made like many prophecies after the event appears to indicate the claim of a royal house at ilios and is regarded as of later date than the general context of the epic the aeneid is constructed on this hint the romans claiming to be of trojan descent through aeneas the date of the composition cannot be fixed from considerations of the homeric tone thus lines may be a reminiscence of odyssey greek text and other like suggestions are offered the conjectures as to date vary from the time of homer to that of the cypria of mimnermus the references to the bitterness of loveless old age are in his vein of anacreon or even of herodotus and the tragedians the words greek text greek text and other indications are relied on for a late date and there are obvious coincidences with the hymn to demeter as in line demeter f gemoll however takes this hymn to be the earlier about the place of composition cyprus or asia minor the learned are no less divided than about the date many of the grounds on which their opinions rest appear unstable the relations of aphrodite to the wild beasts under her wondrous spell for instance need not be borrowed from circe with her attendant beasts if not of homers age the hymn is markedly successful as a continuation of the homeric tone and manner modern puritanism naturally condemns aphrodite as it condemns helen but homer is lenient helen is under the spell of the gods an unwilling and repentant tool of destiny and aphrodite too is driven by zeus into the arms of a mortal she is greek text shamefast and her adventure is to her a bitter sorrow the dread of anchises a man is not long of life who lies with a goddess refers to a belief found from glenfinlas to samoa and new caledonia that the embraces of the spiritual ladies of the woodlands are fatal to men the legend has been told to me in the highlands and to mr stevenson in samoa while my cousin mr j j atkinson actually knew a kaneka who died in three days after an amour like that of anchises the breton ballad le sieur nan turns on the same opinion the amour of thomas the rhymer is a mediaeval analogue of the idaean legend aphrodite has better claims than most greek gods to oriental elements herodotus and pausanias i xiv iii i look on her as a being first worshipped by the assyrians then by the paphians of cyprus and phoenicians at askelon who communicated the cult to the cythereans cyprus is one of her most ancient sites and ishtar and ashtoreth are among her oriental analogues she springs from the sea the wandering waters knew her the winds and the viewless ways and the roses grew rosier and bluer the seablue streams of the bays but the charm of aphrodite is greek even without foreign influence greek polytheism would have developed a goddess of love as did the polytheism of the north frigga and of the aztecs the rites of adonis the vernal year are even in the name of the hero oriental the name adonis is the phoenician adon lord the decay and revival of vegetation inspires the adonis rite which is unhomeric and was superfluous where the descent and return of persephone typified the same class of ideas to whatever extent contaminated by phoenician influence aphrodite in homer is purely greek in grace and happy humanity the origins of aphrodite unlike the origins of apollo cannot be found in a state of low savagery she is a departmental goddess and as such as ruling a province of human passion she belongs to a late development of religion to christianity she was a scandal one of the scandals which are absent from the most primitive of surviving creeds polytheism as if of set purpose puts every conceivable aspect of life good or bad under divine sanction this is much less the case in the religion of the very backward races we do not know historically what the germs of religion were if we look at the most archaic examples for instance in australia or the andaman islands we find neither sacrifice nor departmental deities religion there is mainly a belief in a primal being not necessarily conceived as spiritual but rather as an undying magnified man of indefinitely extensive powers he dwells above the vaulted sky beyond which lies the mysterious home of that great and powerful being who is bunjil baiame or daramulun in different tribal languages but who in all is known by a name the equivalent of the only one used by the kurnai which is munganngaur or our father this father is conceived of in some places as a very great old man with a long beard enthroned on or growing into a crystal throne often he is served by a son or sons apollo hermes frequently regarded as spiritually begotten elsewhere looked on as the son of the wife of the deity and as father of the tribe a scandals connected with fatherhood amorous intrigues so abundant in greek mythology are usually not reported among the lowest races in one known case the deity pundjel or bunjil takes the wives of karween who is changed into a crane b this is one of the many savage aetiological myths which account for the peculiarities of animals as a result of metamorphosis in the manner of ovid it has been connected with the legend of bunjil who is thus envisaged not as our father beyond the vault of heaven who still inspires poets c but as a wandering shapeshifting medicineman zeus the heavenly father of course appears times without number in the same contradictory aspect but such anecdotes are either not common or are not frequently reported in the faiths of the most archaic of known races much more frequently we find the totemistic conception all the kindreds with animal names why adopted we do not know are apt to explain these designations by descent from the animals selected or by metamorphosis of the primal beasts into men this collides with the other notions of descent from or creation or manufacture out of clay by the primal being father ours such contradictions are nothing to the savage theologian who is no reconciler or apologist but when reconciliation and apology are later found to be desirable as in greece it is easy to explain that we are descended both from our father and from a swan cow ant serpent dog wolf or what you will that beast was our father say father zeus in animal disguise thus greek legends of bestial amours of a god are probably in origin not primitive but scandals produced in the effort to reconcile contradictory myths the result is a worse scandal an accretion of more low myths about a conception of the primal being which was relatively lofty and pure again as aristocracies arose the chief families desired to be sons of the father in a special sense not as common men are her majestys lineage may thus be traced to woden now each such descent required a separate divine amour and a new scandalous story of zeus or apollo though zeus may originally have been as celibate as the australian baiame or noorele are in some legends once more syncretism came in as a mythopoeic influence say that several australian nations becoming more polite amalgamated into a settled people then we should have several gods the chief beings of various tribes say noorele bunjil mungan ngaur baiame daramulun mangarrah mulkari pinmeheal the most imposing god of the dominant tribe might be elevated to the sovereignty of zeus but in the new administration places must be found for the other old tribal gods they are therefore set over various departments love war agriculture medicine poetry commerce while one or more of the sons take the places of apollo and hermes there appears to be a very early example of syncretism in australia daramulun papang our father is master of all on the coast near shoalhaven river baiame is master of all far north on the barwan but the locally intermediate tribe of the wiraijuri or wiradthuri have adopted baiame and reduced daramulun to an exploded bugbear a merely nominal superintendent of the mysteries and the southern coast murring have rejected baiame altogether or never knew him while making daramulun supreme one obvious method of reconciling various tribal gods in a syncretic olympus is the genealogical all are children of zeus for example or grandchildren or brothers and sisters fancy then provides an amour to account for each relationship zeus loved leto leda europa and so forth thus a god originally innocent and even moral becomes a perfect pattern of vice and the eternal contradiction vexes the souls of xenophanes plato and st augustine sacrifices even human sacrifices wholly unknown to the most archaic faiths were made to ghosts of men and especially of kings in the case of human sacrifice thence they were transferred to gods and behold a new scandal when men began to reflect under more civilised conditions thus all these legends of divine amours and sins or most of them including the wanton legend of aphrodite and all the human sacrifices which survived to the disgrace of greek religion are really degrading accessories to the most archaic beliefs they are products not of the most rudimentary savage existence but of the evolution through the lower and higher barbarism the worst features of savage ritual are different taking the lines of sorcery of cruel initiations and perhaps of revival of the licence of promiscuity or of group marriage of these things the traces are not absent from greek faith but they are comparatively inconspicuous buffoonery as we have seen exists in all grades of civilised or savage rites and was not absent from the popular festivals of the mediaeval church religion throwing her mantle over every human field of action as over folk medicine on these lines i venture to explain what seem to me the strange and repugnant elements of the religion of a people so refined and so capable of high moral ideas as the greeks aphrodite is personified desire but religion did not throw her mantle over desire alone the cloistered life the frank charm of maidenhood were as dear to the greek genius and were consecrated by the examples of athene artemis and hestia she presides over the pure element of the fire of the hearth just as in the household did the daughter of the king or chief hers are the first libations at feasts xxviii though in homer they are poured forth to hermes we may explain the gods of the minor hymns in the same way pan for instance as the son of hermes inherits the wild frolicsome rural aspect of his character the dioscuri answer to the vedic asvins twin rescuers of men in danger on land or sea perhaps the evening and morning star dionysus is another aspect of the joy of life and of the world and the vintaging moon and sun selene and helios appear as quite distinct from artemis and apollo gaea the earth is equally distinct from demeter the hymn to ares is quite unhomeric in character and is oddly conceived in the spirit of the scottish poltroon who cries to his friend haud me haud me or ill fecht the wargod is implored to moderate the martial eagerness of the poet the original collector here showed lack of discrimination at no time however was ares a popular god in greece in homer he is a braggart and coward the hymn to demeter the beautiful hymn to demeter an example of greek religious faith in its most pensive and most romantic aspects was found in the last century in moscow inter pullos et porcos latitabat the song of the rural deity had found its way into the haunts of the humble creatures whom she protected a discovery even more fortunate in led sir charles newton to a little sacellum or family chapel near cnidos on a platform of rock beneath a cliff and looking to the mediterranean were the ruins of the ancient shrine the votive offerings the lamps long without oil or flame the curses or dirae inscribed on thin sheets of lead and directed against thieves or rivals the head of the statue itself already known was also discovered votive offerings cheap curses objects of folklore rite and of sympathetic magic these are connected with the popular the peasant aspect of the religion of demeter she it is to whom pigs are sacrificed who makes the fields fertile with scattered fragments of their flesh and her rustic effigy at theocrituss feast of the harvest home stands smiling with corn and poppies in her hands mourning demeter marble statue from knidos in the british museum langjpg but the cnidian shrine had once another treasure the beautiful melancholy statue of the seated demeter of the uplifted eyes the mourning mother the weary seeker for the lost maiden her child persephone far from the ruins above the sea beneath the scorched seaward wall of rock far from the aromatic fragrance of the rocknourished flowers from the bees and the playful lizards demeter now occupies her place in the great halls of the british museum like the hymn this melancholy and tender work of art is imperfect but the sentiment is thereby rather increased than impaired the ancients buried things broken with the dead that the shadows of tool or weapon or vase might be set free to serve the shadows of their masters in the land of the souls broken as they too are the hymn and the statue are free among the dead and eloquent of the higher religion that in greece attached itself to the lost maiden and the sorrowing mother demeter in religion was more than a fertiliser of the fields kore the maiden was more than the buried pig or the seed sown to await its resurrection or the harvest idol fashioned of cornstalks more even than a symbol of the winter sleep and vernal awakening of the year and the life of nature she became the dread persephone of the odyssey a queen over death and the dead in her winter retreat below the earth she was the bride of the lord of many guests and the ruler of the souls of men outworn in this office odysseus in homer knows her though neither iliad nor odyssey recognises kore as the maiden spring the daughter and companion of demeter as goddess of grain christianity even did not quite dethrone persephone she lives in two forms first as the harvest effigy made of cornstalks bound together the last gleanings secondly as the fairy queen proserpina who carried thomas the rhymer from beneath the eildon tree to that land which lies beyond the stream of slain mens blood for a the bluid thats shed on earth flows through the streams of that countrie silver denarius of c vibius pansa about bc obv head of apollo rev demeter searching for persephone langjpg thus tenacious of life has been the myth of mother and maiden a natural flower of the human heart found unborrowed by the spaniards in the maizefields of peru clearly the myth is a thing composed of many elements glad and sad as the waving fields of yellow grain or as the chthonian darkness under earth where the seed awaits new life in the new year the creed is practical as the folklore of sympathetic magic which half expects to bring good harvest luck by various mummeries and the creed is mystical as the hidden things and words unknown which assured pindar and sophocles of secure felicity in this and in the future life the creed is beautiful as the exquisite profile of the corntressed head of persephone on syracusan coins and it is grotesque as the custom which bade the pilgrims to eleusis bathe in the sea each with the pig which he was about to sacrifice the highest religious hopes the meanest magical mummeries are blended in this religion that one element is earlier than the other we cannot say with much certainty the ritual aspect as concerned with the happy future of the soul does not appear in iliad or odyssey where the mysteries are not named but the silence of homer is never a safe argument in favour of his ignorance any more than the absence of allusion to tobacco in shakspeare is a proof that tobacco was in his age unknown we shall find that a barbaric people the pawnees hold a mystery precisely parallel to the demeter legend a mystery necessarily unborrowed from greece the greeks therefore may have evolved the legend long before homers day and he may have known the story which he does not find occasion to tell as to what was said shown and done in the eleusinia we only gather that there was a kind of mystery play on the sacred legend that there were fastings vigils sacrifices secret objects displayed sacred words uttered and that thence such men as pindar and sophocles received the impression that for them in this and the future life all was well was well for those of pure hearts and hands the purity may partly have been ritual but was certainly understood also as relating to excellence of life than such a faith for faith it is religion has nothing better to give but the extreme diligence of scholars and archaeologists can tell us nothing more definite the impressions on the souls of the initiated may have been caused merely by that dim or splendid religious light of the vigils and by association with sacred things usually kept in solemn sanctuaries again mere buffoonery as is common in savage mysteries brought the pilgrims back to common life when they crossed the bridge on their return to athens just as the buffooneries of baubo brought a smile to the sad lips of demeter beyond this all is conjecture and the secret may have been so well kept just because in fact there was no secret to keep till the end of the present century mythologists did not usually employ the method of comparing greek rites and legends with first the sympathetic magic and the fables of peasant folklore second with the mysteries and myths of contemporary savage races of which european folk lore is mainly a survival for a study of demeter from these sides a study still too much neglected in germany readers may consult mannhardts works mr frazers golden bough and the present translators custom and myth and myth ritual and religion mr frazer especially has enabled the english reader to understand the savage and rural element of sympathetic magic as a factor in the demeter myth meanwhile mr pater has dealt with the higher sentiment the more religious aspect of the myth and the rites i am not inclined to go all lengths with mr frazers ingenious and learned system as will be seen while regretting that the new edition of his golden bough is not yet accessible if we accept which i do not entirely mr frazers theory of the origin of the demeter myth there is no finer example of the greek power of transforming into beauty the superstitions of barbarism the explanation to which i refer is contained in mr j g frazers learned and ingenious work the golden bough while mythologists of the schools of mr max muller and kuhn have usually resolved most gods and heroes into sun sky dawn twilight or again into elemental powers of thunder tempest lightning and night mr frazer is apt to see in them the spirit of vegetation osiris is a tree spirit or a corn spirit mannhardt the founder of the system however took osiris to be the sun balder is the spirit of the oak the oak we may certainly conclude was one of the chief if not the very chief divinity of the aryans before the dispersion if so the aryans before the dispersion were on an infinitely lower religious level than those australian tribes whose chief divinity is not a gumtree but a being named our father dwelling beyond the visible heavens when we remember the vast numbers of gods of sky or heaven among many scattered races and the obvious connection of zeus with the sky sub jove frigido and the usually assigned sense of the name of zeus it is not easy to suppose that he was originally an oak but mr frazer considers the etymological connection of zeus with the sanscrit word for sky an insufficient reason for regarding zeus as in origin a skygod he prefers it seems to believe that as being the wood out of which fire was kindled by some aryanspeaking peoples the oak may have come to be called the bright or shining one zeus jove by the ancient greeks and italians the greeks in fact used the laurel daphne for making fire not as far as i am aware the oak though the oak was the tree of zeus the heavens were certainly his province and despite the oak of dodona and the oak on the capitol he is much more generally connected with the sky than with the tree in fact this reduction of zeus in origin to an oak rather suggests that the spirit of system is too powerful with mr frazer he makes perhaps a more plausible case for his reduction of dread persephone to a pig the process is curious early agricultural man believed in a corn spirit a spiritual essence animating the grain in itself no very unworthy conception but because as the field is mown animals in the corn are driven into the last unshorn nook and then into the open the beast which rushed out of the last patch was identified with the corn spirit in some animal shape perhaps that of a pig many other animals occur the pig has a great part in the ritual of demeter pigs of pottery were found by sir charles newton on her sacred ground the initiate in the mysteries brought pigs to eleusis and bathed with them in the sea the pig was sacrificed to her in fact though not in our hymn she was closely associated with pigs we may now ask may not the pig be nothing but the goddess herself in animal form a she would later become anthropomorphic a lovely goddess whose hair as in the hymn is yellow as ripe corn but the prior pig could not be shaken off at the attic thesmophoria the women celebrated the descent and ascent of persephone a double of demeter in this rite pigs and other things were thrown into certain caverns later the cold remains of pig were recovered and placed on the altar fragments were scattered for luck on the fields with the seedcorn a myth explained that a flock of pigs were swallowed by earth when persephone was ravished by hades to the lower world of which matter the hymn says nothing in short the pigs were proserpine b the eating of pigs at the thesmophoria was a partaking of the body of the god though the partakers one thinks must have been totally unconscious of the circumstance we must presume that if this theory be correct a very considerable time was needed for the evolution of a pig into the demeter of the hymn and the change is quite successfully complete a testimony to the transfiguring power of the greek genius we may be inclined to doubt however whether the task before the genius of greece the task of making proserpine out of a porker was really so colossal the primitive mind is notoriously capable of entertaining simultaneously the most contradictory notions thus in the australian legend of eerin the mourners implore byamee to accept the soul of the faithful eerin into his paradise bullimah no doubt byamee heard yet eerin is now a little owl of plaintive voice which ratters warning cries in time of peril no incongruity of this kind is felt to be a difficulty by the childlike narrators now i conceive that starting with the relatively high idea of a spirit of the grain early man was quite capable of envisaging it both spiritually and in zoomorphic form accidentally conditioned here into horse there into goat pig or what not but these views of his need not exclude his simultaneous belief in the corn spirit as a being anthropomorphic mother earth or mother grain as we follow the common etymology or that of mannhardt greek text greek textbarleymother if i am right poetry and the higher religion moved from the first on the line of the anthropomorphic lady of the harvest and the corn mother barley while the popular folk lore of the corn spirit which found utterance in the mirth of harvesting and in the magic ritual for ensuring fertility followed on the line of the pig at some seasons and in some ceremonies the pig represented the genius of the corn in general the lady of the corn was demeter we really need not believe that the two forms of the genius of the corn were ever consciously identified demeter never was a pig the peruvians we are told believed all useful plants to be animated by a divine being who causes their growth says mr frazer the genealogical table then in my opinion is divine being of the grain anthropomorphized zoomorphised mother of corn pig horse demeter and so on thus the greek genius had other and better materials to work on in evolving demeter than the rather lowly animal which is associated with her rites if any one objects that animal gods always precede anthropomorphic gods in evolution we reply that in the most archaic of known races the deities are represented in human guise at the mysteries though there are animal totems and though in myth the deity may and often does assume shapes of bird or beast among rites of the backward races none perhaps so closely resembles the eleusinian mysteries as the tradition of the pawnees in attica hades lord of the dead ravishes away persephone the vernal daughter of demeter demeter then wanders among men and is hospitably received by celeus king of eleusis baffled in her endeavour to make his son immortal she demands a temple where she sits in wrath blighting the grain she is reconciled by the restoration of her daughter at the command of zeus but for a third of the year persephone having tasted a pomegranate seed in hades has to reign as queen of the dead beneath the earth scenes from this tale were no doubt enacted at the mysteries with interludes of buffoonery such as relieved most ancient and all savage mysteries the allegory of the years death and renewal probably afforded a text for some discourse or spectacle concerned with the future life among the pawnees not a mother and daughter but two primal beings brothers named manabozho and chibiabos are the chief characters the manitos spirits or gods drown chibiabos manabozho mourns and smears his face with black as demeter wears black raiment he laments chibiabos ceaselessly till the manitos propitiate him with gifts and ceremonies they offer to him a cup like the beverage prepared for demeter in the hymn by iambe he drinks it is glad washes off the black stain of mourning and is himself again while earth again is joyous the manitos restore chibiabos to life but having once died he may not enter the temple or medicine lodge he is sent to reign over the souls of the departed as does persephone manabozho makes offerings to mesukkumikokwi the earth mother of the pawnees the story is enacted in the sacred dances of the pawnees the pawnee ideas have fallen with singularly accurate coincidence into the same lines as those of early greece some moderns such as m foucart have revived the opinion of herodotus that the mysteries were brought from greece to egypt but as the pawnee example shows similar natural phenomena may anywhere beget similar myths and rites in greece the donnee was a nature myth and a ritual in which it was enacted that ritual was a form of sympathetic magic and the myth explained the performances the refinement and charm of the legend on which homer as we saw does not touch is due to the unique genius of greece demeter became the deity most familiar to the people nearest to their hearts and endowed with most temples every farm possessing her rural shrine but the chthonian or funereal aspect of chibiabos or of persephone is due to a mood very distinct from that which sacrifices pigs as embodiments of the corn spirit if that be the real origin of the practice we should much misconceive the religious spirit of the greek rite if we undertook to develop it all out an origin in sympathetic magic which of course i do not understand mr frazer to do greek scholars again are apt to view these researches into savage or barbaric origins with great distaste and disfavour this is not a scientific frame of mind in the absence of such researches other purely fanciful origins have been invented by scholars ancient or modern it is necessary to return to the pedestrian facts if merely in order to demonstrate the futility of the fancies the result is in no way discreditable to greece beginning like other peoples with the vague unrealised conception of the corn mother an idea which could not occur before the agricultural stage of civilisation the greeks refined and elevated the idea into the demeter of the hymn and of the cnidian statue to do this was the result of their unique gifts as a race meanwhile the other notion of a ruler of souls in greece attached to persephone is found among peoples not yet agricultural nomads living on grubs roots seeds of wild grasses and the products of the chase almost all mens ideas are as old as mankind so far as we know mankind conceptions originally halfconscious and purely popular as of a spirit of vegetation incarnate as it were in each years growth were next handled by conscious poets like the author of our hymn and then are realised as abstract symbols because intensely characteristic examples of moral or spiritual conditions thus demeter and persephone no longer pigs or grainmothers lend themselves to the elevation and the correction of the sentiments of sorrow and awe by the presentment to the senses and imagination of an ideal expression of them demeter cannot but seem the type of divine grief persephone is the goddess of death yet with a promise of life to come that the eleusinia included an ethical element seems undeniable this one would think probable a priori on the ground that greek mysteries are an embellished survival of the initiatory rites of savages which do contain elements of morality this i have argued at some length in myth ritual and religion many strange customs in some greek mysteries such as the daubing of the initiate with clay the use of the greek text the australian tundun a small piece of wood whirled noisily by a string the general suggestion of a new life the flogging of boys at sparta their retreat each with his instructor australian kabbo greek greek text to the forests are precisely analogous to things found in australia america and africa now savage rites are often associated with what we think gross cruelty and as in fiji with abandoned license of which the fathers also accuse the greeks but among the yao of central africa the initiator observes mr macdonald is said to give much good advice his lectures condemn selfishness and a selfish person is called mwisichana that is uninitiated a among the australians dampier in observed the singular unselfish generosity of distribution of food to the old the weak and the sick according to mr howitt the boys of the coast murring tribe are taught in the mysteries to speak the straightforward truth while being initiated and are warned to avoid various offences against propriety and morality the method of instruction is bad a pantomimic representation of the sin to be avoided but the intention is excellent b among the kurnai respect for the old for unprotected women the duty of unselfishness and other ethical ideas are inculcated c while certain food taboos prevail during the rite as was also the case in the eleusinia that this moral idea of sharing what they have with their friends is not confined merely to the tribe is proved by the experience of john finnegan a white man lost near moreton bay early in this century at all times whether they had much or little fish or kangaroo they always gave me as much as i could eat even when the whites stole the fish of the natives and were detected instead of attempting to repossess themselves of the fish they instantly set at work to procure more for us and one or two fetched us as much dingowa as they could carry the first english settlers in virginia on the other hand when some native stole a cup burned down the whole town thus the morality of the savage is not merely tribal as is often alleged and is carried into practice as well as inculcated in some regions not in all during the mysteries for these reasons if the greek mysteries be survivals of savage ceremonies as there is no reason to doubt that they are the savage association of moral instruction with mummeries might survive as easily as anything else that it did survive is plain from numerous passages in classical authors a the initiate live a pious life in regard to strangers and citizens they are to be conscious of no evil they are to protect such as have wrought no unrighteousness such precepts have their root in the ethicoreligious consciousness b it is not mere ritual purity that the mysteries demand either among naked australians or yao or in greece lobeck did his best to minimise the testimony to the higher element in the eleusinia but without avail the study of early barbaric savage classical egyptian or indian religions should not be onesided men have always been men for good as well as for evil and religion almost everywhere is allied with ethics no less than it is overrun by the parasite of myth and the survival of magic in ritual the mother and the maid were saviours greek text holy and pure despite contradictory legends the tales of incest as between zeus and persephone are the result of the genealogical mania the gods were grouped in familyrelationships to account for their companionship in ritual and each birth postulated an amour none the less the same deities offered salvation of a sort and were patrons of conduct greek religion was thus not destitute of certain chief elements in our own but these were held in solution with a host of other warring elements lustful cruel or buffooning these elements greece was powerless to shake off philosophers by various expedients might explain away the contradictory myths which overgrew the religion but ritual the luck of the state and popular credulity were tenacious of the whole strange mingling of beliefs and practices the view taken of the eleusinia in this note is hardly so exalted as that of dr hatch the main underlying conception of initiation was that there were elements in human life from which the candidate must purify himself before he could be fit to approach god the need of purification ritual and moral is certain but one is not aware of anything in the purely popular or priestly religion of greece which exactly answers to our word god as used in the passage cited individuals by dint of piety or of speculation might approach the conception and probably many did both in and out of the philosophic schools but traditional ritual and myth could scarcely rise to this ideal and it seems exaggerated to say of the crowded eleusinian throng of pilgrims that the race of mankind was lifted on to a higher plane when it came to be taught that only the pure in heart can see god the black native boys in australia pass through a purgative ceremony to cure them of selfishness and afterwards the initiator points to the blue vault of sky bidding them behold our father munganngaur this is very well meant and very creditable to untutored savages and creditable ideas were not absent from the eleusinia but when we use the quotation blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see god our meaning though not very definite is a meaning which it would be hazardous to attribute to a black boy or to sophocles the idea of the new life appears to occur in australian mysteries a tribesman is buried and rises at a given signal but here the new life is rather that of the lad admitted to full tribal privileges including moral precepts than that of a converted character confirmation rather than conversion is the analogy the number of those analogies of ancient and savage with christian religion is remarkable but even in greek mysteries the conceptions are necessarily not so purely spiritual as in the christian creed of which they seem halfconscious and fragmentary anticipations or we may regard them as suggestions which christianity selected accepted and purified hymn to demeter the alleged egyptian origins in what has been said as to the greek mysteries i have regarded them as of native origin i have exhibited rites of analogous kinds in the germ as it were among savage and barbaric communities in peru under the incas we actually find mama and cora demeter and kore as goddesses of the maize acosta and for rites of sympathetic magic connected with the production of fertile harvests as in the thesmophoria at athens it is enough to refer to the vast collection in mr frazers golden bough i have also indicated the closest of all known parallels to the eleusinian in a medicinedance and legend of the pawnees for other savage mysteries in which a moral element occurs i have quoted australian and african examples thence i have inferred that the early greeks might and probably did evolve their multiform mystic rites out of germs of such things inherited from their own prehistoric ancestors no process on the other hand of borrowing from greece can conceivably account for the pawnee and peruvian rites so closely analogous to those of hellas therefore i see no reason why if egypt for instance presents parallels to the eleusinia we should suppose that the prehistoric greeks borrowed the eleusinia from egypt these things can grow up autochthonous and underived out of the soil of human nature anywhere granting certain social conditions monsieur foucart however has lately argued in favour of an egyptian origin of the eleusinia the greeks naturally identified demeter and dionysus with isis and osiris there were analogies in the figures and the legends and that was enough so had the greeks visited america they would have recognised demeter in the pawnee earth mother and persephone or eubouleus in chibiabos to account for the similarities they would probably have invented a fable of pawnee visitors to greece or of greek missionaries among the pawnees so they were apt to form a theory of an egyptian origin of dionysus and demeter m foucart however argues that agriculture corngrowing at least came into greece at one stride barley and wheat not being indigenous in a wild state the greeks however may have brought grain in their original national migration the greek words for grain and ploughing are common to other families of aryan speech or obtained it from phoenician settlements demeter however in m foucarts theory would be the goddess of the foreigners who carried the grain first to hellas now both the homeric epics and the egyptian monuments show us egypt and greece in contact in the greek prehistoric period but it does not exactly follow that the prehistoric greeks would adopt egyptian gods or that the thesmophoria an athenian harvestrite of demeter was founded by colonists from egypt answering to the daughters of danaus egyptians certainly did not introduce the similar rite among the khonds or the incas the rites could grow up without importation as the result of the similarities of primitive fancy everywhere if isis is lady of the grain in egypt so is mama in peru and demeter need no more have been imported from egypt than mama if osiris taught the arts of life and the laws of society in egypt so did daramulun in australia and yehl in british columbia all the gods and culture heroes everywhere play this role in regions where importation of the idea from egypt is utterly out of the question even in minute details legends recur everywhere the phallus of a mutilated australian being of the fabulous alcheringa time is hunted for by his wives exactly as isis wanders in search of the phallus of the mutilated osiris a is anything in the demeter legend so like the isis legend as this australian coincidence yet the arunta did not borrow it from egypt b the mere fact again that there were mysteries both in egypt and greece proves nothing there is a river in monmouth and a river in macedon there are mysteries in almost all religions again it is argued the gods of the mysteries in egypt and greece had secret names only revealed to the initiated so too in australia women never initiated and boys before initiation know daramulun only as papang father c the uninitiated among the kurnai do not know the sacred name munganngaur d the australian did not borrow this secrecy from egypt everywhere a mystery is kept up about proper names m foucart seems to think that what is practically universal a taboo on names can only have reached greece by transplantation from egypt a to the anthropologist it seems that scholars in ignoring the universal ideas of the lower races run the risk of venturing on theories at once superficial and untenable m foucart has another argument which does not seem more convincing though it probably lights up the humorous or indecent side of the eleusinia isocrates speaks of good offices rendered to demeter by our ancestors which can only be told to the initiate b now these cannot be the kindly deeds reported in the hymn for these were publicly proclaimed what then were the secret good offices in one version of the legend the hosts of demeter were not celeus and metaneira but dusaules and baubo the part of baubo was to relieve the gloom of the goddess not by the harmless pleasantries of iambe in the hymn but by obscene gestures the christian fathers clemens of alexandria at least make this a part of their attack on the mysteries but it may be said that they were prejudiced or misinformed a but says m foucart an inscription has been found in paros wherein there is a dedication to hera demeter thesmophoros kore and babo or baubo again two authors of the fourth century palaephatus and asclepiades cite the dusaules and baubo legend b now the indecent gesture of baubo was part of the comic or obscene folk lore of contempt in egypt and so m foucart thinks that it was borrowed from egypt with the demeter legend c can isocrates have referred to this good office the amusing of demeter by an obscene gesture if he did such gestures as baubos are as widely diffused as any other piece of folklore in the centre of the australian desert mr carnegie saw a native make a derisive gesture which he thought had only been known to english schoolboys a again indecent pantomimic dances said to be intended to act as object lessons in things not to be done are common in australian mysteries further we do not know baubo or a counterpart of her in the ritual of isis and the clay figurines of such a figure in egypt are of the greek the ptolemaic period thus the evidence comes to this an indecent gesture of contempt known in egypt is at eleusis attributed to baubo this does not prove that baubo was originally egyptian b certain traditions make demeter the mistress of celeus c traces of a mystic marriage which also occur are not necessarily egyptian the idea and rite are common there remains the question of the sacred objects displayed possibly statues probably very ancient medicine things as among the pawnees and sacred words spoken these are said by many authors to confirm the initiate in their security of hope as to a future life now similar instruction as to the details of the souls voyage the dangers to avoid the precautions to be taken notoriously occur in the egyptian book of the dead but very similar fancies are reported from the ojibbeways kohl the polynesians and maoris taylor turner gill thomson the early peoples of virginia a the modern arapaho and sioux of the ghost dance rite the aztecs and so forth in all countries these details are said to have been revealed by men or women who died but did not like persephone taste the food of the dead and so were enabled to return to earth the initiate at eleusis were guided along a theatrically arranged pathway of the dead into a theatrical elysium b now as such ideas as these occur among races utterly removed from contact with egypt as they are part of the european folklore of the visits of mortals to fairyland in which it is fatal to taste fairy food i do not see that eleusis need have borrowed such common elements of early belief from the egyptians in the seventh century bc one might as well attribute to egypt the finnish legend of the descent of wainamoinen into tuonela or the experience of the aunt of montezuma just before the arrival of cortes or the expedition to fairyland of thomas the rhymer it is not pretended by m foucart that the details of the book of the dead were copied in greek ritual and the general idea of a river to cross of dangerous monsters to avoid of perils to encounter of precautions to be taken by the wandering soul is nearly universal where it must be unborrowed from egypt in polynesian and red indian belief as at eleusis in these remote tribes formulas of a preservative character are inculcated the book of the dead was a guidebook of the itinerary of egyptian souls very probably similar instruction was given to the initiate at eleusis but the fijians also have a regular theory of what is to be done and avoided on the path of the shades the shade is ferried by ceba charon over wainiyalo lethe he reaches the mystic pandanus tree here occurs a rite he meets and dodges drodroyalo and the two devouring goddesses he comes to a spring and drinks and forgets sorrow at wainadula the water of solace after halfadozen other probations and terrors he reaches the gods the dancingground and the white quicksand and then the young gods dance before them and sing a now turn to plutarch b plutarch compares the souls mortal experience with that of the initiate in the mysteries there are wanderings darkness fear trembling shuddering horror then a marvellous light pure places and meadows dances songs and holy apparitions plutarch might be summarising the fijian belief again take the mystic golden scroll found in a greek grave at petilia it describes in hexameters the path of the shade the spring and the white cypress on the left do not approach it go to the other stream from the lake of memory tell the guardians that you are the child of earth and of the starry sky but that yours is a heavenly lineage and they will give you to drink of that water and you shall reign with the other heroes tree and spring and peaceful place with dance song and divine apparitions all are fijian all are greek yet nothing is borrowed by fiji from greece many other greek inscriptions cited by m foucart attest similar beliefs very probably such precepts as those of the petilia scroll were among the secret instructions of eleusis but they are not so much egyptian as human chibiabos is assuredly not borrowed from osiris nor the fijian faith from the book of the dead sacred things not to be shown to man still less to woman date from the medicine bag of the red indian the mystic tribal bundles of the pawnees and the churinga and bark native portmanteaux of which mr carnegie brought several from the australian desert demeter and persephone sending triptolemos on his mission marble relief found at eleusis now in athens langjpg for all greek mysteries a satisfactory savage analogy can be found these spring straight from human nature from the desire to place customs and duties and taboos under divine protection from the need of strengthening them and the influence of the elders by mystic sanctions from the need of fortifying and trying the young by probations of strength secrecy and fortitude from the magical expulsion of hostile influences from the sympathetic magic of early agriculture from study of the processes of nature regarded as personal and from guesses surmises visions and dreams as to the fortunes of the wandering soul on its way to its final home i have shown all these things to be human universal not sprung from one race in one region greek mysteries are based on all these natural early conceptions of life and death the early greeks like other races entertained these primitive or very archaic ideas greece had no need to borrow from egypt and though egypt was within reach greece probably developed freely her original stock of ideas in her own fashion just as did the incas aztecs australians ojibbeways and the other remote peoples whom i have selected the argument of m foucart i think is only good as long as we are ignorant of the universally diffused forms of religious belief which correspond to the creeds of eleusis or of egypt in the greek mysteries we have the greek guise solemn wistful hopeful holy and pure yet not uncontaminated with archaic buffoonery of notions and rites hopes and fears common to all mankind there is no other secret the same arguments as i have advanced against greek borrowing from egypt apply to greek borrowing from asia mr ramsay following mr robertson smith suggests that leto the mother of apollo and artemis may be the old semitic allat a then we have leto and artemis as the mother and the maid kore with their mystery play clement describes them the details as eleusinian for they had spread to eleusis as the rites of demeter and kore crossing from asia to crete and from crete to the european peninsula the ritual remained everywhere fundamentally the same obviously if the eleusinian mysteries are of phrygian origin ramsay they cannot also be of egyptian origin foucart in truth they are no more specially of phrygian or egyptian than of pawnee or peruvian origin mankind can and does evolve such ideas and rites in any region of the world b conclusion what has all this farrago about savages to do with dionysus i conceive some scholar or literary critic asking if such an one looks into this book certainly it would have been easier for me to abound in aesthetic criticism of the hymns and on the aspect of greek literary art which they illustrate but the hymns if read even through the pale medium of a translation speak for themselves their beauties and defects as poetry are patent patent too are the charm and geniality of the national character which they express the glad ionian gatherings the archaic humour the delight in life and love and nature the pious domesticities of the sacred hearth the peopling of woods hills and streams with exquisite fairy forms all these make the poetic delight of the hymns but all these need no pointing out to any reader the poets can speak for themselves on the other hand the confusions of sacred and profane the origins of the mysteries the beginnings of the gods in a mental condition long left behind by greece when the hymns were composed all these matters need elucidation i have tried to elucidate them as results of evolution from the remote prehistoric past of greece which as it seems must in many points have been identical with the historic present of the lowest contemporary races in the same way if dealing with ornament i would derive the spirals volutes and concentric circles of mycenaean gold work from the identical motives on the oldest incised rocks and kists of our islands of north and south america and of the tribes of central australia recently described by messrs spencer and gillen and mr carnegie the material of the mycenaean artist may be gold his work may be elegant and firm but he traces the selfsame ornament as the naked arunta with feebler hand paints on sacred rocks or on the bodies of his tribesmen what is true of ornament is true of myth rite and belief greece only offers a gracious modification of the beliefs rites and myths of the races who now are nearest the beginning however remote from that unknown beginning they may be to understand this is to come closer to a true conception of the evolution of greek faith and art than we can reach by any other path yet to insist on this is not to ignore the unmeasured advance of the greeks in development of society and art on that head the hymns like all greek poetry bear their own free testimony but none the less greek religion and myth present features repellent to us which derive their origin not from savagery but from the more crude horrors of the lower and higher barbarisms greek religion greek myth are vast conglomerates we find a savage origin for apollo and savage origins for many of the mysteries but the cruelty of savage initiations has been purified away on the other hand we find a barbaric origin for departmental gods such as aphrodite and for greek human sacrifices unknown to the lowest savagery from savagery zeus is probably derived from savagery come the germs of the legends of divine amours in animal forms but from barbarism arises the sympathetic magic of agriculture which the lowest races do not practise from the barbaric condition not from savagery comes greek heroworship for the lowest races do not worship ancestral spirits such is the medley of prehistoric ideas in greece while the charm and poetry of the hymns are due mainly to the unique genius of the fully developed hellenic race the combination of good and bad of ancestral rites and ideas of native taste of philosophical refinement on inherited theology could not last the elements were too discordant and yet it could not pass naturally away the greece of ad wandered between two worlds one dead the other powerless to be born without external assistance that help was brought by the christian creed and officially gods rites and myths vanished while unofficially they partially endure even to this day in romaic folk lore homeric hymns hymn to apollo silver stater of croton about bc obv hercules the founder rev apollo shooting the python by the delphic tripod langjpg mindful ever mindful will i be of apollo the fardarter before him as he fares through the hall of zeus the gods tremble yea rise up all from their thrones as he draws near with his shining bended bow but leto alone abides by zeus the lord of lightning till apollo hath slackened his bow and closed his quiver then taking with her hands from his mighty shoulders the bow and quiver she hangs them against the pillar beside his fathers seat from a pin of gold and leads him to his place and seats him there while the father welcomes his dear son giving him nectar in a golden cup then do the other gods welcome him then they make him sit and lady leto rejoices in that she bore the lord of the bow her mighty son hail o blessed leto mother of glorious children prince apollo and artemis the archer her in ortygia him in rocky delos didst thou bear couching against the long sweep of the cynthian hill beside a palm tree by the streams of inopus leto with her infants apollo and artemis from a vase in the british museum sixth century bc langjpg how shall i hymn thee aright howbeit thou art in sooth not hard to hymn for to thee phoebus everywhere have fallen all the ranges of song both on the mainland nurse of young kine and among the isles to thee all the cliffs are dear and the steep mountain crests and rivers running onward to the salt sea and beaches sloping to the foam and havens of the deep shall i tell how leto bore thee first a delight of men couched by the cynthian hill in the rocky island in seagirt delos on either hand the black wave drives landward at the word of the shrill winds whence arising thou art lord over all mortals among them that dwell in crete and the people of athens and isle aegina and euboea famed for fleets and aegae and peiresiae and peparethus by the seastrand and thracian athos and the tall crests of pelion and thracian samos and the shadowy mountains of ida scyros and phocaea and the mountain wall of aigocane and stablished imbros and inhospitable lemnos and goodly lesbos the seat of makar son of aeolus and chios brightest of all islands of the deep and craggy mimas and the steep crests of mykale and gleaming claros and the high hills of aesagee and watery samos and tall ridges of mycale and miletus and cos a city of meropian men and steep cnidos and windy carpathus naxos and paros and rocky rheneia so far in travail with the archer god went leto seeking if perchance any land would build a house for her son but the lands trembled sore and were adread and none nay not the richest dared to welcome phoebus not till lady leto set foot on delos and speaking winged words besought her delos would that thou wert minded to be the seat of my son phoebus apollo and to let build him therein a rich temple no other god will touch thee nor none will honour thee for methinks thou art not to be well seen in cattle or in sheep in fruit or grain nor wilt thou grow plants unnumbered but wert thou to possess a temple of apollo the far darter then would all men bring thee hecatombs gathering to thee and ever wilt thou have savour of sacrifice from others hands albeit thy soil is poor thus spoke she and delos was glad and answered her saying leto daughter most renowned of mighty coeus right gladly would i welcome the birth of the archer prince for verily of me there goes an evil report among men and thus would i wax mightiest of renown but at this word leto i tremble nor will i hide it from thee for the saying is that apollo will be mighty of mood and mightily will lord it over mortals and immortals far and wide over the earth the graingiver therefore i deeply dread in heart and soul lest when first he looks upon the sunlight he disdain my island for rocky of soil am i and spurn me with his feet and drive me down in the gulfs of the salt sea then should a great seawave wash mightily above my head for ever but he will fare to another land which so pleases him to fashion him a temple and groves of trees but in me would manyfooted seabeasts and black seals make their chambers securely no men dwelling by me nay still if thou hast the heart goddess to swear a great oath that here first he will build a beautiful temple to be the shrine oracular of men thereafter among all men let him raise him shrines since his renown shall be the widest so spake she but leto swore the great oath of the gods bear witness earth and the wide heaven above and dropping water of styx the greatest oath and the most dread among the blessed gods that verily here shall ever be the fragrant altar and the portion of apollo and thee will he honour above all when she had sworn and done that oath then delos was glad in the birth of the archer prince but leto for nine days and nine nights continually was pierced with pangs of childbirth beyond all hope with her were all the goddesses the goodliest dione and rheia and ichnaean themis and amphitrite of the moaning sea and the other deathless ones save whitearmed hera alone she wotted not of it eilithyia the helper in difficult travail for she sat on the crest of olympus beneath the golden clouds by the wile of whitearmed hera who held her afar in jealous grudge because even then fairtressed leto was about bearing her strong and noble son but the goddesses sent forth iris from the fairstablished isle to bring eilithyia promising her a great necklet golden with amber studs nine cubits long iris they bade to call eilithyia apart from whitearmed hera lest even then the words of hera might turn her from her going but windfooted swift iris heard and fleeted forth and swiftly she devoured the space between so soon as she came to steep olympus the dwelling of the gods she called forth eilithyia from hall to door and spake winged words even all that the goddesses of olympian mansions had bidden her thereby she won the heart in eilithyias breast and forth they fared like timid wild doves in their going even when eilithyia the helper in sore travailing set foot in delos then labour took hold on leto and a passion to bring to the birth around a palm tree she cast her arms and set her knees on the soft meadow while earth beneath smiled and forth leaped the babe to light and all the goddesses raised a cry then great phoebus the goddesses washed thee in fair water holy and purely and wound thee in white swaddling bands delicate new woven with a golden girdle round thee nor did his mother suckle apollo the goldensworded but themis with immortal hands first touched his lips with nectar and sweet ambrosia while leto rejoiced in that she had borne her strong son the bearer of the bow then phoebus as soon as thou hadst tasted the food of paradise the golden bands were not proof against thy pantings nor bonds could bind thee but all their ends were loosened straightway among the goddesses spoke phoebus apollo mine be the dear lyre and bended bow and i will utter to men the unerring counsel of zeus so speaking he began to fare over the wide ways of earth phoebus of the locks unshorn phoebus the fardarter thereon all the goddesses were in amaze and all delos blossomed with gold as when a hilltop is heavy with woodland flowers beholding the child of zeus and leto and glad because the god had chosen her wherein to set his home beyond mainland and isles and loved her most at heart but thyself o prince of the silver bow fardarting apollo didst now pass over rocky cynthus now wander among temples and men many are thy fanes and groves and dear are all the headlands and high peaks of lofty hills and rivers flowing onward to the sea but with delos phoebus art thou most delighted at heart where the longrobed ionians gather in thine honour with children and shamefast wives mindful of thee they delight thee with boxing and dances and minstrelsy in their games who so then encountered them at the gathering of the ionians would say that they are exempt from eld and death beholding them so gracious and would be glad at heart looking on the men and fairgirdled women and their much wealth and their swift galleys moreover there is this great marvel of renown imperishable the delian damsels handmaidens of the fardarter they when first they have hymned apollo and next leto and artemis the archer then sing in memory of the men and women of old time enchanting the tribes of mortals and they are skilled to mimic the notes and dance music of all men so that each would say himself were singing so well woven is their fair chant but now come be gracious apollo be gracious artemis and ye maidens all farewell but remember me even in time to come when any of earthly men yea any stranger that much hath seen and much endured comes hither and asks maidens who is the sweetest to you of singers here conversant and in whose song are ye most glad then do you all with one voice make answer a blind man is he and he dwells in rocky chios his songs will ever have the mastery ay in all time to come but i shall bear my renown of you as far as i wander over earth to the fairest cities of men and they will believe my report for my word is true but for me never shall i cease singing of apollo of the silver bow the fardarter whom fairtressed leto bore o prince lycia is thine and pleasant maeonia and miletus a winsome city by the sea and thou too art the mighty lord of seawashed delos the founding of delphi the son of glorious leto fares harping on his hollow harp to rocky pytho clad in his fragrant raiment that waxes not old and beneath the golden plectrum winsomely sounds his lyre thence from earth to olympus fleet as thought he goes to the house of zeus into the consistory of the other gods and anon the immortals bethink them of harp and minstrelsy and all the muses together with sweet voice in antiphonal chant replying sing of the imperishable gifts of the gods and the sufferings of men all that they endure from the hands of the undying gods lives witless and helpless men unavailing to find remede for death or buckler against old age then the fairtressed graces and boon hours and harmonia and hebe and aphrodite daughter of zeus dance holding each by the wrist the others hand while among them sings one neither unlovely nor of body contemptible but divinely tall and fair artemis the archer nurtured with apollo among them sport ares and the keeneyed bane of argos while phoebus apollo steps high and disposedly playing the lyre and the light issues round him from twinkling feet and fairwoven raiment but all they are glad seeing him so high of heart leto of the golden tresses and zeus the counsellor beholding their dear son as he takes his pastime among the deathless gods how shall i hymn thee aright howbeit thou art in sooth not hard to hymn shall i sing of thee in love and dalliance how thou wentest forth to woo the maiden azanian with ischys peer of gods and elations son of the goodly steeds or with phorbas son of triopes or amarynthus or how with leucippus and leucippus wife thyself on foot he in the chariot or how first seeking a place of oracle for men thou camest down to earth fardarting apollo on pieria first didst thou descend from olympus and pass by lacmus and emathia and enienae and through perrhaebia and speedily camest to iolcus and alight on cenaeum in euboea renowned for galleys on the lelantian plain thou stoodest but it pleased thee not there to stablish a temple and a grove thence thou didst cross euripus fardarting apollo and fare up the green hill divine and thence camest speedily to mycalessus and teumesos of the bedded meadow grass and thence to the place of woodclad thebe for as yet no mortals dwelt in holy thebe nor yet were paths nor ways along thebes wheatbearing plain but all was wild wood thence forward journeying apollo thou camest to onchestus the bright grove of poseidon there the newbroken colt takes breath again weary though he be with dragging the goodly chariot and to earth skilled though he be leaps down the charioteer and fares on foot while the horses for a while rattle along the empty car with the reins on their necks and if the car be broken in the grove of trees their masters tend them there and tilt the car and let it lie such is the rite from of old and they pray to the king poseidon while the chariot is the gods portion to keep thence faring forward fardarting apollo thou didst win to cephisus of the fair streams that from lilaea pours down his beautiful waters which crossing fardarter and passing ocalea of the towers thou camest thereafter to grassy haliartus then didst thou set foot on telphusa and to thee the land seemed exceeding good wherein to stablish a temple and a grove beside telphusa didst thou stand and spake to her telphusa here methinketh to stablish a fair temple an oracle for men who ever seeking for the word of sooth will bring me hither perfect hecatombs even they that dwell in the rich isle of pelops and all they of the mainland and seagirt islands to them all shall i speak the decree unerring rendering oracles within my rich temple so spake phoebus and thoroughly marked out the foundations right long and wide but at the sight the heart of telphusa waxed wroth and she spake her word phoebus fardarting prince a word shall i set in thy heart here thinkest thou to stablish a goodly temple to be a place of oracle for men that ever will bring thee hither perfect hecatombs nay but this will i tell thee and do thou lay it up in thine heart the neverending din of swift steeds will be a weariness to thee and the watering of mules from my sacred springs there men will choose rather to regard the wellwrought chariots and the stamping of the swiftfooted steeds than thy great temple and much wealth therein but an if thou that art greater and better than i o prince and thy strength is most of might if thou wilt listen to me in crisa build thy fane beneath a glade of parnassus there neither will goodly chariots ring nor wilt thou be vexed with stamping of swift steeds about thy wellbuilded altar but none the less shall the renowned tribes of men bring their gifts to iepaeon and delighted shalt thou gather the sacrifices of them who dwell around therewith she won over the heart of the fardarter even that to telphusa herself should be honour in that land and not to the fardarter thenceforward didst thou fare fardarting apollo and camest to the city of the overweening phlegyae that reckless of zeus dwelt there in a goodly glade by the cephisian mere thence fleetly didst thou speed to the ridge of the hills and camest to crisa beneath snowy parnassus to a knoll that faced westward but above it hangs a cliff and a hollow dell runs under rough with wood and even there prince phoebus apollo deemed well to build a goodly temple and spake saying here methinketh to stablish a right fair temple to be a place oracular to men that shall ever bring me hither goodly hecatombs both they that dwell in rich peloponnesus and they of the mainland and seagirt isles seeking here the word of sooth to them all shall i speak the decree unerring rendering oracles within my wealthy shrine so speaking phoebus apollo marked out the foundations right long and wide and thereon trophonius and agamedes laid the threshold of stone the sons of erginus dear to the deathless gods but round all the countless tribes of men built a temple with wrought stones to be famous for ever in song hard by is a fairflowing stream and there with an arrow from his strong bow did the prince the son of zeus slay the dragoness mighty and huge a wild etin that was wont to wreak many woes on earthly men on themselves and their straightstepping flocks so dread a bane was she this dragoness it was that took from goldenthroned hera and reared the dread typhaon not to be dealt with a bane to mortals him did hera bear upon a time in wrath with father zeus whenas cronides brought forth from his head renowned athene straightway lady hera was angered and spake among the assembled gods listen to me ye gods and goddesses all how cloudcollecting zeus is first to begin the dishonouring of me though he made me his wife in honour and now apart from me he has brought forth greyeyed athene who excels among all the blessed immortals but he was feeble from the birth among all the gods my son hephaestos lame and withered of foot whom i myself lifted in my hands and cast into the wide sea but the daughter of nereus thetis of the silver feet received him and nurtured him among her sisters would that she had done other grace to the blessed immortals thou evil one of many wiles what other wile devisest thou how hadst thou the heart now alone to bear greyeyed athene could i not have borne her but none the less would she have been called thine among the immortals who hold the wide heaven take heed now that i devise not for thee some evil to come yea now shall i use arts whereby a child of mine shall be born excelling among the immortal gods without dishonouring thy sacred bed or mine for verily to thy bed i will not come but far from thee will nurse my grudge against the immortal gods so spake she and withdrew from among the gods with angered heart right so she made her prayer the oxeyed lady hera striking the earth with her hand flatlings and spake her word listen to me now earth and wide heavens above and ye gods called titans dwelling beneath earth in great tartarus ye from whom spring gods and men list to me now all of you and give me a child apart from zeus yet nothing inferior to him in might nay stronger than he as much as farseeing zeus is mightier than cronus so spake she and smote the ground with her firm hand then earth the nurse of life was stirred and hera beholding it was glad at heart for she deemed that her prayer would be accomplished from that hour for a full year she never came to the bed of wise zeus nor to her throne adorned whereon she was wont to sit planning deep counsel but dwelling in her temples the homes of prayers she took joy in her sacrifices the oxeyed lady hera now when her months and days were fulfilled the year revolving and the seasons in their course coming round she bare a birth like neither gods nor mortals the dread typhaon not to be dealt with a bane of men him now she took the oxeyed lady hera and carried and gave to the dragoness to bitter nurse a bitter fosterling who received him that ever wrought many wrongs among the renowned tribes of men whosoever met the dragoness on him would she bring the day of destiny before the prince fardarting apollo loosed at her the destroying shaft then writhing in strong anguish and mightily panting she lay rolling about the land dread and dire was the din as she writhed hither and thither through the wood and gave up the ghost and phoebus spoke his malison there do thou rot upon the fruitful earth no longer shalt thou at least live to be the evil bane of mortals that eat the fruit of the fertile soil and hither shall bring perfect hecatombs surely from thee neither shall typhoeus nay nor chimaera of the evil name shield death that layeth low but here shall black earth and bright hyperion make thee waste away so he spake in malison and darkness veiled her eyes and there the sacred strength of the sun did waste her quite away whence now the place is named pytho and men call the prince pythian for that deed for even there the might of the swift sun made corrupt the monster then phoebus apollo was ware in his heart that the fairflowing spring telphusa had beguiled him and in wrath he went to her and swiftly came and standing close by her spoke his word telphusa thou wert not destined to beguile my mind nor keep the winsome lands and pour forth thy fair waters nay here shall my honour also dwell not thine alone so he spoke and overset a rock with a shower of stones and hid her streams the prince fardarting apollo and he made an altar in a grove of trees hard by the fairflowing stream where all men name him in prayer the prince telphusian for that he shamed the streams of sacred telphusa then phoebus apollo considered in his heart what men he should bring in to be his ministers and to serve him in rocky pytho while he was pondering on this he beheld a swift ship on the winedark sea and aboard her many men and good cretans from minoan cnossus such as do sacrifice to the god and speak the doom of phoebus apollo of the golden sword what word soever he utters of sooth from the daphne in the dells of parnassus for barter and wealth they were sailing in the black ship to sandy pylos and the pylian men anon phoebus apollo set forth to meet them leaping into the sea upon the swift ship in the guise of a dolphin and there he lay a portent great and terrible of the crew whosoever sought in heart to comprehend what he was on all sides he kept swaying to and fro and shaking the timbers of the galley but all they sat silent and in fear aboard the ship nor loosed the sheets nor the sail of the blackprowed galley nay even as they had first set the sails so they voyaged onward the strong southwind speeding on the vessel from behind first they rounded malea and passed the laconian land and came to helos a citadel by the sea and taenarus the land of helios that is the joy of mortals where ever feed the deep fleeced flocks of prince helios and there hath he his glad demesne there the crew thought to stay the galley and land and consider of the marvel and see whether that strange thing will abide on the deck of the hollow ship or leap again into the swell of the fishes home but the wellwrought ship did not obey the rudder but kept ever on her way beyond rich peloponnesus prince apollo lightly guiding it by the gale so accomplishing her course she came to arene and pleasant arguphea and thryon the ford of alpheius and wellbuilded aepu and sandy pylos and the pylian men and ran by crounoi and chalcis and dyme and holy elis where the epeians bear sway then rejoicing in the breeze of zeus she was making for pherae when to them out of the clouds showed forth the steep ridge of ithaca and dulichium and same and wooded zacynthus anon when she had passed beyond all peloponnesus there straightway off crisa appeared the wide sound that bounds rich peloponnesus then came on the west wind clear and strong by the counsel of zeus blowing hard out of heaven that the running ship might swiftest accomplish her course over the salt water of the sea backward then they sailed towards the dawn and the sun and the prince was their guide apollo son of zeus then came they to farseen crisa the land of vines into the haven while the seafaring ship beached herself on the shingle then from the ship leaped the prince fardarting apollo like a star at high noon while the gledes of fire flew from him and the splendour flashed to the heavens into his inmost holy place he went through the precious tripods and in the midst he kindled a flame showering forth his shafts and the splendour filled all crisa and the wives of the crisaeans and their fairgirdled daughters raised a wail at the rushing flight of phoebus for great fear fell upon all thence again to the galley he set forth and flew fleet as a thought in shape a man lusty and strong in his first youth his locks swathing his wide shoulders anon he spake to the seamen winged words strangers who are ye whence sail ye the wet ways is it after merchandise or do ye wander at adventure over the salt sea as searobbers use that roam staking their own lives and bearing bane to men of strange speech why sit ye thus adread not faring forth on the land nor slackening the gear of your black ship sure this is the wont of toilsome mariners when they come from the deep to the land in their black ship foredone with labour and anon a longing for sweet food seizes their hearts so spake he and put courage in their breasts and the leader of the cretans answered him saying stranger behold thou art no whit like unto mortal men in shape or growth but art a peer of the immortals wherefore all hail and grace be thine and all good things at the hands of the gods tell me then truly that i may know indeed what people is this what land what mortals dwell here surely with our thoughts set on another goal we sailed the great sea to pylos from crete whence we boast our lineage but now it is hither that we have come maugre our wills with our galley another path and other ways we longing to return but some god has led us all unwilling to this place then the fardarting apollo answered them strangers who dwelt aforetime round wooded cnossus never again shall ye return each to his pleasant city and his own house and his wife but here shall ye hold my rich temple honoured by multitudes of men lo i am the son of zeus and name myself apollo and hither have i brought you over the great gulf of the sea with no evil intent nay here shall ye possess my rich temple held highest in honour among all men and ye shall know the counsels of the immortals by whose will ye shall ever be held in renown but now come and instantly obey my word first lower the sails and loose the sheets and then beach the black ship on the land taking forth the wares and gear of the trim galley and build ye an altar on the strand of the sea thereon kindle fire and sprinkle above in sacrifice the white barleyflour and thereafter pray standing around the altar and whereas i first in the misty sea sprang aboard the swift ship in the guise of a dolphin therefore pray to me as apollo delphinius while mine shall ever be the delphian altar seen from afar then take ye supper beside the swift black ship and pour libations to the blessed gods who hold olympus but when ye have dismissed the desire of sweet food then with me do ye come singing the paean till ye win that place where ye shall possess the rich temple so spake he while they heard and obeyed eagerly first they lowered the sails loosing the sheets and lowering the mast by the forestays they laid it in the maststead and themselves went forth on the strand of the sea then forth from the salt sea to the mainland they dragged the fleet ship high up on the sands laying long sleepers thereunder and they builded an altar on the seastrand and lit fire thereon scattering above white barleyflour in sacrifice and standing around the altar they prayed as the god commanded anon they took supper beside the fleet black ship and poured forth libations to the blessed gods who hold olympus but when they had dismissed the desire of meat and drink they set forth on their way and the prince apollo guided them harp in hand and sweetly he harped faring with high and goodly strides dancing in his train the cretans followed to pytho and the paean they were chanting the paeans of the cretans in whose breasts the muse hath put honeysweet song all unwearied they strode to the hill and swiftly were got to parnassus and a winsome land where they were to dwell honoured of many among men apollo guided them and showed his holy shrine and rich temple and the spirit was moved in their breasts and the captain of the cretans spake and asked the god saying prince since thou hast led us far from friends and our own country for so it pleases thee how now shall we live we pray thee tell us this fair land bears not vines nor is rich in meadows wherefrom we might live well and minister to men then smiling apollo the son of zeus spoke to them foolish ones enduring hearts who desire cares and sore toil and all straits a light word will i speak to you do ye consider it let each one of you knife in right hand be ever slaughtering sheep that in abundance shall ever be yours all the flocks that the renowned tribes of men bring hither to me yours it is to guard my temple and receive the tribes of men that gather hither doing above all as my will enjoins but if any vain word be spoken or vain deed wrought or violence after the manner of mortal men then shall others be your masters and hold you in thraldom for ever i have spoken all do thou keep it in thy heart even so fare thou well son of zeus and leto but i shall remember both thee and another song ii hermes of hermes sing o muse the son of zeus and maia lord of cyllene and arcadia rich in sheep the fortunebearing herald of the gods him whom maia bore the fairtressed nymph that lay in the arms of zeus a shamefaced nymph was she shunning the assembly of the blessed gods dwelling within a shadowy cave therein was cronion wont to embrace the fairtressed nymph in the deep of night when sweet sleep held whitearmed hera the immortal gods knowing it not nor mortal men but when the mind of great zeus was fulfilled and over her the tenth moon stood in the sky the babe was born to light and all was made manifest yea then she bore a child of many a wile and cunning counsel a robber a driver of the kine a captain of raiders a watcher of the night a thief of the gates who soon should show forth deeds renowned among the deathless gods born in the dawn by midday well he harped and in the evening stole the cattle of apollo the fardarter on that fourth day of the month wherein lady maia bore him who when he leaped from the immortal knees of his mother lay not long in the sacred cradle but sped forth to seek the cattle of apollo crossing the threshold of the highroofed cave there found he a tortoise and won endless delight for lo it was hermes that first made of the tortoise a minstrel the creature met him at the outer door as she fed on the rich grass in front of the dwelling waddling along at sight whereof the luck bringing son of zeus laughed and straightway spoke saying lo a lucky omen for me not by me to be mocked hail darling and dancer friend of the feast welcome art thou whence gatst thou the gay garment a speckled shell thou a mountaindwelling tortoise nay i will carry thee within and a boon shalt thou be to me not by me to be scorned nay thou shalt first serve my turn best it is to bide at home since danger is abroad living shalt thou be a spell against ill witchery and dead then a right sweet musicmaker hermes making the lyre bronze relief in the british museum fourth century bc langjpg so spake he and raising in both hands the tortoise went back within the dwelling bearing the glad treasure then he choked the creature and with a gouge of grey iron he scooped out the marrow of the hill tortoise and as a swift thought wings through the breast of one that crowding cares are haunting or as bright glances fleet from the eyes so swiftly devised renowned hermes both deed and word he cut to measure stalks of reed and fixed them in through holes bored in the stony shell of the tortoise and cunningly stretched round it the hide of an ox and put in the horns of the lyre and to both he fitted the bridge and stretched seven harmonious chords of sheepgut then took he his treasure when he had fashioned it and touched the strings in turn with the plectrum and wondrously it sounded under his hand and fair sang the god to the notes improvising his chant as he played like lads exchanging taunts at festivals of zeus cronides and fairsandalled maia he sang how they had lived in loving dalliance and he told out the tale of his begetting and sang the handmaids and the goodly halls of the nymph and the tripods in the house and the store of cauldrons so then he sang but dreamed of other deeds then bore he the hollow lyre and laid it in the sacred cradle then in longing for flesh of kine he sped from the fragrant hall to a place of outlook with such a design in his heart as reiving men pursue in the dark of night the sun had sunk down beneath earth into ocean with horses and chariot when hermes came running to the shadowy hills of pieria where the deathless kine of the blessed gods had ever their haunt there fed they on the fair unshorn meadows from their number did the keensighted argeiphontes son of maia cut off fifty loudlowing kine and drove them hither and thither over the sandy land reversing their tracks and mindful of his cunning confused the hoofmarks the front behind the hind in front and himself fared down again straightway he wove sandals on the seasand things undreamed he wrought works wonderful unspeakable mingling myrtle twigs and tamarisk then binding together a bundle of the fresh young wood he shrewdly fastened it for light sandals beneath his feet leaves and all brushwood that the renowned slayer of argos had plucked on his way from pieria being as he was in haste down the long way then an old man that was labouring a fruitful vineyard marked the god faring down to the plain through grassy onchestus and to him spoke first the son of renowned maia old man that bowest thy shoulders over thy hoeing verily thou shalt have wine enough when all these vines are bearing see thou and see not hear thou and hear not be silent so long as naught of thine is harmed therewith he drave on together the sturdy heads of cattle and over many a shadowy hill and through echoing corries and flowering plains drave renowned hermes then stayed for the more part his darkling ally the sacred night and swiftly came morning when men can work and sacred selene daughter of pallas mighty prince clomb to a new place of outlook and then the strong son of zeus drave the broadbrowed kine of phoebus apollo to the river alpheius unwearied they came to the high roofed stall and the wateringplaces in front of the fair meadow there when he had foddered the deepvoiced kine he herded them huddled together into the byre munching lotus and dewy marsh marigold next brought he much wood and set himself to the craft of firekindling taking a goodly shoot of the daphne he peeled it with the knife fitting it to his hand and the hot vapour of smoke arose lo it was hermes first who gave fire and the firesticks then took he many dry faggots great plenty and piled them in the trench and flame began to break sending far the breath of burning fire and when the force of renowned hephaestus kept the fire aflame then downward dragged he so mighty his strength two bellowing kine of twisted horn close up to the fire he dragged them and cast them both panting upon their backs to the ground then bending over them he turned them upwards and cut their throats task upon task and sliced off the fat meat pierced it with spits of wood and broiled it flesh and chine the joint of honour and blood in the bowels all together then laid all there in its place the hides he stretched out on a broken rock as even now they are used such as are to be enduring long and long after that ancient day a anon glad hermes dragged the fat portions on to a smooth ledge and cut twelve messes sorted out by lot to each its due meed he gave then a longing for the rite of the sacrifice of flesh came on renowned hermes for the sweet savour irked him immortal as he was but not even so did his strong heart yield b the fat and flesh he placed in the highroofed stall the rest he swiftly raised aloft a trophy of his reiving and gathering dry faggots he burned heads and feet entire with the vapour of flame anon when the god had duly finished all he cast his sandals into the deep swirling pool of alpheius quenched the embers and all night long spread smooth the black dust selene lighting him with her lovely light back to the crests of cyllene came the god at dawn nor blessed god on that long way nor mortal man encountered him nay and no dog barked then hermes son of zeus bearer of boon bowed his head and entered the hall through the hole of the bolt like mist on the breath of autumn then standing erect he sped to the rich inmost chamber of the cave lightly treading noiseless on the floor quickly to his cradle came glorious hermes and wrapped the swaddling bands about his shoulders like a witless babe playing with the wrapper about his knees so lay he guarding his dear lyre at his left hand but his goddess mother the god did not deceive she spake saying wherefore thou cunning one and whence comest thou in the night thou clad in shamelessness anon methinks thou wilt go forth at apollos hands with bonds about thy sides that may not be broken sooner than be a robber in the glens go to wretch thy father begat thee for a trouble to deathless gods and mortal men but hermes answered her with words of guile mother mine why wouldst thou scare me so as though i were a redeless child with little craft in his heart a trembling babe that dreads his mothers chidings nay but i will essay the wiliest craft to feed thee and me for ever we twain are not to endure to abide here of all the deathless gods alone unapproached with sacrifice and prayer as thou commandest better it is eternally to be conversant with immortals richly nobly well seen in wealth of grain than to be homekeepers in a darkling cave and for honour i too will have my dues of sacrifice even as apollo even if my father give it me not i will endeavour for i am of avail to be a captain of reivers and if the son of renowned leto make inquest for me methinks some worse thing will befall him for to pytho i will go to break into his great house whence i shall sack goodly tripods and cauldrons enough and gold and gleaming iron and much raiment thyself if thou hast a mind shalt see it so held they converse one with another the son of zeus of the aegis and lady maia then morning the daughter of dawn was arising from the deep stream of oceanus bearing light to mortals what time apollo came to onchestus in his journeying the gracious grove a holy place of the loud girdler of the earth there he found an old man grazing his ox the stay of his vineyard on the roadside him first bespoke the son of renowned leto old man hedger of grassy onchestus hither am i come seeking cattle from pieria all the crookhorned kine out of my herd my black bull was wont to graze apart from the rest and my four brighteyed hounds followed four of them wise as men and all of one mind these were left the hounds and the bull a marvel but the kine wandered away from their soft meadow and sweet pasture at the going down of the sun tell me thou old man of ancient days if thou hast seen any man faring after these cattle then to him the old man spake and answered my friend hard it were to tell all that a man may see for many wayfarers go by some full of ill intent and some of good and it is difficult to be certain regarding each nevertheless the whole day long till sunset i was digging about my vineyard plot and methought i marked but i know not surely a child that went after the horned kine right young he was and held a staff and kept going from side to side and backwards he drove the kine their faces fronting him so spake the old man but apollo heard and went fleeter on his path then marked he a bird long of wing and anon he knew that the thief had been the son of zeus cronion swiftly sped the prince apollo son of zeus to goodly pylos seeking the shambling kine while his broad shoulders were swathed in purple cloud then the fardarter marked the tracks and spake verily a great marvel mine eyes behold these be the tracks of high horned kine but all are turned back to the meadow of asphodel but these are not the footsteps of a man nay nor of a woman nor of grey wolves nor bears nor lions nor methinks of a shaggymaned centaur whosoever with fleet feet makes such mighty strides dread to see they are that backwards go more dread they that go forwards so speaking the prince sped on apollo son of zeus to the cyllenian hill he came that is clad in forests to the deep shadow of the hollow rock where the deathless nymph brought forth the child of zeus cronion a fragrance sweet was spread about the goodly hill and many tall sheep were grazing the grass thence he went fleetly over the stone threshold into the dusky cave even apollo the fardarter now when the son of zeus and maia beheld apollo thus in wrath for his kine he sank down within his fragrant swaddling bands being covered as piled embers of burnt treeroots are covered by thick ashes so hermes coiled himself up when he saw the fardarter and curled himself feet head and hands into small space summoning sweet sleep though of a verity wide awake and his tortoiseshell he kept beneath his armpit but the son of zeus and leto marked them well the lovely mountain nymph and her dear son a little babe all wrapped in cunning wiles gazing round all the chamber of the vasty dwelling apollo opened three aumbries with the shining key full were they of nectar and glad ambrosia and much gold and silver lay within and much raiment of the nymph purple and glistering such as are within the dwellings of the mighty gods anon when he had searched out the chambers of the great hall the son of leto spake to renowned hermes child in the cradle lying tell me straightway of my kine or speedily between us twain will be unseemly strife for i will seize thee and cast thee into murky tartarus into the darkness of doom where none is of avail nor shall thy father or mother redeem thee to the light nay under earth shalt thou roam a reiver among folk fordone then hermes answered with words of craft apollo what ungentle word hast thou spoken and is it thy cattle of the homestead thou comest here to seek i saw them not heard not of them gave ear to no word of them of them i can tell no tidings nor win the fee of him who tells not like a lifter of cattle a stalwart man am i no task is this of mine hitherto i have other cares sleep and mothers milk and about my shoulders swaddling bands and warmed baths let none know whence this feud arose and verily great marvel among the immortals it would be that a newborn child should cross the threshold after kine of the homestead a silly rede of thine yesterday was i born my feet are tender and rough is the earth below but if thou wilt i shall swear the great oath by my fathers head that neither i myself am to blame nor have i seen any other thief of thy kine be kine what they may for i know but by hearsay so spake he with twinkling eyes and twisted brows glancing hither and thither with longdrawn whistling breath hearing apollos word as a vain thing then lightly laughing spake apollo the fardarter oh thou rogue thou crafty one verily methinks that many a time thou wilt break into stablished homes and by night leave many a man bare silently pilling through his house such is thy speech today and many herdsmen of the steadings wilt thou vex in the mountain glens when in lust for flesh thou comest on the herds and sheep thick of fleece nay come lest thou sleep the last and longest slumber come forth from thy cradle thou companion of black night for surely this honour hereafter thou shalt have among the immortals to be called for ever the captain of reivers so spake phoebus apollo and lifted the child but even then strong argus bane had his device and in the hands of the god let forth an omen an evil bellytenant with tidings of worse and a speedy sneeze thereafter apollo heard and dropped renowned hermes on the ground then sat down before him eager as he was to be gone chiding hermes and thus he spoke take heart swaddling one child of zeus and maia by these thine omens shall i find anon the sturdy kine and thou shalt lead the way so spake he but swiftly arose cyllenian hermes and swiftly fared pulling about his ears his swaddling bands that were his shoulder wrapping then spake he whither bearest thou me fardarter of gods most vehement is it for wrath about thy kine that thou thus provokest me would that the race of kine might perish for thy cattle have i not stolen nor seen another steal whatsoever kine may be i know but by hearsay i but let our suit be judged before zeus cronion now were lone hermes and the splendid son of leto point by point disputing their pleas apollo with sure knowledge was righteously seeking to convict renowned hermes for the sake of his kine but he with craft and cunning words sought to beguile the cyllenian to beguile the god of the silver bow but when the wily one found one as wily then speedily he strode forward through the sand in front while behind came the son of zeus and leto swiftly they came to the crests of fragrant olympus to father cronion they came these goodly sons of zeus for there were set for them the balances of doom quiet was snowy olympus but they who know not decay or death were gathering after goldthroned dawn then stood hermes and apollo of the silver bow before the knees of zeus the thunderer who inquired of his glorious son saying phoebus whence drivest thou such mighty spoil a newborn babe like a herald a mighty matter this to come before the gathering of the gods then answered him the prince apollo the fardarter father anon shalt thou hear no empty tale tauntest thou me as though i were the only lover of booty this boy have i found a finished reiver in the hills of cyllene a long way to wander so fine a knave as i know not among gods or men of all robbers on earth my kine he stole from the meadows and went driving them at eventide along the loud sea shores straight to pylos wondrous were the tracks a thing to marvel on work of a glorious god for the black dust showed the tracks of the kine making backward to the mead of asphodel but this child intractable fared neither on hands nor feet through the sandy land but this other strange craft had he to tread the paths as if shod on with oaken shoots while he drove the kine through a land of sand right plain to discern were all the tracks in the dust but when he had crossed the great tract of sand straightway on hard ground his traces and those of the kine were ill to discern but a mortal man beheld him driving straight to pylos the cattle broad of brow now when he had stalled the kine in quiet and confused his tracks on either side the way he lay dark as night in his cradle in the dusk of a shadowy cave the keenest eagle could not have spied him and much he rubbed his eyes with crafty purpose and bluntly spake his word i saw not i heard not aught nor learned anothers tale nor tidings could i give nor win reward of tidings therewith phoebus apollo sat him down but another tale did hermes tell among the immortals addressing cronion the master of all gods father zeus verily the truth will i tell thee for true am i nor know the way of falsehood today at sunrise came apollo to our house seeking his shambling kine no witnesses of the gods brought he nor no gods who had seen the fact but he bade me declare the thing under duress threatening oft to cast me into wide tartarus for he wears the tender flower of glorious youth but i was born but yesterday as well himself doth know and in naught am i like a stalwart lifter of kine believe for thou givest thyself out to be my father that may i never be well if i drove home the kine nay or crossed the threshold this i say for sooth the sun i greatly revere and other gods and thee i love and him i dread nay thyself knowest that i am not to blame and thereto i will add a great oath by these fairwrought porches of the gods i am guiltless and one day yet i shall avenge me on him for this pitiless accusation mighty as he is but do thou aid the younger so spake cyllenian argusbane and winked with his wrapping on his arm he did not cast it down but zeus laughed aloud at the sight of his evil witted child so well and wittily he pled denial about the kine then bade he them both be of one mind and so seek the cattle with hermes as guide to lead the way and show without guile where he had hidden the sturdy kine the son of cronos nodded and glorious hermes obeyed for lightly persuadeth the counsel of zeus of the aegis then sped both of them the fair children of zeus to sandy pylos at the ford of alpheius and to the fields they came and the stall of lofty roof where the booty was tended in the season of darkness there anon hermes went to the side of the rocky cave and began driving the sturdy cattle into the light but the son of leto glancing aside saw the flayed skins on the high rock and quickly asked renowned hermes how wert thou of avail oh crafty one to flay two kine newborn and childish as thou art for time to come i dread thy might no need for thee to be growing long thou son of maia so spake he and round his hands twisted strong bands of withes but they at his feet were soon intertwined each with other and lightly were they woven over all the kine of the field by the counsel of thievish hermes but apollo marvelled at that he saw then the strong argusbane with twinkling glances looked down at the ground wishful to hide his purpose but that harsh son of renowned leto the fardarter did he lightly soothe to his will taking his lyre in his left hand he tuned it with the plectrum and wondrously it rang beneath his hand thereat phoebus apollo laughed and was glad and the winsome note passed through to his very soul as he heard then maias son took courage and sweetly harping with his harp he stood at apollos left side playing his prelude and thereon followed his winsome voice he sang the renowns of the deathless gods and the dark earth how all things were at the first and how each god gat his portion to mnemosyne first of gods he gave the meed of minstrelsy to the mother of the muses for the muse came upon the son of maia then all the rest of the immortals in order of rank and birth did he honour the splendid son of zeus telling duly all the tale as he struck the lyre on his arm but on apollos heart in his breast came the stress of desire who spake to him winged words thou crafty slayer of kine thou comrade of the feast thy song is worth the price of fifty oxen henceforth methinks shall we be peacefully made at one but come now tell me this thou wily son of maia have these marvels been with thee even since thy birth or is it that some immortal or some mortal man has given thee the glorious gift and shown thee song divine for marvellous is this new song in mine ears such as methinks none hath known either of men or of immortals who have mansions in olympus save thyself thou reiver thou son of zeus and maia what art is this what charm against the stress of cares what a path of song for verily here is choice of all three things joy and love and sweet sleep for truly though i be conversant with the olympian muses to whom dances are a charge and the bright minstrel hymn and rich song and the lovesome sound of flutes yet never yet hath aught else been so dear to my heart dear as the skill in the festivals of the gods i marvel son of zeus at this the music of thy minstrelsy but now since despite thy youth thou hast such glorious skill to thee and to thy mother i speak this word of sooth verily by this shaft of cornel wood i shall lead thee renowned and fortunate among the immortals and give thee glorious gifts nor in the end deceive thee then hermes answered him with cunning words shrewdly thou questionest me fardarter nor do i grudge thee to enter upon mine art this day shalt thou know it and to thee would i fain be kind in word and will but within thyself thou well knowest all things for first among the immortals son of zeus is thy place mighty art thou and strong and zeus of wise counsels loves thee well with reverence due and hath given thee honour and goodly gifts nay they tell that thou knowest soothsaying fardarter by the voice of zeus for from zeus are all oracles wherein i myself now know thee to be allwise thy province it is to know what so thou wilt since then thy heart bids thee play the lyre harp thou and sing and let joys be thy care taking this gift from me and to me friend gain glory sweetly sing with my shrill comrade in thy hands that knoweth speech good and fair and in order due freely do thou bear it hereafter into the glad feast and the winsome dance and the glorious revel a joy by night and day whatsoever skilled hand shall inquire of it artfully and wisely surely its voice shall teach him all things joyous being easily played by gentle practice fleeing dull toil but if an unskilled hand first impetuously inquires of it vain and discordant shall the false notes sound but thine it is of nature to know what things thou wilt so to thee will i give this lyre thou glorious son of zeus but we for our part will let graze thy cattle of the field on the pastures of hill and plain thou far darter so shall the kine consorting with the bulls bring forth calves male and female great store and no need there is that thou wise as thou art should be vehement in anger so spake he and held forth the lyre that phoebus apollo took and pledged his shining whip in the hands of hermes and set him over the herds gladly the son of maia received it while the glorious son of leto apollo the prince the fardarter held the lyre in his left hand and tuned it orderly with the plectrum sweetly it sounded to his hand and fair thereto was the song of the god thence anon the twain turned the kine to the rich meadow but themselves the glorious children of zeus hastened back to snowclad olympus rejoicing in the lyre ay and zeus the counsellor was glad of it both did he make one in love and hermes loved letos son constantly even as now since when in knowledge of his love he pledged to the fardarter the winsome lyre who held it on his arm and played thereon but hermes withal invented the skill of a new art the farheard music of the reed pipes then spake the son of leto to hermes thus i fear me son of maia thou leader thou crafty one lest thou steal from me both my lyre and my bent bow for this meed thou hast from zeus to establish the ways of barter among men on the fruitful earth wherefore would that thou shouldst endure to swear me the great oath of the gods with a nod of the head or by the showering waters of styx that thy doings shall ever to my heart be kind and dear then with a nod of his head did maias son vow that never would he steal the possessions of the fardarter nor draw nigh his strong dwelling and letos son made vow and band of love and alliance that none other among the gods should be dearer of gods or men the seed of zeus and i shall make with thee a perfect token of a covenant of all gods and all men loyal to my heart and honoured a thereafter shall i give thee a fair wand of wealth and fortune a golden wand three pointed which shall guard thee harmless accomplishing all things good of word and deed that it is mine to learn from the voice of zeus b but as touching the art prophetic oh best of fosterlings of zeus concerning which thou inquirest for thee it is not fit to learn that art nay nor for any other immortal that lies in the mind of zeus alone myself did make pledge and promise and strong oath that save me none other of the eternal gods should know the secret counsel of zeus and thou my brother of the golden wand bid me not tell thee what awful purposes is planning the farseeing zeus one mortal shall i harm and another shall i bless with many a turn of fortune among hapless men of mine oracle shall he have profit whosoever comes in the wake of wings and voice of birds of omen he shall have profit of mine oracle him i will not deceive but whoso trusting birds not ominous approaches mine oracle to inquire beyond my will and know more than the eternal gods shall come i say on a bootless journey yet his gifts shall i receive yet another thing will i tell thee thou son of renowned maia and of zeus of the aegis thou bringer of boon there be certain thriae sisters born three maidens rejoicing in swift wings their heads are sprinkled with white barley flour and they dwell beneath a glade of parnassus apart they dwell teachers of soothsaying this art i learned while yet a boy i tended the kine and my father heeded not thence they flit continually hither and thither feeding on honeycombs and bringing all things to fulfilment they when they are full of the spirit of soothsaying having eaten of the wan honey delight to speak forth the truth but if they be bereft of the sweet food divine then lie they all confusedly these i bestow on thee and do thou inquiring clearly delight thine own heart and if thou instruct any man he will often hearken to thine oracle if he have the good fortune these be thine o son of maia and the cattle of the field with twisted horn do thou tend and horses and toilsome mules and be lord over the burning eyes of lions and whitetoothed swine and dogs and sheep that wide earth nourishes and over all flocks be glorious hermes lord and let him alone be herald appointed to hades who though he be giftless will give him highest gift of honour with such love in all kindness did apollo pledge the son of maia and thereto cronion added grace with all mortals and immortals he consorts somewhat doth he bless but ever through the dark night he beguiles the tribes of mortal men hail to thee thus son of zeus and maia of thee shall i be mindful and of another lay iii aphrodite tell me muse of the deeds of golden aphrodite the cyprian who rouses sweet desire among the immortals and vanquishes the tribes of deathly men and birds that wanton in the air and all beasts even all the clans that earth nurtures and all in the sea to all are dear the deeds of the garlanded cyprian aphrodite marble statue in the louvre langjpg yet three hearts there be that she cannot persuade or beguile the daughter of zeus of the aegis greyeyed athene not to her are dear the deeds of golden aphrodite but war and the work of ares battle and broil and the mastery of noble arts first was she to teach earthly men the fashioning of war chariots and cars fairwrought with bronze and she teaches to tender maidens in the halls all goodly arts breathing skill into their minds nor ever doth laughterloving aphrodite conquer in desire artemis of the golden distaff rejoicing in the sound of the chase for the bow and arrow are her delight and slaughter of the wild beasts on the hills the lyre the dance the clear hunting halloo and shadowy glens and cities of righteous men nor to the revered maiden hestia are the feats of aphrodite a joy eldest daughter of crookedcounselled cronos youngest too by the design of zeus of the aegis that lady whom both poseidon and apollo sought to win but she would not nay stubbornly she refused and she swore a great oath fulfilled with her hand on the head of father zeus of the aegis to be a maiden for ever that lady goddess and to her father zeus gave a goodly meed of honour in lieu of wedlock and in midhall she sat her down choosing the best portion and in all temples of the gods is she honoured and among all mortals is chief of gods of these she cannot win or beguile the hearts but of all others there is none of blessed gods or mortal men that hath escaped aphrodite yea even the heart of zeus the thunderer she led astray of him that is greatest of all and hath the highest lot of honour even his wise wit she hath beguiled at her will and lightly laid him in the arms of mortal women hera not wotting of it his sister and his wife the fairest in goodliness of beauty among the deathless goddesses to highest honour did they beget her crookedcounselled cronos and mother rheia and zeus of imperishable counsel made her his chaste and duteous wife but into aphrodite herself zeus sent sweet desire to lie in the arms of a mortal man this wrought he so that anon not even she might be unconversant with a mortal bed and might not some day with sweet laughter make her boast among all the gods the smiling aphrodite that she had given the gods to mortal paramours and they for deathless gods bare deathly sons and that she mingled goddesses in love with mortal men therefore zeus sent into her heart sweet desire of anchises who as then was pasturing his kine on the steep hills of manyfountained ida a man in semblance like the immortals him thereafter did smiling aphrodite see and love and measureless desire took hold on her heart to cyprus wended she within her fragrant shrine even to paphos where is her sacred garth and odorous altar thither went she in and shut the shining doors and there the graces laved and anointed her with oil ambrosial such as is on the bodies of the eternal gods sweet fragrant oil that she had by her then clad she her body in goodly raiment and prinked herself with gold the smiling aphrodite then sped to troy leaving fragrant cyprus and high among the clouds she swiftly accomplished her way to manyfountained ida she came mother of wild beasts and made straight for the steading through the mountain while behind her came fawning the beasts grey wolves and lions fieryeyed and bears and swift pards insatiate pursuers of the roedeer glad was she at the sight of them and sent desire into their breasts and they went coupling two by two in the shadowy dells but she came to the wellbuilded shielings and him she found left alone in the shielings with no company the hero anchises graced with beauty from the gods all the rest were faring after the kine through the grassy pastures but he left lonely at the shielings walked up and down harping sweet and shrill in front of him stood the daughter of zeus aphrodite in semblance and stature like an unwedded maid lest he should be adread when he beheld the goddess and anchises marvelled when he beheld her her height and beauty and glistering raiment for she was clad in vesture more shining than the flame of fire and with twisted armlets and glistering earrings of flower fashion about her delicate neck were lovely jewels fair and golden and like the moons was the light on her fair breasts and love came upon anchises and he spake unto her hail queen whosoever of the immortals thou art that comest to this house whether artemis or leto or golden aphrodite or highborn themis or greyeyed athene or perchance thou art one of the graces come hither who dwell friendly with the gods and have a name to be immortal or of the nymphs that dwell in this fair glade or in this fair mountain and in the wellheads of rivers and in grassy dells but to thee on some point of outlook in a place far seen will i make an altar and offer to thee goodly victims in every season but for thy part be kindly and grant me to be a man preeminent among the trojans and give goodly seed of children to follow me but for me let me live long and see the sunlight and come to the limit of old age being ever in all things fortunate among men then aphrodite the daughter of zeus answered him anchises most renowned of men on earth behold no goddess am i why likenest thou me to the immortals nay mortal am i and a mortal mother bare me and my father is famous otreus if thou perchance hast heard of him who reigns over strongwarded phrygia now i well know both your tongue and our own for a trojan nurse reared me in the hall and nurtured me ever from the day when she took me at my mothers hands and while i was but a little child thus it is thou seest that i well know thy tongue as well as my own but even now the argusslayer of the golden wand hath ravished me away from the choir of artemis the goddess of the golden distaff who loves the noise of the chase many nymphs and maids beloved of many wooers were we there at play and a great circle of people was about us withal but thence did he bear me away the argusslayer he of the golden wand and bore me over much tilled land of mortal men and many wastes unfilled and uninhabited where wild beasts roam through the shadowy dells so fleet we passed that i seemed not to touch the fertile earth with my feet now hermes said that i was bidden to be the bride of anchises and mother of thy goodly children but when he had spoken and shown the thing lo instantly he went back among the immortal gods the renowned slayer of argus but i come to thee strong necessity being laid upon me and by zeus i beseech thee and thy good parents for none ill folk may get such a son as thee by them i implore thee to take me a maiden as i am and untried in love and show me to thy father and thy discreet mother and to thy brothers of one lineage with thee no unseemly daughter to these and sister to those will i be but well worthy and do thou send a messenger swiftly to the phrygians of the dappled steeds to tell my father of my fortunes and my sorrowing mother gold enough and woven raiment will they send and many and goodly gifts shall be thy meed do thou all this and then busk the winsome weddingfeast that is honourable among both men and immortal gods so speaking the goddess brought sweet desire into his heart and love came upon anchises and he spake and said if indeed thou art mortal and a mortal mother bore thee and if renowned otreus is thy father and if thou art come hither by the will of hermes the immortal guide and art to be called my wife for ever then neither mortal man nor immortal god shall hold me from my desire before i lie with thee in love now and anon nay not even if apollo the fardarter himself were to send the shafts of sorrow from the silver bow nay thou lady like the goddesses willing were i to go down within the house of hades if but first i had climbed into thy bed so spake he and took her hand while laughterloving aphrodite turned and crept with fair downcast eyes towards the bed it was strewn for the prince as was of wont with soft garments and above it lay skins of bears and deepvoiced lions that he had slain in the lofty hills when then they twain had gone up into the wellwrought bed first anchises took from her body her shining jewels brooches and twisted armlets earrings and chains and he loosed her girdle and unclad her of her glistering raiment that he laid on a silverstudded chair then through the gods will and design by the immortal goddess lay the mortal man not wotting what he did now in the hour when herdsmen drive back the kine and sturdy sheep to the steading from the flowery pastures even then the goddess poured sweet sleep into anchises and clad herself in her goodly raiment now when she was wholly clad the lady goddess her head touched the beam of the lofty roof and from her cheeks shone forth immortal beauty even the beauty of fairgarlanded cytherea then she aroused him from sleep and spake and said rise son of dardanus why now slumberest thou so deeply consider am i even in aspect such as i was when first thine eyes beheld me so spake she and straightway he started up out of slumber and was adread and turned his eyes away when he beheld the neck and the fair eyes of aphrodite his goodly face he veiled again in a cloak and imploring her he spake winged words even so soon as mine eyes first beheld thee goddess i knew thee for divine but not sooth didst thou speak to me but by zeus of the aegis i implore thee suffer me not to live a strengthless shadow among men but pity me for no man lives in strength that has couched with immortal goddesses then answered him aphrodite daughter of zeus anchises most renowned of mortal men take courage nor fear overmuch for no fear is there that thou shalt suffer scathe from me nor from others of the blessed gods for dear to the gods art thou and to thee shall a dear son be born and bear sway among the trojans and childrens children shall arise after him continually lo aeneas shall his name be called since dread sorrow held me when i came into the bed of a mortal man and of all mortal men these who spring from thy race are always nearest to the immortal gods in beauty and stature witness how wisecounselling zeus carried away goldenhaired ganymedes for his beautys sake that he might abide with the immortals and be the cupbearer of the gods in the house of zeus a marvellous thing to behold a mortal honoured among all the immortals as he draws the red nectar from the golden mixingbowl but grief incurable possessed the heart of tros nor knew he whither the wild wind had blown his dear son away therefore day by day he lamented him continually till zeus took pity upon him and gave him as a ransom of his son highstepping horses that bear the immortal gods these he gave him for a gift and the guide the slayer of argus told all these things by the command of zeus even how ganymedes should be for ever exempt from old age and death even as are the gods now when his father heard this message of zeus he rejoiced in his heart and lamented no longer but was gladly charioted by the windfleet horses so too did dawn of the golden throne carry off tithonus a man of your lineage one like unto the immortals then went she to pray to cronion who hath dark clouds for his tabernacle that her lover might be immortal and exempt from death for ever thereto zeus consented and granted her desire but foolish of heart was the lady dawn nor did she deem it good to ask for eternal youth for her lover and to keep him unwrinkled by grievous old age now so long as winsome youth was his in joy did he dwell with the goldenthroned dawn the daughter of morning at the worlds end beside the streams of oceanus but so soon as grey hairs began to flow from his fair head and goodly chin the lady dawn held aloof from his bed but kept and cherished him in her halls giving him food and ambrosia and beautiful raiment but when hateful old age had utterly overcome him and he could not move or lift his limbs to her this seemed the wisest counsel she laid him in a chamber and shut the shining doors and his voice flows on endlessly and no strength now is his such as once there was in his limbs therefore i would not have thee to be immortal and live for ever in such fashion among the deathless gods but if being such as thou art in beauty and form thou couldst live on and be called my lord then this grief would not overshadow my heart but it may not be for swiftly will pitiless old age come upon thee old age that standeth close by mortal men wretched and weary and detested by the gods but among the immortal gods shall great blame be mine for ever and all for love of thee for the gods were wont to dread my words and wiles wherewith i had subdued all the immortals to mortal women in love my purpose overcoming them all for now lo you my mouth will no longer suffice to speak forth this boast among the immortals for deep and sore hath been my folly wretched and not to be named and distraught have i been who carry a child beneath my girdle the child of a mortal now so soon as he sees the light of the sun the deepbosomed mountain nymphs will rear him for me the nymphs who haunt this great and holy mountain being of the clan neither of mortals nor of immortal gods long is their life and immortal food do they eat and they join in the goodly dance with the immortal gods with them the sileni and the keen sighted slayer of argus live in dalliance in the recesses of the darkling caves at their birth there sprang up pine trees or tallcrested oaks on the fruitful earth nourishing and fair and on the lofty mountain they stand and are called the groves of the immortal gods which in no wise doth man cut down with the steel but when the fate of death approaches first do the fair trees wither on the ground and the bark about them moulders and the twigs fall down and even as the tree perishes so the soul of the nymph leaves the light of the sun these nymphs will keep my child with them and rear him and him when first he enters on lovely youth shall these goddesses bring hither to thee and show thee but to thee that i may tell thee all my mind will i come in the fifth year bringing my son at the sight of him thou wilt be glad when thou beholdest him with thine eyes for he will be divinely fair and thou wilt lead him straightway to windy ilios but if any mortal man asketh of thee what mother bare this thy dear son be mindful to answer him as i command say that he is thy son by one of the flower faced nymphs who dwell in this forestclad mountain but if in thy folly thou speakest out and boastest to have been the lover of fairgarlanded cytherea then zeus in his wrath will smite thee with the smouldering thunderbolt now all is told to thee do thou be wise and keep thy counsel and speak not my name but revere the wrath of the gods so spake she and soared up into the windy heaven goddess queen of wellstablished cyprus having given thee honour due i shall pass on to another hymn iv hymn to demeter syracusan medallion by euainetos obv head of persephone rev victorious chariot langjpg of fairtressed demeter demeter holy goddess i begin to sing of her and her slimankled daughter whom hades snatched away the gift of wide beholding zeus but demeter knew it not she that bears the seasons the giver of goodly crops for her daughter was playing with the deepbosomed maidens of oceanus and was gathering flowers roses and crocuses and fair violets in the soft meadow and lilies and hyacinths and the narcissus which the earth brought forth as a snare to the fair faced maiden by the counsel of zeus and to pleasure the lord with many guests wondrously bloomed the flower a marvel for all to see whether deathless gods or deathly men from its root grew forth a hundred blossoms and with its fragrant odour the wide heaven above and the whole earth laughed and the salt wave of the sea then the maiden marvelled and stretched forth both her hands to seize the fair plaything but the widewayed earth gaped in the nysian plain and up rushed the prince the host of many guests the manynamed son of cronos with his immortal horses maugre her will he seized her and drave her off weeping in his golden chariot but she shrilled aloud calling on father cronides the highest of gods and the best but no immortal god or deathly man heard the voice of her save the daughter of persaeus hecate of the shining headtire as she was thinking delicate thoughts who heard the cry from her cave and prince helios the glorious son of hyperion the maiden calling on father cronides but he far off sat apart from the gods in his temple haunted by prayers receiving goodly victims from mortal men by the design of zeus did the brother of zeus lead the maiden away the lord of many the host of many guests with his deathless horses right sore against her will even he of many names the son of cronos now so long as the goddess beheld the earth and the starry heaven and the tide of the teeming sea and the rays of the sun and still hoped to behold her mother dear and the tribes of the eternal gods even so long despite her sorrow hope warmed her high heart then rang the mountain peaks and the depths of the sea to her immortal voice and her lady mother heard her then sharp pain caught at her heart and with her hands she tore the wimple about her ambrosial hair and cast a dark veil about her shoulders and then sped she like a bird over land and sea in her great yearning but to her there was none that would tell the truth none either of gods or deathly men nor even a bird came nigh her a soothsaying messenger thereafter for nine days did lady deo roam the earth with torches burning in her hands nor ever in her sorrow tasted she of ambrosia and sweet nectar nor laved her body in the baths but when at last the tenth morn came to her with the light hecate met her a torch in her hands and spake a word of tidings and said lady demeter thou that bringest the seasons thou giver of glad gifts which of the heavenly gods or deathly men hath ravished away persephone and brought thee sorrow for i heard a voice but i saw not who the ravisher might be all this i say to thee for sooth so spake hecate and the daughter of fairtressed rheie answered her not but swiftly rushed on with her bearing torches burning in her hands so came they to helios that watches both for gods and men and stood before his car and the lady goddess questioned him helios be pitiful on me that am a goddess if ever by word or deed i gladdened thy heart my daughter whom i bore a sweet plant and fair to see it was her shrill voice i heard through the air unharvested even as of one violently entreated but i saw her not with my eyes but do thou that lookest down with thy rays from the holy air upon all the land and sea do thou tell me truly concerning my dear child if thou didst behold her who it is that hath gone off and ravished her away from me against her will who is it of gods or mortal men so spake she and hyperionides answered her daughter of fairtressed rheia queen demeter thou shalt know it for greatly do i pity and revere thee in thy sorrow for thy slimankled child there is none other guilty of the immortals but zeus himself that gathereth the clouds who gave thy daughter to hades his own brother to be called his lovely wife and hades has ravished her away in his chariot loudly shrilling beneath the dusky gloom but goddess do thou cease from thy long lamenting it behoves not thee thus vainly to cherish anger unassuaged no unseemly lord for thy daughter among the immortals is aidoneus the lord of many thine own brother and of one seed with thee and for his honour he won since when was made the threefold division to be lord among those with whom he dwells so spake he and called upon his horses and at his call they swiftly bore the fleet chariot on like longwinged birds but grief more dread and bitter fell upon her and wroth thereafter was she with cronion that hath dark clouds for his dwelling she held apart from the gathering of the gods and from tall olympus and disfiguring her form for many days she went among the cities and rich fields of men now no man knew her that looked on her nor no deepbosomed woman till she came to the dwelling of celeus who then was prince of fragrant eleusis there sat she at the wayside in sorrow of heart by the maiden well whence the townsfolk were wont to draw water in the shade she sat above her grew a thick olivetree and in fashion she was like an ancient crone who knows no more of childbearing and the gifts of aphrodite the lover of garlands such she was as are the nurses of the children of doompronouncing kings such are the housekeepers in their echoing halls now the daughters of celeus beheld her as they came to fetch the fair flowing water to carry thereof in bronze vessels to their fathers home four were they like unto goddesses all in the bloom of youth callidice and cleisidice and winsome demo and callithoe the eldest of them all nor did they know her for the gods are hard to be known by mortals but they stood near her and spake winged words who art thou and whence old woman of ancient folk and why wert thou wandering apart from the town nor dost draw nigh to the houses where are women of thine own age in the shadowy halls even such as thou and younger women too who may kindly entreat thee in word and deed so spake they and the lady goddess answered dear children whoever ye be of womankind i bid you hail and i will tell you my story seemly it is to answer your questions truly deo is my name that my lady mother gave me but now look you from crete am i come hither over the wide ridges of the sea by no will of my own nay by violence have searovers brought me hither under duress who thereafter touched with their swift ship at thoricos where the women and they themselves embarked on land then were they busy about supper beside the hawsers of the ship but my heart heeded not delight of supper no stealthily setting forth through the dark land i fled from these overweening masters that they might not sell me whom they had never bought and gain my price thus hither have i come in my wandering nor know i at all what land is this nor who they be that dwell therein but to you may all they that hold mansions in olympus give husbands and lords and such children to bear as parents desire but me do ye maidens pity in your kindness till i come to the house of woman or of man that there i may work zealously for them in such tasks as fit a woman of my years i could carry in mine arms a newborn babe and nurse it well and keep the house and strew my masters bed within the wellbuilded chambers and teach the maids their tasks so spake the goddess and straightway answered her the maid unwed callidice the fairest of the daughters of celeus mother what things soever the gods do give must men though sorrowing endure for the gods are far stronger than we but this will i tell thee clearly and soothly namely what men they are who here have most honour and who lead the people and by their counsels and just dooms do safeguard the bulwarks of the city such are wise triptolemus diocles polyxenus and noble eumolpus and dolichus and our lordly father all their wives keep their houses and not one of them would at first sight contemn thee and thrust thee from their halls but gladly they will receive thee for thine aspect is divine so if thou wilt abide here that we may go to the house of my father and tell out all this tale to my mother the deepbosomed metaneira if perchance she will bid thee come to our house and not seek the homes of others a dear son born in her later years is nurtured in the wellbuilded hall a child of many prayers and a welcome if thou wouldst nurse him till he comes to the measure of youth then whatsoever woman saw thee should envy thee such gifts of fosterage would my mother give thee so spake she and the goddess nodded assent so rejoicing they filled their shining pitchers with water and bore them away swiftly they came to the high hall of their father and quickly they told their mother what they had heard and seen and speedily she bade them run and call the strange woman offering goodly hire then as deer or calves in the season of spring leap along the meadow when they have had their fill of pasture so lightly they kilted up the folds of their lovely kirtles and ran along the hollow chariotway while their hair danced on their shoulders in colour like the crocus flower they found the glorious goddess at the wayside even where they had left her and anon they led her to their fathers house but she paced behind in heaviness of heart her head veiled and the dark robe floating about her slender feet divine speedily they came to the house of celeus the fosterling of zeus and they went through the corridor where their lady mother was sitting by the doorpost of the wellwrought hall with her child in her lap a young blossom and the girls ran up to her but the goddess stood on the threshold her head touching the roofbeam and she filled the doorway with the light divine then wonder and awe and pale fear seized the mother and she gave place from her high seat and bade the goddess be seated but demeter the bearer of the seasons the giver of goodly gifts would not sit down upon the shining high seat nay in silence she waited casting down her lovely eyes till the wise iambe set for her a wellmade stool and cast over it a glistering fleece then sat she down and held the veil before her face long in sorrow and silence sat she so and spake to no man nor made any sign but smileless she sat nor tasted meat nor drink wasting with long desire for her deep bosomed daughter so abode she till wise iambe with jests and many mockeries beguiled the lady the holy one to smile and laugh and hold a happier heart and pleased her moods even thereafter then metaneira filled a cup of sweet wine and offered it to her but she refused it saying that it was not permitted for her to drink red wine but she bade them mix meal and water with the tender herb of mint and give it to her to drink then metaneira made a potion and gave it to the goddess as she bade and lady deo took it and made libation and to them fairgirdled metaneira said hail lady for methinks thou art not of mean parentage but goodly born for grace and honour shine in thine eyes as in the eyes of doom dealing kings but the gifts of the gods even in sorrow we men of necessity endure for the yoke is laid upon our necks yet now that thou art come hither such things as i have shall be thine rear me this child that the gods have given in my later years and beyond my hope and he is to me a child of many prayers if thou rear him and he come to the measure of youth verily each woman that sees thee will envy thee such shall be my gifts of fosterage then answered her again demeter of the fair garland and mayst thou too lady fare well and the gods give thee all things good gladly will i receive thy child that thou biddest me nurse never methinks by the folly of his nurse shall charm or sorcery harm him for i know an antidote stronger than the wild wood herb and a goodly salve i know for the venomed spells so spake she and with her immortal hands she placed the child on her fragrant breast and the mother was glad at heart so in the halls she nursed the goodly son of wise celeus even demophoon whom deepbreasted metaneira bare and he grew like a god upon no mortal food nor on no mothers milk for demeter anointed him with ambrosia as though he had been a son of a god breathing sweetness over him and keeping him in her bosom so wrought she by day but at night she was wont to hide him in the force of fire like a brand his dear parents knowing it not nay to them it was great marvel how flourished he and grew like the gods to look upon and verily she would have made him exempt from eld and death for ever had not fairgirdled metaneira in her witlessness spied on her in the night from her fragrant chamber then wailed she and smote both her thighs in terror for her child and in anguish of heart and lamenting she spake winged words my child demophoon the stranger is concealing thee in the heart of the fire bitter sorrow for me and lamentation so spake she wailing and the lady goddess heard her then in wrath did the fairgarlanded demeter snatch out of the fire with her immortal hands and cast upon the ground that womans dear son whom beyond all hope she had borne in the halls dread was the wrath of demeter and anon she spake to fairgirdled metaneira oh redeless and uncounselled race of men that know not beforehand the fate of coming good or coming evil for lo thou hast wrought upon thyself a bane incurable by thine own witlessness for by the oath of the gods the relentless water of styx i would have made thy dear child deathless and exempt from age for ever and would have given him glory imperishable but now in nowise may he escape the fates and death yet glory imperishable will ever be his since he has lain on my knees and slept within my arms but as the years go round and in his day the sons of the eleusinians will ever wage war and dreadful strife one upon the other now i am the honoured demeter the greatest good and gain of the immortals to deathly men but come now let all the people build me a great temple and an altar thereby below the town and the steep wall above callichorus on the jutting rock but the rites i myself will prescribe that in time to come ye may pay them duly and appease my power therewith the goddess changed her shape and height and cast off old age and beauty breathed about her and the sweet scent was breathed from her fragrant robes and afar shone the light from the deathless body of the goddess the yellow hair flowing about her shoulders so that the goodly house was filled with the splendour as of levin fire and forth from the halls went she but anon the knees of the woman were loosened and for long time she was speechless nay nor did she even mind of the child her best beloved to lift him from the floor but the sisters of the child heard his pitiful cry and leapt from their fairstrewn beds one of them lifting the child in her hands laid it in her bosom and another lit fire and the third ran with smooth feet to take her mother forth from the fragrant chamber then gathered they about the child and bathed and clad him lovingly yet his mood was not softened for meaner nurses now and handmaids held him they the long night through were adoring the renowned goddess trembling with fear but at the dawning they told truly to mighty celeus all that the goddess had commanded even demeter of the goodly garland thereon he called into the marketplace the many people and bade them make a rich temple and an altar to fairtressed demeter upon the jutting rock then anon they heard and obeyed his voice and as he bade they builded and the child increased in strength by the goddesss will now when they had done their work and rested from their labours each man started for his home but yellowhaired demeter sitting there apart from all the blessed gods abode wasting away with desire for her deep bosomed daughter then the most dread and terrible of years did the goddess bring for mortals upon the fruitful earth nor did the earth send up the seed for demeter of the goodly garland concealed it many crooked ploughs did the oxen drag through the furrows in vain and much white barley fell fruitless upon the land now would the whole race of mortal men have perished utterly from the stress of famine and the gods that hold mansions in olympus would have lost the share and renown of gift and sacrifice if zeus had not conceived a counsel within his heart first he roused iris of the golden wings to speed forth and call the fair tressed demeter the lovesome in beauty so spake zeus and iris obeyed zeus the son of cronos who hath dark clouds for his tabernacle and swiftly she sped adown the space between heaven and earth then came she to the citadel of fragrant eleusis and in the temple she found demeter clothed in dark raiment and speaking winged words addressed her demeter father zeus whose counsels are imperishable bids thee back unto the tribes of the eternal gods come thou then lest the word of zeus be of no avail so spake she in her prayer but the goddess yielded not thereafter the father sent forth all the blessed gods all of the immortals and coming one by one they bade demeter return and gave her many splendid gifts and all honours that she might choose among the immortal gods but none availed to persuade by turning her mind and her angry heart so stubbornly she refused their sayings for she deemed no more for ever to enter fragrant olympus and no more to allow the earth to bear her fruit until her eyes should behold her fairfaced daughter but when farseeing zeus the lord of the thunderpeal had heard the thing he sent to erebus the slayer of argos the god of the golden wand to win over hades with soft words and persuade him to bring up holy persephone into the light and among the gods from forth the murky gloom that so her mother might behold her and that her anger might relent and hermes disobeyed not but straightway and speedily went forth beneath the hollow places of the earth leaving the home of olympus that king he found within his dwelling sitting on a couch with his chaste bedfellow who sorely grieved for desire of her mother that still was cherishing a fell design against the ill deeds of the gods then the strong slayer of argos drew near and spoke hades of the dark locks thou prince of men outworn father zeus bade me bring the dread persephone forth from erebus among the gods that her mother may behold her and relent from her anger and terrible wrath against the immortals for now she contrives a mighty deed to destroy the feeble tribes of earthborn men by withholding the seed under the earth thereby the honours of the gods are minished and fierce is her wrath nor mingles she with the gods but sits apart within the fragrant temple in the steep citadel of eleusis so spake he and smiling were the brows of aidoneus prince of the dead nor did he disobey the commands of king zeus as speedily he bade the wise persephone go persephone to thy darkmantled mother go with a gentle spirit in thy breast nor be thou beyond all other folk disconsolate verily i shall be no unseemly lord of thine among the immortals i that am the brother of father zeus and whilst thou art here shalt thou be mistress over all that lives and moves but among the immortals shalt thou have the greatest renown upon them that wrong thee shall vengeance be unceasing upon them that solicit not thy power with sacrifice and pious deeds and every acceptable gift so spake he and wise persephone was glad and joyously and swiftly she arose but the god himself stealthily looking around her gave her sweet pomegranate seed to eat and this he did that she might not abide for ever beside revered demeter of the dark mantle then openly did aidoneus the prince of all get ready the steeds beneath the golden chariot and she climbed up into the golden chariot and beside her the strong slayer of argos took reins and whip in hand and drove forth from the halls and gladly sped the horses twain speedily they devoured the long way nor sea nor rivers nor grassy glades nor cliffs could stay the rush of the deathless horses nay far above them they cleft the deep air in their course before the fragrant temple he drove them and checked them where dwelt demeter of the goodly garland who when she beheld them rushed forth like a maenad down a dark mountain woodland but persephone on the other side rejoiced to see her mother dear and leaped to meet her but the mother said child in hades hast thou eaten any food for if thou hast not then with me and thy father the son of cronos who has dark clouds for his tabernacle shalt thou ever dwell honoured among all the immortals but if thou hast tasted food thou must return again and beneath the hollows of the earth must dwell in hades a third portion of the year yet two parts of the year thou shalt abide with me and the other immortals when the earth blossoms with all manner of fragrant flowers then from beneath the murky gloom shalt thou come again a mighty marvel to gods and to mortal men now tell me by what wile the strong host of many guests deceived thee then fair persephone answered her august mother behold i shall tell thee all the truth without fail i leaped up for joy when boon hermes the swift messenger came from my father cronides and the other heavenly gods with the message that i was to return out of erebus that so thou mightest behold me and cease thine anger and dread wrath against the immortals thereon hades himself compelled me to taste of a sweet pomegranate seed against my will and now i will tell thee how through the crafty device of cronides my father he ravished me and bore me away beneath the hollows of the earth all that thou askest i will tell thee we were all playing in the lovely meadows leucippe and phaino and electra and ianthe and melite and iache and rhodeia and callirhoe and melobosis and tuche and flowerfaced ocyroe and chraesis and ianeira and acaste and admete and rhodope and plouto and winsome calypso and styx and urania and beautiful galaxaure we were playing there and plucking beautiful blossoms with our hands crocuses mingled and iris and hyacinth and roses and lilies a marvel to behold and narcissus that the wide earth bare a wile for my undoing gladly was i gathering them when the earth gaped beneath and therefrom leaped the mighty prince the host of many guests and he bare me against my will despite my grief beneath the earth in his golden chariot and shrilly did i cry this all is true that i tell thee so the livelong day in oneness of heart did they cheer each other with love and their minds ceased from sorrow and great gladness did either win from other then came to them hekate of the fair wimple and often did she kiss the holy daughter of demeter and from that day was her queenly comrade and handmaiden but to them for a messenger did farseeing zeus of the loud thunderpeal send fairtressed rhea to bring darkmantled demeter among the gods with pledge of what honour she might choose among the immortals he vowed that her daughter for the third part of the revolving year should dwell beneath the murky gloom but for the other two parts she should abide with her mother and the other gods thus he spake and the goddess disobeyed not the commands of zeus swiftly she sped down from the peaks of olympus and came to fertile rarion fertile of old but now no longer fruitful for fallow and leafless it lay and hidden was the white barley grain by the device of fairankled demeter none the less with the growing of the spring the land was to teem with tall ears of corn and the rich furrows were to be heavy with corn and the corn to be bound in sheaves there first did she land from the unharvested ether and gladly the goddesses looked on each other and rejoiced in heart and thus first did rhea of the fair wimple speak to demeter hither child for he calleth thee farseeing zeus the lord of the deep thunder to come among the gods and has promised thee such honours as thou wilt and hath decreed that thy child for the third of the rolling year shall dwell beneath the murky gloom but the other two parts with her mother and the rest of the immortals so doth he promise that it shall be and thereto nods his head but come my child obey and be not too unrelenting against the son of cronos the lord of the dark cloud and anon do thou increase the grain that bringeth life to men so spake she and demeter of the fair garland obeyed speedily she sent up the grain from the rich glebe and the wide earth was heavy with leaves and flowers and she hastened and showed the thing to the kings the dealers of doom to triptolemus and diocles the charioteer and mighty eumolpus and celeus the leader of the people she showed them the manner of her rites and taught them her goodly mysteries holy mysteries which none may violate or search into or noise abroad for the great curse from the gods restrains the voice happy is he among deathly men who hath beheld these things and he that is uninitiate and hath no lot in them hath never equal lot in death beneath the murky gloom now when the goddess had given instruction in all her rites they went to olympus to the gathering of the other gods there the goddesses dwell beside zeus the lord of the thunder holy and revered are they right happy is he among mortal men whom they dearly love speedily do they send as a guest to his lofty hall plutus who giveth wealth to mortal men but come thou that holdest the land of fragrant eleusis and seagirt paros and rocky antron come lady deo queen and giver of goodly gifts and bringer of the seasons come thou and thy daughter beautiful persephone and of your grace grant me goodly substance in requital of my song but i will mind me of thee and of other minstrelsy v to aphrodite i shall sing of the revered aphrodite the goldencrowned the beautiful who hath for her portion the mountain crests of seagirt cyprus thither the strength of the west wind moistly blowing carried her amid soft foam over the wave of the resounding sea her did the goldensnooded hours gladly welcome and clad her about in immortal raiment and on her deathless head set a wellwrought crown fair and golden and in her ears put earrings of orichalcum and of precious gold her delicate neck and white bosom they adorned with chains of gold wherewith are bedecked the goldensnooded hours themselves when they come to the glad dance of the gods in the dwelling of the father anon when they had thus adorned her in all goodliness they led her to the immortals who gave her greeting when they beheld her and welcomed her with their hands and each god prayed that he might lead her home to be his wedded wife so much they marvelled at the beauty of the fairgarlanded cytherean hail thou of the glancing eyes thou sweet winsome goddess and grant that i bear off the victory in this contest and lend thou grace to my song while i shall both remember thee and another singing vi to dionysus dionysus sailing in his sacred ship interior design on a kylix by exekias in munich langjpg concerning dionysus the son of renowned semele shall i sing how once he appeared upon the shore of the sea unharvested on a jutting headland in form like a man in the bloom of youth with his beautiful dark hair waving around him and on his strong shoulders a purple robe anon came in sight certain men that were pirates in a wellwrought ship sailing swiftly on the dark seas tyrsenians were they and ill fate was their leader for they beholding him nodded each to other and swiftly leaped forth and hastily seized him and set him aboard their ship rejoicing in heart for they deemed that he was the son of kings the fosterlings of zeus and they were minded to bind him with grievous bonds but him the fetters held not and the withes fell far from his hands and feet there sat he smiling with his dark eyes but the steersman saw it and spake aloud to his companions fools what god have ye taken and bound a strong god is he our trim ship may not contain him surely this is zeus or apollo of the silver bow or poseidon for he is nowise like mortal man but like the gods who have mansions in olympus nay come let us instantly release him upon the dark mainland nor lay ye your hands upon him lest being wroth he rouse against us masterful winds and rushing storm so spake he but their captain rebuked him with a hateful word fool look thou to the wind and haul up the sail and grip to all the gear but this fellow will be for men to meddle with methinks he will come to egypt or to cyprus or to the hyperboreans or further far and at the last he will tell us who his friends are and concerning his wealth and his brethren for the god has delivered him into our hands so spake he and let raise the mast and hoist the mainsail and the wind filled the sail and they made taut the ropes all round but anon strange matters appeared to them first there flowed through all the swift black ship a sweet and fragrant wine and the ambrosial fragrance arose and fear fell upon all the mariners that beheld it and straightway a vine stretched hither and thither along the sail hanging with many a cluster and dark ivy twined round the mast blossoming with flowers and gracious fruit and garlands grew on all the tholepins and they that saw it bade the steersman drive straight to land meanwhile within the ship the god changed into the shape of a lion at the bow and loudly he roared and in midship he made a shaggy bear such marvels he showed forth there stood it raging and on the deck glared the lion terribly then the men fled in terror to the stern and there stood in fear round the honest pilot but suddenly sprang forth the lion and seized the captain and the men all at once leaped overboard into the strong sea shunning dread doom and there were changed into dolphins but the god took pity upon the steersman and kept him and gave him all good fortune and spake saying be of good courage sir dear art thou to me and i am dionysus of the noisy rites whom cadmeian semele bare to the love of zeus hail thou child of beautiful semele none that is mindless of thee can fashion sweet minstrelsy vii to ares ares thou that excellest in might thou lord of the chariot of war god of the golden helm thou mighty of heart thou shieldbearer thou safety of cities thou that smitest in

for soundingboard and the cithara with no such soundingboard are represented is it possible that the tuneful shell was primarily used without chords as an instrument for drumming upon the drum variously made is the primitive musical instrument and it is doubted whether any stringed instrument existed among native american races but drawings in ancient aztec mss as mr morse has recently observed show the musician using a kind of drum made of a tortoiseshell and some students have probably with too much fancy recognised a figure with a tortoiseshell fitted with chords in aztec mss it is possible enough that the early greeks used the shell as a sort of drum before some inventor hermes in the hymn added chords and developed a stringed instrument cf p such sandals are used to hide

hermes was hinting at his wish to receive in exchange the gift of prophecy if so these passages are all disjointed and with what follows should come after where hermes makes the gift of the lyre it
