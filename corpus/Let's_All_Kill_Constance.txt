 lets all kill constance ray bradbury this book is dedicated with love to my daughter alexandra without whose help the third millennium might never have arrived and again with gratitude and love to sid stebel chapter one it was a dark and stormy night is that one way to catch your reader well then it was a stormy night with dark rain pouring in drenches on venice california the sky shattered by lightning at midnight it had rained from sunset going headlong toward dawn no creature stirred in that downfall the shades in the bungalows were drawn on faint blue glimmers where night owls deathwatched bad news or worse the only thing that moved in all that flood ten miles south and ten miles north was death and someone running fast ahead of death to bang on my paperthin oceanfront bungalow door shocking me hunched at my typewriter digging graves my cure for insomnia i was trapped in a tomb when the hammering hit my door midstorm i flung the door wide to find constance rattigan or as she was widely known the rattigan a series of flickerflash lightning bolts cracked the sky and photographed dark light light dark a dozen times rattigan forty years of triumphs and disasters crammed in one brown surfseal body golden tan five feet two inches tall here she comes there she goes swimming far out at sunset bodysurfing back they said at dawn to be beached at all hours barking with the sea beasts half a mile out or idling in her oceanside pool a martini in each hand stark naked to the sun or whiplashing down into her basement projection room to watch herself run timeless on the pale ceiling with eric von stroheim jack gilbert or rod la rocques ghosts then abandoning her silent laughter on the cellar walls vanishing in the surf again a quick target that time and death could never catch constance the rattigan my god what are you doing here she cried rain or tears on her wild suntanned face my god i said what are you answer my question maggies east at a teachers conference im trying to finish my new novel our house inland is deserted my old landlord said your beach apartments empty come write swim and here i am my god constance get inside youll drown i already have stand back but constance did not move for a long moment she stood shivering in the light of great sheets of lightning and the following sound of thunder one moment i thought i saw the woman that i had known for years larger than life leaping into and jumping out of the sea whose image i had witnessed on the ceiling and walls of her basements projection room backstroking through the lives of von stroheim and other silent ghosts then that changed she stood in the doorway diminished by light and sound she shrank to a child clutching a black bag to her chest holding herself from the cold eyes shut with some unguessed dread it was hard for me to believe that rattigan the eternal film star had come to visit in the midst of thunders i finally said again come in come in she repeated her whisper stand back she swarmed on me and with one vacuumsuction kiss harassed my tongue like saltwater taffy and fled halfway across the room she thought to come back and buss my cheek lightly jeez thats some flavor she said but wait im scared hugging her elbows she sogged down to dampen my sofa i brought a huge towel pulled off her dress and wrapped her you do this to all your women she said teeth chattering only on dark and stormy nights i wont tell maggie hold still rattigan for gods sake men have said that all my life then they drive a stake through my heart are your teeth gritting because youre halfdrowned or scared lets see she sank back exhausted i ran all the way from my place i knew you werent here its been years since you left but christ how great to find you save me from what for gods sake death no one gets saved from that constance dont say that i didnt come to die im here christ to live forever thats just a prayer constance not reality youre going to live forever your books forty years maybe dont knock forty years i could use a few you could use a drink sit still i brought out a half bottle of cold duck jesus whats that i hate scotch and this is el cheapo writers stuff drink its hemlock she drank and grimaced quick something else in our midget bathroom i found a small flask of vodka kept for nights when dawn was far off constance seized it come to mama she chugalugged easy constance you dont have my death cramps she finished three more shots and handed me the flask eyes shut god is good she fell back on the pillows you wanna hear about that damn thing that chased me down the shore wait i put the bottle of cold duck to my lips and drank shoot well she said death chapter two i was beginning to wish there was more in that empty vodka flask shivering i turned on the small gas heater in the hall searched the kitchen found a bottle of ripple hell rattigan cried thats hair tonic she drank and shivered where was i running fast yeah but whatever i ran away from came with the front door knocked with wind i grabbed her hand until the knocking stopped then she picked up her big black purse and handed over a small book trembling here i read los angeles telephone directory oh lord i whispered tell me why i brought that she said i turned from the as on down through the gs and hs and on through m and tv and o to the end the names the names from a lost year the names oh my god the names let it sink in said constance i started up front a for alexander albert and william b for burroughs c for good grief i whispered this is i i looked at constance pale under her eternal summer tan these people only a few are still alive i stared at the names no use calling most of these numbers this is what a book of the dead bullseye a book of the dead i said egyptian fresh from the tomb fresh out constance waited someone sent this to you i said was there a note there doesnt have to be a note does there i turned more pages no since practically everyone here is gone the implication is ill soon be silent youd be the last name in these pages of the dead yep said constance i went to turn the heat up and shivered what an awful thing to do awful telephone books i murmured maggie says i cry at them but it all depends on what telephone books when all depends now from her purse she pulled out a second small black book open that i opened it and read constance rattigan and her address on the beach and turned to the first page it was all as abrams alexander alsop allen i went on baldwin bradley benson burton buss and felt a coldness take my fingers these are all friends of yours i know those names and not all but most of them buried out at forest lawn but dug up tonight a graveyard book i said and worse than the one from why i gave this one away years ago to the hollywood helpers i didnt have the heart to erase the names the dead accumulated a few live ones remained but i gave the book away now its back found it when i came in tonight from the surf jesus you swim in this weather rain or shine and tonight i came back to find this lying like a tombstone in my yard no note by saying nothing it says everything christ i took the old directory in one hand rattigans small names and numbers book in the other two almostbooks of the dead i said almost yes said constance look here and here and also here she showed me three names on three pages each with a red ink circle around it and a crucifix these names i said special special yes aw dead or so i think but theyre marked arent they with a cross by each which means what marked to die next up yes no i dont know except it scares me look her name up front had a red ink circle around it plus the crucifix book of the dead plus a list of the soon possibly dead holding it how does that book feel to you cold i said awfully cold the rain beat on the roof who would do a thing like this to you constance name a few hell ten thousand she paused to add sums would you believe nine hundred give or take a dozen my god thats too many suspects spread over thirty years sparse sparse i cried they stood in lines on the beach you didnt have to ask them in when they all shouted rattigan you didnt have to listen what is this a baptist revival sorry well she took the last swig in the bottle and winced will you help find this son of a bitch or two sons of bitches if the books of the dead were sent by separate creeps im no detective constance how come i remember you halfdrowned in the canal with that psycho shrank well how come i saw you up on notre dame at fenix studios with the hunchback please help mama let me sleep on it no sleep tonight hug these old bones now she stood up with the two books of the dead and walked across the room to open the door on black rain and the surf eating the shore and aimed the books wait i cried if im going to help ill need those atta boy she shut the door bed and hugs but no phys ed i wasnt planning constance i said chapter three at two fortyfive in the middle of the dark storm a terrific lightning bolt rammed the earth behind my bungalow thunder erupted mice died in the walls rattigan leaped upright in bed save me she yelled constance i stared through the dark you talking to yourself god or me whoevers listening we all are she lay in my arms the telephone rang at three am the hour when all souls die if they need to die i lifted the receiver whos in bed with you maggie asked from some country with no rains and no storms i searched constances suntanned face with the white skull lost under her summer flesh no one i said and it was almost true chapter four at six in the morning dawn was out there somewhere but you couldnt see it for the rain lightning still flashed and took pictures of the tide slamming the shore an incredibly big lightning bolt struck out in the street and i knew if i reached across the bed the other side would be empty constance the front door stood wide like a stage exit with rain drumming the carpet and the two phone books large and small dropped for me to find constance i said in dismay and looked around at least she put on her dress i thought i telephoned her number silence i shrugged on my raincoat and trudged up the shoreline blinded by rain and stood in front of her arabianfortress house which was brightly lit inside and out but no shadows moved anywhere constance i yelled the lights stayed on and the silence with it a monstrous wave slammed the shore i looked for her footprints going out to the tide none thank god i thought but then the rain would have erased them all right for you i yelled and went away chapter five later i moved along the dusty path through the jungle trees and the wild azalea bushes carrying two sixpacks i knocked on crumleys carved african front door and waited i knocked again silence i set one sixpack of beer against the door and backed off after eight or nine long breaths the door opened just enough to let a nicotinestained hand grab the beer and pull it in the door shut crumley i yelled i ran up to the door go away said a voice from inside crumley its the crazy let me in no way said crumleys voice liquid now for he had opened the first beer your wife called damn i whispered crumley swallowed she said that every time she leaves town you fall off the pier in deep guano or karatechop a team of lesbian midgets she didnt say that look williefor shakespeareim an old man and cant take those graveyard carousels and crocodile men snorkeling the canals at midnight drop that other sixpack thank god for your wife damn i murmured she said shell come home early if you dont cease and desist she would too i muttered nothing like a wife coming home early to spoil the chaos wait he took a swallow youre okay william but no thanks i set the other sixpack down and put the telephone book and rattigans private phone book on top and backed off after a long while that hand emerged again touched braillewise over the books knocked them off and grabbed the beer i waited finally the door reopened the hand curious fumbled the books and snatched them in good i cried good i thought in one hour by god hell call chapter six in one hour crumley called but didnt call me william he said crud crap crapola you really know how to hook a guy what is it with these goddamn books of the dead why do you say that hell i was born in a mortuary raised in a graveyard matriculated in the valley of the kings outside karnak in upper or was it lower egypt some nights i dream im wrapped in creosote who wouldnt know a book thats dead when its served with his beer same old crumley i said i wish it wasnt when i hang up im calling your wife dont why not because i stopped gasped and then blurted out i need you crud did you hear what i said i heard he muttered christ and at last meet you down by rattigans around sunset when things come out of the surf to get you rattigans he hung up before i could chapter seven everything by night thats the ticket nothing at noon the sun is too bright the shadows wait the sky burns so nothing dares move there is no fun in sunlit exposure midnight brings fun when the shadows under trees lift their skirts and glide wind arrives leaves fall footsteps echo beams and floorboards creak dust sifts from tombstone angel wings shadows soar like ravens before dawn the streetlights die the town goes briefly blind it is then that all good mysteries start all adventures linger dawn never was everyone holds their breath to bind the darkness save the terror nail the shadows so it was only proper that as dark waves were striking a darker shore i met crumley on the sand out front of her big white arabianfortress beach house we walked up and looked in all the doors still stood wide bright lights burned inside while gershwin punched holes in a playerpiano roll in to be played again and again triple time with no one listening except me and crumley walking through lots of music but no constance i opened my mouth to apologize for calling crumley drink your gin and shut up crumley thrust a beer at me now he went on what the hell does all this mean he thumbed the pages of rattigans personal book of the dead here here and over here there were red ink marks circling a halfdozen names with deeply indented crucifixes freshly inscribed constance guessed and so did i that those marks meant the owners of those names were still alive but maybe not for long what do you think i dont said crumley this is your picnic i was all set to head for yosemite this weekend and you show up like a film producer who improves the flavor of screenplays by peeing on every other scene id better run for yosemite right now you got that look of a wild rabbit with intuitions hold on for he was starting to move dont you want to prove or disprove which of these names are still kicking or which dropped dead i grabbed the book then tossed it back so he had to catch it fell open at one page with a morethanenormous crucifix by an almostcircusbanner name crumley scowled i read the name upside down califia queen califia bunker hill no address but there was a phone number crumley could not take his eyes off it scowling know where that is i said bunker hill hell i know i know i was born a few blocks north of there a real freeforall stewpot of mexicans gypsies stovepipeoutthewindow irish white trash and black used to go by there to look in at callahan and ortega funeral directors hoped to see real bodies my god callahan and ortega what names right there in the middle of juarez ii guadalajara bums dead flowers from rosarita beach dublin whores crud crumley suddenly yelled furious at listening to his own travel talk half selling himself on my next expedition did you hear me did you listen god i heard i said so why dont we just call one of those red circle numbers to see whats aboveground or below and before he could protest i seized the book and ran up the dune to rattigans outdoor pool brightly lit with an extension phone on a glasstop patio table waiting i didnt dare look at crumley who had not moved as i dialed a voice answered from long miles away that number was no longer in service damn i thought and then wait i dialed information swiftly got a number dialed it and held the phone out so crumley could hear the voice callahan and ortega good evening the voice said a full rich ripe brogue from center stage of abbey theatre i smiled wildly i saw crumley below twitch callahan and ortega the voice repeated louder now its temper roused a long pause i stayed mum who the hell is this i hung up before crumley reached me son of a bitch he said hooked two blocks maybe three from where you were born four you conniving bastard well i said crumley grabbed rattigans book almost but not quite a book of the dead he said want to try another number i opened the book turned and stopped under the rs heres one oh lord yes even better than queen califia crumley squinted rattigan mount lowe what kind of rattigan lives up on mount lowe thats where the big red trolley thats been dead half my lifetime used to take thousands up for picnics memory shadowed crumleys face i touched another name rattigan st vibianas cathedral what kind of rattigan holy jumping jesus hides out in st vibianas cathedral spoken like a bornagain catholic i studied crumleys nowpermanent scowl want to know im on my way i took three false steps before crumley swore how the hell you going to get there with no license and no car i kept my back turned youre going to take me there was a long brooding silence right i prompted you know how in hell to find where the mount lowe trolley once ran i was carried up by my folks when i was eighteen months old that means you can show the way total recall shut up said crumley as he tossed a halfdozen bottles of beer into the jalopy get in the car we got in left gershwin to punch pianoroll holes in paris and drove away dont say anything said crumley just nod your head left right or straight ahead chapter eight ill be damned if i know why in hell im doing this crumley muttered almost driving on the wrong side of the street i said ill be damned if i know why in hell i heard you i said watching the mountains and the foothills coming closer you know who you remind me of crumley snorted my first and only wife who knew how to flimflam me with her shapes and sizes and big smiles do i flimflam you say you dont and ill throw you out of the car when you see me coming you sit and pretend to be working a crossword puzzle youre maybe four words into it before i grab your pencil and shove you outta the way did i ever do that crumley dont get me mad you watching the street signs do so now tell me why are you heading this damnfool expedition i looked at the rattigan phone book in my lap she was running away she said from death from one of die names in this book maybe one of them sent it to her as a spoiled gift or maybe she was running toward them like were doing heading for one to see if hes the sinner who dared to send tombstone dictionaries to impressionable child actresses rattigans no child crumley groused she is she wouldntve been so great up on the screen if she hadnt kept one heckuva lot of her meglin kiddie self locked up in all those sexual acrobatics its not the old rattigan whos scared here its the schoolgirl in panic running through the dark forest hollywood full of monsters you whipping up another of your christmas fruitcakes full of nuts does it sound like it no comment why would one of these redlined friends send her two books full of lousy memories why not constance loved a lot of people in her time so years later one way or another a lot of people hate her they got rejected left behind forgotten she got famous they were found with the trash by the side of the road or maybe theyre real old now and dying and before they go they want to spoil things youre beginning to sound like me crumley said god help me i hope not i mean its okay youll never be crumley just like ill never be jules verne junior where in hell are we i glanced up quickly hey i said this is it mount lowe where the great old red trolley train fell down dead a long time ago professor lowe i said reading some offhand memory from the dark side of my eyelids was the man who invented balloon photography during the civil war where did that come from crumley exclaimed it just came i said unsettled youre full of useless information oh i dont know i said offended were here at mount lowe right and its named for professor lowe and his toonerville trolley scaling its heights right yeah yeah sure crumley said well then professor lowe invented hotair balloon photography that helped catch enemy images in the great war of the states balloons and a new invention trains won for the north okay okay crumley grumbled im outta the car and ready to climb i leaned out the car window and looked at the long weedchoked path that went up and up a long incline in evenings gathering shadows i shut my eyes and recited its three miles to the top you really want to walk crumley glared at the foothill hell no he got back in the car and banged the door shut is there any chance we could run off the edge of that damn narrow path wed be goners always the chance onward crumley edged our jalopy to the foot of the mostly blind path cut the engine got out walked over kicked some dirt and pulled some weeds hallelujah he exclaimed iron steel the old rail track didnt bother to yank it out just buried it see i said his face crimson crumley plunged back in almost submerging the car okay smartass damn car wont start put your foot on the starter damn crumley stomped the floorboard the car shimmied doubledamn smartass kids we ascended chapter nine the way up the mountain was a double wilderness the dry season had come early and burned the wild grass to sere crispness in the rapidly fading light the whole hillside up to the peak was the color of wheat fried by the sun as we rode it crackled two weeks before someone had tossed a match and the whole foothill had exploded in flame it was headlined in the papers and lit the television news the flames were so pretty but now the fire was gone and the chars and dryness with it there was a deadfire smell as crumley and i threaded the lost path winding up mount lowe on the way crumley said its good you cant see over my side a thousandfoot drop i clutched my knees crumley noticed well maybe only a fivehundredfoot drop i shut my eyes and recited off my clenched eyelids the mount lowe railway was part electric part cable car crumley made curious said and i unclenched my knees the railway opened july fourth with free cake and ice cream and thousands of riders the pasadena city brass band rode the first car playing hail columbia but considering their passage into the clouds they had shifted to nearer my god to thee which made at least ten thousand people along the way cry later in the ascension they decided to do upward always upward as they reached the heights they were followed in three cable cars by the los angeles symphony the violins in one car the brass in a second and the timpani and woodwinds in the third car in the confusion the conductor was left behind with his baton later in the day the salt lake city mormon tabernacle choir ascended also in three cars sopranos in one the baritones in another and the bass in the third they sang onward christian soldiers which seemed very appropriate as they vanished in the mist it was reported that ten thousand miles of red white and blue bunting covered all of the trolleys and the trains and the cable cars when the day was finally over one semihysterical woman who admired professor lowe for what he had done to bring about the creation of the mount lowe railway and its taverns and hotels was quoted as saying praise god from whom all blessings flow and also praise professor lowe which made everyone cry again i babbled on crumley said ill be damned i added the pacific electric railway ran to mount lowe the pasadena ostrich farm seleg lion zoo san gabriel mission monrovia baldwins ranch and whittier crumley mumbled under his breath and drove on in silence taking that as a hint i said are we there yet cowardly custard said crumley open your eyes i opened my eyes i think were there and we were for there stood the ruins of the old rail station and beyond that a few charred struts of the burned pavilion i got out slowly and stood with crumley surveying miles of land that went forever to the sea cortes never saw better said crumley views great makes you wonder why they didnt rebuild politics always is now where in hell do we find someone named rattigan in a place like this there some eighty feet away behind a huge spread of pepper trees was a small cottage halfsunk in the earth fire hadnt touched it but rain had worn its paint and battered its roof theres got to be a body in there crumley said as we walked toward it isnt there always a body or else why come see go check ill stand here hating myself for not bringing more booze some detective i ambled over to the cottage and had one helluva time yanking its door wide when it finally whined and gave way i lurched back afraid and peered in crumley i said at last yeah he said sixty feet away come see a body he said even better i said in awe chapter ten we entered a labyrinth of newsprint a labyrinth hell a catacomb with narrow passages between stacks of old newspapersthe new york times the chicago tribune the seattle news the detroit free press five feet on the left six on the right and a pathway between which you might jockey through fearful of avalanches that could crush and kill holy magoly i breathed you can say that again crumley groused christ there must be ten thousand sunday and daily papers stacked here in layerslook yellow down below white on top and not just one stack ten dozenmy god a hundred for indeed the catacomb of newsprint hollowed back through twilight shadow to curve out of sight it was a moment i later said like lord carnarvon opening tuts tomb in all those ancient headlines those obituary piles that led to what more news stacks and more beyond crumley and i sidled through with hardly enough space for bellies or behinds god i whispered if ever a real earthquake hit it did came a voice from far down the stacked tunnel of print a mummy cried kicked the stacks almost pancaked me whos there i called where in hell are you a great maze yeah the mummys voice yelled in glee built it myself morning extra by

churchill builds iron curtain swell huh we turned a final comer among tall flapjack stacks of print to find a clearing in the forest on the far side of the clearing was an army cot on the cot lay what seemed a long bundle of beef jerky or a mummy rampant from the earth there was a strong smell not dead i thought not alive i approached the cot slowly with crumley behind i knew the odor now not death but the great unwashed the rag bundle stirred some ancient blanket shreds flaked from a face like watermarks on mud shallows a faint crack of light glinted between two withered lids pardon my not rising the withered mouth trembled chez monsieur from armentieres havent got up in forty years it cackled a cackle that almost killed it it began to cough no no im okay it whispered the head fell back

didnt think one place we never looked the yellow pages what a goof the yellow pages he was across the sidewalk and into a public phone booth to scrabble through some beatup yellow pages tear out a page and tote it back old phone number useless but maybe a halfass address he shoved the page in my face i read queen califia palmistry phrenology astrology egyptian necrology your life is mine

we dont know that like hell we dont lets see he put the car in gear and we went fast to see chapter twelve we drove up near queen califias psychic research lodge dead center of bunker hill crumley gave it a sour eye then i nodded to one side and he saw what to him was a lovely sight callahan and ortega funeral parlor that raised his spirits its like a homecoming he admitted our jalopy stopped i got out you coming in i said crumley sat staring out the windshield hands on the steering wheel as if we were still moving how come he said everything seems downhill with us you coming in i need you outta the way he was halfway up the steep concrete steps and then the cracked cement walk before he stopped surveyed the big white dilapidated bird cage of a house and said looks like the half bakery where they bake your misfortune cookies we continued up the walk on the way we met a cat a white goat and a peacock the peacock flirted its thousand eyes watching us pass we made it to the front door when i knocked an unseasonable blizzard of paint snowflakes rained on my shoes if thats what holds this joint up it wont be long observed crumley i rapped on the door with my knuckles inside i heard what sounded like a massive portable safe being trundled across a hardwood floor something heavy was shoved up against the other side of the door i raised my hand again but a high sparrow voice inside cried go away i just want go away five minutes i said four two one for gods sake i need your help no the voice shrilled i need yours my mind spun like a rolodex i heard the mummy i echoed him you ever wonder where the name california came from i said silence the high voice lowered to almost a whisper damn three sets of locks rattled nobody knows that about california nobody the door opened a few inches okay give the voice said a hand like a great plump starfish thrust out put it there i put my hand in hers turn it over i turned it palm up her hand seized it calmness her hand massaged mine her thumb circumnavigated the lines on my palm cant be she whispered more quiet motions as she thumbed the pads under my fingers is she sighed and then you remember being born how did you know that you must be the seventh son of a seventh son no i said just me no brothers my god her hand jumped in mine youre going to live forever no one does you will not your body but what you do what do you do i thought my life was in your hands she let out a breathless laugh jesus an actor no shakespeares bastard son he had no sons melville then herman melvilles byblow wish it were true is i heard the great weight behind the door roll back on creaking wheels the portal drifted wide i saw an immense woman in an immense crimson velvet queens robe receding on roller wheels in a metal throne across the hardwood floor to the far side of the room she stopped by a table on which rested not one but four crystal balls coruscant with light from a greenandamber tiffany lamp queen califia astrologer palmist phrenologist past and futurist sank inside three hundred mountainous pounds of tootoosolid flesh her stare flashing x rays a vast iron safe hulked in the shadows i dont bite i stepped in crumley followed but leave the door open she added i heard the peacock scream in the yard and dared to hold out my other hand queen califia reared back as if burned you know greene the novelist she gasped graham greene i nodded wrote about a priest who lost faith then witnessed a miracle he himself had caused the shock at his renewed faith almost killed him so so she stared at my hand as if it were disconnected from my arm lord is it happening to you i said what happened to that priest oh god did you lose your faith your power to heal yes she murmured and now just now it all came back dammit yes i crushed my hand to my chest to blind it howd you guess that i said no guess scares the hell out of me she saw the wedding invitation and the newspaper in my outstretched hand youve been up to see him she said you looked thats cheating that brought a half smile and then a snort people ricochet off him and end up here not often enough i think may i sit i said ill fall if i dont she nodded at a chair a few feet away a safe distance i fell into it crumley ignored looked peevish you were saying i said people dont visit old rattigan often no one knows hes alive on mount lowe but someone went

last i said sheepishly one queen califia mopped her face with a handkerchief big enough to cover half her bosom regained her composure and slowly advanced on me propelling herself on glider wheels with dainty pushes of her incredibly small shoes i could not take my eyes off how tiny her feet were compared with the vast territory above and the great lunar face that loomed on that expanse i saw the ghost of constance drowned beneath that flesh queen califia shut her eyes shes using you you love her carefully keep your clothes on and your motor running she ask you to get her with child not in so many words no words just bastard stillborns she whelped monsters down the whole la basin lousy hollywood boulevard deadend main burn her bed scatter the ashes call a priest which priest where ill

all the names all the pictures all the headlines big and small saved for mysterious or not mysterious reasons behind me crumley snorted horse apples you going to commune with news that was dead as

not worth loving like you crum he glanced over cautiously oh im okay he admitted ive more holes than a sieve but i havent fallen through hold on crumley hit the brakes the popes home away from home i

twelve when i skinned my knees on wild women will you ever take communion again when i die hop out buster from queen califia to the queen of angels i climbed out say a hail mary for me crumley said chapter fifteen inside the cathedral it was empty just after noon and just one penitent was waiting by the confessional when a priest arrived and beckoned her in his face confirmed i was in the right place when the woman left i ducked in the other side of the confessional tonguetied a shadow moved in the lattice window well my son forgive me father i blurted out califia the other confessional door banged wide with a curse i opened my door the priest reared as if i had shot him it was rattigan deja vu not svelte in ninetyfive pounds of suntanned sealbrown flesh but marrowed in a wirecoathanger skeletonthin florentine renaissance priest constances bones hid there but the flesh skinned over the bones was skull pale the priests lips were ravenous for salvation not bed and sinful breakfasts here was savonarola begging god to forgive his wild perorations and god silent with constances ghost burning from his eyes and peering from his skull father rattigan riven found me harmless save for that word jerked his head toward the vestry led me in and shut the door you her friend no sir good he caught himself sit you have five minutes the cardinal is waiting you had better go five minutes said constance from inside the mask of this genetic twin well ive just visited califia father rattigan exhaled with controlled despair the queen sends people she cant help she has her church not mine constance has disappeared again father again thats what the queen ah califia said i held out the book of the dead father rattigan turned its pages whered you get this constance she said someone sent it to her to scare her maybe or hurt her or god knows what i mean only she knows if its a real threat you think she might just be hiding to spoil things for everyone he deliberated i myself am of two minds but then there were those who burned savonarola then and elevate him now a most peculiar sinnercumsaint arent there similarities father i dared to say lots of sinners became saints yes what do you know about florence in when savonarola made botticelli burn his paintings its the only age i know sir father then savonarola now constance if savonarola knew her hed kill himself no no let me think ive starved since dawn heres bread and wine lets have some before i fall the good father pulled a loaf and a jug out of the vestry closet and we sat father rattigan broke the bread then poured a small wine for himself and a large for me which i took gladly baptist he said how did you guess id rather not say i tipped back my glass can you help me with constance father no oh lord lord maybe he refilled my glass last night can it be i stayed in the confessional late i felt as if i were waiting for someone finally near midnight a woman entered the confessional and for a long while was silent finally like jesus calling lazarus i insisted and she wept it all came out sins by the pound and the truckload sins from last year ten years thirty years past she couldnt stop on and on night on dreadful night on and on and finally she was still and i was about to instruct her with hail marys when i heard her running i checked the other side of the confessional but only smelled perfume oh lord lord your sisters scent constance father rattigan sank back hell burned twice that perfume last night i thought so close if crumley and i had only come then youd better go father i said the cardinal will wait well i said if she returns would you call me no said the priest the confessionals as private as a lawyers office are you that upset yes i twisted the wedding ring on my finger absently father rattigan noticed does your wife know all this approximately that sounds like delicatessen morality my wife trusts me wives do that god bless them does my sister seem worth saving doesnt she to you dear god i gave up when she claimed mouthtomouth resuscitation was a kama sutra pose constance still father if she shows up again could you call my number and hang up id know you were signaling her arrival you do know how to split hairs give me your number i see in you not so much a baptist but a fair christian i gave him my number as well as crumleys just one ring father the priest studied the numbers we all live on the slope but some by a miracle grow roots dont wait your phone may never ring but ill give your number to my assistant betty kelly too just in case why are you doing this she was heading fast off a cliff watch out she doesnt take you with im ashamed i said that but as a child she skated out and stopped in midtraffic to laugh he fixed me with a bright needle eye but why do i tell you this its my face your what my face i look in mirrors but never catch myself the expression always changes before i can trap it its got to be a blend of the boy jesus and genghis khan it drives my friends crazy this relaxed some of the priests bones does idiot savant sound right almost the school bullies took one look and beat the hell out of me you were saying was i yes well if that screaming woman was constance and her voice seemed different she gave me orders imagine orders to a priest gave me a deadline said shed be back in twentyfour hours i must give complete forgiveness for all her sins twenty thousand strong as if i could assign such massmarket absolution i told her she must forgive herself and ask others for forgiveness god loves you but he doesnt she said and then she was gone will she come back with doves on her shoulders or lightning bolts father rattigan walked me to the front of the cathedral and how does she look like a siren singing to lure damned sailors to drown are you a poor damn sailor no just someone who writes people on mars father i hope they are happier than we are wait good lord there was a thing she said that she was joining a new church and might not come back to douse my ears what church father chinese chinese and graumans some church to many it is youve been there to see king of kings i found the forecourt superior to the film you look as if youre about to break and run to the new church father chinese graumans stay off the quicksand footprints many sinners have sunk there what films playing abbott and costello in jack and the beanstalk lamentable lamentable i ran mind the quicksand father rattigan called after me as i raced out the doors chapter sixteen on the way across town i was a hotair balloon full of great expectations crumley kept hitting my elbow to make me calm down calm down but we had to get to that other church church crumley muttered since when do double features sideline the father son and holy ghost king kong thats when fay wray kissed my cheek holy mackerel crumley switched on the car radio afternoon a voice said mount lowe listen i said my stomach a chunk of ice the voice said death police clarence rattigan victim a flare of static freak accident victim smothered smothered old newspapers recall brothers in bronx saved stacks of old papers that fell and killed the brothers newspapers turn it off crumley turned it off that poor lost soul i said was he really that lost lost as you can get without giving it the old heaveho you want to drive by drive by i said at last making noises you didnt know him said crumley why those noises the last police car was leaving the morgue van had long since left a lone policeman on his motorcycle stood at the bottom of mount lowe crumley leaned out his window anything to keep us from driving up just me said the officer but im leaving were there any reporters no it wasnt worth it yeah i said and made more noises okay okay crumley groused wait till i get this damn car aimed before you upchuck your hairball i waited and fell apart silently the motorcycle policeman left and it was a long late afternoon journey up to the ruined temple of karnak the destroyed valley of the kings and lost cairo or so i said along the way lord carnarvon dug up a king we bury one i wouldnt mind a grave like this bull montana said crumley he was a wrestling cowboy bull at the top of the hill there were no ruins just a vast pyramid of newspapers being rummaged by a bulldozer driven by an illiterate the guy bucking the wheeled machine had no idea he was reaping hearsts outcries or mccormicks eruptions in the chicago tribune roosevelt hitler baby rose marie marie dressier aimee semple mcpherson one twice buried forever shy i cursed crumley had to restrain me from leaping out to seize victory in europe or hitler dead in bunker or aimee walks from sea easy crumley muttered but look what hes doing to all that priceless stuff let go dammit i leaped forward to grab two or three front pages roosevelt was elected on one dead on another reelected on the third and then there was pearl harbor and hiroshima at dawn jesus i whispered pressing the damned lovely things to my ribs crumley picked up l will return says macarthur i get your point he admitted he was a bastard but the best emperor japan ever had the guy minding the grim reaping machine had stopped and was eyeing us like more trash crumley and i jumped back he plowed through toward a truck already heaped with mussolini bombs ethiopia jeanette macdonald marries al jolson dead fire hazard he yelled i watched a halfhundred years of time pour into the dumpster dry grass and newsprint firetraps i mused my god my god what if what if what in some future date people use newspapers or books to start fires they already do said crumley winter mornings my dad shoved newspaper under the coal in our stove and struck a match okay but what about books no damn fool would use a book to start a fire wait you got that look says youre about to write a tenton encyclopedia no i said maybe a story with a hero who smells of kerosene some hero we walked over a killing field of littered days nights years half a century the papers crunched like cereal underfoot jericho i said someone bring a trumpet here and blow a blast a trumpet blast or a yell theres been a lot of yelling lately at queen califias or here for king tut and then theres the priest rattigan crumley said didnt constance try to blow his church down but hell look were standing on omaha beach normandy over churchills war rooms holding chamberlains damned umbrella you soaking it up wading three feet deep i wonder how it felt that last second when old rattigan drowned in this flood francos falangists hitlers youth stalins reds detroits riots mayor la guardia reading the sunday funnies what a death to hell with it look the remnant of clarence rattigans burial cot was sticking up out of a cat litter of stock market crashes and banks close i picked up a final discard nijinsky danced on the theater page a couple of nuts said crumley nijinsky and old rattigan who saved this review touch your eyelids crumley did so his fingers came away wet damn he said this is a graveyard move i grabbed tokyo sues for peace and then headed for the sea crumley drove me to my old beach apartment but it was raining again and i looked at the ocean threatening to drown us all with a storm that could knock at midnight and bring constance dead and the other rattigan also dead and crush my bed with rain and seaweed hell i yanked clarence rattigans newspapers off the wall crumley drove me back to my small empty tract house with no storm on the shore and stashed vodka by my bed crumleys elixir and left the lights on and said he would call later that night to see if my soul was decent and drove away i heard hail on the roof someone thumping a coffin lid i called maggie across a continent of rain do i hear someone crying she said chapter seventeen the sun was long gone when my phone rang you know what time it is said crumley ohmigod its night people dying takes a lot out of you you done blubbering i cant stand hysterical sob sisters or bastard sons who carry kleenex am i your bastard son hit the shower brush your teeth and get the daily news off your porch i rang your bell but you were lost did queen califia tell your fortune she should have told her own is she im heading back to bunker hill at seventhirty be out front with a clean shirt and an umbrella i was out front with a clean shirt and an umbrella at seven twentynine when i got in crumley grabbed my chin and scanned my face hey no stormy weather and we roared to bunker hill passing callahan and ortega seemed different suddenly there were no police cars or morgue wagons you know a scotch ale called old peculiar said crumley as we pulled up to the curb look at the nonevent outside queen califias i also looked at the newspaper in my lap califia wasnt a headliner she was buried near the obits renowned psychic famed in silent films dies in fall alma crown aka queen califia was found on the steps of her bunker hill residence neighbors reported hearing her peacock cry searching califia fell her book the chemistry of palmistry was a bestseller her ashes are to be strewn in the egyptian valley of the kings where some said she was born garbage said crumley we saw someone on the front porch of the queens house and walked up it was a young woman in her twenties with long dark hair and gypsy coloring wringing her hands moaning and letting tears fall pointing her face toward the front door awful she mourned oh awful awful i opened the front door and stared in no my god no crumley came to look in at the desolation for the house was completely empty all the pictures crystal balls tarot cards lamps books records furniture had vanished some mysterious van and transfer company had lugged it all away i walked into the small kitchen pulled open drawers empty vacuumed clean pantry no spices canned fruit the cupboard was bare so her poor dog had none in her bedroom the closet was crammed with hangers but no tentsize dressing gowns stockings shoes crumley and i went out to stare at the young gypsy womans face i saw it all she cried pointing in all directions they stole everything theyre all poor excuses poor across the street when the police left they knocked me down old women men kids yelling laughing ran in and out carrying chairs drapes pictures books grab this grab that a fiesta one hour and it was empty they went to that house over there my god the laughs look my hands the blood you want califias junk go knock on doors you gonna go crumley and i sat down on either side of her crumley took her left hand i took her right sonsabitches she gasped sonsabitches thats about it said crumley you can go home theres nothing to guard nothing inside she is inside they took her body but shes still there ill wait until she says go we both looked over her shoulder at the screen door and some unseen massive ghost how will you know when she says go the gypsy wiped her eyes ill know where are you going said crumley because i was on the walk heading across the street at the opposite house i knocked silence i knocked again i peered through a side window i could see shapes of furniture in midfloor where there should be no furniture and too many lamps and rolled carpets i kicked the door and cursed and went to the middle of the street and was about to yell at every door when the gypsy girl came quietly to touch my arm i can go now she said califia said okay where to crumley nodded at his car she could not stop staring at califias home the center of all california i have friends near the red rooster plaza could you i could said crumley the gypsy looked back at the vanishing palace of a queen i will be back tomorrow she called she knows you will i said we passed callahan and ortega but this time crumley ignored it we were quiet on the way to the plaza named for a rooster of a certain color we dropped the gypsy my god i said on the way back its like a friend years ago died and the immigrants from cuernavaca poured in grabbed his collection of old phonographs caruso records mexican masks left his place like the egyptian tombs empty thats what its like to be poor said crumley i grew up poor i never stole maybe you never had a real chance we passed queen califias place a final time shes in there all right the gypsy was right she was right but youre nuts all this i said its too much too much constance hands me two wrongnumber phone books and flees we almost drown in twenty thousand leagues of old newspapers now a dead queen makes me wonder is father rattigan okay crumley swerved the car to the curb near a phone booth heres a dime in the phone booth i dialed the cathedral is mister i blushed father rattigan is he all right all right hes at confession good i said foolishly as long as the one hes confessing is okay nobody said the voice is ever okay i heard a click i dragged myself back to the car crumley eyed me like a dogs dinner well hes alive where are we going who knows from here on this trip is a retreat you know catholic retreats long silent weekends shut la trap okay we drove to venice city hall crumley got out and slammed his door he was gone half an hour when he returned he stuck his head in the driversside window and said now hear this i just took a weeks sick leave and jesus this is sick we got one week to find constance shield st vibianas priest raise the lazarus dead and warn your wife to stop me from strangling you nod your head yes i nodded next twentyfour hours you dont speak without permission now where are those goddamn phone books i handed him the books of the dead crumley behind the wheel scowled at them say one last thing and shut up youre still my pal i blurted pity he said and banged the gas chapter eighteen we went back to rattigans and stood down on the shoreline it was early evening and her lights were still full on the place was like a full moon and a rising sun of architecture gershwin was still manhandling manhattan one moment paris the next i bet they buried him in his piano said crumley we got out the one book of the dead rattigans personal phone pals mostly cold and buried and repeated what we had done before went through it page by page with a growing sense of mortality on page we came to the rs there it was clarence rattigans dead phone and a red christian cross over his name damn now lets check califia again we riffled back and there it was with big red lines under her name and a crucifix that means whoever planted this book with constance marked all the names with red ink and a cross handed it over and then killed the first two victims maybe im running halfempty or hoping constance would see the red ink crucifixes before they were killed panic on that night she came running and destroy them inadvertently with her shouts christ lets check the other red lines and crosses check st vibianas crumley turned the pages and exhaled red crucifix but father rattigans still alive i said hell i trudged up the sand to rattigans poolside phone i dialed st vibianas whos this a sharp voice answered father rattigan thank god for what this is constances friend the idiot dammit the priest cried dont take any more confessions tonight you giving orders father youre alive i mean well is there anything we can do to protect you or no no the voice cried go to that other heathen church that jack and the beanstalk place the telephone slammed i looked at crumley he looked at me look under graumans i said crumley looked chinese yeah and graumans name and a red circle and a crucifix but he died years ago yeah but part of constance is buried there or written there in cement ill show you last chance to see jack and the beanstalk if we time it said crumley the film will be over chapter nineteen we didnt have to time it right when crumley dropped me in front of the other church the great loud boisterous romantic tearstained celluloid cathedral there was a sign on the red chinese front door closed for alterations and some workmen moving in and out a few people were in the forecourt fitting their shoes in the footprints crumley dropped me and vamoosed i turned to look at the great pagoda facade ten percent chinese ninety percent graumans little sids he was some said kneehigh to a midget the eighth dwarf cinema munchkin all four feet bursting with film clips sound tracks kong shrieking on the empire state colman in shangrila friend to garbo dietrich and hepburn haberdasher to chaplin golf buddy to laurel and hardy keeper of the flame recollector of ten thousand pasts sid pourer of cement imprinter of fair and flat feet begging and getting pavement autographs and there i stood on a lava flow of signatures of ghosts who had abandoned their shoe sizes i watched the tourists quietly testing their feet in the vast spread of cement prints laughing softly what a church i thought more worshipers here than at st vibianas rattigan i whispered are you here chapter twenty it was said that constance rattigan had the smallest tootsies in all hollywood perhaps in the whole world she had her shoes cobbled in rome and airmailed to her twice a year because her old ones were melted from champagne poured by crazed suitors small feet dainty toes tiny shoes her imprints left in graumans cement the night of august proved this girls testing their size found their feet to be titanic and pitiful and abandoned her prints in despair so here i was alone on a strange night in graumans forecourt the only place in dead unburied hollywood where shoppers brought dreams for refunds the crowd cleared i saw her footprints some twenty feet away i froze because a small man in a black trench coat a snapbrim hat yanked over his brow had just tucked his shoes in rattigans footprints jesus god i gasped they fit the small man gazed at his tiny shoes for the first time in forty years rattigans tracks were occupied constance i whispered the small mans shoulders shrank right behind you i whispered are you one of them i heard a voice say from under the large dark hat one of what i said are you death chasing me just a friend trying to keep up ive been waiting for you the voice said not moving the feet planted firmly in the footprints of constance rattigan whats it mean i said why this wild goose chase are you scared or playing tricks why would you say that the voice said hidden good grief i said is this all some cheap dodge someone said you might want to write your life and needed someone to help if you expect that to be me no thanks ive got better things to do whats better than me said the voice growing smaller no one but is death really after you or are you looking for a new life god knows what kind what better than uncle sids concrete mortuary all the names with nothing beneath ask away are you going to turn and face me i couldnt talk then is this some way of getting me to help you uncover your past is the casket halffull or halfempty did someone else make those red marks in your book of the dead or did you make them it had to be someone else or else why would i be so frightened those red ink marks ive got to look them up find which ones are dead already and which are just about to die but still alive do you ever have the feeling everythings falling apart not you constance christ yes some

shifted her feet cant you stand still i said if i say red light stop your feet are stuck in that cement what then i saw her shoes ache to pull free people are staring at us the theaters closed most of the lights are out the forecourt is empty you dont understand ive got to go straight on i looked up at the front doors of graumans still open with some workmen carrying equipment inside its the next step but god how do i get there just walk you dont understand its hopscotch there must be other footprint paths to the door if i can find them which way do i jump her head moved the dark hat fell to the pavement constances closecropped bronze hair came into view she still stared ahead as if afraid to show me her face if i say go what then i asked ill go and meet me again where god knows quick say go theyre catching up who all those others theyll kill me if i dont kill first you wouldnt want me to die right here well would you i shook my head ready set go she asked ready set and she was gone she zigzagged across the forecourt a dozen fast steps to the right another dozen to the left pause and a final two dozen steps to a third set of prints where she froze as if it were a land mine a car horn hooted i turned when i glanced back the graumans front door swallowed a shadow i counted to ten to give her a real start then i bent down to pick up the tiny shoes she had left behind in her footprints then i walked over to the first set of prints where she had paused sally simpson the name was just an echo from a lost time i moved on to the second set of prints gertrude erhard an even fainter ghost of time and the final footprints nearer the front door dolly dawn peter pan dolly dawn a fleeting mist of years touched me i almost remembered hell i whispered no way and got ready to let uncle sids fake chinese palace swallow me with one huge dark dragon swallow chapter twentyone i stopped just outside the crimson doors for as clearly as if he were calling i heard father rattigan shout lamentable which made me pull out rattigans book of the dead i had only looked for names now i looked for a place there it was under the gs graumans followed by an address and a name clyde rustler rustler i thought my god he retired from acting in after working with griffith and gish and getting involved with dolly dimpless bathtub death and here was his namealiveon a boulevard where they buried you without warning and erased you from history the way dear uncle joe stalin rubbed out his pals with a shotgun eraser and my heart thumped there was red ink around his name and a double crucifix rattigani looked at the dark beyond the red door rattigan yes but clyde rustler are you here too i reached and grasped one brass handle and a voice behind me announced bleakly theres nothing inside to steal a gaunt homeless guy stood to my right dressed in various shades of gray speaking to the universe he felt my gaze go ahead i read his lips you got nothing to lose plenty to win i thought but how do you excavate a big chinese tomb filled with blackandwhite flicker film clips an aviary of birds shuttling the air fireworks ricocheting a big ravenous screen as swift as memory as quick as remorse the homeless man waited for me to selfdestruct with remembrance i nodded i smiled and as quickly as rattigan i sank into die theaters darkness chapter twentytwo inside the lobby there was a frozen army of chinese coolies concubines and emperors dressed in ancient wax parading nowhere one of the wax figurines blinked yes god i thought a crazy outside a crazy in and clyde rustler moldering toward ninety or ninetyfive time shifted if i ducked back out i would find a dozen driveins where teenage waitresses rollerskated hamburgers yes the chinese wax mannequin said again i moved swiftly through the first entry door and down the aisle under the balcony where i stared up it was a big dark aquarium undersea it was possible to imagine a thousand film ghosts scared by gunshot whispers soaring to flake the ceiling and vanish in the vents melvilles whale sailed there unseen old ironsides the titanic the bounty sailing forever never reaching port i focused my gaze on up through the multiple balconies toward what had once been called nigger heaven my god i thought im three years old that was the year when chinese fairy tales haunted my bed whispered by a favorite aunt when i thought death was just a forever bird a silent dog in the yard my grandfather was yet to lie in a box at a funeral parlor while tut arose from his tomb what i asked was tut famous for for being dead four thousand years boy i said howd he do that and here i was in a vast tomb under the pyramid where i had always wished to be if you lifted the aisle carpets youd find the lost pharaohs buried with fresh loaves of bread and bright sprigs of onions food for fartraveling upriver to eternity they must never ruin this i thought i must be buried here its not green glade cemetery said the old wax chinaman nearby reading my mind i had spoken aloud when was this theater built i murmured the old waxwork let loose a fortyday flood one of the first there was nothing here some palm trees farmhouses cottages a dirt main street little bungalows built to lure doug fairbanks lillian gish mary pickford radio was just a crystal matchbox with earphones nobody could hear the future on that we opened big people walked or drove from melrose north saturday nights there were veritable desert caravans of movie fanatics the graveyard hadnt yet begun at gower and santa monica it filled up with valentinos

died for love of lowell sherman dapper guy with mustache cancer got him you listening clyde rustler i blurted holy jesus nobody knows him see way up that old projection room they buried him there alive in when they built the new projection room on the second balcony i stared up into phantoms of mist rain and shangrila snow seeking the high lama my shadow friend said no elevator two hundred steps a long climb with no sherpas up to a middle lobby and a mezzanine and then another balcony and another after that amid three thousand seats how do you please three thousand customers i wondered how if eightyearold boys didnt pee three times during your film you had it made i climbed i stopped halfway to sit panting suddenly ancient instead of halfway new chapter twentythree i reached the back wall of mount everest and tapped on the old projectionroom door is that who i think it is a terrified voice cried no i said quietly just me back for one last matinee after forty years that was a stroke of genius upchucking my past the terrified voice simmered down whats the password it came right off my tongue a boys voice tom mix and his horse tony hoot gibson ken maynard bob steele helen twelvetrees vilma banky thatll do it was a long while before i heard a giant spider brush the door panel the door whined a silver shadow leaned out a living metaphor of the blackandwhite phantoms i had seen flickering across the screen a lifetime ago no one ever comes up here said this old old man no one no one ever knocks on my door said the man with silver hair and silver face and silver clothes bleached out by seventy years of living under a rock in a high place and gazing down at unreality ten thousand times no one knows im here not even me youre here youre clyde rustler am i for a moment i thought he might bodysearch his suspenders and sleeve garters who are you he poked his face like a turtles from its shell i said my name never heard of you he glanced down at the empty screen you one of them the dead stars they sometimes climb up fairbanks came last night zorro dartagnan robin hood he knocked at your door scratched being dead has its problems you coming in or out i stepped in quickly before he could change his mind the film projectors stood facing emptiness in a room that looked like a chung king burial chamber it smelled of dust and sand and acrid celluloid there was only one chair between the projectors as hed said no one ever came to visit i stared at the crowded walls there mustve been three dozen pictures nailed there some in cheap woolworth frames others in silver still others mere scraps torn from old silver screen magazines photographs of thirty women no two alike the old old man let a smile haunt his face my sweetheart dears from when i was an active volcano the most ancient of ancient men looked out at me from behind a maze of wrinkles the kind you get when you search the icebox at six am and take out last nights premixed martinis i keep the door locked i thought you were just here yelling outside not me someone was outside of that nobodys been up here since lowell sherman died thats two obituaries in ten minutes winter cancer and pneumonia nobody knows that i rollerskated by the coliseum one saturday before a football game lowell sherman came in whooping and barking i got his autograph and said take care he died two days later lowell sherman the old old man regarded me with a new luster in his eyes as long as youre alive he is too clyde rustler collapsed in the one chair and sized me up again lowell sherman why in hell did you make the long climb up here people have died climbing uncle sid climbed up once or twice said to hell with it built the bigger projection booth a thousand yards downslope in the real world if there is a real one never went down to see so for he saw that i was casting my gaze around his primeval nest at those walls teeming with dozens of faces forever young would you like a rundown on these mountainlion street cats he leaned and pointed her name was carlotta or midge or diana she was a spanish flirt a cal coolidge it girl with a skirt up to her navel a roman queen fresh out of demilles milk bath then she was a vamp named illysha a typist called pearl an english tennis playerpamela sylvia ran a nudist flytrap in cheyenne some called her hard hearted hannah the vamp of savannah

ripened fast willakate worked in a chophouse chink joint lila wong got more votes than the president coney island beauty pageant notsoplain willa got off the night train in glendale barbara jo next day almost head of glory films anastasia alice grimes he stopped i looked up which brings us to rattigan i said clyde rustler froze in place you said no ones been up here for years butshe came up here today right maybe to look at these pictures did she or didnt she the old old man stared at his dusty hands then slowly rose to face a brass whistle tube in the wall one of those submarine devices that you blew so it shrieked and you yelled orders leo wine a twodollar tip a tiny voice squealed from the brass nozzle you dont drink i do now leo and hot dogs the brass nozzle squealed and died the old old man grunted and stared at the wall a long terribly long five minutes passed while we waited i opened my notepad and took down the names scrawled on the pictures then we heard the hot dogs and wine rattling up the dumbwaiter clyde rustler stared as if he had forgotten that tiny elevator he took forever opening the wine with a corkscrew sent by leo from down below there was only one glass one he apologized you first im not afraid of catching anything i got nothing for you to catch i drank and handed the glass over he drank and i could see the relaxation move his body and now he said let me show you some clips i glued together why last week a stranger called from down below that voice on the phone was once harry cohns livein nurse never said yes but yes yes harry yes said she was looking for robin locksley robin hood searching for robin of locksley an actress took that name a flash in the pan she disappeared in hearsts castle or his backside kitchen but now this voice years later asks for locksley spooked me i ran through my cans and found the one film she made in when sound really took over watch he fitted the film into the projector and switched on the lamp the image shot down to flood the big screen on the screen a circus butterfly spun flirting her gossamer wings dropping to pull the bit from her smile laugh then run pursued by white knights and black villains recognize her nope try this he spun the film the screen filled with a smoldering bank of snow fires a russian noblewoman smoking long languid cigarettes wringing her handkerchief someone had died or was going to die well said clyde rustler hopefully nope try again the projector lit the darkness with a tomboy climbing a tree to shake down fruit laughing but you could see small crab apples under her shirtfront tomboy sawyer a girl who damn the old man filled the screen with a dozen more images starting with ending with open shut mysterious obvious light dark wild composed beautiful plain willful innocent you dont know any of those my god ive racked my brain there must be some reason why ive saved these damned clips look at me dammit know how old i am around ninety ninetyfive ten thousand years jesus they found me floating in a basket on the nile i fell downhill with the tablets i doused the fire in the burning bush mark antony said loose the dogs of war i loosed the lot did i know all these wonders i wake nights hitting my head to make the jelly beans shake in place every time ive almost got the answer i move my head and the damned beans fall you sure you dont remember these clips or the faces on the wall good grief weve got a mystery i was about to say the same i came up here because someone else came maybe that voice that called from down below what voice constance rattigan i said i let the fog settle behind his eyes whats she got to do with this he wondered maybe she knows last time i saw her she was standing in her own footprints and you think she might know who all these faces belong to what all the names mean hold on outside the door i guess it was today cant be yesterday today she said hand em over hand what over hell what do you see in this damn empty place worth handing over i looked at the pictures on the wall clyde rustler saw my look why would anyone want those he said not worth nothing even i dont know why in hell i nailed them there are they wives or some old girlfriends how many of each did you have i dont have the fingers to count one thing for sure constance wanted you to hand em over was she jealous constance you got road rage in the streets she had bed rage wanted to grab all my lovelies whoever in hell they were and stomp tear and burn them go on finish the wine i got things to do like what but he was rethreading the film clips in the projector fascinated by a thousand and one nights past i moved along the wall and scribbled furiously writing down the names under all of the pictures and then said if constance comes back will you let me know for the pictures ill throw her downstairs someone else said that only it was to hell instead of the second balcony why would you throw her theres gotta be a reason right dont recollect and why did you say you climbed up here and what was it you called me clyde rustler oh yeah him it just came to me did you know i am constances father what constances father i thought i told you before now you can leave good night i went out and shut the door on whoever that was and the pictures on the wall whoever they were chapter twentyfour downstairs i edged to the front of the theater and stared down then i stepped into the orchestra pit and edged to the back wall and peered though a door into a long hall that diminished into complete night and a night inside that night where all the old abandoned dressing rooms were i was tempted to call a name but what if she answered far off down that black corridor i thought i heard the sound of a hidden sea or a river flowing somewhere in the dark i put one foot forward and pulled back i heard that dark ocean heave on an endless shore again then i turned and went away up through the great darkness out of the pit into the aisles with everyone gone rushing toward the doors leading out to an evening sky most dearly welcome i carried rattigans incredibly small shoes over to her footprints and placed them neatly down to fit at which instant i felt my guardian angel touching my shoulder youre back from the dead said crumley you can say that again i said staring at the wide red doorway of graumans chinese with all those film creatures swimming in the dark shes in there i murmured i wish i knew a way to get her out dynamite tied to a bundle of cash might do it crumley sorry i forgot we were talking about florence nightingale i stepped back crumley regarded rattigans tiny shoes lodged in prints put down a long long time ago not exactly ruby slippers he said chapter twentyfive we rode across town in a warm silence i tried to describe the great black sea of graumans theres this big dressingroom cellar maybe full of stuff from i have a feeling she might be there save your breath said crumley someones got to go down there to see you afraid to go there alone not exactly that means damn right shut up and ride shotgun we were soon at crumleys he put a cold beer against my brow hold it there until you feel it cure your thinking i held it there crumley switched on the tv and began switching through the channels i dont know which is worse he said your gab or the local tv news father seamus rattigan the tv said hold it i cried crumley switched back vibianas cathedral and a blizzard of static and snow crumley hit the damned tv with his fist natural causes rumored to be future cardinal another snowstorm and the tv went dead i been meaning to have it fixed said crumley we both stared at his telephone telling it to ring we both jumped because it did chapter twentysix it was a woman father rattigans assistant betty kelly inarticulate going down for the third time begging for mercy i offered what small mercy i had to come visit dont wait or im dead myself she wailed betty kelly was out in front of st vibianas when crumley and i arrived we stood for a long moment before she saw us gave a quick halfrealized wave and dropped her gaze we came to stand by her i introduced crumley im sorry i said she raised her head then you are the one was talking to father she said oh lord lets get inside the big doors were locked for the night we went in through a door at the side inside she swayed and almost fell i caught and led her to one of the pews where she sat breathless we came as quick as we could i said you knew him she gasped its so confusing you knew someone in common an acquaintance a friend a relative said crumley the same name rattigan she killed him wait she grabbed my sleeve for i was on my feet sit she gasped i dont mean murder but she killed him i sat back down gone cold crumley backed off she clutched my elbow and lowered her voice she was here sometimes three times a day in confession whispering then raving poor father looked like hed been shot when she left but she hardly left just stayed until he fell out starving couldnt eat and the liquor cabinet low he let her rave later id check the confessional empty but the air smelled like it had been hit by lightning she kept shouting the same thing what im killing them killing them she yelled and ill keep on killing them until ive killed them all help me to kill them bless their souls then ill kill the rest kill them all get them

pray over them so they wont come back stay dead say yes get out father cried and then she said worse what she said then damn you damn damn damn you to hell her voice was so loud people left i could hear her weeping the father must have been in a state of shock then i heard footsteps running in the dark i waited for father rattigan to speak say anything then i dared open the door he was there and silent because he was dead and here the secretary let the tears shed themselves down her cheeks poor man she said those dreadful words stopped his heart as they almost stopped mine we must find that awful woman make her take back the words so he can live again god what am i saying him slumped there as if she had drained his blood you know her tell her shes done her worst there ive said it now ive thrown up and where do you go to be clean its yours and sorry i did it to you i looked down at my suit as if expecting to find her vile upchuck crumley walked over to the confessional and opened both doors and stared in at the darkness i came to stand next to him and take a deep breath smell it said betty kelly its there and ruined ive told the cardinal to tear it down and burn it i took a final breath a touch of charcoal and st elmos fires crumley closed the doors it wont help betty kelly said shes still there so is he poor soul dead tired and dead two coffins side by side god help us ive used you all up you have the same look the poor father had dont tell me that i said weakly i wont she said and led by crumley i beggared my way to the door chapter twentyseven i couldnt nap i couldnt

talk quickly i begged you remember all she said in the confessional anything else important consequential different dear god said betty kelly words and words and words but wait she kept saying you

be late getting to rattigans but that id be bringing henry with me the blind leading the blind he said chapter twentynine he was standing exactly where he said he would be in bill robinsons copasetic dancing footprints not banished to that longgone nigger heaven but out front where thousands of passing whites could see his body was erect and quiet but his shoes were itching around in bill robinsons marks ever so serenely his eyes were shut like his mouth turned in on a pleased imagination i stood in front of him and exhaled henrys mouth burst wrigleys double your pleasure double your fun with wrigleys doublemint doublemint gum dont get it on me he laughed seized my elbows lord boy you look fine i dont have to see to know youve always sounded like some of those people up on the screen that comes from sneaking into too many movies let me feel you boy hey you been drinking lotsa malts you look swell henry i always wondered what i looked like the way bill robinson sounds is how you shape henry am i in his shoes here say yes a perfect fit thanks for coming henry had to its one helluva time since we ransacked graveyards i go to sleep nights running those graves ahead or behind what kind of graveyards here i glanced at graumans oriental facade ghosts thats what i said when i snuck backstage when i was six and stared up at all those blackandwhite things leering on the screen the phantom playing the organ has his mask yanked off and jumps thirty feet tall to kill you with one stare pictures tall and wide and pale and the actors mostly dead ghosts did your folks hear you talk like that with them mums the word thats a nice son i smell incense got to be graumans real class no chopsuey name here goes henry let me hold the door hey its dark in there you bring a flashlight always feels good to wave a flashlight and look like we know what were doing heres the flashlight henry ghosts you said seances four times a day for thirty years dont hold my elbow makes me feel useless if i fall shoot me and he was off hardly ricocheting down the aisle toward the orchestra pit and the great spaces beyond and below it getting darker he said let me turn on the flashlight he switched it on there he smiled thats better chapter thirty in the dark unlit basement there were rooms and rooms and rooms all with mirrors lining their walls the reflections reflecting and rereflecting emptiness facing emptiness corridors of lifeless sea we went into the first biggest one henry circled the flashlight like a lighthouse beam plenty of ghosts down here the light hit and sank in the ocean deeps not the same as the ghosts upstairs spookier i always wondered about mirrors and that thing called reflection another you right four or five feet off sunk under ice henry reached out to touch the glass someone under there you henry and me hot damn i sure wish i could know that we moved on along the cold line of mirrors and there they were more than ghosts graffiti on glass i must have sucked in my breath for henry swung his flashlight to my face you see something i dont my god yes i reached out to the first cold window on time my finger came away smudged with a faint trace of ancient lipstick well henry bent as if to squint at my discovery what margot lawrence rip october someone stash her here under glass not quite and over about three feet another mirror juanita lopez summer dont ring no bell next mirror carla moore christmas hey said henry silent film but a sighted friend spoke her to me one matinee carla moore she was something i guided the flashlight eleanor twelvetrees april i read helen twelvetrees was in the cat and the canary this mightve been her sister but so many names were fake you never know lucille lesueur became joan crawford lily chauchoin was reborn as claudette colbert gladys smith carole lombard gary grant was archibald leach you could run a quiz show henry extended his fingers whats this jennifer long didnt she die disappeared about the time sister aimee sank in the sea and arose reborn on the hallelujah shore how many more names as many as there are mirrors henry tasted one finger yum its been a long time butlipstick what color tangee orange summer heat coty lanvier cherry why do you figure these ladies wrote their names and dates because henry it wasnt a lot of ladies one woman signed the names all different one woman who wasnt a lady hold my cane while i think you dont have a cane henry funny how your hand feels things not there you want me to guess i nodded even though henry couldnt see i knew hed feel the rush of my bobbing head i wanted him to say it needed to hear him speak that name henry smiled at the mirrors and his smile beamed one hundredfold constance his fingers touched the glass the rattigan he said chapter thirtyone again henry leaned to brush a reddish signature and then touch it to his lips he moved to the next glass repeated the gesture and let his tongue figure different flavors he noted like different women it all comes back his eyes squeezed tight lord lord lots of women passed through my hands through my heart came and went unseen all those flavors why do i feel stopped up because i feel the same way crumley says when you turn on the faucets stand back youre a good boy im no boy you sound like youre fourteen when your voice changed and you tried to grow a mustache he moved and touched then looked with his sightless eyes at the ancient residue on his fingers all these have to do with constance a hunch you got a powerful stomach i know from having your stuff read to me my mama once said a powerful midsection is better than two brains most folks use their brains too much when they should be listening to that thing under their ribs the gangganglion my mama never called it that house spider she said when she met some damnfool politician she always felt right above her stomach if the spider was twitching shed smile yes but if the spider tightened into a ball she shut her eyes no thats you my mama read you she said you dont write them weary stories she meant eerie with gray matter you pull the spider legs under your ribs my mania said that boy will never be sick never get poisoned by people he knows how to upchuck teasing that balledup spider to let go she said he dont stay up nights in a bad life getting old while hes young hed make a great doctor cut right to the pain and toss it out your mama said all that i blushed woman who got twelve kids buried six raised the rest one bad husband one good she got fine ideas which side to use in bed so you untie let your gut free i wish i had met her shes still around henry put his palm on his chest henry surveyed the unseen mirrors pulled his black glasses from his pocket wiped and put them on thats better rattigan these names was she crazy wild was she ever honesttogod sane offshore i heard her swimming way out with the seals barking a free soul maybe she should have stayed out there herman melville i muttered say again took me years to finish mobydick melville should have stayed at sea with jack his loving friend land when he lived there it tore his soul from his heart onshore he aged thirty years in a customs shed halfdead poor son of a bitch whispered henry poor son of a bitch i echoed quietly and rattigan you think she shouldve stayed offshore not in her fancy beach place it was big bright white and lovely but a tomb full of ghosts like those films upstairs forty feet tall fifty years wide like these mirrors here and one woman hating them all for unknown reasons poor son of a bitch murmured henry poor bitch i said chapter thirtytwo lets see some more said henry switch on the lights so i wont need my cane can you feel if lights are on or off silly child read me the names i took his arm and we moved along the mirrors as i read the names the dates under the names henry commanded they getting closer to now and with names names names to go with them all different one too many said henry we done one last mirror and date october thirtyfirst last year how come everything happens to you on halloween fate and providence love wimps like me you say the date but henry touched the cold glass no name none she going to come add a name going to show up making noises just a dog hears and no light down here she shut up henry i stared along the mirrors in the cellar night where shadowphantoms ran son henry took my arm lets git one last thing i took a dozen steps and stopped dont tell me henry inhaled youre fresh out of floor i looked down at a round manhole the darkness sank deep with no end sounds empty henry inhaled a freshwater storm drain beneath the back of the theater yes damn for suddenly a flood of water gushed below a clean tide smelling of green hills and cool air it rained a few hours ago takes an hour for the runoff to get here most of the year the storm drains dry now itll run a foot deep all the way to the ocean i bent to feel the inside of the hole rungs henry guessed youre not climbing down its dark and cold and a long way to the sea and if youre careless drowning henry sniffed you figure she came up this way to check those names or came in through the theater and climbed down hey more water a gust of wind very cold sighed up out of the hole jesus christ i yelled what i stared i saw something if you didnt i did the flashlight beam arced crazily around the mirrored room as henry grabbed my elbow and lurched away from the hole we going the right way christ i said i hope so chapter thirtythree our taxi dropped us at the curb behind rattigans big white arabian fortress lordy said henry and added that meter ran overtime from now on im driving crumley was not out front by the shoreline but farther up by the pool with half a dozen full martini glasses two already empty he gazed at these fondly and explained im ready now for your numbskull routines i am fortified hello henry henry arent you sorry you left new orleans for this canoworms factory one of those drinks smells like vodka right that will make me not sorry i handed a glass to henry and took one for myself in haste while crumley scowled at my silence okay spill it he said i told him about graumans and the basement dressingroom mirrors plus i said i been making lists hold it youve sobered me up said crumley let me kill another he lifted a glass in mock salute okay read your lists the grocery boy on mount lowe the neighbors of queen califia in bunker hill father rattigans secretary the film projectionist on high in graumans chinese henry cut in that gent in graumans i described rustler stashed among stacks of old film with the pictures on the walls of all the sad women with all the lost names henry mused hey now did you make a list of those ladies in the pictures up on high i read off my pad mabel helen marilee annabel hazel betty lou clara pollyanna crumley sat up straight you got a list of those names on the cellar mirrors i shook my head it was dark down there easy as pie henry tapped his head hazel annabel grace pollyanna helen marilee betty lou detect the similarities as the names rolled from henrys mouth i ticked them off my penciled list a perfect match at which point there was a lightning strike the lights failed we could hear the surf roar in to salt rattigans beach as pale moonlight silvered the shore thunder clamored it gave me time to think and say rattigans got a complete run of academy annuals with all the pictures ages roles her competition is in every one it ties in with all those

dear god a voice said i havent a thing to wear the door opened and a billowing butterfly kimono stood there with a victorian relic inside squirming to make it fit it stopped squirming and tapemeasured my shoes my knee bones my shoulders and finally eye to eye j wallington bradford i cleared my throat mr bradford whos asking the creature in the doorway wondered jesus come in come in and whos this

surprise her eyebrows lift her ears shorten her upper lip widen her smile flatten or bulge her bosom walk taller than tall or fall short i was a mirror she posed in front of watching me stare blink pretend remorse alert despair delight sing in a gilded cage powerdive into pajamas breaststroke out she trotted in a high school pony swarmed out a nest of ballerinas by the time she left she was someone else that was ten thousand vaudevilles ago and all so she could compete with other actresses for other roles in films or maybe steal their men okay doll j w bradford said as he scribbled on a pad heres more names of those who loved constance nine producers ten directors fortyfive atliberty actors and a partridge in a pear tree did she never hold still ever see those seals in rattigans surf slick as oil quicker than quicksilver hit the bed like lightning number one in the la marathon long before there was one could have been board chairman at three studios but wound up as vampira madame defarge and dolley madison there thanks i scanned a list that would have filled the bastille twice over now if youll forgive mata hari must change zip he flourished his kimono zip i grabbed henrys arm and we flew down the stairs and out onto the street hey someone cried wait i turned and looked up jean harlowdietrichcolbert leaned over the top rail smiling wildly waiting for von stroheim to shoot her closeup theres someone else like me even crazier quickly alberto quickly i called hes alive he does one nightclub a week then hospital rehabs when they sew him up he repeats his farewell tour damn fool in his nineties said he found constance a lie on route when he was my god forty fifty driving across country he picked up this tomboy with suspicious breasts made her a star while his act faded runs a theatre intime in his parlor charges folks on friday nights to see caesar stabbed antony on his sword cleopatra bitten a piece of paper sailed down there and something else what connie helen annette roberta constance didnt show up for more lessons in changing lives last week she was supposed to come back and didnt i dont understand i yelled i had taught her things dark light loud soft wild quiet some sort of new role she was looking for she was coming back to me to learn some more she wanted to be a new person maybe like her old self but i didnt know how to help roleplaying jesus how do you get actors unhooked w c fields learned to be w c fields in vaudeville he never escaped those handcuffs so here was constance saying help me to find a new self i said constance i dont know how to help you get a priest to put a new skin around you a great bell rang in my head priest well thats it said jean harlow did i confuse but amuse ciao bradford vanished quickly i gasped lets call crumley whats the rush said henry no no alberto quickly the rabbit in and out of the hat hamlets fathers ghost oh him said henry chapter thirtyfive we dropped henry off at some nice softspoken relatives on central avenue and then crumley delivered me to the home of alberto quickly ninetynine years old rattigans first teacher the first he said the bertillion expert who fingerprinted constance toenail to elbow to knees in vaudeville he had been known as mr metaphor who acted all of old curiosity shop or every last one of fagins brood in oliver twist as audiences cried mercy he was more morbid than marley paler than poe quickly the critics cried orchestrated requiems to flood the thames with mournful tides when as tosca he flung himself into forever all this metaphorquickly said glibly happily as i sat in his small theaterstage parlor i waved away the box of kleenex he offered before he treated me to his lucia mad again stop i cried at last what about constance hardly knew her he said but i did know katy kelleher my first pygmalion child pygmalion i murmured pieces falling into place do you recall molly callahan faintly how about polly riordan almost katy was alice in wonderland molly was molly in mad molly oday polly was polly of the circus same year katy molly pollyall constance a whirlwind blew in nameless blew out famous i taught her to shout im polly producers cried you are you are the film was shot in six days then i revamped her to jump down leo the lions throat im pretty katy kelly you are the lion pride yelled her second film done in four days kelly vanished then molly climbed the rko radio tower so it was molly polly dolly sally gerty connie and constance rabbiting studio lawns no one ever guessed constance played more than one part over the years only i alberto quickly helped her to grab onto fame fortune and fondling the golden greased pig no one ever knew that some of the marquee names on hollywood boulevard were names constance made up or borrowed could be she shuffled her tootsies in graumans forecourt with four different shoe sizes and where is molly polly sally gerty connie now even she doesnt know here are six different addresses in twelve different summers maybe she drowned in deep grass years are a great hiding place god hides you duck whats my name he did a flipflop cartwheel across the room i heard his old bones scream tata he grinned in pain mr metaphor you got it he dropped cold i leaned over him terrified he popped one eye wide that was a close one prop me up i scared rattigan so she ran he babbled on it was only fitting after all im fagin marley scrooge hamlet quickly someone like me had to be curious and try to figure out what year she lived in or if she ever existed at all the older i got the more jealous i became of the gain and loss of constance i waited too long over the years just as hamlet waited too long to slay the foul fiend who killed his fathers ghost ophelia and caesar begged for slaughter the memory of constance summoned bull stampedes so when i turned ninety all my voices raved for revenge like a damn fool i sent her the book of the dead so it must be that constance ran from my madness call an ambulance mr metaphor added ive got two broken tibias and a herniated groin did you write all that down later dont wait write it an hour from now ill be in valhalla harassing the statues wheres my bed i put him to bed slow down i said that book of the dead you say you sent that to constance there was a halfass semigarage sale of actors junk at the film ladies league last month i got some fairbanks photos and a crosby song sheet and there by god was rattigans thrownaway phonebook stuffed with all her catlitterbox lovers my god i was the snake in the garden grabbed onto damnation for a dime eyed the lists drank the poison why not give rattigan bad dreams tracked her down dropped the dead book ran did it scare the stuffings out of her oh my god it did i stared into mr quicklys grinning face then you didnt have anything to do with that poor old soul lost on mount lowe constances first sucker that stupid old guy is dead newspapers killed him critics do that no tons of old tribunes fell on him one way or the other they kill and you didnt harass queen califia that old noahs ark two of every kind of lie in her highlow hotcold camel dung and horse puckies she told

constance went what killed him god everyones dead she yelled at him or i think it was she you know what she yelled no i do you middle of the night last night i heard voices thought i was dreaming that voice it had to be her maybe what she yelled at that poor damn priest she yelled at me wanna hear im waiting oh yeah she yelled how do i get back wheres the next place how do i get back get back to where there was a quick spin of thought behind quicklys eyelids he snorted her brother told her where to go and she went and at last she said im lost show me the way constance wants to be found that it yes no god i dont know neither does she maybe thats why she yelled but my house is built of bricks it never fell others did her old husband califia her brother its a long story and you have miles

booth scrooge oh yeah and then he snored chapter thirtysix i taxied out to the sea back to my little place i needed to think and then there was a blow against my oceanfront door like a sledgehammer wham i jumped to get it before it fell in a flash of light blinded me from a single bright round crystal tucked in a mean eye hello edgar wallace you stupid goddamn son of a bitch you a voice cried i fell back aghast that he would call me edgar wallace that dimeadance el cheapo hack hello fritz i yelled you stupid goddamn son of a bitch you come in i am as if wearing heavy military boots fritz

great laugh thats my good bastard son thats my twotiming illegitimate pa we embraced with arms of steel in paroxysms of laughter fritz wong wiped his eyes now that weve done the formalities he rumbled how are you alive you barely why the delay in delivering provender i brought out crumleys beer pig swill said fritz no wine but he drank deep and grimaced now he sat down heavily in my only chair how can i help what makes you think i need help you always will wait i cant stand this he stomped out into the rain and lunged back with a bottle of le gorton which silently he opened with a fancy bright silver corkscrew that he pulled from his pocket i brought out two old but clean jelly jars fritz eyed them with scorn as he poured he said a great year i expect loud exclamations i drank dont chugalug fritz shouted for christs sake inhale breathe i inhaled i swirled the wine pretty good jesus christ good let me think goddammit dont think drink with your nose exhale through your ears he showed me how eyes shut i did the same excellent now sit down and shut up this is my place fritz not now it isnt i sat on the floor leaning against the wall and he stood over me like caesar astride an ant farm

vintage shut up sip if anyone can solve rattigan he said sipping its me or should i say i quiet he opened the front door on the lovely endless rain you like this love it sap fritz screwed his monocle in for a long glance upshore rattigans place up there eh not home for seven days maybe dead empress of the killing ground yes but she will never be caught dead one day she will simply disappear and no one will know what happened now shall i spill my beans he poured the last of the le gorton hating the jelly glass loving the wine he was at liberty he said unemployed no films for two years too old they said im the youngest acrobat in any bed on three continents he protested now i have got my hands on bernard shaws play saint joan but how do you cast that incredible play so meanwhile i have a jules verne novel in the public domain free and clear with a dumbcluck flybynight producer who says nothing and steals much so i need a secondrate sciencefiction writeryouto work for scale on this halfass masterwork say yes before i could speak there was a huge deluge of rain and a crack of fire and thunder during which fritz barked youre hired now do you have more to show and tell i showed and told the photos clipped from the ancient newspapers and scotchtaped on the wall over my bed fritz had to half lie down cursing to look at the damned things with one eye the other destroyed in a duel a duel i exclaimed you never said shut up and read the names under the pictures to the cyclops german director i read the names fritz repeated them yes i remember her he reached to touch and that one and yes this one my god what a rogues gallery did you work with all or some some i did two falls out of three in a santa barbara motel i do not brag a thing is either true or not youve never lied to me fritz i have but you were too stupid to see polly molly dolly sounds like a cheap swiss bell ringers act hold on cant be maybe yes he was leaning up adjusting his monocle squinting hard why didnt i see dummkopf but there was time between years that one and that one and that good god what fritz theyre all the same actress the same woman different hair different hairdo different color different makeup thick eyebrows thin eyebrows no eyebrows small lips large lips eyelashes no eyelashes womens tricks woman came up to me last week on hollywood boulevard and said do you know me no i said im

inside a devil inside lucifers flesheating wife maybe because i said you were courting marlene dietrich one of those years courting is that what they call it fritz barked a laugh and rocked off the edge of the bed take those damn things down if i can help ill need the junk theres more like this i said graumans chinese the old projection booth the old that crummy lunatic i wouldnt say that why not he had a missing reel of my ufa film atlantica i went to see he tried to tie me to a chair and forcefeed me old rin tin tin serials i threatened to jump off the balcony so he let me go with atlantica so he spread the pictures out on the bed and gave them the fiery stare of his monocle you say there are more pictures like these upstairs at graumans yes i said would you mind traveling ninetyfive miles an hour in an alfaromeo to get to graumans chinese in less than five minutes the blood drained from my face you would not mind said fritz he blundered swiftly out into the rain his alfaromeo was in full spacerocket throttle when i fell in chapter thirtyseven flashlight matches pad and pencil should we need to leave a note i checked my pockets wine fritz added in case the damn dogs up there on the cliff dont carry brandy we passed a bottle of wine between us as we scanned the avalanche of dark stairs leading to the old projection booth fritz smiled me first if you fall i dont want to catch some friendship fritz plowed the dark i plowed after swiveling the flashlight beam why are you helping me i gasped i called crumley he said hes hiding all day in bed me being around halfass dimwits like you clears my blood and restarts my heart watch that flashlight i might fall dont tempt me i bobbed the light i hate to say fritz said but you give as good as you get youre my tenth bastard out of marie dressier we were higher now in nosebleed territory we reached the top of the second balcony fritz raging at the altitude but happy to hear himself rage explain again fritz said as we continued climbing up here then what then we go as far down as weve come up basement mirror names a glass catacomb knock said fritz at last i knocked and the projection room door swung inward on dim lights from two projectors one lit and working i swung my flash beam along the wall and sucked air what said fritz theyre gone i said the pictures the walls have been stripped i played my flashlight beam along the empty spaces in dismay all the darkroom ghosts had indeed vanished goddamn jesus christ i stopped and swore my god i sound like you my son my son fritz said pleased move the light quiet i inched forward holding the beam unsteadily on what sat between the projectors it was constances father of course erect and cold one hand touching a machine switch one projector was running full spin with a reel that looped through the projector lens and down around a spiral that repeated images again and again every ten seconds the small door that could open to let the images shoot down to fill the theater screen was shut so the images were trapped on the inside of the door small but if you bent close and squinted you could see sally dolly molly holly gaily nellie roby sally dolly mollyaround about on and on i studied old man rattigan frozen in place and whether his grimace showed triumph or need i could not say i glanced beyond to those walls now empty of sally dolly molly but whoever had seized them hadnt figured that the old man seeing his family snatched had switched on this loop to save the past or my mind sank i heard betty kellys voice shrieking what constance had shrieked forgive me forgive me forgive me and quickly recalling how do i get it back back back get what back her other self did someone do this to you i thought standing over the old dead man or did you do it to yourself the dead mans white marble eyes were still i cut the projector all the faces still flowed on my retina the dancing daughter the butterfly the chinese vamp the tomboy clown poor lost soul i whispered you know him said fritz no then hes no poor lost soul fritz did you ever have a heart simple bypass i had it removed how do you live without it because fritz handed me his monocle i fit the cold glass to my eye and stared because he said im a stupid goddamn son of a bitch bullseye fritz said lets go he added this place is a morgue always was i said i called henry and told him to take a taxi to graumans pronto chapter thirtyeight blind henry was waiting for us in an aisle leading down to the orchestra pit and from there to the hidden basement dressing rooms dont tell henry said about what henry the pictures up in that projection booth kaput thats fritz wongs lingo the same to you said fritz henry howd you guess i knew henry fixed his sightless eyes down at the pit i just visited the mirrors i dont need a cane and sure as heck no flashlight just reached when i was there and touched the glass thats how i knew the pictures upstairs had to be gone felt all along forty feet of glass clean all scraped away so he stared again at the sightless uphill seats upstairs all gone right right i exhaled somewhat stunned let me show you henry turned to the pit wait ive got my flash when you going to learn henry mocked and stepped down into the pit in one silent motion i followed fritz glared at our parade well i said what are you waiting for fritz moved chapter thirtynine there henry pointed his nose at the long line of mirrors what did i say i moved along the aisle of glass touching with my flash and then my fingers so fritz growled there were names and now no names just like there were pictures and now no pictures told you said henry how come the sightless are never the wordless said fritz got to do something to fill the time shall i recite the names i said the names from memory you left out carmen carlotta said henry oh yeah carlotta fritz glanced up and whoever swiped the pictures upstairs cleaned and scraped the mirrors so all those ladies are like they never was said henry he leaned in along the line of mirrors and gave a last brush with his blind fingertips to the glass here there and farther on down yeah empty damn those names were caked on took lots to scrub it off who henrietta mabel gloria lydia alice they all came down to clean up they did and they didnt weve already said it henry that all of those women came and went were born and died and wrote their names like grave markers so and those names were not written all at once so starting back in the twenties those women ladies whatever came down here for their obsequies a funeral of one when they looked in their first mirror they saw one face and when they moved to the next the face was changed now youre cooking so henry whats here is a grand parade of funerals births and burials all done with the same two hands and one spade but the scribbleshenry reached out to emptiness were different people change she couldnt make up her mind to one life or how to live it so she stood in front of the mirror and wiped off her lipstick and painted another mouth and washed off her eyebrows and painted better ones or widened her eyes and raised her hairline and tilted her hat like a lampshade or took it off and threw it or took off her dress and stood here starkers starkers henry smiled now you got it hush i said thats work henry continued scribbling those mirrors looking to see how she changed didnt happen overnight once a year maybe two years and shed show up with a smaller mouth or a thinner shape and liked what she saw and went away to become that person for half a year or just one summer hows that henry henry moved his lips whispering constance sure he murmured she never smelled the same way twice henry shuffled touching the mirrors until he reached the open manhole im near right one more step would do it henry we looked down at the round hole in the cement from below came sounds of winds blowing in from san fernando glendale and who knows where elsefar rockaway the light rain runoff was sliding below a mere trickle hardly enough to cool your ankles dead end said henry nothing upstairs nothing down clues to somebody gone but where as if in answer a most ungodly cry came from the dark hole in the cold floor we all jumped jesus fritz cried christ i yelled lord said henry that cant be molly dolly holly can it i repeated that rosary in silence fritz read my lips and cursed the cry came again farther away being carried downstream tears exploded from my eyes i jumped forward to sway over the manhole fritz grabbed my elbow did you hear i cried nothing said fritz that scream thats just the water fritz said fritz you calling me a liar fritz the way you say fritz i lie no lie you dont really want to hell go down there godammit let me go if your wife was here shed push you in dummkopf i stared at the open manhole far away there was another cry fritz cursed you come with me i said no no you afraid afraid fritz plucked the monocle from his eye it was like pulling the spigot on his blood his suntan paled his eye watered afraid of a damn dark stupid underground cave fritz wong sorry i said dont be sorry for the greatest ufa director in cinema history he planted his fiery monocle back in its groove well what now he demanded i find a phone and call crumley to drag you out of this black hole you goddamn teenage deathwisher im no teenager no then why do i see crouched by that damn hole an olympic chump highdiving into a tide half an inch deep go on break your neck drown in garbage tell crumley to drive into the storm drain and meet me halfway from the sea if he sees constance grab her if he finds me grab even quicker fritz shut one eye to target me with fire from the other contempt under glass you will take direction from an academy awardwinning director what drop quick when you hit dont stop whatevers down there cant grab you if you run if you see her tell her to try to catch up stood stood now die like a dog orhe added scowling live like a stoop who got the hell through meet you at the ocean i wont be there oh yes you will he lurched toward the basement door and henry you want to follow that idiot he roared no you afraid of the dark i am the dark said henry they were gone cursing germanic curses i climbed down into mists fogs and rains of night chapter forty quite suddenly i was in mexico rome catacombs the thing about darkness is you can imagine in one direction walltowall mummies torn from their graves because they couldnt pay the funeral rent or kindling by the thousandbonepiles polo heads of skulls to be hammered downfield darkness and me caught between ways that led to eternal twilights in mexico eternity beneath the vatican darkness i stared at the ladder leading up to safetyblind henry and angry fritz but they were long gone toward the light and the crazies out front of graumans i heard the surf pounding like a great heart ten miles downstream in venice there hell was safety but twenty thousand yards of dim concrete floor stood between me and the salty night wind i gasped air because a pale man shambled out of the dark i dont mean he walked crazylegs but there was something about his whole frame his knees and elbows the way his head toppled or his hands flopped like shot birds his stare froze me i know you he cried i dropped the flashlight he grabbed it and exclaimed whatre you doing down here his voice knocked off the concrete walls didnt you used to be he said my name sure jesus you hiding you down here to stay welcome i guess his pale shadow arm waved my flashlight some place eh been here horses years came down to see never went back lotsa friends want to meet em i shook my head he snorted hell why would you want to meet these lost underground jerks how do you know my name i said did we go to school together you dont remember hell and damn harold i said ross there was just the drip of a lone faucet somewhere i added more names tears leaped to my eyes ralph sammy arnold school chums gary philip off to war for gods sake who are you when did i know you nobody ever knows anyone he said backing off were you my best pal i always knew youd get on always knew id get lost he said a mile away the war i died before the war died after it i was never born so how come fading eddie ed edward eduardo its got to be my heart beat swiftly my voice rose when did you last call did you get around to my funeral did you even know i never knew i said inching closer come again dont knock ill always be here wait you searching for someone he cried whats she look like you hear that whats she look like am i right yes no yes i blurted she went that way he waved my flash when just now whats she doing here in dantes inferno what did she look like i burst out chanel no what chanel thatll bring the rats running shell be lucky if she makes it to the surf stay off muscle beach i yelled what stay i yelled shes here somewhere chanel no i seized my flash from his hands turned it back on his ghost face where why he laughed wildly god i dont know this way yeah this way his laugh caromed in all directions hold on i cant see you dont have to chanel more laughter i swiveled my flash now as he babbled i heard something like weather a seasonal change a distant rainfall dry wash i thought but not dry a flash flood this damned place ankledeep kneedeep then drowned all the way to the sea i whipped my flashlight beam up around back nothing the sound grew more whispers coming yes not a change of season dry weather becoming wet but whispers of people not rain on the channel floor but the slap of bare feet on cement and the shuffled murmur of quiet discovery arguments curiosity people i thought my god more shadows like this one more voices the whole damn clan shadows and shadows of shadows like the silent ghosts on rattigans ceiling specters that flowed up around and vanished like rainfall but what if her film ghosts had blown free of her projector and the pale screens up above in graumans and the wind blew and the phantoms caught cobwebs and light and found voices what if dear god what if stupid i cut the light for the rainchannelcrazed man was still mumbling and yammering close i felt his hot breath on my cheek and i lurched back afraid to light his face afraid to sluice the channel a second time to freeze the floodwater of ghost voices for they were louder now closer the dark flowed the unseen crowd gathered as this crazed fool grew taller nearer and i felt a plucking at my sleeves to seize hold bind and the rainfall voices far off blew nearer and i knew that i should get go run like hell and hope they were all legless wonders i i bleated whats wrong my friend cried i why are you afraid look look look there and i was thrust and bumped through darkness to a greater mass of darkness which was a cluster of shadows and then flesh a crowd gathered around a shape that wept and lamented and yearned and it was the sound of a woman drowning in darkness as the woman moaned and cried and wept and grew silent to mourn again i edged near and then someone thought to hold out a cigarette lighter clicking it so that the small blue flame extended toward a shawled and unkempt creature that fretting soul inspired another lighter drifted out of the night hissing and breathed light to hold steady and then another and another small flame after flame like so many fireflies gathered in a circle until there was illumination circling steadily and floating within to reveal that misery that exaltation that whispering that sobbing that voice of sudden pronouncements were six twelve twenty more small blue fires thrust and held to ignite the voice to give it a shape to shine the mystery the more firefly lights the higher the voice shrilled asking for some unseen gift recognition asking for attention demanding to live asking to solve that form face and presence only from my voices i would lose all heart she lamented what i thought whats that familiar i almost guessed almost knew what the bells came down from heaven and their echoes linger in the fields through the quiet of the countryside my voices she cried what almost familiar i thought oh god what then a thunderous flood of storm wind flashed from the far sea drenched with salt odor and a smash of thunder you i cried you and all the fires blew out to screams in utter darkness i called her name but the only answer was a torrent of shouts in an avalanche of feet in full stampede in the roar and rush and ranting some soft flesh struck my arm my face my knee and then it was gone as i cried you and you again there was an immense roundabout a thousand millraces of darkness from which a single flame ignited near my mouth and one of the strange beasts cursed seeing me and shouted you you scared her away you and hands were thrust to snatch at me until i fell back no i turned and leaped hoping to hell it was toward the sea and not the ghosts i stumbled and fell my flashlight skittered christ i thought if i cant get it back i scrambled on hands and knees oh please please and my fingers closed on the flashlight which resurrected my flesh got me upright swaying with the black flood behind and i broke into a drunken run dont fall i thought hold the light like a rope to pull you dont fall dont look back are they close are they near are there others waiting great god at which moment the most glorious sound cracked the channel there was an illumination ahead like the sunrise at heavens door a loud chant of car horn an avalanche of thunder a car people like me think in filmbit flashes over in an instant dumb in retrospect but a lightning bolt of exhilaration john ford i thought monument valley indians but now the damn cavalry for ahead in full plunge from the sea my salvation an old wreck and half standing up front crumley yelling the worst curses he had ever yelled cursing me with the foulest curses ever but glad he had found me and then cursing this damn fool again dont kill me i cried the car braked near my feet not till we get outta here crumley shrieked the darkness lit by headlights reared back i was frozen with crumley blaring the horn waving arms spitting teeth going blind youre lucky this damn buggy made it in what gives i stared back into the darkness nothing then you wont be needing a lift crumley gunned the gas i jumped in and landed so hard the jalopy shook crumley grabbed my chin you okay now yes we gotta back out back out i cried the shadows loomed at fifty miles an hour sixty crumley glared at the night satchel paige said dont look back something may be gaining on you a dozen figures lurched into the light now i yelled we left at seventy miles an

tongue the real stuff he murmured salt your wife said you cry at phone books he said quietly phone books full of people lost in graveyards maybe if i quit now id never forgive myself or you if you made me stop after a long moment crumley shifted out of the car wait he said not looking at me i got to go pee chapter fortytwo he came back after a long while you sure know how to hurt a guy he said as he climbed back into the jalopy just stir dont shake crumley cocked his head at me youre a queer egg youre another we drove slowly along the shore toward rattigans i was silent you got another hairball crumley said why is it i said someone like constance is a lightning bolt performing seal highwire frolicker wild laughing human and at the same time shes the devil incarnate an evil cheater at lifes loaded deck go ask alexander the great said crumley look at attila the hun who loved dogs hitler too bone up on stalin lenin mussolini mao hells anvil chorus rommel good family man how do you cradle cats and cut throats bake cookies and people how come we love richard the third who dumped kids in wine casks how come tv is all al capone reruns god wont say i dont ask he turned us loose its up to us once he took off the leash who wrote malt does more than milton can to justify gods way towards man i rewrote it and added and freud spoils kids and spares the rod to justify mans ways toward god crumley snorted freud was a nut loose in a fruit patch i always believed smartass punks need their teeth punched my dad never broke my teeth thats because youre a halfstale christmas fruitcake the kind no one eats but constance is beautiful you mistake energy for beauty overseas french girls knocked me flat they blink wave dance stand on their heads to prove theyre alive hell constance is all battery acid and short circuit if she ever slows down shell get ugly no gimme those he seized the glasses off my nose and peered through them rosecolored how do things look without them nothings there great theres not much worth seeing theres paris in the spring paris in the rain paris on new years eve you been there i saw the movies paris gimme ill just keep these until you take waltz lessons from blind henry crumley shoved my glasses in his pocket as we pulled our jalopy up on the shore in front of the white chateau we saw two dark shapes by her oceanside pool under the umbrella to keep off the moonlight crumley and i trudged up the dune and peered in at blind henry and angry fritz wong there were martinis laid out on a tray i knew henry said after that storm drain youd seek refreshment grab drink we grabbed and drank fritz soaked his monocle in vodka thrust it in his stare and said thats better and then he finished the drink chapter fortythree i went round placing camp chairs by the pool crumley watched with a dour eye and said let me guess this is the finale of an agatha christie murder mystery and poirots got all the usual suspects stashed poolside bull seye proceed i proceeded this chair here is for the mount lowe collector of old newspapers who will testify in absentia in absentia this next chair is for queen califia long gone with her palmistry and head bumps i kept moving third chair father rattigan fourth chair graumans chinese milehigh projectionist fifth chair j w bradford aka tallulah garbo swanson colbert sixth professor quickly aka scrooge nicholas nickleby richard the third seventh chair me eighth chair constance hold on crumley got up and pinned his badge on my shirt we going to sit here said fritz and listen to a fourthrate nancy drew stash your monocle said crumley fritz stashed his monocle now said crumley junior junior moved behind the chairs for starters im rattigan running in the rain with two books of the dead some already dead some about to die i laid the two books on the glasstop table we all know now that quickly in a spurt of nostalgic madness sent the one book with all the dead people to frighten constance she came running from her past her memories of a fast furious and destructive life you can say that again said crumley i waited sorry said crumley i picked up the second book constances more personal recent phone lists but what if constance hit by the old book of the dead got wired back into her griefs her losses in that past and decided in order to make do with it she had to destroy it person by person one by one what if she redlined the names and forgot she had done it what if crumley sighed let the idiot express his delight fritz wong tucked his monocle back in his eye and leaned forward so the rattigan goes to kill maim or at least threaten her own past ja he said with heavy germanic concern is that the way the next scene plays i asked action said fritz amused i swayed behind the first empty chair here we are at the dead end of the old trolleytram line on mount lowe fritz and crumley nodded seeing the mummy there wrapped in headlines wait blind henry squinted okay im there her first husband is there her first big mistake so she goes up to swipe the newspapers with all her old selves filed away she grabs the papers like i did and gives a final yell whether she pushed the landslide of newsprint or gave one last shriek who knows regardless the mount lowe trolley master drowned in a badnews avalanche okay i looked over at crumley whose mouth gaped with his okay he nodded as did fritz henry sensed this and gave the goahead chair number two bunker hill queen califia predictor of futures insurer of fates i held on to the chair as if i pushed that massive elephant on roller skates constance shouted outside her door califia wasnt murdered any more than that mount lowe egyptian relic was yelled at sure by rattigan telling califia to take back all her lousy predictions that insured the future califia had unrolled a papyrus road map constance followed blind as a batsorry henryall enthusiasm would califia lie no was the future wondrous you betcha now late in the game constance wanted retractions califia would have retracted told new lies and gone on living but alarmed fell downstairs into her grave not murder but panic so much for califia said crumley trying to hide his approval scene three take one said fritz scene three take one chair number three i moved this here is the confessional booth st vibianas fritz scooched his chair closer his monocle a lighthouse flash searching my small private stage he chopped his head at me to continue and heres rattigans bighearted brother trying to lead her along the straight and narrow when califia said left he yelled right and maybe after years of storms of brutal sin he threw up his hands tossed her out of the church but she came back raving demanding absolution screaming her demands purify me forgive me your own flesh give way give in but he clapped his hands over his ears and yelled against her yell and his yells not hers struck him dead so you say said fritz one eye shut the fire from his monocle stabbing prove it if were going to shoot this like a goddamn film write me the moment of truth tell how you know the priest killed himself with his own rage yes who the hells the detective here crumley cut in the boy wonder is drawled fritz not looking at him still shooting lightning bolts of optical glass at me he gets hired or fired by what he next claims im not applying for a job i said youve already got it said fritz or get thrown out on your ass im the studio head and youre pleabargaining how do you know the priest was selfmurdered i exhaled because i heard him breathe watched his face saw him run he couldnt stand constance diving in the surf one way to come out another she was hot desert air he was fog collision lightning bodies all from one priest and one bad sister saint sinner i said fritz wong stiffened with a glow in his face and a most ungodly smile you got the job crumley crumley reared back from fritz but at last nodded as proof itll do next i moved on to the next chair here we are at graumans chinese up high late night film running figures on the screen pictures on the wall all of rattigans former selves nailed ready to be nabbed and the one man who really knows her bum to belly button her dad keeper of the unholy flame but he doesnt want her either so she busts in and swipes the pictures that prove her past shes got to burn those too because she doesnt like all her former selves the final bustin puts her pa in shock like all the rest torn both waysafter all it is his daughterhe lets the pictures go but runs the film on a continuous roundabout reel molly dolly sally holly gala willa sue the reels still running and the faces lit when we arrive too late to save him or the swiped photos unmurder number four so j wellington bradford aka tallulah bankhead cum crawford cum colbert is still alive and hes not a victim said crumley the same goes for quickchange artist quickly alive but not for long theyre as flimsy as kites in a long storm constance ranted at them because said crumley they taught her all the ways to not be herself said fritz proud of his insight dont do this do that dont do that do this richard the third tells you how to be lears daughter lady macbeth medea one size fits all so she became electra juliet lady godiva ophelia cleopatra bradford said rattigan did same with quickly see connie run she had to show up on both their doorsteps to disrobe junk her lines burn her notices can teachers unteach constance demanded who is constance what is she was the essence of her declaration being only forward teachers they didnt know how to teach backward so constance was driven to the basement dressing rooms i said snatch the pictures from upstairs sure but then wipe out the evidence of her former selves on the mirrors scrape erase eliminate name by name year by year i finished and sipped my drink and shut up is the train in murder on the orient express pulling into the station said fritz lying back fulllength like caesar in his bath yes furthermore said fritz wong in his fine germanic guttural are you free to accept work on a screenplay titled the many deaths of rattigan starting monday five hundred a week ten weeks twenty thousand bonus if we finally shoot the goddamn film take the money and run said henry crumley you want me to take his offer i said its dumb thinking but a great film said crumley you dont believe me i cried nobody could be as nuts as you just said said crumley good god why have i stood here upchucking my guts i sank in my chair i dont want to live i said yes you do fritz leaned forward scribbling on a pad five hundred a week was there he threw a fivedollar bill on top your first ten minutes salary then you almost believe no i pushed the paper away got to be one of you here gets my idea me a voice said we all looked at blind henry sign the contract he said but make him sign saying he really believes every word you say i hesitated then scribbled my own manifesto rumbling fritz signed that constance he growled damn she shows up at your door flings herself on you like a goddamn snake hell who cares if she kills herself why should she run scared of her own phone books and look up all the stupid people who led her down the garden path would phone books scare you christ no there had to be a reason for her setting out to run to seek motivation why goddammit why all that work to get what hold on fritz stopped his face suddenly pale then slowly suffusing with color no yes no couldnt be no yes is is what fritz im glad i talk to myself said fritz im glad i listen did anyone hear you havent said fritz ill talk to myself and you eavesdrop ja ja i said fritz shot me through the heart with one glare he doused his irritation with a swallow of his martini and said a month ago two months she threw herself across my desk with heavy breaths was it true she cried i was starting some new film a movie yet nameless ja i said yes maybe and is there a part for me she said on my shoulder in my lap no no i said yes there must be there has to be tell me fritz what is it i should have never told her but i did god help me what was the film fritz what im planning is beyond you i said yes but for gods sake fritz name the film fritz ignored me staring through that monocle into the starry sky still talking to himself while we eavesdropped you cant do it i said she wept please she begged try me i said constance its something you can never be something you never were fritz took another swig from his glass the maid of orleans joan of arc oh my god she cried joan if its the only thing i ever do i must do that must do that came the echo joan a voice cried in my ears rain fell water ran a dozen lighters took fire and were thrust out toward the sad weeping woman only for my voices i would lose all heart the bells came down from heaven and their echoes linger in the fields through the quiet of the countryside my voices the subterranean audience gasped with joan joan of arc ohmigod fritz i cried say that again saint joan i leaped back my chair fell fritz went on i said constance its too late she said its never too late and i said listen ill give you a test if you pass if you can do the scene from shaws saint joan impossible but if you can you get the job she fell apart she cried wait im dying wait ill be back and she ran away i said fritz do you know what youve just said gottdammit yes saint joan oh christ fritz dont you see weve been thrown off by what she said to father rattigan ive killed ive murdered help me bury them she cried we thought she meant old rattigan up on mount lowe queen califia on bunker hill but no dammit she didnt murder them she was out to get help to murder constance hows that again said crumley help me kill constance said constance why for joan of arc thats the answer she has to have that role all this month shes been preparing for it isnt that it fritz just a moment while i take my monocle out and put it back in fritz stared at me fritz look shes not right for the part but there is one way she can be saint joan dammit to hell say it dammit fritz she had to get away from you fall back take a long hard look at her life she had to one by one kill all her selves lay all the ghosts so that when all those constances were dead she could come for her test and maybe just maybe land the part she hasnt had a role like that ever in her life this was her big chance and the only way she could do it was to kill the past dont you see fritz that must be the answer to whats been going on during the last week with all these people with constance appearing disappearing and reappearing again fritz said no no i said yes yes the answers been lying right in front of us but its only when you said the name saint joan is the motive for every woman who ever lived impossible dream cant be attained ill be gottdammed oh no fritz i said blessed youve solved it now if we find constance and say to her maybe just maybe she has a chance maybe maybe i broke off fritz i said answer me what if constance should suddenly appear as the maid of orleans if she were incredibly young changed in some strange way would you give her the job fritz scowled dont push me dammit i said im not look was there ever a time when she could have played the maid yes he said after a moment but that was then and this is now hear me out what if by some miracle she should show up when you think of her just standing there dont think of her past at all when you remember the woman you once knew if she asked would you give her the role fritz pondered took his glass downed it refilled it from a frosted crystal pitcher and then said god help me i think i might dont press me dont press fritz i said if we could find that constance and she asked you would you at least consider taking a chance on her oh god fritz rumbled jesus yes no i dont know fritz dont yell goddammit yes a qualified yes okay all right wonderful now if only my eyes strayed scanning the length of shore to the distant stormdrain entrance too late i glanced away both crumley and fritz had caught the look junior knows where medea is right now said crumley yes god i thought i know but my yell had scared her away fritz focused his monocle on that stormdrain entrance is that where you came out he said no thanks to junior here said crumley i rode shotgun i said guiltily like hell shouldnt have been in that sinkhole to start with probably found rattigan then lost her again probably i thought oh god probably that storm drain fritz wong mused maybe just maybe you ran the wrong way i what i said stunned here in crazy hollywood said fritz is there not more than one way to go the storm drains they head in all directions south north west and i slowed down east i said slowly its not easy to say east slowly but i did east fritz cried ja east east we let our thoughts roam over the hills and down toward glendale no one ever went to glendale except if someone was dead fritz wong twisted his monocle in his fierce right eye and probed the eastern skyline smiling a wonderfully vicious smile gottdamn he said this will make the great finale no script needed shall i tell you where rattigan is east gone to earth gone to what said crumley sly fox swift cat rattigan gone to earth tired ashamed of all her lives hide them all in one final cleopatras carpet roll them up deposit them in eternitys bank fade out darkness plenty of earth there to go to he made us wait forest lawn he said fritz thats where they bury people whos directing this fritz said you took the wrong turn toward open air the sea life rattigan headed east death called her by all two dozen names she answered with one voice bs said crumley youre fired said fritz i was never hired said crumley whats next go and prove i am right said fritz so said crumley rattigan climbed down into that storm drain and walked east or drove or was driven east that said fritz is how i would shoot it film delii cious but why would she go to forest lawn i protested weakly thinking perhaps i had sent her there to die said fritz triumphantly go read ludwig bemelmans tale of the old man dead put a lit candle on his head hung flowers around his neck and walked a oneman funeral to his own grave constance she does the same shes gone to die a last time yes now do i put my car in gear will someone follow and do we go aboveground or take the storm drain direct i looked at crumley he looked at me and we both looked at blind henry he felt our gaze nodded fritz was already gone the vodka with him lead the way said henry swear a little now and then to give me direction crumley and i headed for crumleys old jalopy henry in our wake fritz in his car ahead banged his motor blew his horn okay you damn kraut cried crumley he thrummed his engine exploding which way to the nearest road rage dammit we paused by the storm drain stared in then out at the open road which is it smartass said crumley dantes inferno or route let me think i said oh no you dont crumley cried fritz was gone we looked along the beach and couldnt see his car anywhere we looked to our right there speeding off down the tunnel were two red lights christ crumley yelled hes heading in on the flood channel damned fool what are we going to do i said nothing cried crumley just this he rammed the gas we swerved and plunged into the tunnel madness i cried damn tootin said crumley goddamn im glad i cant see this henry said from the backseat speaking to the wind in his face we raced up the flood channel heading inland can we do it i cried how high is the flood channel most places its ten feet high crumley shouted the farther in we get the higher the ceilings floods come down the mountains in glendale then the channel has to be really big to take the flood hold on ahead of us fritzs car had almost vanished idiot i said does he really know where hes going yes said crumley all the way to graumans chinese then left to the goddamn marble orchard the sound of our motor was shattering in that thunder we saw ahead of us a tide of those lunatics who had assaulted me my god i cried well hit them dont slow down those crazies keep going we raced along the channel our engine roared the history of la streamed past us on the walls pictographs graffiti crazed illustrations left by wandering homeless in faces and images of terrible things and nothing alive crumley floored the gas we plunged at the crazed underground mob who shrieked and screamed a horrible welcome but crumley didnt slow we cut through them tossed them aside one ghost rose up flailing gibbering ed edward eddie oh eduardo i thought is that you you never said goodbye the ghost raved and fell away i wept and we raced on outpacing my guilt we left all behind and the farther we went the more terrified i became how in hell do we know where we are i said there arent any directions down here or we cant see them crumley said i think that maybe yeah lets see for there were signs on the walls scribbled in chalk some in black painted letters crumley slowed the car on the wall ahead of us someone had etched a bunch of crucifixes and cartoon tombstones crumley said if fritz is any guide were in glendale that means i said yeah he said forest lawn he put on his high beams and swerved the car right and left as we moved slowly and we saw a ladder leading up to a grate covered by a manhole in the tunnel ceiling and fritzs car beneath it and him out of the car and climbing the ladder a series of crosses ran alongside the ladder leading up we got out of the car and crossed the dry wash and began to climb the ladder there was a thundering clang above us we saw fritzs shape and the manhole shoved aside and the beginnings of a gentle rain pelting his shoulders we climbed the ladder in silence above us fritz was directing and shouting get the hell up here you damn fools we looked down blind henry was not about to be left behind chapter fortyfour the storm was over but the drizzle stayed the sky was a loon skypromising much delivering little are we there yet said henry we all looked in the gates at forest lawn cemetery a sweeping hillside covered with a cannonade of memorial stones embedded like meteors in its grass they say that place said crumley has a greater voting population than paducah kentucky red river wyoming or east end azusa i like oldfashioned graveyards said henry things you can run your hands over tombs you can lie on like statues or bring your lady in late hours to play doctor anyone ever gone in just to check the boy davids fig leaf said fritz i hear tell said henry when they shipped him over there was no leaf so he lay around the north forty a year under canvas so old ladies in tennis shoes wouldnt be offended day before the fig leaf was glued on to spoil the fun they had to beat off a gloveless braille institute convention live folks doing gymnastics in midnight graveyards is called foreplay dead folks doing the same is afterplay we stood there in the drizzle looking across the way to the mortuary offices gone to earth i heard someone murmur me move said crumley in thirty minutes the rain from the hills hits below the flood will wash our cars down to the sea we stared at the gaping manhole we could hear the creek whispering below my god said fritz my classic car move said crumley we ducked across the street and into the mortuary building who do we ask i said and what do we ask there was a moment of colliding looks pure confusion do we ask for constance i said talk sense said crumley we ask about all those newspaper headlines and names all those lipstick aliases on the basement dressingroom mirrors say again said henry im talking pure circumstantial metaphor said crumley double time we doubletimed it into the vast halls of death or to put it another way the land of clerks and file cabinets we did not have to take a number and wait for a very tall man with iceblond hair and an oyster complexion glided to the front desk and disdained us as if we were discards from a steam laundry he laid a card on the desktop and dared crumley to take it you grey he said elihu phillips grey as you see were here to buy gravesites and plots a latewinter smile appeared on elihu p greys mouth and hung there like a mist with a magicians gesture he manifested a chart and price sheet crumley ignored it first i got a list he pulled out all the names i had put together but placed it upside down in front of grey who scanned the list in silence so crumley pulled forth a rolled wad of onehundreddollar bills hold that will you junior he said tossing the wad to me and then to grey you know those names i know all the names grey relapsed into silence crumley swore under his breath recite them junior i recited the names one by one holly morgan grey flicked through his file shes here buried polly starr another quick runthrough here how about molly circe right emily danse all buried here for sure grey looked sour i have never once in all my life been wrong strange however he rescanned the items he had drawn out of the file odd are they all related all one family how do you mean grey fixed his arctic stare at the names because see here theyre all entombed in the same aboveground gothic stone hut hows that again crumley lurched from his boredom and grabbed the file cards what odd all those different surnames put to rest in one tomb a memorial dwelling with eight shelves for eight family members but they arent family said fritz odd said grey strange i stood as if struck by lightning hold on i whispered fritz and crumley and henry turned to me grey lifted his snowy eyebrows yeess he made two long syllables out of it well the tomb house the family vault there must be a name on the portico the name chiseled in marble grey scanned his cards making us wait rattigan he said are you sure i have never yes i know the name again we all held our breath rattigan his cold voice issued from a steeltrap mouth we let our air out at last i said they cant all be there in that one vault grey shut his eyes i i know i know i said quickly i stared at my friends are you thinking what im thinking jesus christ murmured crumley goddamn can you give us directions to the rattigan tomb grey scribbled on a notepad map easy to find therere fresh flowers out front the tomb door is open there will be a memorial service there tomorrow whos being entombed we all waited eyes shut guessing the answer rattigan said grey almost smiling someone named constance rattigan chapter fortyfive the rain was so thick the graveyard disappeared all we could see as we drove uphill in an electric runabout were monuments on the side of the road the path ahead vanished in the downpour i carried a map on my lap marked with an arrow and the name of the area we stopped its there said crumley azalia gardens plot sixteen neopalladian edifice the rain blew back like a curtain and a flicker of lightning showed us a slender tomb with palladian pillars on each side of a tall metal door which stood ajar so if she wants out said henry shes out or invite folks in rattigan the rain lifted and blew away and the tomb waited while thunder ran along the far brim of the graveyard the open door trembled crumley spoke almost to himself jesus constance buried herself name after name year after year when she was done with one act one face one mask she hired a tomb and stashed herself away and now to get the job maybe from fritz shes killing all her selves again dont go in there willie shes in there now i said horse apples said crumley goddamn intuition no i shivered goddamn hunch shes got to be saved i climbed out shes dead ill save her anyway like hell you will said crumley youre under arrest get back in here youre the law sure but youre my friend i was flooded with cold rain dammit dammit all to hell go on run you stupid idiot well be waiting downhill ill be goddamned if ill sit and watch your head come flying out that goddamn door come find us damn you hold on fritz cried hold goddamn nothing fritz threw a small flask that hit me in the chest i stood shivering in the cold downpour and gave fritz a long look as crumley cursing got out of the runabout slowly we stood in the big mortuary field with an open iron gate and open tomb door and the rain threatening to wash the bodies out of the earth i shut my eyes and drank the vodka ready or not i whispered here goes goddammit said crumley chapter fortysix it was a dark and stormy night my god i thought again feet running a cry lightning thunder a few nights back and here my god the same again the gates of heaven burst a flood poured in darkness with me near a cold tomb with someone crazed and maybe dead deep in the dark stop i told myself touch the outer gate creaked the inner door squealed we stood in the entry of the marble tomb with the sun gone never to return and the rain to rain forever it was dark but there were three small blue votive candles lit and wavering in the draft from the door we all looked at the sarcophagus down below on our right hollys name was there but there was no lid on the sarcophagus and it was empty save for a powdering of dust our eyes looked up to the next shelf lightning flickered outside in the rain thunder mumbled on the next shelf mollys name was cut in marble but again no lid and the sarcophagus was empty rain drenched the open door behind us as we looked at the nexttotop and topmost shelves and marble cases we saw the names of emily and polly we could see one was unoccupied trembling i reached up to probe the top casement my fingers touched only empty air holly polly molly and emily but in the flickers of lightning no bodies no remains i stared up at that final enclosure and began to reach up when there was the faintest gasp and something like a cold weeping far away i took my hand down and looked at crumley he looked up at the last sarcophagus and at last said junior its all yours there was a final intake of breath above in the shadows okay said crumley everyone out everyone backed out into the whispering rain at the door crumley looked back at his lunatic child handed me a flashlight nodded good luck and was gone i was alone i pulled back the flashlight fell i almost collapsed it took a long while before i found and raised its beam my heartbeat quaked with it you i whispered there jesus what did that mean its i whispered me louder i came to find you i whispered so the shadow murmured the rain behind me fell in a solid sheet lightning shimmered but still no thunder constance i said at last to the dark shape on the tall shelf with the shadows of rain curtaining it listen and at last i said my name silence i spoke again oh god i thought shes really dead no more of this get out damn go but even in turning the slightest shrug it happened the shadow above with a faceless face quickened with the merest breath i hardly heard i only sensed the shadow what it exhaled i quickened glad for life any life any pulse my name i gave it again oh someone murmured which hammered me to quicker life i leaned away from rain into cold tomb air ive come to save you i whispered so the voice murmured it was the merest mosquito dance in the air not heard no not there how could a dead woman speak good the whisper said night dont sleep i cried sleep and you wont come back dont die why came the murmur because i gasped because i say so say a sigh jesus i thought say something say said the faintest shadow come out i murmured this isnt your place yes the faintest brush of sound no i cried mine came the breath in the shadow ill help you get away i said from what the shadow said and then in terrible fear gone they are gone they gone theyve got to be are they lightning struck the dark acres at last thunder knocked the tomb i spun to stare out at the meadows of stone the hills of shining slabs with names being sluiced away and the slabs and stones were lit by the fires in the sky and became names on mirror glass photos on walls inked names on papers and again mirror names and dates being washed away down a storm drain while the pictures fell from the walls and the film slithered through the projector to dance faces on a silver screen ten thousand miles below pictures mirrors films films mirrors pictures names dates names are they still there said the shadow on the top shelf of the tomb out there in the rain i looked out at the long hill of the mortuary place the rain was falling on a dozen and a hundred and a thousand stones they mustnt be there she said i thought they were gone forever but then they began to knock at the door wake me i swam out to my friends the seals but no matter how far i swam they were waiting for me on the shore the whisperers who want to remember what i want to forget she hesitated so if i couldnt outrun them id have to kill them one by one one by one who were they me so i chased them instead of them me and one by one i found where they were buried and buried them again then where they would stay forever now its time to lie down and sleep forever or they might call me again at three in the morning so where am i the rain fell outside the crypt there was a long moment of silence and i said youre here constance and im here listening after a while she said are they all gone is the shore clear now can i swim back in and not be afraid i said yes constance theyre really buried you did the job someone had to forgive you that someone had to be constance come out why said the voice from the top shelf of the tomb because i said this is all crazy but youre needed so please rest for a moment and then put your hand out and let me help you down do you hear me constance the sky went dark the fires died the rain fell erasing the stones and slabs and the names the names the terrible names cut to last but dissolving in grass are they came the frantic whisper and i said my eyes filled with cold rain yes yes yes i said the yards empty the pictures dropped the mirrors are clean now theres only you and me the rain washed the unseen stones sinking deep in the flooded grass come out i said quietly rain fell water slid on the road the monuments stones slabs and names were lost constance one final thing what she whispered after a long pause i said fritz wong is waiting the screenplay is finished the sets are built and ready i shut my eyes and agonized to remember then at last i remembered only for my voices i would lose all heart i hesitated then continued it is in the bells i hear my voices the bells come down from heaven and the echoes linger in the quiet of the countryside my voices are there without them i would lose heart silence a shadow moved a white shape motioned the tips of her fingers came out into the shadows and then her hand and then the slender arm then after a long silence a deep breath an exhalation constance said im coming down chapter fortyseven the storm was gone it was as if it had never been the sky was clean not a cloud anywhere and a fresh breeze was blowing as if to clean a slate or a mirror or a mind i stood on the beach in front of rattigans arabian fort with crumley and henry mostly silent and fritz wong surveying the scene for long shots and closeups inside the house two men in white coveralls moved like shadows and i was put in mind of altar attendants somehow the mind of a crazed writer freely associating and i wished that somehow wild as it seemed father rattigan could be there could be one of those white figures cleaning the house with a censer of incense and a rain of holy water to resanctify a place that had probably never been anywhere near sanctified good god i thought bring a priest to cleanse a den of iniquity the housepainters inside scraping the walls clean in order to apply fresh paint worked steadily not knowing whose house it was and what had lived there outside on a table by the pool were some beers for crumley fritz henry and myself and vodka if our mood changed the smell of fresh paint was invigorating it promised a lunatic redemption and an echo of forgiveness new paint new life please god how far out does she go crumley stared at the breakers a hundred yards off shore dont ask me said henry out with the seals i said or sometimes in close she has a lot of friends out there hear the seals were barking louder or softer i couldnt say i only heard it was a glad sound to go with the fresh paint in an old house made new tell the painters when they paint her mailbox said fritz to leave room for just one name ja right said henry he cocked his head to one side and then frowned shes been swimming a long time what if she dont come in that wouldnt be so bad i said she loves the water offshore swells after a storm fine for surfing hey that was loud the kind of loud that made for a theatrical entrance with superb timing a cab roared up in the alley behind rattigans god i said i know who that is a door slammed a woman came slogging across the sand that ran between the house and seaside pool her hands clenched in tight balls she stood before me like a blast furnace and raised her fists what have you got to say for yourself maggie cried sorry i bleated sorry she hauled off and struck me a terrible blow on the nose hit him again crumley suggested once more for luck offered fritz whats going on said henry bastard i know son of a bitch yes i said she struck a second time the blood gushed it flooded my chin and drenched my upraised hands maggie pulled back oh god she cried what have i done hit a son of a bitch and bastard fritz answered right said crumley you keep out of this maggie yelled someone get a bandaid i looked at the bright flow on my hands bandaids wont work shut up you stupid womanizer only one i bleated hold still she cried and raised her fist again i held still and she collapsed no no enough enough she wept oh god this is terrible go ahead i deserve it i said do you do you yeah i said maggie glared at the far surf where is she out there somewhere i hope she never comes in me too what in hell does that mean i dont know i said as quietly as possible maybe she belongs out there maybe she has friends dumb friends and maybe she should stay with them and never come in again if she does ill kill her then shes better off staying way out are you defending her damn you no just saying she should never have come in she was always happier on days like this after a storm when the waves are right and the clouds are gone i saw her a few times like that she didnt drink all day just kept going out and there was always the promise she wouldnt come back what got into you what got into her nobody knows it happens all the time no alibis its just things happen and next thing you know its all gone to hell keep talking maybe youll make sense no the more talk the less sense she was lost for a long time now maybe shes found a lot of bull a lot of malarkey i dont know i promised her if she swam out with all those names she might swim back in as just one promises promises well know when she comes ashore shut up you know i love you dont you you dumb bastard i know in spite of all this you rat i still love you god help me is this what all women put up with most i said most no explanations no reason awful truths the dog wanders the dog comes home the dog smiles you hit him he forgives you for forgiving him and its back home to the kennel or a lonely life i dont want a lonely life do you jesus help me no i dont wipe your nose i wiped it more blood im sorry she cried dont be thats the last thing for you to be dont hold it said henry listen what said everyone at once feel it said henry what what dammit the big surf the biggest wave coming in now murmured henry and bringing something with it way out the seals barked way out a huge wave curled crumley fritz henry maggie and i held our breath and the wave came in
