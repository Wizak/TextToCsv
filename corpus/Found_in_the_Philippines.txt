 found in the philippines the story of a womans letters by captain charles king grosset dunlap publishers eleven east sixteenth street new york copyrighted by f tennyson neely copyrighted by the hobart company found in the philippines chapter i something unusual was going on at division headquarters the men in the nearest regimental camps regular and volunteer were lined up along the sentry posts and silently eagerly watching and waiting for a week rumor had been rife that orders for a move were coming and the brigades hailed it with delight for a month shivering at night in the dripping drenching fogs drifting in from the pacific or drilling for hours each day on the bleak slopes of the presidio heights they had been praying for something to break the monotony of the routine they were envious of the comrades who had been shipped to manila emulous of those who had stormed santiago and would have welcomed with unreasoning enthusiasm any mandate that bore promise of change of scene or duty the afternoon was raw and chilly the wet wind blew salt and strong from the westward sea and the mist rolled in thick and fleecy hiding from view the familiar landmarks of the neighborhood and forcing a display of lamplights in the row of gaudy saloons across the street that bounded the camp ground toward the setting sun though that invisible luminary was still an hour high and afternoon drill only just over company after company in their campaign hats and flannel shirts in worn blue trousers and brown canvas leggings the men had come swinging in from the broad driveways of the beautiful park to the south and as they passed the tents of the commanding general even though they kept their heads erect and noses to the front their wary eyes glanced quickly at the unusual array of saddled horses of carriages and concord wagons halted along the curbstone and noted the number of officers grouped about the gate ponchos and overcoat capes were much in evidence on every side as the men broke ranks scattered to their tents to stow away their dripping arms and belts and then came streaming out to stare unrebuked at headquarters it was still early in the war days and among the volunteers and indeed among regiments of the regulars whose ranks were sprinkled with college men who had rubbed shoulders but a few months earlier with certain subalterns the military line of demarcation was a dead letter when the boys were out of sight and hearing of their seniors and so it happened that when a young officer came hurrying down the pathway that led from the tents of the general to those of the field officers of the tenth california he was hailed by more than one group of regulars along whose lines he passed and as a rule the query took the terse soldierly form of whats up billy the lieutenant nodded affably to several of his fellows of the football field but his hand crept out from underneath the shrouding cape palm down signalling caution orders some kind he answered in tones just loud enough to be heard by those nearest him seen the old man anywhere the general wants him and never halting for reply the youngster hurried on he was a bright cheery braveeyed lad of twenty who six months earlier was stumbling through the sciences at the great university on the heights beyond the glorious bay never dreaming of deadlier battle than that in which his pet eleven grappled with the striped team of a rival college all on a sudden to the amaze of the elders of the great republic the tenets and traditions of the past were thrown to the winds and the hermit nation leaped the seas and flew at the strongholds of the spanish colonies volunteers sprang up by the hundred thousand and a reluctant congress accorded a meagre addition to the regular army many a college athlete joined the ranks while a limited few gifted with relatives who had both push and pull were permitted to pass a not very exacting examination and join the permanent establishment as second lieutenants forthwith counting those commissioned in the regular artillery and infantry there must have been a dozen in the thronging camps back of the great city and of these dozen billy gray belligerent billy as a tutor dubbed him when the war and billy broke out together the latter to the extent of a fourdays absence from all collegiate duty was easily the gem of the lot one of the brightest minds in his class he was one of the laziest one of the quickest and most agile when aroused he was one of the torpids as a rule one of the kind who should have gone in for honors as the faculty said he came nearer going out for devilment the only son of a retired colonel of the army who had made california his home billy had spent years in camp and field and saddle and knew the west as he could never hope to know haswell the only natural soldier of his class when sorely against the will of most they entered the student battalion he promptly won the highest chevrons that could be given in the sophomore year and almost as promptly lost them for lates and absences when the varsity was challenged by a neighboring institute to a competitive drill the scouts of the former reported that the crack company of the san pedros had the snappiest captain they ever saw and that with far better material to choose from and more of it the varsity wouldnt stand a ghost of a show in the eyes of the professional judges unless billy would brace up and take hold billy was willing as barkis but the faculty said it would put a premium on laxity to make billy a varsity captain even though the present incumbents were ready any of them to resign in his favor prex said no in no uncertain terms the challenge was declined whereat the institute crowed lustily and the thing got into the rival papers as a result a select company of student volunteers was formed its members agreed to drill an hour daily in addition to the prescribed work provided billy would take hold in earnest and this was the company that under his command swept the boards six weeks later and left san pedros contingent an amazed and disgusted crowd then billy went to metaphorical pieces again until the war clouds overspread the land then like his fathers son he girded up his loins went in for a commission and won and here he was a sub in uncle sams stalwart infantry with three classmates serving under him in the ranks and half a dozen more either as junior officers or enlisted men in the camps of the volunteers he was a handsome boy a healthy hearty boy and as boys go rather a good boy a boy in whom his mother would have found had she not long since been lifted above the cares of this world much of comfort and more to condone but a boy nevertheless who had given his old dragoon of a dad many an anxious hour now just as he neared the legal dividing line between youth and years of discretion billy gray had joined the third battalion of his regiment full of pluck hope and health full of ambition to make a name for himself in a profession he loved as except his father he certainly loved nothing else and utterly scoffing the idea that there might come into his life a being for the sake of whose smile he could almost lay down his sword for he had yet to meet amy lawrence who are the women folks up at headquarters billy asked a youth of his own years and rank peering eagerly through the drifting mist at the dim ghostly outlines of the generals camp didnt get to see em wheres the old man the colonel was the reply chief wants him toot de sweet whats wanted called a voice from the biggest of the neighboring tents and a closecropped head was thrust out between the front tent flaps that you billy who wants the colonel he and the brig rode over to the presidio an hour ago aint got back come in ive started a fire in our oil stove a puff of warm air blew from the interior and confirmed the statement it was well along in summer and not a dozen miles away to the east men were strolling about with palmleaf fans and wilted collars here close to the gray shores of the mighty sea blankets and overcoats were in demand hospitably the older officer tugged at the lacings of the military front door swore between his set teeth when the knots swollen by the wet withstood his efforts and then shouted sergeantmajor send somebody here to open this a light footstep sounded on the springy board floor nimble fingers worked a moment at the cords then the flap was thrown open and the adjutants office stood partially revealed it was a big wall tent backed up against another of the same size and pattern half a dozen plain chairs two rough board tables littered with books papers and smoking tobacco an oil stove and a cheap clothes rack on which were hanging raincoats ponchos and a cape or two comprised all the furniture in a stout frame of unplaned wood cased in their oilskins and tightly rolled stood the colors of the famous regiment and back of them well within the second tent where one clerk was just lighting a camp lantern were perched on rough tables a brace of field desks with the regimental books the sergeantmajor a veteran of years of service in the regulars sat at one of them a young soldier he who had unfastened the tent flap to admit lieutenant gray was just returning to his seat at the other two orderlies lounged on a bench well beyond and back of the sergeantmajors seat and a bugler with his hands in his pockets was smoking a short brierroot pipe at the opposite or back doorway woe to the enlisted men who sought the presence of the colonel or adjutant through any other channel the sergeantmajor would drop on him with the force of a baseball bat who all are over yahnduh at the chiefs asked the adjutant as soon as he had his visitor well inside and the soft accent as well as the quaint phraseology told that in the colonels confidential staff officer a southerner spoke all the brigade and most regimental commanders cept ours i should say and they seem to be waiting for them cant we send was the answer as the junior whipped off his campaign hat and sprinkled the floor with the vigorous shakes he gave the battered felt have sent said his entertainer briefly as he filled a pipe from the open tobacco box and struck a safety match orderly galloped after him ten minutes ago blow the brigade and battalion commanders what i asked you was who are the women up there no you didnt you said who all are up yonder im a sub and sposed you meant men soldiers officers what have i to do with anybody in petticoats and im a grizzled vet of a dozen years duty crows feet and gray hairs acomin grinned the adjutant pulling at a long curly mustache and drawing himself up to his full height of six feet and when youre as old as i am and half as wise billy youll know that a pretty girl is worth ten times the thought our old frumps of generals demand my name aint gordon if i havent a mind to waltz over there through the mist and the wind just to tell them ive sent for squeers then ill get a look at the girls ive got to go back said billy and youve no business to with mrs gordon and an interesting family to consider what tentd the ladies go to i didnt see em mrs gordon suh said the adjutant with placid superiority considers it a reflection on her sex when i fail to pay it due homage of course you didnt see the ladies the party was shown into the generals own domicile couldnt you see how many young fellows were posing in picturesque attitudes in front of it awe hank he suddenly shouted to an officer striding past the tent in dripping mackintosh goin up to division headquarters just tell the staff or the chief ive sent an orderly galloping after squeers hes halfway to the presidio now but itll be an hour before they can get back the silent officer nodded and went on whereat gordon made a spring for the entrance and hailed again say hank who are the damsels the answer came back through the fog people from the east looking for a runaway old gent pretty daughter and pretty daughters prettier cousin heard the orders damn the orders they dont touch us where do they come from drect from washington they say three regiments to sail at once and oh i know all that shouted gordon impatiently it was all over camp an hour ago where do they the girls come from whats their name wasnt presented was the sulky reply let a lot of stuffy old women show up in search of longlost sons and those fellows at headquarters unload them on us in less than no time but a brace of pretty girls why they double the gate guards so that no outsider can so much as see them billy here knows em ask him by this time the youngster had ranged up alongside the adjutant and was laughingly enjoying the latest arrivals tirade at the expense of the headquarters staff but at his closing words lieutenant billys grin of amusement suddenly left his face giving way to a look of blank amaze i know em i havent been east of the big muddy since i was a kid they asked for you all the same just after you started least one of em did for whatshisname the chiefs military legal adviser came out bareheaded and called after you but you were out of hearing he said the cousin the prettiest one recognized you as you skipped away from the generals tent and pointed you out to her friend somebody explained you were running an errand for one of those aides too lazy to go himself and that youd be back presently then go at once young man said the adjutant laying a mighty hand on the juniors square shoulder stand not upon the order of your going but git never you mind about the colonel he wont be here until after hes been there and hes in for a rasping over this mornings inspection just look at the report sergeantmajor send me colonel colts report he called aloud tossing his head back as he spoke come in parson come out of the wet and eager enough to read a famous inspectors criticisms of the appearance of the regiment the officer addressed as parson shoved briskly into the tent the young soldier who had opened the tent flap a few minutes before came forward with a folded paper which in silence he handed the adjutant and turned back to his desk mr gordon took the paper but his eyes followed the soldier then he called somewhat sharply morton the young fellow stopped at the dividing crack between the two tent floors and slowly faced the three officers he was slender well built erect his uniform fitted him trimly and was worn with easy grace his hands and feet were small and slender his eyes and hair dark and fine his features delicate and clear cut his complexion a trifle blistered and beaten by the harsh winds that whistled in every day from the sea and as he turned all three officers were struck by its extreme pallor youre sick again morton said the adjutant somewhat sternly i thought i told you to see dr heffernan have you done so i wasnt sick enough faltered the young soldier i was all right a minute or two or rather this morning sir itll be over presently perhaps it was the smell of the oil that did it the stove is close to my desk but gordon continued to look at him doubtfully move your desk across the tent for the present anyhow said he and ill speak to the doctor myself with all this newspaper hullabaloo about our neglect of the sick continued he turning to his friends if a man changes color at sight of a smashup he must be turned over to the red cross at once what is it orderly he finished suddenly as the tent flaps parted and a soldier in complete uniform girt with his belt of glistening cartridges stood at salute some visiting cards in his gloved hand lieutenant gray here sir was the comprehensive answer then catching sight of the young officer who stepped quickly forward he held forth the cards the adjutantgenerals compliments sir and hed be glad if the lieutenant would come over at once gray took the cards curiously studied them and then read aloud one after the other and placing the topmost underneath the other two as soon as read mr lispenard prime miss prime miss amy lawrence it was the last name that lay uppermost at the end receiving particular attention and the parson noted it thats the pretty cousin billy quoth he case of the last shall be first dont you see scoot now you lucky boy and tell us all about it later but gray was still gazing dreamily at the cards im sure i never met any of them before in my life said he there must be some mistake yet that name sounds familiar somehow and that was the only name now in sight im off he suddenly announced and vanished there was a sound of light quick footsteps on the flooring of the rearward tent at the same time the sergeantmajor glanced up from his writing looked at a vacant desk then at the clock then inquiringly at his regimental deity the adjutant it was just the hour of the day at which all manner of papers were coming down from division and brigade headquarters to be duly stamped noted and stacked up for the colonels action this was the young clerk mortons especial function but morton had left the office and was gone chapter ii the little party of visitors in the generals personal tent made a striking contrast to that assembled under the official canvas in the latter seated on camp stools and candle boxes or braced against the tent poles were nearly a dozen officers all in the sombre dark blue regulation uniform several in riding boots and spurs some even wearing the heavy frogged overcoat all but two juniors of the staff men who stood on the shady side of forty four of the number wearing on their shoulders the silver stars of generals of division or brigade and among their thinning crops of hair the silver strands that told of years of service one man alone the commanding general was speaking all the others listened in respectful silence in the gloom of that late fogshrouded afternoon a lantern or two would have been welcome but the conference had begun while it was still light enough for the chief to read the memoranda on his desk and now he was talking without notes in the array of grave thoughtful faces some actually somber and severe in expression a smile would have seemed out of place yet all of a sudden grim features relaxed deepset eyes twinkled and glanced quickly about in search of kindred sympathetic spirits and more than half the bearded faces broadened into a grin of merriment and as many heads were suddenly uplifted for just as the grayhaired chief ended an impressive period with the words it will be no laughing matter if i can lay hold of them there burst upon the surprised ears of the group a peal of the merriest laughter imaginable the rippling joyous musical laughter of happy girlhood mingling with the hearty wholesome if somewhat boyish outburst of jollity of healthful youth merciful powers exclaimed the chief i had forgotten all about those people they must have been here twenty minutes sixtyfive sir by the watch said a saturninelooking soldier tall and stalwart and wearing the shield of the adjutantgenerals department on the collar of his sack coat they ought to go then was the placid suggestion of a third officer a man with keen eyes thin almost ascetic face but there twitched a quaint humor about the lines of his lips that visits past the retiring age and then another peal of merriment from the adjoining tent put stop to conversation they dont lack for entertainers hazarded a staff officer as soon as he could make himself heard the solemnlooking gothamite who came with them must have slipped out it seems he knows colonel armstrong said the chief thoughtfully i sent for him an hour ago and he may be piloting mr prime around camp looking up the runaway another case asked a brigade commander with a shrug of his shoulders another case answered the general with a sigh it isnt always home troubles that drive them to it this boy had everything a doting father could give him what on earth could make him bolt and enlist for the war no one answered for a moment then the officer with the humorous twinkle about the eyes and the twitch at the lip corners bent forward placed his elbows on his knees his fingers tip to tip gazed dreamily at the floor and sententiously said girl whereupon his next neighbor a stocky thickset man in the uniform of a brigadier never moving eye head or hand managed to bring a sizable foot in heavy riding boot almost savagely upon the slim gaiter of the humorist who suddenly started and flushed to the temples glanced quickly at the chief and then as quickly back to the floor his blue eyes clouded in genuine distress the generals gray face had seemed to grow grayer in the gloom again there came like a rippling echo the chorus of merry laughter from the adjoining tent only it seemed a trifle subdued possibly as though one or two of the merrymakers had joined less heartily with sudden movement the general rose well ive kept you long enough he said let the three regiments be got in readiness at once but relax no effort in that other matter find the guilty parties if a possible thing and then the group dissolved one or two of the number looked back halfhesitating at the entrance of the tent but the chief had turned again to the littered table before him and seating himself rested his gray head in the hand nearest his visitors it was as though he wished to conceal his face one of the last to go the thinfaced soldier with the twinkling blue eyes hung irresolutely behind the chief a moment as though he had it in his mind to speak then turned and fairly tiptoed out leaving the camp commander to the society of a single staff officer and to the gathering darkness kindly say to mr prime or his friends that i will join them in a moment said the former presently without so much as uplifting head or eye and the aidedecamp left as noiselessly as his predecessor the humorist but when he was gone and the chief sat alone the sound of merry chat and laughter still drifted in with the mist at the halfopened entrance shadowy forms flitted to and fro between the official tent and the lights beginning to twinkle at brigade headquarters across the wide roadway an orderly scratched at the tent flap but got no answer the lone occupant sat well back in the gloomy interior and could barely be distinguished the waiting soldier hesitated a moment then entered and stamped once upon the wooden floor then turned and noiselessly stepped out for anticipating his question the general spoke no light just yet orderly ill call you in a moment just close the tent at his hand he needed no light to find it lay a little packet that had been passed in to him with the mail while the council was still in session it was stoutly wrapped tightly corded and profusely sealed but with the sharp point of an eraser the general slit the fastenings tore off the wrapper and felt rather than saw that a bundle of letters rolled in tissue paper and tied with ribbon ribbon long since faded and wrinkled lay within this he carefully placed in a largesized military letter envelope moistened and pressed tight the gummed flap stowed it in the inner pocket of the overcoat that hung at the rear tent pole reduced the wrapper and its superscription to minute fragments and dropped them into the wastebasket all as carefully and methodically as though life knew neither hurry nor worry then bowed his lined face in both hands a moment in utter silence and in unmistakable sadness presently his lips moved can you look down and see that i have kept my word agnes he murmured god help me to find him and save him yet once again the laughter the gay young voices rang from the other tent all over camp far and near from the limits of the park to the very slope of the height at the north the evening bugles were calling by thousands the thronging soldiery to mess or roll call slowly the general rose drew on his overcoat and in another moment under the sloping visor of his foragecap with eyes that twinkled behind their glasses with a genial smile softening every feature his fine soldierly face peered in on the scene of light of merriment and laughter under the canvas roof of the only home he knew in the world the soldier home of one whose life had been spent following the flag through bivouac camp or garrison through many a march battle and campaign all over the broad lands of the united states until now at the hour when most men turned for the placid joys of the fireside the love of devoted and faithful wife the homage and affection of children the prattle and playful sports of childrens children homeless wifeless childless he stood at the border of the boundless sea soldier duty pointing the way to far distant unknown and undesired regions content to follow that flag to the end of the world if need be and owning no higher hope or ambition than to uphold it to the end of his life there was nothing in such a face as his to put a check to fun and merriment yet all on a sudden the laughter died away three young gallants in soldier garb sprang to their feet and faced him with appeal and explanation in their speaking eyes although only one of their number found his tongue in time to put the matter into words there were only two girls when the general left that tent to meet his officers at four oclock and now there were four and the four were having fiveoclock tea at least any one would have said they were four blithe girls innocent of graver responsibilities than social calls and dinner or dance engagements for never looked four young women so free from the cares of this world as did those who were picturesquely grouped about the generals camp table and under the brilliant reflector of the generals lamp but the plain gold circlet on the slender finger of the merriest and noisiest and smallest of the four and the fact that she had nothing to say to the elder of the three attendant officers except in the brief indifferent tones of assured proprietorship and very much to say to the others told a different story the generals manner lost none of its kindness even though a close observer would have seen that his face lost a little of its light as he recognized in the evident leader of the revels and mistress of the situation the wife of his senior aidedecamp an hour before he thought her a thousand miles away and so did her husband bless your dear old heart exclaimed the little lady springing to her feet facing him with indomitable smiles and thrusting forward two slender white bejeweled hands no dont say you disapprove dont scold dont do anything but sit right down here and have a cup of your own delicious tea frank some boiling water that no one makes for you as i do youve owned it many a time and then were all going in to the palace for dinner and then to the theatre and ill tell you all about it between the courses or between the acts oh you poor dear i ought to have come before youve been working yourself to death and by this time resolutely pulling she had towed the general to a chair and into this his favorite leatherarmed canvasbacked hickoryframed companion of many a year she deftly dropped him and then giving him no chance for a word gayly pirouetting she seized one after another upon each member of the party present an accomplished little mistress of ceremonies encased in a tailormade traveling suit that rendered her proof against a dozen minor ills so beautifully was it cut and fitted to her pretty figure and with inexhaustible flow of merry words presented her or him to the veteran in the chair this my honored general first and foremost is miss mildred prime daughter of a thousand earls is she yet one vastly to be desired though i say it who should not for she hails from new york which is enough to make me hate her whereas weve just sworn an eternal friendship youve only casually met her and her folks before but i can tell you all about them you should have put frank at the head of your intelligence bureau general hed never find out anything but i would we came on the same train together all the way from ogden a tall darkeyed darkhaired ovalfaced girl coloring slightly in evident embarassment over these odd army ways courtesied smilingly to the general and seemed to be pleading dumbly for clemency if there had been transgression this hurried on the voluble little woman seizing another feminine wrist is miss cherry langton cherry ripe we call her at home this summer the dearest girl that ever lived except myself and one youll simply delight in as you do in me when you get to know her she is as you have often been told and have probably forgotten the only goodlooking member of franks family his first cousin she was moping her heart out after all the nice young men in denver went to the wars and withering on the stem until i told her she should go too when she blossomed and blushed with joy as you see her now sir cherry make your manners cherry whose name well described her was only waiting for a chance laughing the while at the merry flow of her chaperons words and at the first break stepped quickly forward and placed her hand frankly in the outstretched palm of her host then glanced eagerly over her shoulder as though she would say but you must see her and her bright eyes sought and found the fourth feminine member of the group and this said mrs frank garrison bravely yet with a trifle less confidence of manner with indeed a faint symptom of hesitancy is miss amy lawrence and in extending her little hand to take that of the most retiring of the three girls only the finger tips and thumb seemed to touch miss lawrence came quickly forward and waiting for no description bowed with quiet grace and dignity to the chief and smiling a bit gravely said uncle left word that he would soon return general but he has been gone with colonel armstrong nearly an hour i hope we have not taken too great a liberty and her glance turned to the substantial tea service on the rude camp table oh im responsible for that and for any and every iniquity here committed solely because i know our general too well to believe he would allow famishing damsels to faint for lack of sustenance it was mrs garrison of course who spoke i simply set frank and his fellows to work with the result that tea and biscuit light and warmth mirth and merriment faith hope and charity sprang up like magic in this gloomy old tent and here we are still now say youre glad i came general for these stupid boys oh i quite forgot let me present the slaves of the lamp the spirit lamp general frank you know too well i dare say stand forth vassal number two this general is captain schuyler a mite of a man physically a gothamite in fact but a tower of wit and wisdom when permitted to speak a diminutive youngster with a head twice too big for his body and a world of fun in his sparkling eyes bowed elaborately to his commanding general but prudently held his peace captain schuyler my dear general meekly bears the crescent of the subsistence department on his beautifully high and unquestionably new yorkmade collars he hasnt an idea on the subject of supplies except that commissary cigars are bad but his senator said he had to have something and thats what he got hed rather be second lieutenant of regular infantry any day but that was too high for him heres a youth it fits to a t mr william gray of the teenth foot whom i knew years ago when we were kids in the same camp and whose best claim to your notice is that you knew his father he says so and hopes youll forgive all his budding iniquities on the strength of it the general nodded with a grin at the youngster who stood at miss lawrences left and then held up his hand for silence shutting off further presentations ill forgive anything but more chatter said he with a placid smile provided you give me some tea at once then i should be glad to know how you all happened to meet here my doing entirely general frank another cup quick cherry came with me to surprise my husband an easy thing to do im always doing it we found him here by your orders striving to entertain these two charming damsels the last thing on earth he is capable of doing however valuable he may be with orders and correspondence i heard mr primes story and at once suggested colonel armstrong i heard miss lawrence exclaim at sight of billy here and saw a case of old acquaintance and sent for him forthwith so easy to say the adjutantgenerals compliments i found that after all they had never met but miss lawrence had seen him at the head of some famous student company i it was who presented him to her and summoned captain schuyler to meet once more his fellowcitizens the primes i it was who ordered lamps fire and the tea things i am the good fairy who wrought the transformation behold me with my wand she seized miss langtons slender umbrella and waving it over her curly little head pirouetted again in triumphant gayety the general was thoughtfully sipping his tea and studying her as she chattered and danced when she paused a moment for breath he again held up his hand colonel armstrong went with mr prime did he with every assurance that the prodigal should be produced forthwith and restored to the paternal bosom declaimed mrs garrison melodramatically and would have ranted on never noting the flush of pain and embarrassment that almost instantly appeared in the faces of miss lawrence and her darkeyed eastern cousin nor seeing the warning in her husbands eyes but at the moment the tent flap was thrown back and held open to admit a tall grayhaired civilian whose silk hat was uplifted as he entered in courteous recognition of the group despite the distress that was betrayed in the pallor of his face and the instant glance of his dark eyes toward the slender girl who stepped eagerly forward mrs garrison turning quickly saw and with swift agile movement sprang to one side the general slowly struggled up from his easychair reaching her fathers side miss prime laid her hand upon his arm looking fondly and anxiously into his face a soldierly middleaged officer in dripping forage cap and rain coat stepped quickly in and lowered the flap did you find him father was miss primes lowtoned faltering question we found the soldier referred to colonel armstrong has been most kind but it wasnt your brother at all my child chapter iii a day had dawned on the presidio heights as brilliant as its predecessor had been dismal a soft south wind had swept the fogs of the pacific far out to sea and cleared the summer sky of every wisp of vapor the sun of early august shone hot and strong upon the sandy wastes between the westward limits of the division camps and the foamy strand beneath the low bluffs and beat upon the canvas homes of the rejoicing soldiery slacking cloth and cordage so that the trim tent lines had become broken and jagged thereby setting the teeth of old squeers on edge as he gazed grimly from under the brim of his unsightly felt hat and called for his one faithful henchman the orderly even his adjutant could not condone the regimental commanders objectionable traits for a crustier old villain of a veteran lived not in the line of the army ould canker the troopers had dubbed him during the few years he had served in the cavalry transplanted from a foot regiment at the time of the reorganization socalled of the army in but a few years of mounted duty in arizona and later in the sioux country had sickened him of cavalry life and he gladly accepted a chance to transfer back to the infantry now twenty years after risen by degrees to the grade of lieutenantcolonel he found himself in command of a famous old regiment of regulars whose colonel had donned the stars of a general officer of volunteers and the pet name save the mark of cavalry days had given place to the unflattering sobriquet derived from that horror of boyish readers the illfavored schoolmaster of dotheboys hall he had come to the teenth with a halo of condemnation from the regiment in which he had served as major and won his baleful name and the boys of his new command soon learned to like him even less than those who had dubbed him squeers because as they explained there wasnt any privilege or pleasure he would not do the boys out of if he possibly could gordon had promptly tendered his resignation as regimental adjutant when his beloved colonel left the post to report for duty in the army destined for cuba but lieutenantcolonel canker declined to accept it and fairly told gordon that as he hadnt a friend among the subalterns there was no one else to take it then too the colonel himself wrote a word or two and settled the matter a big review had been ordered for the morning an entire brigade of sturdy volunteers was already forming and marching out by battalions to their regimental parades the men showing in their easy stride and elastic carriage the effects of two months hard drill and gradually increasing discipline the regulars were still out in the park hidden by the dense foliage and busy with their company drills the adjutant and clerk were at their papers in the big office tent and only the sentries the sick and the special duty men remained about the body of camp there was no one said private noonan to himself as he paced the pathway in front of the colonels tent after having scrupulously saluted him on his appearance no wan fur the ould man to whack at barrin its me but even canker could find nothing to whack at in this veteran soldier who had served in the ranks since the days of the great war and had borne the messages of such men as sheridan thomas and mcpherson when canker himself was sweating under his knapsack and musket like most men even most objectionable men canker had some redeeming features and that was one of them he had been a private soldier and a brave one too and was proud of it but life had little sunshine in it for one of his warped illconditioned nature there was a profound conviction in the minds of the company officers that the mere sight of happiness or content in the face of a subordinate was more than enough to set cankers wits to work to wipe it out there was no doubt whatever in the minds of the subalterns that the main reason why squeers was so manifestly down on billy gray was the almost indestructible expression of good nature jollity and enthusiasm that had shown in the little fellows face ever since he joined the regiment if we call the old man squeers we should dub billy mark tapley said gordon one day when the lad had laughed off the effect of an unusually acrimonious rasping over a trivial error in the guard report book hes no end kind when a fellows in a fix said gray in explanation and all the time he was soaking me i was thinking how he stood by jimmy carson in his scrape a serious scrape it was too for young carson detailed to escort certain prisoners to alcatraz and intrusted with certain funds to be turned over to the chief quartermaster of the department had unaccountably fallen into a deep sleep aboard the train and awoke to find both funds and prisoners gone explanations were useless the commanding general would listen to no excuse a courtmartial was ordered and a very worthy young officers military career seemed about to close under a cloud when old canker threw himself into the breach he had long suspected the sergeant who had accompanied the party in immediate command of the little guard he hated the commanding general with all his soul and how it came about no one could thoroughly explain but one day canker turned up with indubitable proof that the sergeant was the thief that he was bribed to bring about the escape of the prisoners and that he had drugged the fresh spring water he brought in to the young officer after the burning heat of the desert was left behind in the dead of the summer night canker even recovered most of the stolen money for there was a woman in the case and she had safely stowed it away carson was cleared and canker triumphant see what the man can do when his sense of justice is aroused said the optimists of the army justice be blowed answered the cynics he never would have raised his finger to help carson but for the joy of proving the general unjust and a regimental pet the sergeant a thief yet gray reverted to this episode as explanation of his tolerance of cankers harshness and thereby gave rise to a rejoinder from the lips of a veteran company commander that many a fellow was destined to recall before the regiment was two months older in order to settle it somebodys got to find his life or his commission in jeopardy maybe itll be you billy and im betting you wont find squeers a guardian angel yet on this sunshiny summer morning with hope and sunshine and confidence in his handsome boyish face lieutenant gray came bounding up to the presence of the regimental commander as though that sourvisaged soldier were an indulgent uncle who could not say him nay a stylish open carriage in which were seated two remarkably pretty girls and a grayhaired slender gentleman had reined up in the street opposite the entrance to the row of officers tents and canker had ripped out his watch with an ugly frown on his forehead for three of his companies had just marched in from drill and three of their young lieutenants on the instant of dismissal had made straight for the vehicle and he halfhoped to find they had lopped off a minute or so of the allotted hour the sound of merry laughter seemed to grate on his ears the sight of grays beaming face seemed to deepen the gloom in his own instinctively he knew the youngster had come to ask a favor and he stood ready to refuse colonel id like mightily to go over and see that review this morning sir and mr prime is good enough to offer me a seat in his carriage may i go sir you cant go anywhere sir with the tents of your company in that disgraceful condition just look at them sir as ragged as a wash line on a windy day and canker scowled angrily at the young fellow standing squarely at attention before him i know that colonel but the sun did that while we were out at drill and the men will straighten everything in ten minutes ill give the order now sir and billy looked as though refusal were out of the question youll stay and see it done sir and when its done to my satisfaction will be time enough to ask for favors mr gordon send word to the company commanders i wish to see them here at once continued the senior officer whirling on his heel and terminating the interview by so doing it was in grays mind for a brief minute to follow and plead he had made it tell many a time with an obstinate university don but he knew the carriage was waiting the carriage load watching and deep down in his heart there was keen disappointment he would have given a big slice of his monthly pay to go with that particular party occupy the seat opposite amy lawrence and gaze his fill at her fair face he wellnigh hated squeers as he hurried away to hail his first sergeant and give the necessary orders before daring to return to the carriage and report his failure his bright blue eyes were clouded and his face flushed with vexation for he saw that the rearmost regiment was even now filing into the presidio reservation afar off to the north and that no time was to be lost if his friends were to see the review the distant measured boom of guns told that the general in whose honor the ceremony was ordered was already approaching the appointed spot and away over the rolling uplands toward the golden gate a cavalry escort rode into view billy ground his teeth run and tell them i cannot get leave he called to a fellow sub squeers has set me to work straightening up camp turn out the company sergeant brace the tent cords and align tents and a mournful wave of his forage cap was the only greeting he dare trust himself to give as after a few minutes of fruitless waiting the vacant seat was given to another officer and the carriage rolled rapidly away a second or two it was hidden from his sight behind the large wall tents along the line of fence then shot into full view again as he stood at the end of the company street looking eagerly for its reappearance and then occurred a little thing that was destined to live in his memory for many a day and that thrilled him with a new and strange delight he had never been of the socalled spooney set at the varsity pretty girls galore there were about that famous institute and he had danced at many a student party and romped through many a reel but the nearest he had ever come to something more than a mere jolly friendship for a girl was the regard in which he held his partner in the mixed doubles but that was all on account of her exuberant health spirits general comeliness of face and form and exquisite skill in tennis but this day a new and eager longing was eating at his heart a strange dull pang seemed to seize upon it as he noted in a flash that the seat that was to have been his was occupied by an officer many years his senior a man he knew only by sight and an enviable reputation a man whose soldierly clearcut face never turned an instant for his eyes were fixed upon a lovely picture on the opposite seat amy lawrence bending eagerly forward and gazing with her beautiful eyes alight with sympathy interest and frank liking in search of the sorely disappointed young officer there he is she cried though too far away for him to hear and then with no more thought of coquetry than a kitten with no more motive in the world than that of conveying to him an idea of her sorrow her sympathy her perhaps pardonable and exaggerated indignation at what she deemed an act of tyranny on part of his commander with only an instant in which to express it all her sweet face flushed her eyes flamed with the light of her girlish enthusiasm and in that instant she had kissed her hand to him colonel armstrong turning suddenly and sharply to see who could be the object of interest so absorbing caught one flitting glimpse of billy gray lifting his cap in quick acknowledgment and the words that were on the tip of armstrongs tongue the moment before were withheld for a more auspicious occasion and it did not come too soon it was only four days after that initial meeting in the generals tent the foggy evening of the girls first visit to camp but both in town and on the tented field there had been several young ladies junior officers had monopolized the time and attention of the latter but armstrong was a close observer and a man who loved all that was strong highminded and true in his own sex and that was pure and sweet and winsome in woman a keen soldier he had spent many years in active service most of them in the hardy eventful and vigorous life of the indian frontier he had been conspicuous in more than one stirring campaign against the red warriors of the plains had won his medal of honor before his first promotion and his captaincy by brevet for daring conduct in action long antedated the right to wear the double bars of that grade he had seen much of the world at home and abroad had traveled much read much thought much but these were things of less concern to many a woman in our much married army than the question as to whether he had ever loved much certain it was he had never married but that didnt settle it many a man loves said they without getting married forgetful of the other side of the preposition advanced by horrid regimental cynics that many men marry without getting loved armstrong would not have proved an easy man to question on that or indeed on any other subject which he considered personal to himself even in his own regiment in the regular service he had long been looked upon as an exclusive sort of fellow a man who had no intimates and not many companions yet officers and soldiers he held the respect and esteem of the entire command even of those whom he kept at a distance and few are the regiments in which there are not one or two characters who are best seen and studied through a binocular without being sympathetic said his critics armstrong was square but his critics had scant means of knowing whether he was sympathetic or not he was a steadfast fellow an unswerving uncompromising sort of man a man who would never have done for a diplomat and could never have been elected to office but he was truthful just and as the english officer reluctantly said of lucan whom he hated yes damn him hes brave the men whom he did not seem to like in the army and who disliked him accordingly were compelled to admit to themselves at least that their reasons were comprised in the aboverecorded regretable but unmistakable fact he didnt like them another trait unpopular was that he knew when and how to say no he smoked too much perhaps and talked too little for those who would use his words as witnesses against him he never gambled he rarely drank he never lent nor borrowed he was a bachelor yet would never join a mess but kept house himself and usually had some favored comrade living with him he was forty and did not look thirtyfive he was tall erect athletic hardy and graceful in build and his face was one of the best to be seen in many a line of officers at parade his eyes were steelgray and clear and penetrating his features clearcut almost too delicately cut thought some of the best friends he had among the men his hair was brown sprinkled liberally with silver his mouth an admirable mouth in every way was shaded and halfhidden by a long drooping mustache to which some men thought and some women said his tapering white fingers paid too much attention but i doubt if a knowledge of this criticism would have led to the faintest alteration in the habit generally the expression of armstrongs face was grave and on duty a trifle stern and not ten people in the world were aware what humor could twinkle in the clear keen eyes or twitch about the corners of that mobile mouth there were not five who knew the tenderness that lay in hiding there for armstrong had few living kindred and they were men there lived not as he drove this glorious august morning to the breezy uplands beyond the camps one woman who could say she had seen those eyes of armstrongs melt and glow with love as for amy lawrence she was not dreaming of such a thing she was not even looking at him her thoughts at the moment were drifting back to that usually lighthearted boy who stood gazing so disconsolately after them as they drove away her eyes were intent upon an approaching group that presently reclaimed her wandering thoughts coming up point lobos avenue strode a party of four all soldiers one of these wildeyed bareheaded dishevelled his clothing torn his wrists lashed behind him walked between two armed guards the fourth a sergeant followed at their heels miss lawrence had just time to note that the downcast face was dark and oval and refined when it was suddenly uplifted at sound of the whirring carriage wheels a light of recognition almost of terror flashed across it and with one bound the prisoner sprang from between his guards dove almost under the noses of the startled team and darted through the wideopen doorway of a corner saloon he was out of sight in a second chapter iv the review that morning had drawn a crowd to the drill grounds that baffled the efforts of the guards carriages from camps and carriages from town carts from the suburbs equestrians from the parks and pedestrians from everywhere had gradually encroached within kicking distance of the heels of the cavalry escorting the general commanding the department and that official noted with unerring eye that the populace was coming up on his flanks so to speak at the moment when the etiquette of the service required that he should be gazing only to his immediate front and responding to the salutes of the marching column back of him ranged in long single rank was drawn up what the newspapers unanimously described as a brilliant staff despite the fact that all were in sombre campaign uniform and several had never been so rated before in their rear in turn was the line of mounted orderlies and farther still the silent rank of the escorting troop sentries had been posted to keep the throng at proper distance but double their force could have accomplished nothing the omniscient corporal could not help them and after asking one or two stray officers what they would do about it the sentries gave way and the crowd swarmed in it was just as the head of the long tramping column came opposite the reviewing point and the brigade commander and his staff turning out after saluting found their allotted station on the right of the reviewing party completely taken up by the mass of eager spectators a minute or so was required before the trouble could be remedied for just as the officers and orderlies were endeavoring to induce the populace to give way a thing the american always resists with a gay good humor that is peculiarly his own a nervous hack driver on the outskirts backed his bulky trap with unexpected force and penned between it and the wheels of a newlyarrived and much more presentable equipage a fair equestrian who shrieked with fright and clung to her pommel as her excited mount lashed out with his heels and made splinters of the hacks rearmost spokes and felloes down went the hack on its axle point out sprang a tall officer from the open carriage and in a second it seemed transferred the panicstricken horsewoman from the seismatic saddle to the safety of his own seat and the ministrations of the two young women and the gray haired civilian who were the latest arrivals this done and after one quick glance at the ladys helpless escort a young officer from the presidio he shouldered his way through the crowd and stood presently on its inner edge an unperturbed and most interested spectator battalion after battalion in heavy marching order in the darkblue service dress with campaign hats and leggings with ranks well closed and long wellaligned fronts with accurate trace of the guides and welljudged distance the great regiments came striding down the gentle slope conscious every officer and man of the admiration they commanded armstrong himself commander of a fine regiment of volunteers in another brigade looked upon them with a soldiers eye and looked approvingly then as the rearmost company passed the reviewing point and gentlemen with two stars on each shoulder extended their congratulations to the reviewed commander with one armstrong also made his way among the mounted officers in his calm deliberate fashion heedless of threatening heels and crowding forehands until he too could say his word of cordial greeting he had to wait a few minutes for the general officers were grouped and talking earnestly he heard a few words and knew well enough what was meant that quantities of stores intended for the soldiers even dainties contributed by the red cross society had been stolen from time to time and spirited off in the dead of night and doubtless sold in town for the benefit of a pack of unknown scoundrels enlisted for no better purpose in his own regiment his system had been so strict that no loss was discoverable but in certain others the deficit was great complaints were loud and the camp commander stung possibly by comments from the city had urged his officers to unusual effort and had promised punishment to the extent of the law on the guilty parties whenever or wherever found even as he was exchanging a word with the brigadier armstrong heard the exclamation by jove theyve caught another for with a grim smile of gratification the camp commander had read and turned over to his adjutantgeneral a brief dispatch just handed him by a mounted orderly who had galloped part one of your irreproachables armstrong said one of the staff with something halfsneer halftaunt as he too read and then passed the paper to the judgeadvocate of the division armstrong turned with his usual deliberation there was ever about him a quiet dignity of manner that was the delight of his friends and despair of his foes what is his name he calmly asked one of those society swells of whom you have so many was the reply that does not give his name nor identify him as one of my men said armstrong coolly oh well i didnt say he belonged to your command was the staff officers response but one of the kidglove crowd thats got into the ranks if you mean the recruits in the teenth infantry i should be slow to suspect them of any crime said armstrong with something almost like a drawl so slow and deliberate was his manner and now the steelgray eyes and the fair clearcut face were turned straight upon the snapping eyes and dark features of the other there was no love lost there one could tell without so much as seeing youre off then that commissarysergeant caught one of em in the act he got wind of it and skipped and today came back in handcuffs all of which may be as you say answered armstrong and still not warrant your reference to him as one of my irreproachables by this time much of the crowd and most of the vehicles had driven away the generals still sat in saddle chatting earnestly together while their staff officers listened in some impatience to the conversation just recorded everybody knew the fault was not armstrongs but it was jarring to have to sit and hearken to the controversy dont ever twit or try funny business with armstrong once said a regimental sage he has no sense of humor of that kind those who best knew him knew that armstrong never tolerated unjust accusations great or small in his desire to say an irritating thing to a man he both envied and respected the staff officer had not confined himself to facts and it proved a boomerang and now armstrongs eyes had lighted for an instant on the alleged culprit seated opposite miss lawrence as the carriage whirled across point lobos avenue and watching her unobtrusively he saw the sudden light of alarm and excitement in her expressive face heard the faint exclamation as her gloved hand grasped the rail of the seat felt the quick sway of the vehicle as the horses shied in fright at some object beyond his vision then as they dashed on he had seen the running guard and just vanishing within the portals of the corner building the slim figure of the escaping prisoner he saw the quivering hands tearing at their fastenings he turned to the driver and bade him stop a minute but it took fifty yards of effort before the spirited horses could be calmed and brought to a halt at the curb to the startled inquiries of mr prime and his daughter as to the cause of the excitement and the running and shouting he answered simply a prisoner escaped i think and sent a passing corporal to inquire the result the man came back in a minute they got him easy sir he had no show his hands were tied behind his back and he couldnt climb was the brief report they have not hurt him i hope said armstrong no sir he hurt them one of em at least before hed surrender when they nabbed him in town this time he submitted all right said he only ran in for a glass of beer and was laughinglike when i got there very well thatll do go on driver we havent a minute to lose if we are to see the review he continued as he stepped lightly to his seat i saw nothing of this affair said miss prime what was it all about nor could i see added her father i heard shouts and after we passed saw the guard but no fugitive it is just as well indeed im glad you didnt uncle answered miss lawrence turning even as she spoke and gazing wistfully back he looked so young and seemed so desperate and had such a i dont know hunted look on his face poor fellow and then the carriage reached the entrance to the reservation and the subject and the second object of miss lawrences sympathies evoked that day were for the time forgotten possibly mrs garrison was partly responsible for this for hardly had they rounded the bend in the road that brought them in full view from the left or southern flank of the long line of masses in which the brigade was formed than there came cantering up to them all gay good humor all smiles and saucy coquetry their hostess of the evening at the generals tent she was mounted on a sorrylooking horse but the habit was a triumph of art and it well became her slender rounded figure no one who really analyzed mrs frank garrisons features could say that she was a pretty woman no one who looked merely at the general effect when she was out for conquest could deny it colonel armstrong placidly observant as usual was quick to note the glances that shot between the cousins on the rear seat as the little lady came blithely alongside he knew her and saw that they were beginning to be as wise as he for the smiles with which they greeted her were but wintry reflections of those that beamed upon her radiant face prime paterfamilias bent cordially forward in welcome but her quick eyes had recognized the fourth occupant by this time and there was a little less of assurance in her manner from that instant how perfectly delicious she cried i feared from what you said yesterday you werent coming and so i never ordered the carriage but came out in saddle i cant say on horseback with such a wreck as this but every decent horse in the presidio had to go out with the generals and staffs you know and i had to take what i could get both horse and escort she added in confidential tone oh may i present mr ellis he knows you all by name already the youth in attendance and a mcclellan tree two sizes too big for him lifted his cap and strove to smile he had ridden nothing harder than a park hack before that day frank says i talk of nothing else but wheres mr gray surely i thought he would be with you this for armstrongs benefit in case he were in the least interested in either damsel mr gray was detained by some duties in camp explained miss prime with just a trace of reserve that was lost upon neither their new companion nor the colonel it settled a matter the placid officer was revolving in his mind pardon us mrs garrison he said briefly we must hurry go on driver oh i can keep up was the indomitable answer even on this creature and mrs garrison proved her words by whipping her steed into a lunging canter and sitting him admirably rode gallantly alongside and just where mr prime could not but see and admire since colonel armstrong would not look at all he had entered into an explanation of the ceremony by that time well under way and miss lawrences great soft brown eyes were fixed upon him attentively when perhaps she should have been gazing at the maneuvers like those latter possibly her thoughts were changing direction not ten minutes later occurred the collision between the hack and the heels that resulted in the demolition of one and demoralization of the rider of the victor while the latter was led away by the obedient mr ellis lest the sight of him should bring on another nervous attack mrs garrison was suffering herself to be comforted her nerves were gone but she had not lost her head lots of presidio dames and damsels were up on the heights that day in such vehicles as the post afforded none appeared in anything so stylish and elegant as the carriage of the prime party she was a new and comparative stranger there and it would vastly enhance her social prestige she argued to be seen in such swell surroundings with a little tact and management she might even arrange matters so that willy nilly her friends would drive her home instead of taking colonel armstrong back to camp that would be a stroke worth playing she owed stanley armstrong a bitter grudge and had nursed it long she had known him ten years and hated him nine of them where they met and when it really matters not in the army people meet and part in a hundred places when they never expected to meet again she had married frank garrison in a hand gallop said the garrison chronicles before she had known him two months said the men before he knew her at all said the women she was four years his senior if the chaplain could be believed and five months his junior if she could whatever might have been the discrepancy in their ages at the time of the ceremony no one would suspect the truth who saw them now it was he who looked aged and careworn and harassed and she who preserved her youthful bloom and vivacity and now as she reclined as though still too weak and shaken to leave the carriage and return to saddle her quick wits were planning the scheme that should result in her retaining and his losing the coveted seat there was little time to lose most of the crowd had scattered and she well knew that he was only waiting for her to leave before he would return almost at the instant her opportunity came a covered wagon reined suddenly alongside and kind and sympathetic voices hailed her do let us drive you home mrs garrison you must have been terribly shaken she recognized at once the wife and daughter of a prominent officer of the post oh how kind you are she cried i was hoping some one would come indeed i did get a little wrench and then as she moved with a sudden gasp of pain she clasped miss lawrences extended hand indeed you must not stir mrs garrison said that young lady we will drive you home at once miss prime and her father were adding their pleas she looked up smiling faintly i fear i must trouble you she faltered oh how stupid of me but about stanley armstrong i havent even thanked him ah well he knows weve been such good friends for years dear old fellow chapter v there had been a morning of jubilee in the camp of the fifth separate brigade and a row in the tents of the regulars up to within a fortnight such a state of affairs would have been considered abnormal for the papers would have it that the former were on the verge of dissolution through plague pestilence and famine due to the neglect of officials vaguely referred to as the military authorities or the staff while up to the coming of canker to command sweet accord had reigned in the regular brigade and the volunteers looked on with envy but now a great martial magnate had praised the stalwart citizen soldiery whom he had passed in review early in the day and set them to shouting by the announcement that as reward for their hard work and assiduous drill they should have their hearts desire and be shipped across the seas to far manila it had all been settled beforehand at headquarters the chief had known for four days that that particular command would be selected for the next expedition but it tickled the boys to have it put that way and the home papers would make so much of it so there was singing and triumph and rejoicing all along the eastern verge of a rocky roughly paved cross street and rank blasphemy across the way to the scandal and sorrow of the teenth infantry some of the recent robberies had been traced to their very doors a commissarysergeant had weakened a cartman had squealed and one of the most popular and attractive young soldiers in the whole command was now a prisoner in the guardhouse charged with criminal knowledge of the whole affair and of being a large recipient of the illgotten money morton of the adjutants office a private in company k what made it worse was the allegation that several others noncommissioned officers and special duty men were mixed up in the matter and canker had rasped the whole commissioned force present for duty in his lecture upon the subject and had almost intimated that officers were conniving at the concealment of the guilt of their sergeants rather than have it leak out that the felony was committed in a company of their commanding he and gordon had had what was described as a redhot row all because gordon flatly declared that while something was queer about the case of the young clerk who had money to burn as the men said hed bet his bottom dollar he wasnt a thief canker said such language was a reflection on himself as he had personally investigated the case was convinced mortons guilt could be established and had so reported to the brigade commander in recommending trial by general courtmartial indeed he had made out a case against the lad even before he was arrested and returned to camp gordon asked if he had seen the boy and heard his story canker reddened and said he hadnt and he didnt mean to and didnt have to gordon said he had he had talked with the lad fully and freely on his being brought to camp toward nine oclock and was greatly impressed with his story as would any one else be who heard it canker reddened still more and said he wouldnt allow officers to interview prisoners without his authority ill prefer charges against the next that does it said he and not three hours later mr billy gray sprawling on his camp cot striving to forget the sorrow of the earlier morning and to memorize a page of paragraphs of army regulations was suddenly accosted by an orderly who stood at the front of the tent scratching at the tent flap the camp substitute for a ring at the bell a note for the lieutenant said he darting in and then darting out possibly fearful of question it was a queer note i am a total stranger to you but i wore in brighter days the badge of the same society that was yours at the university three of the fraternity are in my company one is on guard and he urged me to write at once to you they know me to be a brother delt even though i dare not tell my real name what i have to say is that the charge against me is utterly false as i can convince you but could not convince a court i am confined at the moment of all others in my life when it is most vitally important that i should be free grant me ten minutes interview this afternoon and if i do not prove myself guiltless i will ask no favor but when i do convince you do as you would be done by yours in greekd s ch george morton well ill be blessed said mr gray as he rolled out of his gray blanket heres a state of things listen to this captain he called to his company commander in the adjoining tent heres morton back from fortyeight hours absence without leave brought back by armed guard after sharp resistance charged with lord knows what all wants to tell me his story and prove his innocence you let him alone growled his senior remember what canker said or youll go in arrest what call has morton on you id like to know the lad flushed fraternity was a very sacred thing in the greek d s ch it was the most exclusive crowd at the varsity its membership was pledged to one another by unusual ties it was the hardest society for a fellow to get into in any one of the seven colleges whereat it flourished and its mystic bonds were not shaken off with the silken gown and mortar board of undergraduate days but followed its membership through many a maturer year it was a society most college men might ask to join in vain money social station influence were powerless not until a student had been under observation two whole years and was thoroughly known could he hope for a bid to become a delta sig not until another six months of probation could he sport its colors and not until he formally withdrew from its fold in post graduation years could he consider himself absolved from its mild obligations but the boast of the delta sig had ever been that no one of its membership had ever turned a deaf ear to a fellow in need of aid who of its originators ever dreamed of such a thing as its drifting into and becoming a factor in the affairs of the regular army no wonder gray stood for a moment the paper still in his hands irresolute even disturbed not to answer the appeal meant to run counter to all the tenets of his fraternity to answer might mean arrest and courtmartial for deliberate disobedience of orders canker had no more mercy than an indian it was barely fortyeight hours since he had been publicly warned by an experienced old captain that he would find no guardian angel in squeers it would seriously mar his prospects to start now with squeers down on him and as that lynxeyed commander was ever on watch for infractions of orders billy well knew that he could not hope to see and talk with the prisoner and canker not hear of it to ask permission of canker would only make matters worse he was sure to refuse and then reemphasize his orders and redouble his vigilance to ask the consent of the officerof theday or the connivance of the officeroftheguard was to invite them to court arrest and trial on their own account he couldnt do that even to oblige a brother delt if only ned craven were officeroftheguard something might be done he was a college man too and though not a delt but rather of a rival set he would understand and possibly help guard mount was held toward dusk and that was four hours away at least the prisoners note and tone were urgent an idea occurred to billy what if he could get gordon to let him go on this very evening it wasnt his tour he had marched off only two days before as he well remembered for canker had roughed him up and down about that little error in copying the list of prisoners from the report of the previous day moreover he had counted on going to town right after retreat dining at the palace an extravagance not to be thought of at other times so as to be on hand when the primes and amy lawrence came down to dinner he had planned it all even to the amount of surprise he was to exhibit when he should discover about when he had finished his own dinner that they were just beginning theirs and the extent and degree of pleasurable emotion he might venture on showing as he hastened over to greet them and accept their offer to be seated with them even if he had been so unkind as to dine beforehand solus instead of with them he had set his heart on having a chat with miss lawrence as part recompense for all he had lost that morning and all this he was thinking of while still fumbling over that disturbing note time was getting short too there was no telling how much longer they might stay mr prime had brought his only daughter all that long journey across the continent on the assurance that the boy he loved with whom he had quarreled and whom in his anger he had sorely rebuked had enlisted there in san francisco and was serving in a regiment at the great camp west of the city he had come full of hope and confidence he had found the young soldier described and in his bitter disappointment he declared there was no resemblance to justify the report sent him by the boys own uncle who vowed he had met him with comrades on the main street of the city that the recognition was mutual for the boy had darted around the first corner and escaped his companions were scattered by the time mr lawrence returned to the spot after a brief fruitless search but private detectives had taken it up and located as they thought young prime and telegraphed the father in the distant east now mr lawrence was away on business of his own written assurances that he couldnt be mistaken lost weight and mr prime disheartened was merely waiting the report of an agent who thought he had traced the boy to tampa in twentyfour hours he might spirit his daughter away on another chase and then there would be no further warrant for miss lawrences remaining in the city she would return to her lovely home in one of the loveliest of californian valleys miles away from the raw fogs and chills of the golden gate and would be no more seen among the camps that said billy gray to himself would take every bit of sunshine from his life all this detail or much of it he had learned from the fair lips of miss lawrence herself for mr prime and his daughter seemed to shrink from speaking of the matter from the first miss amy had had to take the young gentleman under her personal wing as it were in her desire to aid her uncle and cousin in every way and knowing them to be strangers to the entire camp she had eagerly sent for him as the first familiar or friendly object she saw then when he came and was presented and proved to possess little interest to the careworn man and his anxious and devoted child it devolved upon miss lawrence to make much of billy in proportion as they made little of him and for three days or so the blithe young fellow seemed fairly to walk on air moreover she had taken him into the family confidences in telling him of the missing son and brother for both her uncle and cousin she said were so sensitive about it they could not talk to any one except when actually necessary they had leaned as it were on the general and on colonel armstrong for a day and then seemed to draw away from both they even seemed to take it much amiss that her father had to be absent when they came though they had sent no word until too late of their coming he was on his return might arrive any hour but so might they go now if billy could only discover that missing son then came an inspiration penciling a brief note he gave it to a soldier of his company and bade him take it to the guard tents it told morton of the colonels orders issued that very day and bade him be patient he hoped and believed opportunity would be afforded for an interview that evening then he hunted up a subaltern of his own grade whom he knew would probably be the detail for officeroftheguard that evening brooke said he will you swap tours with me if gordons willing i have id like mightily to exchange if its all the same to you brooke hesitated he had social hopes and aspirations of his own by swapping with gray he might find himself doomed to a night in camp when he had accepted for some pleasant function in town thought you were keen to go in tonight right after retreat he hazarded well i was said gray pulling his drab campaign hat down over his eyes to shut out the glare of the westering sun but ive got a new wrinkle some bid for friday thats your tour isnt it and brooke began counting on his fingers wait till i look at my notebook friday why thats the night of the burtons card party thought you didnt know them i dont said gray glad enough to escape the other question and you hate card parties you know you do its a go is it ill see gordon at once and off he went leaving brooke to wonder why he should be so bent on the arrangement but gordon proved an unexpected foe to the plan cant be done billy said he sententiously canker watches those details like a hawk he hasnt forgotten you only came off two days ago and if i were to mount you tonight hed mount me with both feet think theres any use in asking him queried the boy tossing a backward glance toward cankers tent not unless youre suffering for another snub that man loves to say no as much as any girl i ever asked and he doesnt do it to be coaxed either best leave it alone billy and then the unexpected happened into the tent with quick impetuous step came the commanding officer himself and something had occurred to stir that gentleman to the core his eyes were snapping and his head was high mr gordon said he heres more of this pilfering business and now theyre beginning to find out it isnt all in my camp by a damned sight i want that letter copied at once then with a glance at gray who had whipped off his cap and was standing in respectful attitude he changed his tone from the querulous halftreble of complaint whats this youd best leave alone he suddenly demanded there are a dozen things youd best leave alone and a dozen you would do well to cultivate and study when i was however i never was a lieutenant except in wartime when they amounted to something i got my professional knowledge in front of the enemy not at any damned charity school youre here to ask some new indulgence i suppose want to stay in town over night and fritter away your money and the time the government pays for no sir you cant have my consent you will be back in camp at twelve oclock and stop and report your return to the officeroftheguard so that i may know the hour you come in whos officeroftheguard tonight mr gordon mr brooke sir mr brooke why i thought i told you he was to take those prisoners in town tomorrow he has to testify before that court in the case of sergeant kelly and it saves my sending another officer and having two of our lieutenants away from drill and hanging around the bohemian club detail somebody else all right sir answered gordon imperturbably make any odds sir who is detailed canker had turned to his desk and was tossing over the papers with nervous hand gray impulsively stepped forward his eyes kindling with hope it was on the tip of his tongue to launch into a proffer of his own services for the detail but gordon hastily warned him back with a sweep of the hand and a portentous scowl no ones as bad as the other next thing i know some of em will be letting prisoners escape right under my nose making us the laughing stock of these damned militia volunteers canker entered service in as a private in a city company that was militia to the tip of its spiketailed coats but he had forgotten it i want these young idlers to understand distinctly by george that the first prisoner that gets away from this post takes somebodys commission with him dyou hear that mr gray and canker turned and glared at the bright blue eyes as though he would like to blast their clear fires with the breath of his disapprobation has that young fellow morton been put in irons yet he suddenly asked whirling on gordon again think not sir supplies limited officeroftheday reported half an hour ago every set was in use sent over to division quartermaster and he answered we had a dozen moren we were entitled to now wanted to know f we meant to iron the whole regiment the hell he did raged canker ill settle that in short order my horse there orderly ill be back by four mr gordon fix that detail to suit yourself and so saying the irascible colonel flung himself out of the tent and into his saddle you young idiot said gordon whirling on billy the moment the coast was clear you came within an ace of ruining the whole thing never ask canker for anything unless its what you wish to be rid of tell brooke youre for guard and hes to go to town instead hopping mad as he himself afterward expressed it colonel canker had ridden over to have it out with the quartermaster who had ventured to comment on his methods but the sight of the commanding general standing alone at the entrance to his private tent his pale face grayer than ever and a world of trouble in his eyes compelled canker to stop short two or three orderlies were on the run two aidesdecamp mr garrison and a comrade were searching through desks and boxes their faces grave and concerned the regimental commander was off his horse in a second anything amiss general he asked with soldierly salute the general turned slowly toward him can our men sell letters he said as well as food and forage do people buy such things a most important package has been stolen from my tent chapter vi the great thoroughfare of that wonderful city seated on more than her seven hills and ruling the western world was thronged from curb to curb gay with bunting and streamers the tall buildings of the rival newspapers and the long faзades of hotels and business blocks were gayer still with the life and color and enthusiasm that crowded every window street traffic was blocked cable cars clanged vainly and the police strove valiantly it was a day given up to but one duty and one purpose that of giving godspeed to the soldiery ordered for service in the distant philippines and though they hailed from almost every section of the union except the pacific slope as though they were her own children with all the hope and faith and pride and patriotism with all the blessings and comforts with which she had loaded the foremost ships that sailed yet happily without the tears that flowed when her own gallant regiment was among the first to lead the way san francisco turned out en masse to cheer the men from far beyond the sierras and the rockies and to see them proudly through the golden gate early in the day the guns of a famous light battery had been trundled decked like some rosecovered chariot at the summer festival of flowers through the winding lanes of eager forms and faces the cannoneers almost dragged from the ranks by the clasping hands of men and women who seemed powerless to let go with their little brown carbines tossed jauntily over the broad blue shoulders half a regiment of regular cavalry dismounted had gone trudging down to the docks cheered to the gateway of the pier by thousands of citizens who seemed to envy the very recruits who only halfuniformed and drilled brought up the rear of the column once within the massive wooden portals the guards and sentries holding back the importunate crowd the soldiers flung aside their heavy packs and were marshalled before an array of tempting tables and there feasted comforted and rejoiced under the ministrations of that marvelous successor of the sanitary commission of the great civil war of the sixties the noble order of the red cross there at those tables in the dust and din of the bustling piers in the soot and heat of the railway station in the jam and turmoil at the ferry houses in the fog and chill of the seaward camps in the feverhaunted wards of crowded field hospitals from dawn till dark from dark till dawn toiled week after week devoted women in every grade of life the wife of the millionaire the daughter of the day laborer the gently born the delicately reared the social pets and darlings the humble seamstress no one too high to stoop to aid the departing soldier none too poor or low to deny him cheer and sympathy the war was still young then spain had not lowered her riddled standard and sued for peace two great fleets had been swept from the seas the guns of santiago were silenced and the stronghold of the orient was sulking in the shadow of the flag but there was still soldier work to be done and so long as the nation sent its fighting men through her broad and beautiful gates san francisco and the red cross stood by with eager lavish hands to heap upon the warrior sons of a score of other states even as upon their own every cheer and comfort that wealth could purchase or human sympathy devise it was the one feature of the war days of that will never be forgotten at one of the flowerdecked tables near the great stage that led to the main deck of the transport a group of blithe young matrons and pretty girls had been busily serving fruit coffee bouillon and substantials to the troopers man after man for over two hours there was lively chat and merry war of words going on at the moment between half a dozen young officers who had had their eyes on that particular table ever since the coming of the command and were now making the most of their opportunities before the trumpets should sound the assembly and the word be passed to move aboard all the heavy baggage and ammunition had at last been swung into the hold the guns of the battery had been lowered and securely chocked the forecastle head was thronged with the redtrimmed uniforms of the artillerymen who had already been embarked and were now jealously clamoring that the troopers should be shut off from the further ministrations of the red cross and broadly intimating that it wasnt a fair deal that their rivals should be allowed a whole additional hour of lingering farewells lingering farewells there certainly were many a young soldier and many a lass paired off in little nooks and corners among the stacks of bales and boxes but at the table nearest the staging all seemed gay good humor a merry little woman with strawcolored hair and pert tiptilted nose and much vivacity and complexion had apparently taken the lead in the warfare of chaff and fun evidently she was no stranger to most of the officers almost as evidently to a very close observer who stood a few paces away she was no intimate of the group of women who with good right regarded that table as their especial and personal charge her red cross badge was very new her garb and gloves were just as fresh and spotless she had not been ladling out milk and cream or buttering sandwiches or pinning souvenirs on dusty blue blouses ever since early morning other faces there showed through all their smiles and sweetness the traces of long days of unaccustomed work and short nights of troubled sleep marvelous were mrs frank garrisons recuperative powers thought they who saw her brought home in the primes stylish carriage weak and helpless and shaken after her adventure of the previous day she had not been at the presidio a week and yet she pervaded it she had never thought of such a thing as the red cross until she found it the center of the social firmament after her arrival at san francisco and here she was the last comer the foremost most forward i think some one described it in their circle at one of the most prominent tables absorbing much of the attention most of the glory and none of the fatigue that should have been equally shared by all adios she gayly cried as the assembly rang out loud and clear and waving their hands and raising their caps the officers hastened to join their commands adios till we meet in manila do you really think of going to the philippines mrs garrison queried a much olderlooking yet younger woman why we were told the general said that none of his staff would be allowed to take their wives yet there are others laughed mrs garrison waving a dainty handkerchief toward the troops now breaking into column of twos and slowly climbing the stage who would want to go with that blessed old undertaker goodby bon voyage geordie she cried blowing a kiss to the lieutenant at the head of the second troop a youth who blushed and looked confused at the attention thereby centered upon him and who would fain have shaken his fist rather than waved the one unoccupied hand in perfunctory reply when i go ill choose a ship with a band and broad decks not any such cramped old canal boat as the portland oh i thought perhaps your husband began the lady dubiously but with a significant glance at the silent faces about her who frank garrison heavens i havent known what it was to have a husband since that poor dear boy went on staff duty promptly answered the diminutive center of attraction a merry peal of laughter ringing under the dingy archway of the long long roof why the portland has only one stateroom in it big enough for a bandbox and of course the general has to have that and there isnt a deck where one couple could turn a slow waltz no indeed wait for the next flotilla when our fellows go bands and all then well see but surely mrs garrison we are told the war department has positively forbidden officers wives from going on the transports again began her interrogator a wistful look in her tired eyes i know id give anything to join mr dutton the war department has to take orders quite as often as it gives them mrs dutton the thing is to know how to be of the ordergiving side oh joy she suddenly cried here are the primes and amy lawrence then the regiments must be coming and theres stanley armstrong far up the westward street the distant roar of voices mingled with the swing and rhythm and crash of martial music dock policemen and soldiers on guard began boring a wide lane through the throng of people on the pier a huge black transport ship lay moored along the opposite side to that on which the guns and troopers were embarked and for hours bales boxes and barrels had been swallowed up and stored in her capacious depths until now over against the tables of the red cross there lay behind a rope barrier taut stretched and guarded by a line of sentries an open space close under the side of the greater steamer and between the two landing stages placed fore and aft by this time the north side of the broad pier was littered with the inevitable relics of open air lunching and though busy hands had been at work and the tables had been cleared and fresh white cloths were spread and everything on the tables began again to look fair and inviting the good fairies themselves looked askance at their bestrewn surroundings oh if we could only move everything bodily over to the other side wailed madam president as from her perch on a stack of red cross boxes she surveyed that coveted stretch of clean unhampered flooring and why not chirruped mrs garrison from a similar perch a tier or two higher here are men enough to move mountains all we have to do is to say the word ah but it isnt replied the other gazing wistfully about over the throng of faces as though in search of some one sufficient in rank and authority to serve her purpose we plead in vain with the officeroftheguard he says his orders are imperative to allow no one to intrude on that space and madam looked as though she would rather look anywhere than at the animated sprite above her what nonsense shrilled mrs garrison here cherry she called to a pretty girl standing near the base of the pile give me my bag im army woman enough to know that order referred only to the street crowd that sometimes works in on the pier and steals the bag was duly passed up to her she cast one swift glance over the heads of the crowd to where a handsome carriage was slowly working its way among the groups of prettily dressed women and children friends and relatives of members of the departing commands in whose behalf as though by special dispensation the order excluding all but soldiers and the red cross had been modified already the lovely darkeyed girl on the near side had waved her hand in greeting responding to mrs garrisons enthusiastic signals but her companion equally lovely though of far different type seemed preoccupied perhaps unwilling to see for her large dark thoughtful eyes were engaged with some object on the opposite side not even with the distinguished looking soldier who sat facing her and talking quietly at the moment with mr prime there was a gleam of triumph in mrs garrisons dancing eyes as she took out a flat notebook and pencil and dashed off a few lines in bold and vigorous strokes tearing out the page she rapidly read it over folded it and glanced imperiously about her a cavalry sergeant one of the home troop destined to remain at the presidio was leaning over the edge of the pier hanging on to an iron ring and shouting some parting words to comrades on the upper deck but her shrill soprano cut through the dull roar of deep masculine voices and the tramp of feet on resounding woodwork sergeant she cried with quick decision take this over to the officer in command of that guard then bring a dozen men and move these two tables across the pier the cavalryman glanced at the saucy little woman in the stunning costume took in the gold crossed sabres topped by a regimental number in brilliants that pinned her martial collar at the round white throat noted the ribbon and pin and badge of the red cross and the symbol of the eighth corps in red enamel and gold upon the breast of her jacket and above all the ring of accustomed authority in her tone and never hesitated a second springing to the pile of boxes he grasped the paper respectfully raised his cap and bored his stalwart way across the pier in three minutes he was back half a dozen soldiers at his heels wherell you have em maam miss he asked as the men grasped the supports and raised the nearmost table straight across and well over to the edge she answered in the same crisp tones of command then with total and instant change of manner i suppose your tables should go first madam president she smilingly said it shall be as you wish about the others and the red cross was vanquished i declare said an energetic official a moment later leaning back on her throne of lemon boxes and fanning herself vigorously for a whole hour ive been trying to move that officers heart and convince him the order didnt apply to us now how did she do it the officer must be some old some personal friend hazarded the secretary with a quick feminine comprehensive glance at the little lady now being lifted up to shake hands with the carriage folk after being loaded with compliments and congratulations by the ladies of the two favored tables not at all was the prompt reply he is a volunteer officer she never set eyes on before today i would like to know what was on that paper but now the roar of cheering and the blare of martial music had reached the very gateway the broad portals were thrown open and in blue and brown crushed and squeezed by the attendant throng the head of the column of infantry came striding on to the pier the band wheeling to one side stood at the entrance playing them in the rafters ringing to the stirring strains of the liberty bell they were still far down the long pier the sloping rifles just visible dancing over the heads of the crowd no time was to be lost more tables were to be carried but who but that that little army woman could give the order so that it would be obeyed not one bit did the president like to do it but something had to be done to obtain the necessary order for the soldiers who so willingly and promptly obeyed her beck and call were now edging away for a look at the newcomers and mrs frank garrison perched on the carriage step and chatting most vivaciously with its occupants and no longer concerning herself apparently about the red cross or its tables had the gratification of finding herself approached quite as she had planned by two most prominent and distinguished women of san francisco society and requested to issue instructions as to the moving of the other tables certainly ladies she responded with charming smiles just one minute mildred dont drive farther yet and within that minute half a dozen boys in blue were lugging at the first of the tables still left on the crowded side of the dock and others still were bearing oil stoves urns and trays in less time than it takes to tell it the entire red cross equipage was on its way across the pier and when the commanding officer of the arriving regiment reached the spot which he had planned to occupy with his band his staff and all his officers there in state and ceremony to receive the citizens who came in swarms to bid them farewell he found it occupied by as many as eight snowy goodyladen tables presided over by as many as eighty charming maids and matrons all ready and eager to comfort and revive the inner man of his mighty regiment with coffee and good cheer illimitable and the colonel swore a mighty oath and pounced on his luckless officeroftheguard he had served as a subaltern many a year in the old army and knew how it was done didnt i give you personal and positive orders not to let anything or anybody occupy this space after the baggage was got aboard sir he demanded you did sir said the unabashed lieutenant pulling a folded paper from his belt and the red cross got word to the general and what the red cross says goes look at that the colonel looked read looked dazed scratched his head and said well im damned then he turned to his adjutant you were with me when i saw the general last night and he told me to put this guard on and keep this space clear now what dyou say to that the adjutant glanced over the penciled lines well said he if you spose any order that discriminates against the red cross is going to hold good once they find it out youre bound to get left theyre feasting the first company now sir shall i have it stopped and there was a grin under the young soldiers mustache the colonel paused one moment shook his head and concluded he too would better grin and bear it taking the paper in his hand again he heard his name called and saw smiling faces and beckoning hands in an open carriage near him but the sight of stanley armstrong signalling to him from another farther away had something dominant about it with you in a minute he called to those who first had summoned him what is it armstrong i wish to present you to some friends of mine miss lawrence miss prime mr prime my old associate colonel stewart pardon me mrs garrison i did not see you had returned she had and was once more perched upon the step mrs garrison colonel stewart what we need to know stewart is this will all your men board the ship by this stage or will some go aft all by this stage why but the colonel felt a somewhat massive hand crushing down on his own and forebore to press the question armstrong let no pause ensue he spoke rapidly for him bending forward too and speaking low but even as she chatted and laughed the little woman on the carriage step saw even though she did not seem to look heard even though she did not seem to listen an awkward thing has happened the generals tent was robbed of important papers perhaps two days ago and the guardhouse rid of a most important prisoner last night canker has put the officeroftheguard in arrest remember good old billy gray who commanded us at apache this is billy junior and im awful sorry here the soft gray eyes glanced quickly at the anxious face of miss lawrence who sat silently feigning interest in the chat between the others the anxious look in her eyes increased at armstrongs next words the prisoner must have had friends he is now said to be among your men disguised and those two fellows at the stage are detectives i thought all that space was to be kept clear it was answered stewart yet the chief must have been overpersuaded look here and the colonel held forth a scrap of paper amy lawrence hearing something like the gasp of a sufferer in sudden pain turned quickly and saw that every vestige of color had left mrs garrisons face that she was almost reeling on the step before she could call attention to it armstrong who had taken and glanced curiously at the scrap whirled suddenly and his eyes in stern menace swept the spot where the little lady clung but an instant before as suddenly mrs garrison had sprung from the step and vanished chapter vii billy gray was indeed in close arrest and the grim prophecy was fulfilled colonel canker was proving anything but a guardian angel to him the whole regiment officers and men barring only the commander was practically in mourning with sorrow for him and chagrin over its own discomfiture not only one important prisoner was gone but two not only two but four no man in authority was able to say just when or how it happened for it was cankers own order that the prisoners should not be paraded when the guard fell in at night they were there at tattoo and at taps all secure the officer of the guard said several soldiers had quite a long talk with one of the prisoners young morton just after tattoo at which time the entire guard had been inspected by the commanding officer himself but at reveille four most important prisoners were gone and such was cankers wrath not only was gray in arrest but the sergeant of the guard also while the three luckless men who were successively posted as sentries during the night at the back of the wooden shell that served as a guardhouse were now in close confinement in the place of the escaped quartette yet those three were men who had hitherto been above suspicion and there were few soldiers in the regiment who would accept the theory that any one of the three had connived at the escape as for the sergeant he had served four enlistments in the teenth and without a flaw in his record beyond an occasional aberration in the now distant past due to the potency of the poteen distilled by certain hibernian experts not far from an oldtime plains fort where the regiment had rested on its march cross continent as for the officers but who would suppose an officer guilty of anything of the kind a flagrant military crime and yet men got to asking each other if it were so that bugler curran had carried a note from the prisoner morton to mr gray about that afternoon and what was this about grays having urged brooke to swap tours with him an hour later and what was that story the headquarters clerks were telling about mr grays coming to the adjutant and begging to be allowed to march on that evening instead of brooke it wasnt long before these rumors somehow got to cankers ears and canker seemed to grow as big again he fairly swelled with indignation at thought of such turpitude on part of an officer then he sent for gray it was the afternoon following the sailing of the ships with the big brigade and with pain and bewilderment and indignation in his brave blue eyes the youngster came and stood before his stern superior gordon who sent the message and who had heard cankers denunciatory remarks had found time to scribble a word or two admit nothing say nothing do nothing but hold your tongue and temper if c insists on answers say you decline except in presence of your legal adviser so there was a scene in the commanders tent that afternoon the morning had not been without its joys along about ten oclock as gray sat writing to his father in his little canvas home he heard a voice that sent the blood leaping through his veins and filled his eyes with light springing from his campstool and capsizing it as he did so he poked his curly head from the entrance of the tent and there she was only a dozen feet away major lane in courteous attendance mr prime sadly following and miss prime quite content with the devotions of captain schuyler only a dozen feet away and coming straight to him with frank smiles and sympathy in her kind and winsome face with hand outstretched the moment she caught sight of him we wanted to come when we heard of it yesterday mr gray said amy lawrence but it was dark when we got back from seeing the fleet off and uncle was too tired in the evening indeed we are all very very sorry and poor billy never heard or cared what the others said so absorbed was he in drinking in her gentle words and gazing into her soft dark eyes no wonder he found it difficult to release her hand that brief visit filled with sweetness and sunshine ought to have been a blessing to him all day long but canker caught sight of the damsels as they walked away on the arms of the attendant cavaliers miss lawrence more than once smiling back at the incarcerated billy and canker demanded to be informed who they were and where they had been and gordon answered they were miss lawrence of santa anita and miss prime of new york and he reckoned they must have been in to condole with mr gray whereat canker snarled that people ought to know better than to visit officers in arrest it was tantamount to disrespect to the commander it was marvelous how many things in cankers eyes were disrespectful so he heard these stories with eager ears and sent for gray and thought to bully him into an admission or confession but gordons words had stiffened the little fellow to the extent of braving cankers anger and telling him he had said all he proposed to say when the colonel called him up the previous day the result of that previous interview was his being placed in close arrest and informed that he should be tried by general courtmartial once so he had taken counsel as was his right and counsel forbade his committing himself in any way then you refuse to divulge the contents of that note and to say why you were so eager to go on guard out of your turn said canker oracularly that in itself is sufficient to convince any fairminded court of your guilt sir whereat gordon winked at billy and put his tongue in his cheek and billy stood mute until ordered with much asperity to go back to his tent but there were other things that might well go toward convincing a court of the guilt of lieutenant gray and poor billy contemplated them with sinking heart taking prompt advantage of his position as officer of the guard he had caused the young prisoner to be brought outside the guardhouse and as a heavy dripping fog had come on the wings of the night wind sailing in from the sea he had led the way to the sheltered side which happened to be the darkest one of the rude little building and had there bidden him tell his story but morton glanced uneasily at a sentry who followed close and was hovering suspiciously about i cannot talk about the affair with that fellow spying he said with an eager plea in his tone and a sign of the hand that gray well knew and quickly recognized keep around in front ill be responsible for this prisoner were his orders and almost reluctantly the man left he was a veteran soldier and his manner impressed the lieutenant with a vague sense of trouble twice the sentry glanced back and hesitated as though something were on his mind that he must tell but finally he disappeared and kept out of the way during the brief interview that immediately followed the prisoner eagerly excitedly began his explanation swiftly banishing any lingering doubts gray might have entertained as to his innocence but he had come from a stoveheated guardroom into the cold sea wind off the pacific into the floating wisps of vapor that sent chill to the marrow he was far too lightly clad for that climate and presently he began to shiver you are cold said gray pityingly have you no overcoat its at my tent i never expected to spend this night here ive been before the summary court fined for absence and thought that would end it but instead of that im a prisoner and the man who should be here is stalking about camp planning more robberies yet id rather associate with the very worst of the deserters or dead beats inside there and the dark eyes glanced almost in horror the slender figure shook with mingled repulsion and chill than with that smoothtongued sneak and liar theres no crime too mean for him to commit mr gray and the men are beginning to know it though the colonel wont for gods sake get me out of this before morning and again the violent tremor shook the lad from head to foot here get inside said gray impulsively ill see the adjutant at once and return to you in a few minutes if you have to remain until the matter can be investigated by the general it might be it would be vehemently interrupted morton then breaking off short as though at loss for descriptive of sufficient strength he seemed to swell with passion as he clinched his fists and fairly stood upon his toes an instant his strong white teeth grinding together it would be simply hell he burst in again hoarse and quivering it would ruin everything cant the general give the order tonight he asked with intense eagerness while the young officer taking him by the arm had led him again to the light of the guardhouse lamps at the front the sergeant and a group of soldiers straightened up and faced them listening curiously it may be even impossible to see the general answered gray doubtfully take morton into the guardroom till i get back sergeant and let him warm himself thoroughly dont put him with the prisoners till i return and so saying he had hastened away gordon his friend and adviser had left camp and gone visiting over in the other division the lights at general headquarters were turned low even now after having heard proofs of the innocence of the accused soldier gray knew that it was useless to appeal to the colonel he could not understand however the feverish almost insane impatience of the lad for immediate release another day ought not to make so great a difference what could be the reason if it were not that though innocent of the robbery of the storehouse or of complicity in the sale of stolen goods some other crime lay at his door which the morrow might disclose all the loyalty of a delta sig was stretched to the snapping point as gray paused irresolute in front of the adjutants tent his quest there unsuccessful the sergeantmajor and a sorely badgered clerk were working late over some regimental papers things that morton wrote out easily and accurately i suppose sir its no use asking to have the prisoner sent up here under guard said that jewel of a noncommissioned officer yet the colonel will be savage if these papers aint ready it will take us all night as things are going gray shook his curly head go ask if you like but mortons in no shape to help you has he been drinking sir said the sergeantmajor in surprise i never knew him oh it isnt that said gray hastily only hes hes got other matters on his mind bring me his overcoat he said it was in his tent and the young officer jerked his head at the patch of little a tents lined up in the rear of those of the officers get mortons overcoat and take it to him at the guardhouse snapped the staff sergeant to the clerk be spry now and no stopping on the way back he added well aware how much in need his assistant stood of creature comfort of some surreptitious and forbidden kind the man was back in a moment the coat rolled on his arm ill take it said gray simply you neednt come go on with it ordered the sergeant as the soldier hesitated dye think the service has gone to the devil and officers are runnin errands for enlisted men an get back inside two minutes too he added with portent in his tone the subaltern of hardly two months service felt the implied rebuke of the soldier of over twenty years and meekly accepted the amendment but a thought occurred to him he had promised morton paper envelopes and stamps and the days newspapers the lad seemed strangely eager to get all the latter and vaguely billy remembered having heard that canker considered giving papers to prisoners as equivalent to aid and comfort to the enemy take it by way of my tent said he as they started and once there it took time to find things go back to the sergeantmajor and tell him i sent you said gray after another search he needs you on those papers and when the officer of the guard returned to the guardhouse and went in to the prisoner the sergeant saw and others saw that rolled in the soldiers overcoat he carried on his arm was a bundle done up in newspaper moreover a scrap of conversation was overheard theres no one at the generals said the officer i see no way of fixing it before morning my god lieutenant there must be some way out of it the morning will be too late then ill do what i can for you tonight said mr gray as he turned and hurriedly left the guardroom a dozen men standing stiffly about the walls and doorway and staring with impassive faces straight to the front again the young officer had left the post of the guard and gone up into camp while far and near through the dim fogswept aisles of a score of camps the bugles and trumpets were wailing the signal for lights out and shadowy forms with coat collars turned up about the ears or capes muffled around the neck scurried about the company streets ordering laughter and talk to cease a covered carriage was standing at the curb outside the officers gate as a certain hole in the fence was designated and the sentry there posted remembered that the officer of the guard came hurrying out and asked the driver if he was engaged im waiting for the major was the answer well where can one order a carriage tonight without going clear to town inquired gray i want one that is i wish to order one at once and the driver who knew very well there were several places where carriages could be had preferred loyalty to his own particular stable away in town and so declared there was none you can telephone there if you wish sir he added and wait till morning for it to get here no ill get it somehow and that he did get it somehow was current rumor on the following day for the sentries on the guardhouse side of camp swore that a closed carriage drove down from mcallister street for all the world as though it had just come out of the park and rolled on past the back of the guardhouse the driver loudly whistling killarney so that it could be heard above the crunching of the wheels through the rough loose rock that covered the road and that carriage drew up not a hundred yards away while the lieutenant was out visiting sentries and presently they saw him coming back along the walk stopping to question each sentry as to his orders then he returned and inquired if all was quiet among the prisoners and then went and put out his light in the tent reserved for the officer of the guard and once more left his post briefly informing the sergeant of the guard he was going to the officer of the day then it was ascertained that he had visited half a dozen places in search of that veteran captain and appeared much disturbed because he could not find him in half an hour he was back asking excitedly of the sentry in rear of the guardhouse if a carriage had come that way it had said the sentry and was waiting down the street gray hurried in the direction indicated was gone perhaps three minutes and returned saying that the sentry must be mistaken that no carriage was there but the sentry reiterated his statement that it had been there and had been waiting for some time and must have disappeared while he was temporarily around at the opposite side of the building this was about pm then when gray appeared at reveille morton had disappeared its not the sergeant let them fellers out said the regimental oracles this is no tendollar subscription business and so until late in the afternoon the question that agitated the entire range of regimental camps was how did those fellows break away from the prison of the teenth then came a clue and then discovery by order of lieutenantcolonel canker a board of officers had been convened to investigate the matter and after questioning everybody whom squeers had already badgered with his assertions threats and queries they went to the guardhouse and began a thorough inspection of the premises the wooden building stood in the midst of a waste of sand blown in from the shore line by the strong sea wind it was perched on something like a dozen stout posts driven into the soft soil and then the space between the floor level and the sand was heavily and stoutly boarded in thick planks being used between the floor and the sand was a space of about eighteen inches vertical and a dozen men could have sprawled therein lying at full length but to escape would have required the connivance of one or more of the sentries surrounding the building and the ripping off of one or more of the planks in his keen anxiety canker accompanied the board on its tour of investigation a thing the board did not at all like and presently as was his wont began running things his own way it had been found useless to question the soldiers of the guard not a man could be found to admit he knew the faintest thing about the escape as for the prisoners most of them reckless devilmaycare rascals they grinned or leered suggestively but had nothing to tell well have this boarding ripped off said canker decisively and see what theyve got secreted under there i shouldnt be surprised to find a whisky still in full blast or a complete gambling outfit dash dash em to dash and dashnation send for a carpenter sergeant the carpenter came and he and two or three of the guard laid hold of one end of the plank after its nails were drawn and with little exertion ripped it off the other posts then everybody held his breath a minute stared and a small majority swore so far from its being open to cats cans and rubbish the space on that side was filled solid with damp heavy sea sand a vertical wall extending from floor to ground canker almost ran around to the opposite side and had a big plank torn off there within was a wall as damp solid and straight as that first discovered and so when examined were the other two sides provided cankers face was a study and the board gazed and was profoundly happy at last the colonel exploded by jupiter they havent got away at all then there isnt a flaw in the sand wall anywhere they must be hiding about the middle now come on gentlemen and around he trotted to the front door sergeant he cried get out all the prisoners all their bedding every blessed thing theyve got i want to examine that floor most of the guardhouse birds were out chopping wood and canker danced in among the few remaining loading them with bedding belonging to their fellows until every item of clothing and furniture was shoved out of the room one member of the board and one only failed to enter with his associates a veteran captain who read much war literature and abhorred canker to the surprise of the sentry he walked deliberately over to the fence climbed it and presently began poking about the wooden curb that ran along the road making a low revetment or retaining wall for the earth cinders and gravel that distributed over the sand had been hopefully designated a sidewalk by the owners of the tract presently he came sauntering back and both sentries within easy range would have sworn he was chuckling canker greeted him with customary asperity what do you mean sir by absenting yourself from this investigation when you must have known i was with the board and giving it the benefit of the information i had gathered i was merely expediting matters colonel while you were looking for where they went in i was finding where they got out went in what got out of what snapped canker their tunnel sir its libby on a small scale over again they must have been at work at it at least ten days and as he spoke calmly ignoring canker and letting his eyes wander over the floor the veteran battalion commander sauntered across the room stirred up a slightly projecting bit of flooring with the toe of his boot and placidly continued if youll be good enough to let the men pry this up you may understand and when pried up and lifted away a snugly fitting trapdoor about two feet square there yawned beneath it leading slantwise downward in the direction of the street a tunnel through the soft yielding sand braced and strengthened here and there with lids and sides of crackerboxes now if you dont mind straddling a fence sir ill show you the other end said the captain imperturbably leading the way and canker halfdazed yet wholly in command of his stock of blasphemy followed at the curb right in the midst of a lot of loose hay from the bales dumped there three days before the leader dislodged with his sword the top of a clothing box that had been thickly covered with sand and hay and there was the outlet easy as rolling off a log colonel said old cobb with a sarcastic grin this could all be done without a man youve blamed and arrested being a whit the wiser they sawed a panel out of the floor scooped the sand out of this tunnel banked it solid against the weather boarding inside filled up the whole space pretty near but ran their tunnel under fence and sidewalk crawled down the gutter to the next block out of sight of the sentries then walked away free men those three thieves who got away were old hands the other men in the guardhouse were only mild offenders except morton course he was glad of the chance to go with em i spose youll release my sergeant and those sentries now ill do nothing of the kind answered canker red with wrath and your suggestion is disrespectful to your commanding officer when i want your advice ill ask for it well mr gray will be relieved to learn of this anyhow i suppose i may tell him hazarded the junior member mischievously mr gray be mr gray has everything to answer for shouted the angered colonel it was he who telephoned for a carriage to meet and run those rascals off mr grays fate is sealed he can thank god i dont slap him into the guardhouse with his chosen associates but he shant escape sergeant of the guard post a sentry over lieutenant grays tent with orders to allow no one to enter or leave it without my written authority mr gray shall pay for this behind the prison bars of alcatraz chapter viii social circles at west point at long rare intervals are shocked by a scandal and at short ones say every other summer are stirred by some kind of a sensation and the fairy sisters were the sensation of the year they came in july they went in september and meanwhile they were on the go as they expressed it from morn till late at night physically they were the lightest weights known to the hop room mentally as their admirers in the corps expressed it either of them can take a fall out of any woman at the point and this was especially true of the elder mrs frank garrison whose husband was on staff duty in the far west both were slight fragile tiny blondes with light blue eyes with lighter fluffy hair with exquisite little hands and feet with oval prettily shaped faces and the younger the maiden sister had a bewitching mouth and regular snowy dots of teeth of which she was justly proud yet as has been previously said of mrs frank while the general effect was in the case of each that of an extremely pretty young girl the elder had no really good features the younger only that one they generally dressed very much alike in light flimsy gowns and hats gloves and summer shoes all of dazzling white sometimes verging for a change to a creamy hue but colors except for sashes or summer shawls seemed banished from their wardrobes they danced divinely said the corps and preferred cadet partners to the joy of the battalion they rode fearlessly and well and had stunning hats and habits but few opportunities for display thereof they came tripping down the path from the hotel every morning fresh and fair as daisies in time for guard mounting and at any hour after that could be found chatting with cadet friends at the visitors tent strolling arm in arm about the shaded walks with some of their many admirers until time to dress for the evening hop where they never missed a dance and on rainy days or on those evenings when there was neither hop nor band practice they could be found each in some dimly lighted secluded nook about the north or west piazza or on the steps leading down to the chain battery walk sometimes surrounded by a squad of cadet friends but more frequently in murmured tкteаtкte with only one cavalier in the case of mrs frank no member of the corps seemed especially favored she was just the same to every one in the case of her younger sister miss terriss there presently developed a dashing young cadet captain who so scientifically conducted his campaign that he headed off almost all competitors and was presently accorded the lead under the universally accepted theory that he had won the little ladys heart observant women and what women are not observant of each other declared both sisters to be desperate flirts society at the point frowned upon them and after the first formal call or two dropped them entirely a thing they never seemed to resent in the least or even to notice they were never invited out to tea or dinner on the post solemn functions nowhere near so palatable as the whispered homage of stalwart young manhood nita is yet such a child she infinitely prefers cadet society and i always did like boys explained mrs garrison some rather gay old boys used to run up saturday afternoons on the mary powell and spend sunday at the point wall street men of fifty years and much lucre dear old friends of fathers mrs frank used to say and ive simply got to entertain them entertained they certainly were for her wit and vivacity were acknowledged on every side and entertained not only collectively but severally for she always managed to give each his hours confidential chat and on the sundays of their coming had no time to spare for cadet friends moreover she always drove down in the big bus with them monday morning when the powell was sighted coming along that glorious reach from polopels island and stood at the edge of the wharf waving her tiny kerchief even blowing fairy kisses to them as they steamed away no wonder nita terriss was frivolous and flirtatious with such an example said society and its frowns grew blacker when the white sisters the fairy sisters the sylphites came in view but frowns and fulminations both fell harmless from the armor of mrs franks gay insouзiance nita winced at first but soon rallied and bore the slights of the permanent and semipermanent residents as laughingly as did her more experienced sister nita it was explained was only just out of school and mrs frank was giving her this summer at the point as a great treat before taking her to the far west where the elder sister must soon go to join her husband everybody knew frank garrison he had long been stationed at the academy and was a man universally liked and respected even very highly regarded all of a sudden the news came back to the point a few months after his return to his regiment that he was actually engaged to witchie terriss hot on the heels of the rumor came the wedding cards lieutenantcolonel and mrs terriss requested the honour of your presence at the marriage of their daughter margaret to lieutenant francis key garrison th u s cavalry at the post chapel fort riley kansas november all in tiffanys best style as were the cards which accompanied the invitation what a good thing for old bill terriss said everybody who knew that his impecuniosity was due to the exactions and extravagancies of his wife and witchie and what a bad thing for frank garrison was the echo his intimates knew that he had put by through economy and selfdenial about two thousand dollars the extent of his fortune outside of his pay shell make ducks and drakes of it in the six weeks honeymoon was the confident prophecy and she probably did for despite the fact that he had so recently rejoined the regiment witchie insisted on a midwinter run to new orleans savannah and washington and bore her lord but not her master over the course in triumph to a student of human nature and frailty that union of a faded and somewhat shopworn maid of twentyseven to an ardent and vigorous young soldier many moons her junior was easy to account for one after another witchie terriss had had desperate affairs with half a dozen fellows older or younger in the army and was known to have been engaged to five different men at different times and believed to have been engaged to two different men at one time asked as to this by one of her chums she was reported to have replied do you know i believe it true i had totally forgotten about ned colston before mr forman had been at the post a week of course the only thing to do was to break with both and let them start fresh but this mr colston whose head had been somewhat cleared by a month of breezy healthful scouting accepted only in part that part which included the break forman had the fresh start and a walk over and held the trophy just two months when it dawned upon him that margaret loved dancing far more than she did him a clumsy performer and that she would dance night after night the lightest daintiest creature in the hop room and never have a word or a look for him who leaned in gloomy admiration against the wall and never took his eyes off her he became jealous moody uglytempered and finally had the good luck to get his congй as the result of an attempt to assert himself and limit her dances she was blithe and radiant and fancy free when frank garrison reached the post a wee bit hipped it was whispered because of the failure of a somewhat halfhearted suit of his in the far east and the fairy bounded into the darkness of his life and fairly dazzled him somebody had said frank garrison had money there is no need to tell of the disillusion that gradually came frank found his debts mounting up and his cares increasing she was all sympathy and regret when he mentioned it but there were certain comforts luxuries and things she had always been accustomed to and couldnt live without surely he would not have her apply to papa no but could she not manage with a little less he was willing to give up his cigars indeed he had long since done so and to make his uniforms last a year longer he who was in his day the most carefully dressed man at the point well she thought perhaps he ought to do that besides mens fashions changed but slowly whereas womens well id rather be dead than out of style frank and so it went but if she did not love her husband there was one being in whom her frivolous heart was really bound up nita her baby sister as she called her and when terriss the colonel went the way of all flesh preceded only a few months by the wife of his bosom the few thousands in life insurance he had managed to maintain went to the two daughters not one penny was ever laid out in payment of the debts of either the father or husband nita was sent to an extravagant finishing school in gotham and along in may of the young girls graduating year blithe little mrs garrison arrived fresh from the far west and after a few weeks of sightseeing and shopping the sisters appeared at the point even halfmourning by this time discarded thirteen years difference was there in the ages of the fairy sisters and not a soul save those who knew them in former days on the frontier would have suspected it mrs frank in evening dress didnt look over twenty one lovely evening early in august just about the time that cadet captain latrobe began to show well to the front in the run for the prize the two sisters had gone to their room at the hotel to dress for the hop it was their custom to disappear from public gaze about six oclock and when they came floating down the stairs in filmy diaphanous clouds of white the halls were well filled with impatient cavaliers in the natty cadet uniform and with women waiting to see then the sisters would go into the dining room and have some light refreshment with a glass of iced tea and no matter how torrid the heat or how flushed and dragged other women might look they were inviting pictures of all that was ever fresh cool and fragrant the two fluffy blonde heads would be huddled close together a minute as they studied the bill of fare and virtuous matrons at other tables fanning vigorously would sniff and say all for effect they know that supper bill by heart it never changes all the same at the bottom of this public display of sisterly devotion and harmony and in spite of occasional tiffs and differences there was genuine affection on both sides for as a child nita had adored margaret and there could be no doubting the elders love for the child some regimental observers said that every bit of heart that eldest terriss girl had was wrapped up in the little one neither girl even after margarets marriage would listen to a word in disparagement of the other but in the sanctity of the sisterly retreat on the third floor of the old hotel there occurred sometimes spirited verbal tilts that were quite distinctly audible to passersby in the corridor provided they cared to listen which some of them did on this especial august evening mrs frank was in an admonitory frame of mind they had known mr latrobe barely three weeks and yet as mrs frank was sauntering around a turn in flirtation walk leaning on the arm of the cadet adjutant there in the pathway right ahead stood nita a lovely little picture with downcast eyes and pat latrobe bending over her with love and passion glowing in his handsome face pleading eagerly clinging fervently to both her tiny whitegloved hands mrs garrison saw it all in the flash of a second the adjutant not at all for with merry laughter she repeated some words he had just spoken as though they were about the wittiest funniest things in the world and looked frankly up into his eyes as though he were the best and brightest man she had met in years so his eyes were riveted and the tableau had time to dissolve all the same that sight gave mrs garrison rather more than a bad quarter of an hour she was infinitely worried not because pat latrobe had fallen desperately in love with her charming little sister that was his lookout but what oh what might not happen if the charming little sister were to fall in love with that handsome soldier boy at all hazards even if she had to whisk her away tomorrow that had to be stopped and this very evening when they went to their room margaret spoke nita if it were only for mr latrobe i should not care a snap of my finger but its you you i thought you had more sense i thought you fully understood that you couldnt afford to lose yourself a moment and yet if ever a girl looked like yielding you did this very afternoon for my sake for your own sake nita dont let it go any further dont fall in love here whatever you do the younger sister stood at the dressing table at the moment her face averted the mary powell was just rounding the point and the mellow melodious notes of her bell were still echoing through the highlands nita was gazing out on the gorgeous effect of sunset light and shadow on the eastern cliffs and crags across the hudson a flush as vivid mantling her cheeks her lip quivering she was making valiant efforts to control herself before replying im not in love with him she finally said perhaps not yet surely i hope not but it looked awfully like it was coming and nita you simply mustnt youve got to marry money if i have to stand guard over you and see you do it and you know you can this minute if youll only listen the younger girl wheeled sharply her eyes flashing peggy you promised me i shouldnt hear that hateful thing again at least not until we left here and youve broken your word twice you its because i must i cant see you drifting the way i did when with your youth and advantages you can pick and choose colonel frost has mines and money all over the west and he was your shadow at the seashore and all broken up he told me so when we came here paddy latrobe is a beautiful boy without a penny his uncle began nita feebly his uncle had a sister to support besides paddys mother his pay as brigadier in the regular service is only fiftyfive hundred he cant have saved much of anything in the past and he may last a dozen years yet or more even if he does leave everything then to latrobe whatll you do meantime dont be a fool nita because i was i had to be it was that or nothing and father was getting tired you heard how he talked the younger sister was still at the dressingtable diligently brushing her shining curly tresses she had regained her composure and was taking occasional furtive peeps at mrs frank now seated at the foot of the bed busy with a buttonhook and the adjustment of a pair of very dainty boots of white kid whose buttons gleamed like pearls the mates to them half a size smaller peeped from the tray of nitas new trunk there came a footstep and a rap at the door see what it is nita theres a love i dont want to hop it was a card a new arrival at the hotel gentleman said hed wait in the parlor m said the bellboy and vanished nita glanced at the card and instant trouble stood in her paling face silently mrs garrison held out her hand took the card and one quick look the buttonhook dropped from her relaxed fingers the card read mr gouverneur prime for a second or two the sisters gazed at each other in silence at last the elder spoke in heavens name what brings that absurd boy back here i thought him safe in europe chapter ix one of the most charming writers of our day and generation has declared that the truest blessing a girl can have is the ingenuous devotion of a young boys heart nine mothers in ten will probably take issue with the gifted author on that point and though no longer a young girl in years whatever she might be in looks margaret garrison would gladly have sent the waiting gentlemen to the right about for though he was only twenty gov prime as a junior at columbia had been ingenuously devoted to the little lady from the very first evening he saw her a boy of frank impulsive nature was gov a boy still in spite of the budding mustache the twenty summers and the barely passed exam that wound up the junior year and entitled him to sit with the seniors when the great university opened its doors in october studies he hated but tennis polo cricket riding and dancing were things he loved and excelled in much of his boyhood had been spent at one of those healthy hearty english schools where all that would cultivate physical and mental manhood was assiduously practiced and all that would militate against them was as rigorously tabooed at the coming of his twentieth birthday that summer his father had handed him his check for five thousand dollars the paternal expression of satisfaction that his boy had never smoked pipe cigar or cigarette and the same week gov had carried off the blue ribbon with the racquet and the second prize with the single sculls it was during the exams the first week in june when dropping in for five oclock tea on some girls whom he had known for years he was presented to this witching little creature whose name he didnt even catch we met her away out at an army post in wyoming when papa took us to california last year was whispered to him and they entertained us so cordially and of course we said if ever you come to new york you must be sure to let us know and she did but and there his informant paused dubious other callers came in and it began to rain a sudden drenching shower and the little stranger from the far west saw plainly enough that her hostesses though presenting their friends after our cheery american fashion were unable to show her further attention and the newly presented almost all women said so very pleased but failed to look it or otherwise to manifest their pleasure she couldnt go in the rain the butler had phoned for a cab she wouldnt sit there alone and neglected she deliberately signaled mr prime the ladies are all busy she said with a charmingly appealing smile but i know you can tell me i have to dress for dinner after i get home and must be at one hundred and tenth street at how long will it take a carriage to drive me there oh is that your society pin why are you still in college why i thought that cab was twentyfive minutes coming and when it came mr prime went with it and her whom he had not left an instant from the moment of her question moreover he discovered she was nervous about taking that carriage drive all alone away up to one hundred and tenth street yet what other way could a girl go in dinner dress he left her at her door with a reluctantly given permission to return in an hour and escort her to the distant home of her friends and entertainers he drove to the waldorf and had a light dinner with a half pint of hock devoured her with his eyes as they drove rapidly northward went to a harlem theater while she dined and forgot him and was at the carriage door when she came forth to be driven home seven hours or less had done the business so far as gouverneur prime was concerned it was the boys first wild infatuation as mad unreasoning absurd yet intense as was ever that of arthur pendennis for the lovely fotheringay margaret garrison had never seen or known the like of it she had fascinated others for a time had kindled love passion and temporary devotion but this this was worship and it was something so sweet to her jaded senses something so rich and spontaneous that she gave herself up for a day or two to the delight of studying it here was a glorious young athlete whose eyes followed her every move and gesture who hung about her in utter captivation whose voice trembled and whose eyes implored yet whose strong brown shapely hand never dared so much as touch hers except when she extended it in greeting he was to accompany his father and sister to europe in a week so what harm was there he would forget all about it he knew now she was married he was presented to nita but had hardly a word and never a look for her when margaret was near he was dumb and miserable all the day they drove in the park and later dined at delmonicos with colonel frost he was sick even when mounted on his favorite english thoroughbred and scampering about the bridle path for peeps at the drives when she was at the park again with that grayhaired reprobate that money shark cashton a wall street broker blackballed at every decent club in new york why should she go with him he had been most kind she said in the advice and aid he had given her in the investment of her little fortune she told the lie with downcast eyes and cheeks that burned for most of that little fortune was already frittered away and cashtons reports seemed to require many personal visits that had set tongues wagging at the hotel so much frequented of the army where she had taken a room until nita should have been graduated and they could go to the seashore she had promised to be at home to her boy adorer that very evening and to go with him to dalys and he had secured the seats four days ahead poor gov had trotted swiftly home from the park striving to comfort himself over his bath and irreproachable evening clothes that there with her by his side the wild jealousy of the day would vanish sharply on time he had sent up his card and listened incredulous to the reply mrs garrison has not yet returned he would wait he said and did wait biting his nails treading the floor fuming in doubt and despair until nearly ten when a carriage dashed up to the ladies entrance and that vile cashton handed her out escorted her in and vanished she came hurrying to her boy lover with both little hands outstretched with a face deeply flushed and words of pleading and distress rushing from her lips indeed i could not help it gov she cried i told him of my engagement and said we must not go so far but away at the north end something happened i dont know what a wheel was bent and the harness wrenched by too short a turn on a stone post at a corner something had to be repaired they said it wouldnt take ten minutes and he led me out and up to the piazza of that big hotel you know we saw it the day i drove with you he was a blackguard to take you there burst in prime the blood boiling in his veins then we waited and waited and he went to hurry them and then he came back and said they had found more serious damages that it would take an hour and meantime dinner had been ordered and was served he had telephoned to you and the butler had answered all right hes a doubledyed liar raved gov furiously and so what could i do gov the dinner was delicious but i couldnt eat a mouthful this time it wasnt cashton who lied i was worrying about you and and about myself too gov i had set my heart on going with you it was to be almost our last evening oh if you only didnt have to sail saturday and could be here next week you dear boy you should have no cause for complaint wont you try to forgive me and actually tears stood in her eyes as again she held out both hands they were the only people in the parlor and in an instant with quick sudden irresistible action he had clasped and drawn her to his breast and though she hid her face and struggled passionate kisses were printed on her disheveled hair it was the first time he had dared and then he did not sail saturday prime senior was held by most important business they gave up the saturday cunarder and took the midweek white star and those four additional days riveted poor govs chains and left her wellnigh breathless with excitement the strain had been intense it was all she could do to make the boy try to behave in a rational way in the presence of others when alone with her he raved a fearful load was lifted from her spare little shoulders when the teutonic sailed even nita had worried and had seen her sisters worry then no sooner did gov reach europe than he began writing impassioned letters by every steamer but that wasnt so bad she had several masculine correspondents some of whom wrote as often as frank but none of whom to do her justice got letters as often as he did which however was saying little for she hated writing gov was to have stayed abroad three months piloting the pater and sister about the scenes so familiar to him but they saw how nervous and unhappy he was they knew he was writing constantly to some one mildred had long since divined that there was a girl at the bottom of it all and longed and strove to find out who she was through the last of june and all through july he resolutely stood to his promise and did his best to be loving and brotherly to a loving and devoted sister and dutiful to a most indulgent father but he grew white and worn and haggard he who had been such a picture of rugged health and in her utter innocence and ignorance as to the being on whom her brother had lavished the wealth of his love mildred began to ask herself should she not urge her father to let gov return to america at last one sweet july evening late in the month the brother and sister were wandering along the lovely shore of lucerne he had been unusually fitful restless and moody all day no letter had reached him in over a fortnight and he was miserably unhappy they stopped at a grassy bank that ran down to the rippling waters edge and she seated herself on a stone ledge while in reckless abandonment he threw himself full length on the dewy grass instantly the last doubt vanished bending over him her soft hand caressing his hair she whispered gov dear boy is it so very hard would you like to go to her at once and the boy buried his face in her lap twined his arms about her slender waist and almost groaned aloud as he answered for pitys sake help me if you can mildred im almost mad early in august the swiftest steamer of the line was splitting the atlantic surges and driving hard for home with gov cursing her for a canal boat the day after he reached new york he had traced and followed the white sisters to west point and margaret garrison stared in mingled delight triumph and dismay at the card in her hand delight that she could show these exclusive pointers that the heir to one of the oldest and best names in gothams four hundred was a slave to her beck and call dismay to think of the scene that might occur through his jealousy when he saw the devoted attentions she received from so many men officers civilians and cadets old cashton came up now as regularly as saturday night came around and there were others margaret garrison was more talked about than any woman in orange county yet who could report anything of her beyond that she was a universal favorite and danced walked possibly flirted with a dozen different cavaliers every day of her life there were some few among her accusers demure and most proper even prudish women of whom were the truth to be told so little could not be said gov prime took the only kind of room to be had in the house so full was it a little seven by ten box on the office floor he would have slept in the coal bin rather than leave her he saw her go off to the hop looking radiant glancing back over her shoulder and smiling sweetly at him he rushed to his trunk dragged out his evening clothes and stood at the wall looking on until the last note of the last dance he a noted german leader in the younger set and the best dancer of his years in gotham not so much as a single spin had he and he longed to show those tightwaisted buttonbestrewed fellows in gray and white how little they really knew about dancing well as many of them appeared on the floor his reward was tendered as the hop broke up she came gliding to him with such witchery in her upraised face now sir it is your turn i couldnt give you a dance for my card was made out days ago but mr latrobe was glad enough to get rid of taking me home he is daft about nita and of course she cant let him take her to more than one hop a week mr stanton is her escort tonight then she placed her little hand on his arm and drew herself to his side and when he would have followed the others going straight across the broad plain to the lights at the hotel turned him to the left im going to take you all the way round sir she said joyously then we can be by ourselves at least ten minutes longer and so began the second period of gouverneur primes thralldom a young civilian at the point has few opportunities at any time but when the lady of his love is a belle in the corps he would much better take a long ocean voyage than be where he could hear and see and live in daily torment one comfort came to him when he could not be with mrs garrison who naпvely explained that gov was such a dear boy and they were such stanch friends real comrades you know he had early made the acquaintance of pat latrobe and there was a bond of sympathy between them which was none the less strong because on primes side it could neither be admitted nor alluded to that they were desperately in love with the sisters and it was not long before it began to dawn on prime that pretty little nita was playing a double game that even while assuring her guardian sister that she had only a mild interest in latrobe she was really losing or had lost her heart to him and in every way in her power was striving to conceal the fact from margaret and yet meet her lover at hours when she thought it possible to do so without discovery as the friendship strengthened between himself and latrobe they began using him as cupids postman and many little notes and some big ones found their way to and from the fourth division of cadet barracks mrs frank was only moderately kind to her civilian adorer then granting him only one dance at each hop and going much with other men but that dance was worth seeing primes was the only black clawhammer in the room and therefore conspicuous and cadets who know a good thing when they see it and many a pretty girl partner would draw aside to watch the perfection of their step and the exquisite ease with which they seemed to float through space circling and reversing and winding among the other dancers he ever alert watchful quick as a cat and lithe and strong as a panther she all yielding lissome airy grace that dance was gov primes reward and almost only reward for hours of impatient waiting other women charming and pretty and better women would gladly have been his partners some two or three whom he met at the hotel even intimated as much but not until lady garrison told him he must to protect her from scandal did he ask another to dance at last came the end of the summers encampment the return of the corps to barracks and studies one blissful week in which he was enabled to spend several uninterrupted hours each day at her side and then a cataclysm a letter intended only for nitas hands fell into those of her sister it was bulky it was from latrobe she hesitated only a moment then with determination in her eyes opened and read all two days after nita was whisked away to new york and within another week leaving two most disconsolate swains on the hudson the sisters one of them bathed in tears went spinning away to the west where frank garrison was on duty at department headquarters prime was permitted to write once a fortnight he sent a volume and latrobe forbidden but already the poor boy owned a thick packet of precious missives all breathing fond love and promising utter constancy though she had to wait for him for years for a month nita would hardly speak to her sister but in october there were lovely drives picnics and gayeties of all kinds there were attractive young officers and assiduous old ones and among these latter was frost with his handsome gray mustache and distinguished bearing and that air of conscious success and possession which some men know so well how to assume even when their chances are slimmer than my ladys hand the sisterly breach was healed before that beautiful month was over frost dined at the garrisons four times a week and drove miss nita behind his handsome bays every day or two in november he asked a question in december there was an announcement that called forth a score of congratulations around headquarters and in january the wedding cards went all over the union some to west point but to latrobe who had been looking ill and anxious for six weeks said his classmates and falling off fearfully in his studies said his professors only a brief note inclosing his letters and begging for hers at reveille next morning there was no captain to receive the report of roll call from the first sergeant of company b wheres latrobe sleepily asked the officer of the day of the cadet first lieutenant i don know was the answer and to the amaze of latrobes roommate who had gone to bed and to sleep right after taps the night before they found evidence that pat had left the post he had not even made down his bedding his cadet uniforms were all there but a suit of civilian clothes usually in a snug package up the chimney that had been used several times running it to the hotel after taps in august was now like its owner missing after three days waiting and fruitless search the superintendent wired latrobes uncle and best friend old general drayton and that was the last seen or heard of pat in the spring and ahead of time his class was graduated without him for the war with spain was on in the spring an irate and longtried father was upbraiding another only son for persistent failures at college gov prime will get the sack not the sheepskin prophesied his fellows and then somehow somewhere the father heard it was a married woman with whom his boy was so deeply in love and there were bitter bitter words on both sides so bitter that when at last he flung himself out of his fathers study gov prime went straight to mildreds room silently kissed her and walked out of the house this was in april the next heard of him he had enlisted for the war and was gone to san francisco with his regiment with the prospect of service in the philippines ahead of him but that was full four months after his disappearance thither late in july the father followed bringing mildred with him and the reader knows the rest chapter x one of colonel frosts consuming ambitions was to be the head of his department with the rank of brigadiergeneral but he had strong rivals and knew it wealth he had in abundance it was rank and power that he craved four men all with better war records and more experience stood between him and that coveted star and two of the four were popular and beloved men frost was cold selfish intensely selfwilled indomitably persevering and though closefisted to the scale of a scotch landlord as a rule he would loose his purse strings and pay well for services he considered essential when frost had a consuming desire he let no money consideration stand in the way and for nita terriss he stood ready to spend a small fortune everybody knew mrs frank garrison could never dress and adorn herself as she did on poor frank garrisons pay and when she appeared with a dazzling necklace and a superb new gown at the garrison ball not long after frost and his shrinking bride left for their honeymoon people looked at her and then at each other nita terris was sold to jack frost was the verdict and her shrewd elder sister was the dealer mrs frank knew what people were thinking and saying just as well as though they had said it to her yet smiled sweetness and bliss on every side frankly she looked up into the faces of her sisters in arms i know you like my necklace isnt it lovely colonel frosts wedding present you know he said i shouldnt give nita away without some recompense and this is it but that could have been only a part of it said the garrison an honorarium in solid cash it was believed was far the greater portion of the consideration which the elder sister accepted for having successfully borne nita away from the dangers and fascinations of the point having guarded her drooping and languid against the advances of goodlooking soldier lads at headquarters and finally having by dint of hours of argument persuasion and skill delivered her into the arms of the elderly but wellpreserved groom all he demanded to know was that she was fancy free that there was no previous attachment and on this point mrs frank had solemnly averred there was none the child had had a foolish fancy for a cadet beau but it amounted to absolutely nothing there had been no vows no pledge no promise of any kind and she was actually free as air so frost was satisfied they made an oddlooking pair frost was pony built but sturdy and nita seemed like a fairy indeed as unsubstantial as a wisp of vapor as she came down the aisle on his arm they were so far to the south on this honeymoon trip as almost to feel the shock and concussion when the maine was blown to a mass of wreckage they were in washington when congress determined on full satisfaction from spain and colonel frost was told his leave was cut short that he must return to his station at once going first to the arlington and hurriedly entering the room he almost stumbled over the body of his wife lying close to the door in a swoon from which it took some time and the efforts of the house physician and the maids to restore her questioned later as to the cause she wept hysterically and wrung her hands she didnt know she had gone to the door to answer a knock and got dizzy and remembered nothing more what became of the knocker she didnt know frost inquired at the office a bellboy was found who said he had taken up a card in an envelope given him by a young feller who seemed kind o sick mrs frost took it and flopped and a chambermaid ran in to her and then hurried for the doctor what became of the letter or note or card asked frost with suspicion and jealousy in his heart two women mistress and maid and the bellboy swore they didnt know but the maid did know with the quick intuition of her sex and class she had seen that there was or had been a young lover and sympathy for nita and a dislike for frost who gave no tips prompted her to hide it until she could slip it safely into nitas hand nita who read shuddered tore it into minute scraps and wept more face downward on the bed they had reached their winter station before the cable flashed the stirring tidings of deweys great victory in manila bay and within half a week came telegraphic orders for colonel frost to proceed at once to san francisco there to await instructions the first expedition was organizing when he arrived his pallid little wife by his side and there were his instructions to proceed to manila as chief of his department an independent position and yet it was a horrid blow but there was no recourse nita begged that she might stay with her sister she could not bear the idea of going frost knew that no women could accompany the expedition and shipping his chest and desks by the transport he had secured passage for himself and wife to hongkong on one of the splendid steamers of the english line from vancouver and so informed her it dashed nitas last hope they were occupying fine rooms at the palace hotel the city was thronged with officers and rapidly arriving troops other army women eager to accompany their husbands were railing at the fate that separated them and nita had been forced to conceal the joy with which she heard their lamentations but she had yet to learn how exacting frost could be it had never occurred to her that he could obtain permission to go except by transport it had not seemed possible that he would take her with him you should have known said he that even if i had had to go by transport you would have gone by the empress of india it is only sixty hours from manila to hongkong and i could have joined you soon after your arrival as it is i shall see you safely established there i have letters to certain prominent english people then shall go over to join the fleet when it arrives in manila bay that night she wrote long and desperately to margaret he swore he would follow me wherever we went until i granted him the interview you know how he dogged me in washington followed me to denver and any moment he may address me here f will not let me return to you he insists on my going to hongkong where he can occasionally join me but rollin holds those letters over me like a whip and declares that he will give them into frosts hands unless i see him whenever he presents himself you made me swear to frost i never cared a straw for my darling that was o god how i loved him and if these letters ever reach the man to whom you have sold me he would treat me as he would a dog even if he doesnt kill me meg meg you must help me for i live in terror and that she lived in terror was true some women were quick to see never would she go anywhere even along the corridor alone if the colonel could not come to luncheon she was served in their rooms if she had to go calling or shopping it was in a carriage and always with some army woman whom she could persuade to go with her one day just before their intended departure she drove out paying parting calls it was quite late when the carriage drew up at the market street entrance the nearest to their elevator the door boy sprang across the sidewalk to open the carriage and as she stepped wearily out a tall young man erect and slender dressed in a dark traveling suit fairly confronted her raised his derby and said you can give me ten minutes now mrs frost be good enough to take my arm bowing her head she strove to dodge by but it was useless again he confronted her piteously she looked up into his pale stern face and clasped her hands oh rollin she cried give me my letters i dare not see you have mercy and down again she went in a senseless heap upon the stone colonel and mrs frost did not sail with the empress of india brain fever set in and for three weeks the patient never left the hotel frost made his wifes dangerous illness the basis of an application to be relieved from the manila detail but knowing well it would be late summer before the troops could be assembled there in sufficient force to occupy the city and that his clerks and books had gone by transport with the second expedition in june the war department compromised on a permission to delay by the time the fourth expedition was ready to start there was no further excuse moreover the doctors declared the sea voyage was just what mrs frost needed and again their stateroom was engaged by the empress line and though weak and languid mrs frost was able to appear in the diningroom meanwhile a vast amount of work was saddled on the department to which frost was attached and daily he was called upon to aid the local officials or be in consultation with the commanding general this would have left mrs frost to the ministrations of her nurse alone but for the loving kindness of army women in the hotel they hovered about her room taking turns in spending the afternoon with her or the evening for it was speedily apparent that she had a nervous dread of being left by herself or even with her husband said the most observing already it had been whispered that despite his assiduous care and devotion during her illness something serious was amiss everybody had heard of the adventure which had preceded her alarming illness everybody knew that she had been accosted and confronted by a strange young man at sight of whom she had pleaded piteously a minute and then fainted dead away by this time too there were or had been nearly a dozen of the graduating class in town classmates of rollin latrobe their muchloved pat and speedily the story was told of his devotion to her when she was nita terriss of their correspondence of their engagement to be married on his graduation which in strict confidence he had imparted to his roommate who kept it inviolate until after her sudden union with colonel frost and poor pats equally sudden disappearance everybody frost included knew that the young man who had accosted her must be latrobe and frost by this time knew that it must have been he who caused her shock at the arlington he raged in his jealous heart he employed detectives to find the fellow swearing he would have him arrested he became morose and gloomy for all the arts by which mrs garrison persuaded him that nita looked up to him with admiration and reverence that would speedily develop into wifely love were now proved to be machinations he knew that nita feared him shrank from him and was very far from loving him and he believed that despite her denials and fears and protestations she loved young latrobe he wrote angrily reproachfully to margaret who now that her fish was hooked did not greatly exert herself to soothe or reassure him that he could ever use violence to one so sweet and fragile as nita she would not believe for an instant then the nurse still retained heard bitter words from the colonel as one morning she came to the door with mrs frosts breakfast and while she paused uncertain about entering at such a time he rushed angrily forth and nearly collided with her mrs frost was in tears when the nurse finally entered and the breakfast was left untouched late that afternoon just after the various trunks and boxes of the frosts that were to go by the transport were packed and ready and mrs frost looking stronger at last though still fragile almost ethereal was returning from a drive with one of her friends the attention of the two ladies was drawn to a crowd gathering rapidly on the sidewalk not far from the baldwin hotel there was no shouting no commotion nothing but the idle curiosity of men and boys for a young soldier a handsome slender darkeyed darkcomplexioned fellow of twentyone or two had been arrested by a patrol and there they stood the sergeant and his two soldiers fully armed and equipped the hapless captive with his arms half filled with bundles and over the heads of the little throng the ladies could see that he was pleading earnestly with his captors and that the sergeant though looking sympathetic and far from unkind was shaking his head mrs frost listless and a little fatigued had witnessed too many such scenes in former days of garrison life to take any interest in the proceeding how stupid these people are she irritably exclaimed running like mad and blocking the streets to see a soldier arrested for absence from camp without a pass shant we drive on oh just one moment please mrs frost he has such a nice face a gentlemans face and he seems so troubled do look at it languidly and with something very like a pout mrs frost turned her face again toward the sidewalk but by this time the sergeant had linked an arm in that of the young soldier and had led him a pace or two away so that his back was now toward the carriage he was still pleading and the crowd had begun to back him up and was expostulating too awe take him where he says sergeant and let him prove it dont be hard on him man if hes taking care of a sick friend give m a chance then the sergeant tried to explain matters i cant help myself gentlemen said he orders are orders and mine are to find this recruit and fetch him back to camp hes two days over time now oh i wish i knew what it meant anxiously exclaimed mrs frosts companion im sure he needs help then with sudden joy in her eyes oh good there goes colonel crosby hell see whats amiss and as she spoke a tall man in the fatigue uniform of an officer of infantry shouldered his way through the crowd and reached the bluecoated quartette in the center up went the hands to the shouldered rifles in salute and the young soldier the cause of all the gathering which the police were now trying to disperse whirled quickly and with something suspiciously like tears in his fine dark eyes was seen to be eagerly speaking to the veteran officer there was a brief colloquy and then the colonel said something to the sergeant at which the crowd set up a cheer the sergeant looked pleased the young soldier most grateful and away went the four along the sidewalk many of the throng following and then the colonel caught sight of the ladies in the carriage saw that one was signaling eagerly and heard his name called hastening to their side he raised his cap and smiled a cordial greeting oh im so glad you came colonel we are so interested in that young soldier do tell us what it all means oh i beg your pardon mrs frost i surely thought you had met colonel crosby let me pre why nita whats are you ill here take my salts quick no no go on i i want to hear where are they taking him faintly murmured mrs frost try to control yourself said her companion ill tell you in one moment meantime from without the carriage the colonel continued addressing nitas companion he tells a perfectly straight story he says he has an old friend who is here so desperately ill and out of money that he got a doctor for him and had been nursing him himself those things he carried are medicines and wine that the doctor bade him buy all he asks is to take them to his friends room and get a nurse then he is ready to go to camp and stand his trial so i told the sergeant id be responsible oh thank you so much do see that the poor fellow isnt punished well drive right round perhaps we can do something it is red cross business you know goodafternoon colonel please tell our driver to follow them but to her consternation no sooner had they started than she felt nitas trembling hand grasping her wrist and turning quickly saw that she was in almost hysterical condition my poor child i had forgotten you were so worn out ill take you home at once but then well miss them entirely oh could you bear oh no no moaned nita wringing her little hands take me anywhere no take me home take me home and promise me not to not to tell my husband what we saw chapter xi for a man ordinarily absorbed in his own command colonel stanley armstrong had become all on a sudden deeply engrossed in that of colonel canker the frosts had been gone a week via vancouver the expedition only about sixteen hours when he appeared at gordons tent and frankly asked to be told all that tall southerner knew of the young soldier morton now gone from camp for the third and as armstrong believed the last time why that young fellas a bawn gentleman drawled gordon as he offered the colonel a chair and cigar he was behavin tip top steady as you please until about a month ago hes only been with us since the first of may came with a big batch of recruits a regular athlete you know then after hed drilled awhile i nailed him for headquarters clerk i never knew him to be off an hour until about four weeks ago the men say another young fella came out here one night had a talk with morton and they went out together he got regular permission nobody has set eyes on his friend out here since that time but morton got three passes to town in ten days and squeers happened to want him and gave orders he should have to be consulted hereafter bout a fortnight since by jove morton lit out suddenly and was gone fortyeight hours and was brought back by a patrol perfectly straight and he said he had to go on account of a friend who had been taken very ill and was a stranger here squeers let him off with a warning and inside of three days he begged for a twentyfourhour pass and squeers wouldnt give it he went without it by george it was just about the time the prime family arrived looking up the boy they heard was in your regiment this time there was big trouble the patrol sent for him went directly to the lodgings of his sick friend and there they found him and he laid out two of our best men for forcing a way into the room they told me your carriage nearly ran over him the day of the review then came that dam fool charge about his being mixed up in this robbery then his escape from under billy grays nose by george and thats the last of him canker sent a party in to look him up at the usual place and both birds had flown both by george the sick man was well enough to be driven off in a carriage and theres nothing further to tell as yet i wish i had known about him earlier before the primes came said armstrong thoughtfully knocking the ashes off his cigar of course you divine my theory that mortons the missing son and heir of course now that ive seen miss prime the family resemblance is strong but if he wanted to soldier whats to prevent those tents yawnduh are full of youngsters better educated than i am and gordon arose tangling a long lean leg in the nearest campstool which he promptly kicked through the doorway into the sailing fog outside it was barely eleven oclock but already the raw wet wind was whistling in over the barren sandy slopes and dunes and the moisture dripped in big drops from the sloped rifles of the men marching sturdily in from drill yawnduh comes the prime carriage now by george continued the adjutant as he limped to the entrance ole man seems all broke up dont he armstrong had promptly risen and came striding to his comrades side naturally was the answer he had hoped much from this visit the boy was just under twentyone when he enlisted and as his fathers consent was lacking a discharge could have been ordered it may have been fear of that that drove the youngster off where is the carriage and your glass continued the colonel looking about until he found a binocular comin right down the road back of the officers tents reckon its another visit of condolence to gray you know i shouldnt wonduh if this arrest of his proved a blessin in disguise for that lucky boy no reply coming to this observation gordon glanced over his shoulder armstrong was replacing the glasses again the adjutant hazarded i i was sayin this arrest may be after all the biggest kind of blessing in disguise for that lucky billy yes by jove theyre comin to his tent thats a splendid girl ole man miss prime you mean calmly queried armstrong striking match after match in the effort to light a fresh cigar his face averted miss prime i dont mean answered gordon glancing curiously at the senior officer not but that shes a most charming young lady and all that he hurriedly interpolated southern chivalry asserting itself then with a twitch about the lip by the way ole man those cigars light better from the other end take a fresh one armstrong quickly withdrew the illused weed from between his strong white teeth gave it one glance and a toss into the wastebasket no ive smoked enough but how can they see him how about that sentry over grays tent huh chief made him take it off directly he heard of it grinned gordon moses but didnt squeers blaspheme and the adjutant threw his head back and laughed joyously over the retrospect yes theres that curly pate of billys at the tent door now reckon he was expectin em there they are ole prime too dont be in a hurry colonel they had known each other years these two and it had been armstrong and gordon when they addressed each other or ole man when gordon lapsed into the semiaffectionate to the adjutants southern sense of military propriety ole man was still possible armstrong would be a soldierly solecism i am to see the general before noon said armstrong gravely and its time i started if you should hear of your runaway let me know if you shouldnt keep our views to yourself theres no use in rousing false hopes with that armstrong turned up the collar of his overcoat and lunged out into the mist gordon watched him as he strode away the orderly following at the conventional distance the shortest way to general headquarters was up the row of company officers tents in front of the still incarcerated billy the longest was around back of the mess tent and kitchen armstrong took the latter that escape of prisoners was still the talk of camp men had come by battalions to see the tunnel observing which canker promptly ordered it closed up opinion was universal that canker should have released the officers and men he had placed under arrest at once but he didnt in his bottled wrath he hung on to them until the brigade commander took a hand and ordered it canker grumblingly obeyed so far as the sergeant and sentries were concerned but entered stout protest as to gray i still hold that officer as having knowledge of the scheme and aiding and abetting i can prove that he telephoned for that carriage he said at least theres nothing to warrant the posting of that sentry at mr grays tent colonel canker said the brigadier with some asperity order him off at once thats all for today sir and the man with the starred shoulders held over him with the silver leaves the latter could only obey and objurgate but cankers knuckles came in for another rasping within the hour the brigadier being done with him the division commanders compliments came over per orderly and would the colonel please step to the generals tent canker was fuming to get to town he was possessed with insane desire to follow up that boarding house clue he believed the landlady could be bullied into telling where her boarder was taken and what manner of man or woman he was but down he had to go three blocks of camp to where the tents of division headquarters were pitched and there sat the veteran commander suave and placid as ever ah colonel touching that matter of the robbery of your commissary stores suspicion points very strongly to your sergeant foley do you think it wise to have no sentry over him why general said canker ive known that man fifteen years in fact i got him ordered to duty here and the colonel bristled well pardon me colonel but you heard the evidence against him last night or at least heard of it dont you consider that conclusive canker cleared his throat and considered as suggested i heard the allegation sir but he made so clear an explanation to me at least and besides general a bright idea occurring to him you know that as commissary sergeant he is not under my command tut tut colonel interrupted the general waxing impatient the storehouse adjoins your camp your sentries guard it captain hanford the commissary says he called on you last night to notify you that he had placed the sergeant under arrest but considered the case so grave that he asked that a sentry be placed over him and it wasnt done i dislike very much to inflict such indignity on deserving soldiers general said canker stumbling into a selfmade trap until their guilt is established they are innocent under the law apparently you apply a different rule in case of officers calmly responded the general vide mr gray no further words are necessary oblige me by having that sentry posted at once goodmorning sir but to cankers dismay the officer of the guard made prompt report the sentry was sent but the sergeants tent was empty the colonels pet had flown this meant more trouble for the colonel meantime stanley armstrong had hied him to general draytons headquarters the office tents were well filled with clerks orderlies aides and other officers who had come in on business but this meeting was by appointment and after brief delay the camp commander excused himself to those present and ushered armstrong into his own private tent the scene of the merry festivities the evening of mrs garrisons unexpected arrival there the general turned quickly on his visitor with the lowtoned question well what have you found enough to give me strong reason for believing that morton socalled is young prime and that your nephew is with him sir the old soldiers sad eyes lighted with sudden hope yet as he passed his hand wearily over his forehead the look of doubt and uncertainty slowly returned it accounts for the letters reaching me here he said but ive known that boy from babyhood armstrong and a more intense nature i have never heard of what he starts in to do he will carry out if it kills him and drayton looked drearily about the tent as though in search of something he didnt quite know what then he settled back slowly into his favorite old chair do sit down armstrong i want to speak with you a moment yet it was the colonel who was the first to break the silence may i ask if you have had time to look at any of the letters sir do i look as though i had time to do anything said the chief dropping his hands and uplifting a lined and haggard face yet so refined anything but work work morn noon and night the mass of detail one has to meet here is something appalling it weighs on me like a nightmare armstrong no i was worn out the night after the package reached me when next i sought it the letters were gone how long was that general again the weary hands with their long tapering fingers came up to the old soldiers brow he pondered a moment it must have been the next afternoon i think but i cant be sure and you had left them in the inside pocket of that old overcoat of mine hanging there on the rear tent pole was the answer as the general turned halfround in his chair and glanced wistfully selfreproachfully thither armstrong arose and going to the back of the tent made close examination the canvas home of the chief was what is known as the hospital tent but instead of being pitched with the ordinary ridgepole and uprights a substantial wooden frame and floor had first been built and over this the stout canvas was stretched stanch and taut as the head of a drum it was all intact and sound whoever filched that packet made way with it through the front and that as armstrong well knew was kept tightly laced as a rule from the time the general left it in the morning until his return it was never unlaced except in his presence or by his order then the deft hands of the orderlies on duty would do the trick in a twinkling knowing all this the colonel queried further you went in town as i remember late that evening and called on the primes and other people at the palace i think i saw you in the supper room there was much merriment at your table mrs garrison seemed to be the life of the party now you left your overcoat with the boy at the cloak stand no armstrong thats the odd part of it i only used the cape that evening the coat was hanging at its usual place when i returned late with a mass of new orders and papers no no but here i must get back to the office and what i wished you to see was that poor boys letter what can you hope with a nature like that to deal with armstrong took the missive held out to him and slowly read it the general studying his face the while the letter bore no clue as to the whereabouts of the writer it read march st it is six weeks since i repaid all your loving kindness brought shame and sorrow to you and ruin to myself by deserting from west point when my commission was but a few short months away in an hour of intense misery caused by a girl who had won my very soul and whose words and letters made me believe she would become my wife the month of my graduation and who as i now believe was then engaged to the man she married in january i threw myself away my one thought was to find her and god knows what beyond it can never be undone my career is ended and i can never look you in the face again at first i thought i should show the letters one by one to the man she married and ask him what he thought of his wife but that is too low i hold them because i have a mad longing to see her again and heap reproaches upon her but if i fail and should i feel at any time that my end is near im going to send them to you to read to see how i was lured and then if you can to pity and forgive rollin armstrongs firm lips twitched under his mustache the general with moist eyes had risen from his chair and mechanically held forth his hand poor lad sighed armstrong of course you know who the girl was oh of course and drayton shrugged his shoulders well well have to go and led on to the misty light without over across the way were the headquarters tents of a big brigade hopefully awaiting orders for manila to their left separated by a narrow space so crowded were the camps were the quarters of the officers of the teenth infantry and even through the veil of mist both soldiers could plainly see along the line coming toward the gate was mr prime escorted by the major just behind them followed mildred and the attentive schuyler but where was miss lawrence armstrong had already seen lingering she stood at billys tent front her ear inclined to his protruding pate he was saying something that took time and she showed no inclination to hurry him miss prime looked back then she and schuyler exchanged significant smiles and glances there was rather a lingering handclasp before amy started even then she looked back at the boy and smiled hm said the general as he gazed that youngster wouldnt swap places with any subaltern in camp even if he is under charges there was no answer from the strong soldier standing observant at his elbow but when the chief would have moved armstrong detained him one more question general in case you were away and wanted something you had left in this tent you would send an aide or orderly or would an order signed by one of your staff be sufficient hm well yes i suppose it would said the general chapter xii opinion was divided at camp merritt as to whether billy gray should or should not stand trial confident as were his friends of his innocence of all complicity in mortons escape there remained the fact that he had telephoned for a carriage that a carriage had come and that a carriage with four men apparently soldiers had driven rapidly townward along point lobos avenue it was seen by half a dozen policemen as it shot under electric light or gas lamp then there was the bundle inside his rolled overcoat that gray had personally handed morton when a prisoner everybody agreed he should have sent it by orderly everybody that is except some scores of young soldiers in the ranks who could see no harm in it having been done that way especially two delta sigs in the teenth then there were the long conferences in the dark what did they mean all things considered the older and wiser heads saw that as the lieutenant could or would make no satisfactory explanation of these to his colonel he must to a court or take the consequences youve made a mess of the thing and an ass of yourself billy was gordons comprehensive if not consolatory summary of the matter and as canker has been rapped for one thing or another by camp division and brigade commanders one after another he feels that hes got to prove that he isnt the only fool in the business youd better employ good counsel and prepare for a fight cant afford it said billy briefly and im blowed if ill ask my dear old dad to come to the rescue hes had to cough up shame on your slang billy far too much already i tell you gordon im so fixed that i cant explain these things unless im actually brought to trial its its well you have no secret societies at the point as we do at college so you cant fathom it im no more afraid of standing trial than i am of squeers and be dd to him good lawd youngster you you arent quite such an ass as to suppose a court is going to regard any schoolboy obligation as paramount to that which your oath of office demands look hyuh billy your heads just addled i cant work on you but somebody must and gordon went away very low in his mind he liked that boy he loved a keen alert snappy soldier on drill and billy had no superior in the battalion when it came to handling squad or company the adjutant plainly saw the peril of his position and further consultation with his brotherofficers confirmed him in his fears schuyler the brigade commissary being much with the teenth messing with them in fact when he was not dancing attendance on miss prime heard all this camp talk and told her thus it happened that the very next day when he drove with the cousins mr prime being the while in conference with the detectives still scouring the city for the young deserter who the father now felt confident was his missing boy miss lawrence looked the captain full in the face with her clear searching eyes and plumped at him the pointblank question captain schuyler do mr grays brotherofficers really consider him in danger of dismissal miss lawrence i grieve to say that not one has any other opinion now there could be no doubt of it amy lawrence turned very pale and her beautiful eyes filled it is a shame she said after a moments struggle to conquer the trembling of her lips has is there no one influential enough or with brains enough this with returning color to take up his case and clear him they were whirling through the beautiful drive of the golden gate park passing company after company at drill even as amy spoke schuyler lifted his cap and miss prime bowed and smiled a group of regimental officers four in number stood apparently supervising the work and as miss lawrence quickly turned to see who they might be her eyes met those of colonel armstrong five minutes later the carriage returning drew up as though by some order from its occupants at that very spot armstrong and his adjutant were still there and promptly joined them long weeks afterward that morning lived in stanley armstrongs memory it was one of those rare august days when the wind blew from the southeast beat back the drenching pacific fogs and let the warm sun pour upon the brilliant verdure of that wonderful park earth and air distant sea and dazzling sky all seemed glorifying their creator brighthued birds flashed through the foliage and thrilled the ear with their caroling the plash of fountain fell softly on the breeze mingled with the rustling of the luxuriant growth of leaf and flower close at hand it was not chance that brought the stalwart soldier instantly to amys side her gaze was upon him before the carriage stopped and irresistibly drew him the man of mature years the hero of sharp combats and stirring campaigns with a fierce and savage foe the commander of hundreds of eager and gallant men obeyed without thought of demur the unspoken summons of a girl yet in her teens there was a new light in her clear and beautiful eyes a flush upon her soft and rounded cheek a little flutter possibly in her kind and loyal heart heaven knows his beat high with an emotion he could not subdue though his bearing was grave and courteous as ever but about that sweet and flushing face there shone the halo of a womans brave determination and no sooner had be reached the carriage side than bending toward him she spoke mildred prime could not repress a little gasp of amaze colonel armstrong will you kindly open the carriage door i want to talk with you a moment without a word he wrenched the handle and threw wide the door light as a bird she sprang to the ground her fingers just touching the extended hand side by side they strolled away across the sunlit lawn he so strong virile erect she so lissome and graceful full of her purpose yet fearful that with delay might come timidity she looked up in his face colonel armstrong i have heard only today that mr gray is in really serious danger will you tell me the truth just what armstrong expected it might be hard to say the light that had leaped to his eyes faded slowly and his face lost something of the flush of robust health there was a brief pause before he spoke as though he wished time to weigh his words i fear it is true he gravely said then in a moment miss lawrence will you not take my arm and he felt her hand tremble as she placed it there it was a moment before she began again they tell me he should have counsel but will not heed i have not seen him today there is no one in his battalion it seems whom he really looks up to he is headstrong and selfconfident do you think he should that he needs one and anxiously the brave eyes sought the strong soldierly face it would seem so miss lawrence she drew a long breath she seemed to cling a little closer to his arm then straight came the next question colonel armstrong will you do me a great favor will you be his counsel he was looking directly to the front as she spoke something told him what was coming yet he could not answer all at once what did it mean after all but just what he had been thinking for a week that the girls fresh young heart had gone out to this merry handsome soldierly lad whom he too had often marked with keen appreciation when in command of his big company at drill what possible thought of hers could he more than twice her years have ever hoped to win she had come to him in her sore trouble and her lovers as she would have gone to her father had he been a soldier schooled in such affairs armstrong pulled himself together with quick stern selfcommand looking down he saw that her eyes were filling her lips paling and a rush of tenderness overcame him as he simply and gently answered yes and there is no time to be lost all these last days it will be remembered mrs frank garrison with pretty cherry ripe had found shelter at the presidio the palace was no place for a poor soldiers wife and there was no longer a grateful nabob as a possible source of income it is doubtful indeed whether that mine could be further tapped for the effusive brotherinlaw of the winter gone by had found disillusion in more ways than one garrison busy day and night with his staff duties had plainly to tell his capricious wife that she had come without his knowledge or consent and that he could not think of meeting the expense of even a two weeks stay in town he could not account for her coming at all he had left her with his own people where at least she would be in comfort while he took the field he desired that she should return thither at once she determined to remain and gayly tapped his cheek and bade him have no concern she could readily find quarters and so she did the regular garrison of the presidio was long since afield but the families of many of its officers still remained there while the houses of two or three completely furnished so far as army furnishings go were there in charge of the post quartermaster from being the temporary guests of some old friends mrs frank and her pretty companion suddenly opened housekeeping in one of these vacated homes and all her witchery was called into play to make it the most popular resort of the younger element at the post money she might lack but no woman could eclipse her in the dazzle of her dainty toilets the presidio was practically at her feet before she had been established fortyeight hours other peoples vehicles trundled her over to camp whenever she would drive other peoples horses stood saddled at her door when she would ride other peoples servants flew to do her bidding women might whisper and frown but for the present at least she had the men at her beck and call morn noon and night she was on the go the mornings being given over as a rule to a gallop over the breezy heights where the brigade or regimental drills were going on the afternoons to calls wherein it is ever more blessed to give than to receive and the evenings to hops at the assembly room or to entertaining charmingly entertaining the little swarm of officers with occasional angels of her own sex sure to drop in and spend an hour cherry played and sang and made eyes at the boys mrs frank was winsome and genial and joyous to everybody and when garrison himself arrived from camp generally late in the evening looking worn and jaded from long hours at the desk she had ever a comforting supper and smiling playful welcome for her lord making much of him before the assembled company to the end that more than one callow sub was heard to say that there would be some sense in marrying by george if a fellow could pick up a wife like mrs frank all the same the post soon learned that the supposedly blest aidedecamp breakfasted solus on what he could forage for himself before he mounted and rode over to his long days labor at camp merritt another thing was speedily apparent the entente cordial between her radiant self and the primes was at an end if indeed it ever existed she to be sure was sunshine itself when they chanced to meet at camp the clouds were on the faces of the father and daughter while miss lawrence maintained a serene neutrality they were lingering in frisco still hopefully were the primes the detectives on duty at the landing stage the evening stewarts regiment embarked swore that no one answering the description of either of the two young men had slipped aboard those in the employ of the sad old man were persistent in the statement that they had clues were on the scent etc he was a sheep worth the shearing and so while mr prime spent many hours in consultation with certain of these socalled sleuthhounds the young ladies took their daily drive through the park generally picking up the smiling schuyler somewhere along the way and rarely omitting a call with creature comforts in the way of baskets of fruit upon the happy billy whose limits were no longer restricted to his tent as during the first week of his arrest but whose court was ordered to sit in judgment on him the first of the coming week already it began to be whispered that armstrong had a mine to spring in behalf of the defense but he was so reserved that no one even gordon sought to question armstrong is a trump said billy to miss lawrence one fair morning hell knock those charges silly though i dare say i could have wormed through all right only you see i couldnt get out to find people to give evidence for me do you see him often she asked somewhat vaguely armstrong exclaimed billy in openeyed amaze why hes here with me every day but never thought miss lawrence in the morning when we are the eventful monday was duly ushered in but not the court that case never came to trial like the crack of a whip an order snapped in by wire on the thursday previous three regiments the teenth regulars and the primeval dudes armstrongs splendid regiment among them to prepare for sea voyage forthwith more than that general drayton and staff were directed to proceed to manila at once twothirds of the members of the court were from these regiments a new detail would be necessary the general sent for armstrong cant we try that case here and now he asked certainly said armstrong if youll send for canker that he may be satisfied and canker came and listened it was admitted that gray had had a long talk with the prisoner took him his overcoat newspapers etc but in extenuation they were members of the same college society and their social standing was outside the army on the same plane gray deserved reprimand and caution nothing more as to the carriage he had nothing to do with the one that drove to camp that night a man in the uniform of a commissary sergeant giving the name of foley how canker winced had ordered it at the stable and taught the driver killarney gray had phoned for a carriage for himself hoping to get the officerofthedays permission to be absent two hours to tell his story in person to the general who was dining with the department commander he never got the permission and the carriage went to the wrong camp lieutenant w f gray was released from arrest and returned to duty i shall never be able to thank you enough said he sentimentally to miss lawrence at the palace that evening they were strolling up and down the corridor waiting as was schuyler for mildred to come down for the theater grays curly head was inclined toward the dark locks of his fair partner his eyes were fastened on her faintly flushing face they made a very pretty picture said people who looked on knowingly and so thought the officer in the uniform of a colonel of infantry who while talking calmly to mr prime full thirty yards away watched them with eyes that were full of sadness how could he see at that distance that her eyes clear and radiant were seldom uplifted to the ardent gaze of her escort and were at the moment looking straight at him how could he hear at that distance the prompt response given with an inclination of the bonny head to indicate her meaning theres where your thanks are due mr gray quite a gathering of army folk was at the palace that night so many wives or sweethearts were going home so many soldiers abroad and mrs frank garrison gay and gracious passed them time and again leaning on the arm of captain mcdonald a new devotee while poor cherry with an enamored swain from the presidio languished in a dim secluded corner she had been recalled by parental authority and was to start for denver under a matronly wing on the morrow mrs frank had been bidden and expected to go at the same time but that authority was merely marital up to this time not one army wife had been permitted to accompany her husband on any of the transports to manila though one heroine managed to get carried away and to share her liege lords stateroom as far as honolulu the general and his staff with a big regiment of volunteers were to sail on the morrow the other regiments as fast as transports could be coaled and made ready something in mrs garrisons gay triumphant manner prompted a sorehearted woman suffering herself at the coming parting to turn and say well mrs garrison i suppose that after your husband sails youll have to follow the rest of us into grasswidowhood one thing that made women hate margaret garrison was that she could never be taken down and the answer came cuttingly as it was meant to go even though a merry laugh went with it not i when the ship i want is ready i go with it but as she turned triumphantly away the color suddenly left her cheek and there was an instants falter as though he had heard her words stanley armstrong too had suddenly turned and stood looking sternly into her eyes chapter xiii still another expedition was destined to start for manila and keen was the rivalry among the regiments held to daily drill at san francisco the rumor was current in the camps that the next review was to decide the matter and that the commands pronounced to be foremost in discipline and efficiency would be designated to embark the transports that had conveyed the earlier expeditions to the philippines began to reappear in the bay and coaling and refitting were hurried to the utmost the man most eager to get away was stanley armstrong and if merit were to decide the matter it was conceded among the volunteers that in point of style and equipment the primeval dudes held over all competitors even though every competitor believed itself more than a match for the dudes if actual campaigning and fighting were in contemplation senators and members from the states represented by the volunteers at san francisco led burdensome lives for officers and men were pulling every wire to secure the longedfor orders for an immediate voyage to manila when all on a sudden the hopes of all were crushed spain had begged for peace no more men can be sent to manila said the officials consulted and camp merritt put on mourning forthwith but armstrong had been studying the situation and was not easily daunted he was a man whose opinion carried weight and from the very first he had maintained that while fifteen or twenty thousand might be men enough to hold manila fifty thousand might not be enough to subdue at once the forces of aguinaldo in case they should turn upon the americans which said he placidly they will most certainly do before we are a year older the dudes therefore much to their disgust were kept steadily at work other regiments profiting by example followed suit but in others still a small proportion of their membership believing as they said that the jig was up took to lawless and unhallowed expression of their disgust and became thereby a nuisance to the neighborhood san franciscans who had wept copiously when others sailed away would have seen these patriots sent into exile without shedding a tear every man of this command will yet be needed and yet be sent said armstrong so too did the veteran division commander and the brigade took heart accordingly the last of the regulars with the recruit detachments for regiments already in the philippines had been shipped to honolulu there to await orders and september seemed destined to go by without a change for the better in the prospects of the men still left in camp about the reservation the primes convinced at last that the boy they sought was not to be found in california had gone to santa anita visiting their kindred the lawrences and armstrong buckling down to hard and constant work was striving to persuade himself that he did not care that the mornings no longer brought with them the carriage and the fair face of that gentle girl the department commander himself had gone to take a look at his new responsibilities in hawaii little mrs garrison still held court though with diminished retinue at the presidio when one day just as october was ushered in there came a message from the adjutantgeneral in town would armstrong drop in at the office at the first opportunity a matter of some importance had come up in the generals first letter from honolulu one on which armstrongs opinion was desired and the colonel hoping for tidings of a chance to move even that far to the front made immediate opportunity and took the first car for the phelan building the adjutantgeneral looked up from a littered desk as armstrong entered it is good of you to come so promptly said he im in a stew to tell the truth and i want your advice then he tapped his bell excuse me to any one who comes for the next ten minutes said he to the attendant who entered i have business with colonel armstrong no sooner did the orderly vanish than the man of the desk whirled full on the man of the saddle armstrong said he you defended gray and proved him innocent what else has canker against him nothing that i know of why because hes got him in arrest again at honolulu and the chief is worked up over something look here do you suppose did you ever hear about certain letters that were stolen from general draytons tent i heard yes why and the look of disappointment which had appeared in the grave face of the colonel gave way to one of alert interest just read that said the staff official holding forth a letter begin there at later and armstrong read his forehead slowly grooving into something very like a frown later i may have to remain here several days canker with the teenth went ahead before news of the protocol could stop him but he leaves here a number of sick lieutenant gray charged with using threatening and insubordinate language to his commanding officer among them and gray is down with brain fever the doctors say he is too ill to be disturbed and his side of the story is hard to get at as the boy is too flighty to talk sense from cankers own admission i learned that he accused gray of having knowledge of the whereabouts of that packet of letters stolen from general draytons tent and the youngsters reply was furious canker had to place him in arrest and prefer charges when asked if he were sure of his ground in making so serious an accusation he declared he had proof positive at least he would have the instant they reached manila and his intention was to take the boy along with him to be tried there by courtmartial where no meddling outsiders as he said could buy off witnesses it was plain that he considered himself out of my jurisdiction and that he resented my staff officers questions but dr morrow had appealed to me in behalf of gray said that if compelled to continue a prisoner aboard that transport under cankers tyrannical rule gray might be goaded into insanity he was in a condition bordering on brain fever when morrow came to see me and in another day was raving that settled it i ordered him taken off and placed in hospital here and canker had to go without him but i wish you would see armstrong and tell him about gray so that i may know the whole situation as soon as i return canker evidently intended not to let us know his proofs he probably believes that he will find a more credulous and complaisant listener in drayton but his insinuations pointed to gray as at least an abettor in the theft and he went so far as to say that if armstrong could be brought before the court some very interesting testimony could be dragged from him and finally that both armstrong and mrs well the wife of a staff officer who is already well on the way to manila might be compelled to testify i cannot bring myself to repeat more that he said but he was in an ugly and almost defiant mood and i had to give him a dressing down you may say to armstrong for me that i do not believe one word of cankers calumny at his expense or that of the lady in the case but he declared his intention of laying the whole matter before general drayton immediately on his arrival and it is best that armstrong should be prepared as for the lady canker said she and armstrong were very close friends when they were at fort stanhope ten years ago though they no longer meet as such and that brings me to another matter i declined positively to allow two or three ladies wives of officers to go on to manila with cankers command and they said that as i had promised mrs garrison a passage i had no right to refuse them pressed for their authority two very estimable women told me that at the presidio two days before we sailed mrs garrison openly boasted of having my promise to send her on the very next steamer now who is really the fabricator i told her positively that with my consent she should not go and she laughed delightedly and said she only asked as a matter of form the whole thing had already been settled just see to it that if any more transports start before my return no woman is permitted aboard except of course authorized nurses gray is a very sick boy tonight but you might wire his father saying nothing of the arrest that the doctors are confident of his recovery in course of time armstrong read these pages twice over before he looked up how did this letter come he asked by the salvador yesterday and the next mail for honolulu queried armstrong rising from his chair and handing back the folded letter the next mail closed an hour ago man the china sails at two no other boat for a week where are you going now to camp for ten minutes then to the presidio oh come over to the club and have a bite first said the adjutantgeneral rising and wriggling out of his uniform coat as he did so i wont keep you half an hour that halfhour may prove precious answered armstrong already at the door many thanks all the same well hold on what am i to say to the general as to gray and those letters asked the staff officer intent upon the subject uppermost in his mind at the moment you cant say anything that will reach him before he returns you have just told me no other boat would start for a week by that time hell be coming home and with that armstrong let himself out and strode to the elevator leaving his friend to cogitate on the question over his luncheon it was decidedly that officers opinion that armstrong knew much more than he would tell but armstrong knew much less than he himself believed hastening back to camp and ordering his horse he was soon speeding up the slope to the windswept heights overlooking the golden gate the morning had opened fine as silk but by noon the sky was hidden in clouds and the breath of the sea blew in salt and strong the whitecaps were leaping on the crest of the surges driving in through the straits and the surf bursting high on the jagged rocks at the base of the cliffs a little coast steamer from santa barbara way came pitching and plunging in from sea and one or two venturesome craft heeling far to leeward tore through the billows and tossed far astern a frothing wake with manes and tails streaming in the stiff gale the troop horses of the fourth cavalry were cropping at the scanty herbage down the northward slope and the herd guard nearest the road lost his grip on his drab campaign hat as he essayed a salute and galloped off on a stern chase down the long ravine to the east as the colonel trotted briskly by one keen glance over the bay beyond rocky alcatraz had told him the china was not yet away from her pier he might have to send a dispatch by that swift steamer and even then it would be six days getting to hawaii if the department commander should by that time be on his homeward journey the information would still be of interest to the general commanding the new military district at the cross roads of the pacific and of vast benefit possibly to his late client mr gray he wondered what cankers grounds could be for saddling so foul a suspicion on the boys good name he wondered how long that poor lad would have to struggle with this attack of fever and remain perhaps happily unconscious of this latest indignity he wondered if amy lawrence yet knew of that serious seizure and if she did what would be her sensations down the winding sloping road he urged his way glencoe his pet charger marveling at the unusual gait the cape of the sentrys overcoat whirled over the sentrys head and swished his cap off as he presented arms to the tall soldier spurring past the guardhouse i envy no one who has to put to sea this day said armstrong to himself as he turned to the right and reined up in front of a little brown cottage peeping out from a mass of vines and roses shivering in the wet wind half a dozen strides took him across the narrow walk and up the wooden steps with sharp emphasis he clanged the little gong bell screwed to the back of the door and waited impatient for the servants coming there was no answer he rang again and still again and no one came a glance at the windows told that the white lace curtains hung there draped as prettily as ever fresh flowers stood on the window sill a shawl and a pillow the latter indented as by a human head lay in the lounging chair on the little porch another chair stood but a few feet away there was even a fan though fans in a frisco summer are less needed than furs but nowhere saw he other sign of the temporary mistress of the house he went round to a side window and rapped no answer then he turned to the walk again and taking the reins bade the orderly inquire next door if mrs garrison could be found yes was the answer she went driving to golden gate park with mrs stockman an hour ago and mrs stockman was to leave for los angeles that night odd if mrs garrison drove to golden gate park the easiest and best way was that along which he came and he had met no carriage in fact not since that night at the palace had he set eyes on mrs garrison or until the coming of this sorrowful news about gray had he cared to from all that he heard mrs frank was enjoying herself at the presidio cherry having gone one way and her devotee another mrs frank speedily summoned a chum of old garrison days to come and keep house with her for a while and mrs stockman whose lord had left her at the call to duty and gone to manila with his men right gladly accepted and much enjoyed the fun and frolic that went on night after night in mrs franks cozy parlor or the mild flirtation possibly in the recesses of mrs franks embowered porch the last expedition had borne off almost all the regular element at the post but had not left it poor for fast as camp grounds could be made ready for them vastly to the disgust of the saloon keepers and streetcar magnates who had reaped rich harvest from camp merritt regiment after regiment the volunteers came marching over from the malodorous sand lots and settled down in sheltered nooks about the presidio so cavaliers in plenty were still to be had cavaliers whose wives and sweethearts as a rule were far away and mrs frank loved to console such as were so bereft the chafing dish and scotch and soda were in nightly request and even women who didnt at all fancy mrs frank and spoke despitefully of her among themselves were not slow to come in for just a minute as they said as the evenings wore on and to stay and chat with various visitors it was so lonesome and poky over home with the children asleep and nothing to do women there were who never darkened mrs garrisons door after the first formal calls but they were of those who deeply felt the separation from all they held most dear and who forbidden themselves heard with envy and even distress her gay assertion that she would sail for manila the moment the queen of the fleet was ready from what source or circumstance did she derive her influence but with the edict that no more troops should be sent came comfort to the souls of these bereaved ones transports would not go without troops and mrs frank could not go without transports the journey was far too expensive they wished her no evil of course but if they were themselves forbidden how could they rejoice that she should be permitted they were actually beginning to feel a bit charitable toward her when the queen of the fleet herself came in from honolulu with the latest news the fifth expedition had been halted there and put in camp the hospital held several officers billy gray was down with brain fever and there had been a furious scene between him and his peppery colonel before the breakdown and by that same steamer mrs garrison had got a letter that made her turn white and tremble as mrs stockman saw and told and then shut herself up in her room an entire day now for nearly a fortnight the lovely guest had been daily hinting that she really must go home dear witchie was surely tired of her and witchie disclaimed and protested and vowed she could not live without her devoted friend but then had come that letter and with it a change of tone and tactics witchie ceased to remonstrate or reprove mrs stockman and the latter felt that she must go and witchie consented without demur in no pleasant mood armstrong mounted and trotted for the east gate the road was lined with camps and volunteers at drill vehicles were frequently moving to and fro but the sentry at the entrance had kept track of them and in response to question answered promptly and positively mrs garrisons carriage had not come that way but said he the wagon with the ladys baggage did i saw the name on the trunks the colonel turned in saddle and coolly surveyed him do you mean mrs stockmans name he asked in quiet tone how many trunks were there oh some of them might have had mrs stockmans name sir but the two or three that i saw were marked m g this was unlookedfor news to her nextdoor neighbor mrs garrison had said nothing about going away with mrs stockman and armstrong had grave need to see her and to see her at once the train for los angeles did not leave until evening possibly they were lunching somewhere spending the afternoon with friends in town he rode direct to headquarters some of the staff might be able to tell was his theory and one of them justified it did i happen to meet mrs garrison yes i just saw her aboard the china aboard the china exclaimed armstrong with sudden thrill of excitement dyou mean she is going didnt ask her they were hustling everybody ashore and i had only time to give dispatches to purser but she was on the deck with friends when i came away people wondered that day at the speed with which the tall officer followed by his orderly clattered away down market street in less than ten minutes armstrong was at the crowded pier and pushing through the throng to the chinas stage too late already it was swung aloft the lines were cast loose and the huge black mass was just beginning to back slowly from its moorings the rail of the promenade deck swarmed with faces some radiant some tearful words of adieu fluttering kerchiefs waving hands tossing flowers were there on every side two officers honolulu bound shouted armstrongs name and a cheery goodby but he did not seem to hear a gentle voice the voice of all others he most longed to hear repeated the name and strove to call attention to his gesticulating comrades on the upper deck but he was deaf to both eagerly anxiously incredulously he was searching along that crowded rail and all on a sudden he saw her yes there she stood all gayety grace and animation stylishly gowned and fairly burdened with roses and it was right at him she was gazing nodding smiling all sweetness all confiding trusting joy with just a little of triumph too and a tinge of sentimental sorrow in the parting apparently it was all for him for her blue eyes never faltered till they fixed his gaze and then kiss after kiss she threw to him with the daintily gloved little hand and leaning far down over the rail lowering it toward him as much as possible she finally tossed to him standing there stern and spellbound a bunch of beautiful roses she had torn from her corsage it fell almost at his feet for in his astonishment and rising wrath he made no effort to catch it a man stooping quickly rescued and handed it to him mechanically he said thank you and took it a thorn pricking deep into the flesh as he did so and still his eyes were fixed on that fairy form now surely swiftly gliding away and over him swept the consciousness of utter defeat of exasperation of dismay even as he strove to fathom her motives in thus singling him out for such conspicuous even affectionate demonstration triumph and delight he could have understood but not not this semblance of confidential relations not at least until he felt his arm grasped by a cordial hand heard his name spoken by a friendly voice and mr primes pleasant inquiry have you no greeting for other friends then the hot blood rushed to his face and showed even through the bronze as turning his troubled eyes met full the clear placid gaze of amy lawrence chapter xiv mid october the queen of the fleet the finest transport of the pacific service thronged with boys in blue at last ordered on to manila lay at the wharf at honolulu awaiting her commanders orders to cast loose in strong force and with stentorian voices the primeval dudes joined in rollicking chorus to the crashing accompaniment of their band and when they could take time to rest the crowd ashore set up a cheer the hawaiian national band in spotless white forming a huge and melodious circle on the wharf vied with the musicians from the states in the spirit and swing of their stirring airs aloha oe aloha oe chorused the surging throng afloat and ashore as wreaths and garlands the leis of the islanders were twined or hung about some favorite officer or favored man the troops still held to service in hawaii shouted good will and goodby to those ordered on to the philippines the dudes of the queen and the lads from the prairies and the mountains on other transports anchored in the deep but narrow harbor yelled soldierly condolence to those condemned to stay the steam of the scape pipe roared loudly and belched dense white clouds on high swelling the uproar dusky little kanaka boys diving for nickels and paddling tireless about the ship added their shrill cries to the clamor the captain in his natty uniform of blue and gold stepped forth upon the bridge to take command and raised his banded cap in recognition of the constant cheer from the host ashore and the throng of blue shirts on the forecastle head then arose another shout as a veteran officer in the undress uniform of a general appeared upon that sacred bound and bowing to the crowd was escorted by the captain to the end overlooking the animated scene below and then the signal was given the heavy lines were cast off and hauled swiftly in the massive screw began slowly to churn the waters at the stern and gently almost imperceptibly at first the queen slid noiselessly along the edge of the dock to the accompaniment of a little volley of flowers and garlands tossed from eager hands and a cheer of godspeed from the swarm of upturned faces and then there uprose another shout a shout of mingled merriment surprise and applause for all on a sudden there darted up the stairway from the crowded promenade deck to the sacred perch above defiant of the lettered warning passengers are not allowed upon the bridge a dainty vision in filmy white and all in the next moment there appeared at the generals side smiling bowing blowing kisses waving adieux all sparkle animation radiance and rejoicing a bewitching little figure in the airiest loveliest of summer toilets the red cross nurses on the deck below looked at one another and gasped two brave army girls wives of wounded officers in the philippines who by special dispensation were making the voyage on the queen glanced quickly at each other and said nothing audible the general lifting his cap but looking both deprecation and embarrassment fell back and gave his place at the white rail to the new arrival and colored high when she suddenly turned and took his arm the captain trying not to see her or to appear conscious of this infraction of a stringent rule and invasion of his dignity grew redder as he shouted rapid orders and swung his big beautiful ship well out into the stream the guns of the bennington boomed a deafening salute as the queen turned her sharp nose toward the open sea and almost the last thing honolulu saw of her human freight was the tiny dainty winsome little figure in white waving a spotless kerchief as in fond farewell once clear of the narrow entrance the big troop ship headed westward toward the setting sun shook free the reins as it were and followed by less favored craft sped swiftly on her way witchie garrison the latest addition to the passenger list entirely at home if not actually in command leaning on the generals arm an hour later and deftly piloting that bewildered veteran up and down the breezy deck she came just as she had planned to come face to face once more with stanley armstrong well she knew that under the escort of that exalted rank she was safe from any possibility of cross question or interference well she knew that had he heard of her sudden determination to go to honolulu she could not have escaped stern interrogation possibly something worse and her heart failed her when she realized that the man who had gauged her shallow nature years before now held a lash over her head in the shape of the paper that mad vanity had prompted her to write and send to the officer of the guard the day that stewart sailed what madness it was indeed yet how could she have dreamed it would fall into the hands of the man of all others she feared and respected the one man who had he but cared could years ago have had her love the man who because he cared not had won her hate and now that he held or had held this paper nothing less than a forged order in her husbands name as aidedecamp to general drayton she could have cowered at his feet in her terror of him yet braved him with smiles sweetness and gayety with arch merriment and joyous words quitting for the moment the generals arm that she might extend to him both her little whitegloved hands gravely he took the left in his left while with the right he raised his forage cap in combined salute to the woman and to his superior officer gravely and almost instantly he released it and listened in helpless patience to her torrent of playful words but his eyes were on the generals face as though he would ask could he the general know the true character of the woman he had honored above all her sisterhood on board in thus taking her to the bridge whereon neither officer nor man nor nurse nor army wife had presumed to set foot on all the six days run from san francisco as though he would ask if the general knew just what she was this blithe dainty winsome little thing that nestled so confidingly indeed so snugly close to his battered side and who had virtually taken possession of him in the face of an envious and not too silent circle of her own sex truth to tell the chief would rather have escaped he was but an indifferent sailor and the queens long lazy roll over the ocean surges was exciting in his inner consciousness a longing for cracked ice and champagne he had known her but the few days the queen remained in port coaling and preparing for the onward voyage across the broad pacific but a great functionary of the general government had told him a pathetic tale the very day of his first peep at the royal hawaiian hotel had given him a capital dinner at that famous hostelry whereat she appeared in charming attire and in a flow of spirits simply irresistible her sallies of wit had made him roar with delight her mimicry of one or two conscientious but acidulated dames who had come over on the queen bound as nurses for manila had tickled him to the verge of apoplexy but when later she backed him into the coolest corner of the lanai with the plash of fountain close at hand and the sweet music of bergers famous band floating softly on the evening air and told him how her father had loved to talk of his the generals dash and daring in the great days of the great war and led him on to tell of his campaigns in the shenandoah and the west listening with dilated eyes and parted lips the campaigner himself was captivated and she had her will a great senator had told him how she had come thither to nurse a gallant young officer in her husbands regiment how she had pulled the boy through the perils of brain fever until he was now convalescent and going on to rejoin his comrades in manila and she she was pining to reach her husband now serving on general draytons staff other women were aboard the queen could not general crabb find room for her it is hard for a soldier to refuse a pretty woman or a prominent member of the committee on military affairs there was not a vacant stateroom on the ship officers were sleeping three or four in a room so were the red cross nurses and the two army wives already aboard had been assigned a little cubbyhole of a cabin in which only one could dress at a time there were only two apartments on the big craft that were not filled to their capacity the room occupied by that sea monarch the captain and that which from having been the ladies boudoir had been fitted up for the accommodation of the general the piano had been wheeled out on deck the writing table stowed away and a fine new wide brass bedstead with dainty white curtains and mosquito bar a large bureau and a washstand had been moved in and these with easychairs electric fans electric lights and abundant air made it the most desirable room on the ship even armstrong colonel commanding the troops aboard was compelled to share his little cabin with his adjutant and the generals aides were bundled into a skimpy box between decks there really seemed no place for mrs garrison aboard especially when it was found that the passenger list was to be increased by three a surgeon and two officers going forward from honolulu and one of these was our old friend and once lighthearted billy gray now nearly convalescent but weak and as all could see feverishly eager to get on to manila all this was explained to the senator it was even suggested that there was room for mrs garrison on the louisiana a safe old tub if she was slow but mrs frank looked so pathetic and resigned when this arrangement was suggested that no one had the hardihood to actually dwell upon it and the senator said it was a shame to think of it with whom of her own sex could she associate on that long hot voyage ahead of them why not transfer some of the red cross nurses to the louisiana mrs garrison had no objections but they had and the surgeon in charge made prompt and vigorous protest he knew mrs frank and she knew him and did not in the least despair she still had a plan there was a cozy dinner one evening just the evening before the departure of the queen and the gallant captain of the ship the veteran general the quartermaster in charge of transportation the member of the senate military committee some charming girls but none so charming as mrs garrison were of the party there was some sentiment and much champagne as a result of which at one am the bighearted sea monarch aforementioned swore by the bones of his ancestors in the slimy grasp of davy jones that that sweet little woman shouldnt have to go abegging for accommodations on his ship if the general would condescend to move into his room by thunder hed sleep up in his foulweather den next the chart room and mrs garrison god bless her could take the generals room and be queen of the ship queen of the queen queen of queens by jupiter and heres her health with all honor a soldier of course could be no less gallant than a sailor especially as the captains room was a bit better than the boudoir and had an ice chest and contents that the veteran campaigner was bidden to consider his own the agreement was clinched that very night before the party broke up and little mrs frank shed tears of gratitude upon the generals coat sleeve and threw kiss after kiss to the handsome sailor as she hung over the balusters of the broad veranda and waved them away in their swiftrunning cabs and then danced off to her room and threw herself on the bed after a mad pirouette about the spacious apartment and laughed and laughed until real tears trickled from her eyes and then gave orders to be called at seven oclock she meant to be up and aboard that ship with all her luggage before sense and repentance could come with the morning sun before either soldier or sailor could change his mind to the amaze of the women already aboard to the grave annoyance of colonel armstrong to the joy of poor billy gray and the mischievous merriment of several youngsters on the commissioned list mrs frank garrison the latest arrival became sole occupant of the finest room on the ship and it was a bower of lilies and tropical fruit and flowers the breezy day she sailed away from the bay of honolulu no time need be wasted in telling the effect of this assignment to quarters prolific a source of squabble as is the custom ashore it becomes intensified afloat and when coupled with it came a shaking up and rearrangement of seats at table all hope of harmony vanished on the instant the two brave young army girls still retained their seats at the captains table but two most estimable young women red cross nurses were dropped therefrom and transferred to that of the second officer on the port side much to the comfort of a rather large percentage of their sisterhood who had regarded their previous elevation with feelings of not unmixed gratification then officers who had been seated with the generals staff had to vacate in favor of mrs frank and dr prober and lieutenant billy gray whose father and the chief were longtime chums and the red cross nurses who had been at the first officers table fell back to that of the third it was every bit as good as the other but it didnt sound so and they couldnt see it and there were faces sour as the product of the ships baker when that evening all hands went down to dinner and the silence maintained or the ominously subdued tone of the talk at the other tables was in marked contrast with the hilarity that prevailed where sat the grayhaired ruddycheeked old chief and the laughing coterie that listened to the fun that fell from the lips of witchie garrison armstrong silent and somber at the captains right looking forward from time to time saw only one face at the generals table that was not lighted up with merriment it was the face of the boy he envied if envy of this kind ever entered into his heart and he wondered as he looked at billys curly head what could have come over that glad young life to leave so deep a shadow on his handsome face one night just one week later armstrongs eyes were opened more than once in the meanwhile he had invited the young officers confidence and billy who three months earlier had been all gratitude and frankness protested there was nothing on his mind he had been very ill that was all as to cankers charges they were simply rot he hadnt the faintest inkling what had become of the purloined letters any more than he had of the whereabouts of his delta sig friend young morton now officially proclaimed a deserter but armstrong heard more tales of witchies devotions to him in his illness and the slow convalescence that ensued noted how the boys eyes followed her about the deck and how many a time he would seek her side even when other men were reading walking or chatting with her armstrong looked with wonderment that was close allied to incredulity and pain was it possible that this blithe lad who had won such a warm interest in the heart of such a girl as amy lawrence could be forgetful of her faithless to her and fascinated now by this selfish and shallow butterfly it was incredible but was it the days had grown hotter the nights closer and the air between decks was stifling when the sea rolled high and closed the ports officers had taken to snoozing up on deck in steamer chairs by an unwritten law the port side of the promenade deck was given up to them after eleven at night but the women folk had the run of the starboard side at any hour when the crew were not washing down decks armstrong had been far forward about two oclock one breathless night to see for himself the condition of things in the hospital under the forecastle the main deck was crowded with sleeping forms of soldiers who found it impossible to stand the heat below so on his return instead of continuing along the gangway he decided to climb the iron ladder from the main to the promenade deck it would land him at the forward end on the starboard side there he could smoke a cigar in peace and quiet it was high time everybody was asleep but as his head and eyes reached the level of the deck he became suddenly aware of a couple huddled close together in the shelter of a canvas screen and under the steps leading aloft to the bridge he knew grays voice at once and gray was pleading he knew her tones of old and she was imperative and listening with obvious impatience for almost at the instant of his arrival she spoke low yet distinctly do as i say do as i beg you when we reach manila and then come and see how i can reward chapter xv manila at last queen city of the archipelago and manila again besieged the loveliest of the winter months was come the luneta and the paseo de santa lucia close to the sparkling waters were gay every evening with the music of the regimental bands and thronged with the carriages of oldtime residents and their new and not too welcome visitors spanish dames and damsels invisible at other hours drove or strolled along the roadway to enjoy the cool breezes that swept in from the beautiful bay and wistful peeps at the dainty toilets of the american belles now arriving by every boat from hongkong all the castilian disdain they might look and possibly feel toward the soldiery of uncle sam gave place to liveliest interest and curiosity when the wives and daughters of his soldiers appeared upon the scene and there was one carriage about which whenever it stopped a little swarm of officers gathered and toward which at any time all eyes were directed that of the white sisters within the old walled city and in the crowded districts of binondo quiapo and san miguel north of the pasig and again in paco and ermita to the south strong regiments were stationed in readiness to suppress the first sign of the outbreak so confidently predicted by the bureau of military intelligence in a great semicircle of over twenty miles girdling the city north east and south the outposts and sentries of the two divisions kept watchful eyes upon the insurgent forces surrounding them aguinaldo and his cabinet at malolos to the north had all but declared war upon the obstinate possessors of the city and had utterly forbidden their leaving the lines of manila and seeking to penetrate those broader fields and roads and villages without still hugging to its breast the delusion that a semimalaysian race could be appeased by show of philanthropy the government at washington decreed that despite their throwing up earthworks against and training guns on the american positions the enemy should be treated as though they never could or would be hostile and the privileges denied by them to american troops were by the american troops accorded to them coming and going at will through our lines they studied our force our arms equipment numbers supplies methods and long before the christmas bells had clanged their greeting to that universal feast day and the boom of cannon ushered in the new year all doubt of the hostile sentiments of the insurgent leaders had vanished already there had been ominous clashes at the front and with every day the demeanor of the philippine officers and men became more and more insolent and defiant ceaseless vigilance and selfcontrol were enjoined upon the soldiers of the united states nearly all stalwart volunteers from the far west and while officers of the staff and of the halfdozen regiments quartered within the city were privileged each day to stroll or drive upon the luneta there were others that never knew an hour away from the line of the outposts and their supports such was the case with stewarts regiment far out toward the waterworks at the east such was the case with the primeval dudes on the other side of the pasig lining the banks of the crooked estuary that formed the rubicon we were forbidden to cross such was the case with canker and the teenth in the dense bamboo thicket to the south and so it happened that at first armstrong and billy gray saw nothing of each other and but little of the white sisters probably a fortunate thing for all ever since that memorable night on the queen of the fleet gray had studiously avoided his whilom friend and counselor while the latters equally studious avoidance of mrs garrison had become observed throughout the ship the dominion and power of that little lady had been of brief duration as was to be expected in the case of a woman who had secured for her undivided use the best the airiest and by far the largest room on the steamer a cabine de luxe indeed that for a weeks voyage on an atlantic liner would have cost a small fortune while here for a sea sojourn of more than double the time under tropic skies and while other and worthier women were sweltering three in a stuffy box below it had cost but a smile the captain had repented him of his magnanimity before the lights of honolulu faded out astern the general began to realize that he had been made a catspaw of and his amour propre being wounded he had essayed for a day or two majestic dignity of mien that became comical when complicated with the qualms of seasickness there was even noticeable aversion on part of some of the officers of the dudes who having made the journey from the bay to honolulu with the women passengers army wives and red cross nurses naturally became the recipients of the views entertained by these ladies quick to see if slow to seem to see mrs frank had lost no time in begging one of the young soldier wives to share her big stateroom and broad and comfortable bed and the lady preferred the heat and discomfort betweendecks to separation from her friend then mrs garrison tendered both the run of her cabin during the day and evening suggested indeed that on hot nights they come and sleep there one on the bed and one on the couch and they thanked her but never came she coddled the general with cool champagne cup when he was in the throes of mal de mer and held him prisoner with her vivacious chatter when he was well enough to care to talk but after all her most serious trouble seemed to consist in keeping billy gray at respectful distance he sought her side day after day to armstrongs mild amaze as has been said and when he could not be with her was moody even fierce and ugly tempered he whose disposition had been the sunniest in all that gray shivery dripping sojourn at the san francisco camp but once fairly settled in manila the white sisters seemed to regain all the old ascendency colonel frost had taken a big cool roomy house surrounded by spacious grounds down in malate and close to the plashing waters of the bay duties kept him early and late at his office in the walled city but every evening after the drive and dinner callers came thronging in and all witchies witcheries were called into play to charm them into blindness and to cover nitas fitful and nervous moods now almost painfully apparent frosts face was at times a thundercloud and army circles within the outer circle of manila saw plainly that all was not harmony betwixt that veteran benedict and that fragile fluttering baby wife the bloom of nitas beauty was gone she looked wan white even haggard she had refused to leave hongkong or come to manila until margarets arrival then flew to the shelter of that sisterly wing frank garrison had been occupying a room under the same roof with his general but both general and aidedecamp were now much afield and frank spent far more days and nights along the line of blockhouses than he did at home the coming of his wife was unannounced and utterly unlooked for did i consult my husband she exclaimed in surprise when asked the question one day by the wife of a veteran field officer merciful heaven mrs lenox there was no time for that except by cable and at four dollars a word no if any doubt of what frank garrison will say or do exists in my mind i go and do the thing at once then the doubt is settled if he approve well and good if he doesnt well then ive had my fun anyway but it made little difference what frank garrison might think say or do when nitas need came in question it was for nita that margaret garrison so suddenly quitted the presidio and hastened to hawaii it was for her sake to be her counsel and protection the elder sister had braved refusal difficulties criticism even armstrongs open suspicion and dislike to take that long voyage to a hostile clime that she braved too her husbands displeasure was not a matter of sufficient weight to merit consideration she was there to help nita and until that hapless child were freed from a peril that ever threatening seemed sapping her very life margaret garrison meant to stay for the letter that came by way of honolulu had told the elder sister of increasing jealousy and suspicion on the colonels part of his dreadful rage at yokohama on learning that even there the very hour of their arrival when the consul came aboard with a batch of letters in his hand he had one for mrs frost she had barely glanced at its contents before she was stricken with a fit of trembling tore it in half and tossed the fragments on the swift ebbing tide then rushed to her stateroom there she added a postscript to the long letter penned to margaret on the voyage and the purser not her husband saw it safely started on the gaelic leaving for san francisco via honolulu that very day that letter beat the ordinary mail for the queen was heading seaward even as the gaelic came steaming in the coralguarded harbor and a little packet was tossed aboard the new troop ship as she sped away one missive in it telling witchie garrison that the man whose life had been wrecked by her sisters enforced desertion was already in manila awaiting her coming and telling her moreover that the packet placed in general draytons hands contained only her earlier letters in his reckless wrath latrobe had told her that those which bound her to him by the most solemn pledges those that vowed undying love and devotion were still in his hands and that she should see him and them when at last she reached manila three mortal weeks had the sisters been there together and never once in that time did nita venture forth except when under escort of her blackbrowed husband or the protection of her smiling witching yet vigilant margaret never once had their house been approached by any one who bore resemblance to the dreaded lover all along the calle real where were the quarters of many officers little guards of regulars were stationed for black rumors of filipino uprising came with every few days and some mens hearts were failing them for fear when they thought of the paucity of their numbers as compared with the thousands of fanatical natives to whom the taking of human life was of less account than the loss of a game chicken and in whose sight assassination was a virtue when it rid one of a foe already many an officer who had weakly yielded to the importunity of a devoted wife was cursing the folly that led him to let her join him the outbreak was imminent any one could see the war was sure to come even those who strove to banish alarm and reassure an anxious nation and when the call to arms should sound duty honor and law would demand each soldiers instant answer on the battle line then who was to care for the women the very servants in each household it was known were in most cases regularly enrolled in the insurgent army the crowded districts in the city the nipa huts surrounding the wealthy homes in the suburbs swarmed with filipino soldiery in the garb of peace arms and ammunition both were stored in the great stone churches knives bolos and pistols were hidden in every house through the clergy in some instances and foreign residents in others the statement was set afloat that every american officers residence was mapped and marked that the tagals were told off by name so many for each house in proportion to the number of american inmates and day after day awaiting the signal for their bloody work these native devotees greeted with servile bows and studied the habits of the officers they were designated to fall upon in their sleep and slay without mercy even women and children were not to be spared and many a woman hearing this grewsome story trembled in her terror for a time in dread of this new peril nita frost almost forgot the other but not so margaret she scoffed and scouted the rumor of filipino outbreak she laughed at frost who all too evidently believed in it and was in hourly trepidation he begged that the guard at his quarters might be doubled and was totally unnerved when told it might even have to be reduced not so mrs frank she made friends with the stalwart sergeant commanding always had hot coffee and sandwiches ready for the midnight relief made it a point to learn the name of each successive noncommissioned officer in charge and had a winsome smile and word for the sentries as she passed it wasnt filipino aggression that she feared the men wondered why she should so urgently bid them see that no strangers americans were allowed within the massive gates there were tramps even in manila she said when the sisters drove their natty little filipino team flashed through the lanes and streets at top speed the springy victoria bounding at their heels to the imminent peril of the cockaded hats of the dusky coach and footman if not even to the seats of those trim whitecoated bigbuttoned topbooted impassive little spanishbred servitors the carriage stopped only at certain designated points and only then when a group of officers stood ready to greet them not once had they been menaced by any one nor approached by any man even faintly resembling poor latrobe and witchie garrison was beginning to take heart and look upon that threatening letter as a mad piece of bluff when one day the unexpected happened the men of the house frost and garrison were accustomed when the latter was at home to breakfast together quite early then the colonel would drive off to the ayuntamiento in the walled city and frank would mount his pony and ride away to his long days duties later the sisters would have their leisurely breakfast secure in the protection of the guard would give their chinaman chef his orders for the day and send him off to make such purchases as were possible in the now scanty market then reading writing receiving callers of their own sex would fill up the morning there would be a brief siesta after luncheon an hour or so on the broad veranda overlooking the sparkling bay then dress and the inevitable drive of armstrong they had seen nothing heard next to nothing he was busy with his men over toward east paco of billy gray of late they had seen rather too much on one pretext after another he was now forever coming to the house and witchie was beginning to wish that canker had had his way but canker had failed dismally the witnesses he counted on proved dumb or departed and it had pleased the generalinchief to send him with a regiment of infantry and a brace of guns to garrison an important point on an adjacent island and to tell him that in view of the impossibility of his substantiating his charges against gray the youngster had some shadow of excuse for his violent outbreak rather than bring up a scandal it was best to drop the matter entirely gray had been sent to duty with the teenth before he was thoroughly well and a goodhearted battalion commander taking pity on his obvious change for the worse had found occasion after the first ten days at the front to send him back to quarters in malate instead of incessantly on duty along the threatened line toward singalon church and while he seldom came in the evening when numbers of visitors were present the boy had a way of dropping in between three and four when he could generally count on a few moments at least alone with mrs frank she had nursed him well in his slow convalescence had made deep impression on his boyish heart lacerated as he conceived it by a disappointment at home she had won him to her service as she thought until she felt sure he was ready to do almost anything for her sake then she had put him to the test and he had failed her believing as she did that the boy well knew the whereabouts of the alleged deserter morton and his friend nitas reckless lover she had counted on him to wring from them the letters poor latrobe declared he still possessed but the three weeks had passed without a sign and it was becoming evident to her that gray had lost track of them entirely one brilliant afternoon as she lay on the broad canebottomed bedstead with its overhanging canopy of filmy netting she drowsily heard the corporal posting the new sentry in the marbled corridor below and then marching the relief to the rear gate opening to the beach nita was already up and moving about in her room margaret heard the rustle of her skirts and the light patter of her tiny feet as she sped over the hardwood floor of the main salon she heard her throwing back the sliding shutters that kept out the glare of the sun in the morning hours and knew that she was gazing out over the treedotted lawn toward the gate where the guard lounged through the warm afternoon all of a sudden quick and stirring a bugle sounded over on the calle nueva where the north dakotas had a strong detachment the call was repeated and army woman though she was she did not recognize it she could not remember ever having heard it before then up the street from the engineer barrack there came thrilling echo and there was a sound of movement and excitement along the dusty thoroughfare she heard nita calling her name and then the childs quick nervous step along the hallway toward the stairs then came a sudden stop a gasping wailing cry and springing from her bed and to the door margaret found her sister cowering before a tall slender man in the rough dress and field equipment of a private soldier with a little packet letters apparently held forth in one hand while the other grasped her wrist rollin latrobe stood sternly gazing at the girl shrinking at his feet the tableau was over in another second springing up the broad marble stairs came billy gray the corporal of the guard at his heels and latrobe saw his danger in a flash throwing little gray aside as he would a terrier the young athlete whirled on the stalwart regular there was the sound of a crashing blow followed by a heavy fall the corporal went rolling down the steps with latrobe bounding over the tumbling form and the next instant he had vaulted over the ledge of the open window on the lower floor and vanished through the gateway to the beach and now all along the calle real the bugles were sounding to arms chapter xvi that was a wild day in manila far over near the escolta somebody shot at a vagrant dog lapping water from a little pool under one of the many hydrants the soldier police essayed an arrest the culprit broke and ran the guard fired a lot of coolies taking alarm fled jabbering to the river side the natives looking for trouble any moment rushed to their homes some soldiers on pass and unarmed tumbled over the tables and chairs in the alhambra in their dash for the open street a stampeded sergeant told a bugler to sound to arms and in the twinkling of an eye the call was taken up from barrack to barrack and the news went flashing out by wire to the extreme front the shopkeepers hastily put up their shutters and bolted their doors cabs carts quilez and carromattas even the street cars were instantly seized by the soldiery scattered all over town and utilized to take them tearing back to join their regiments in five minutes the business streets down town were deserted chinese cowered within their crowded huts the natives men and women either hid within the shelter of their homes or fled to the sanctuary of the many churches all over the great city the alarm spread like wildfire the battalions formed under arms those nearest the outer lines being marched at once to their positions in support those nearer the walled city waiting for orders foreign residents took matters more coolly than did the asiatic german phlegm english impassibility and yankee devilmaycarishness preventing a panic but those who had families and owned or could hire carriages and launches were not slow in seeking for their households the refuge of the fleet of transports lying placidly at anchor in the bay where deweys bluejackets shifted their quids went coolly to their stations and grouped about their guns quietly awaiting further developments in an agony of fear colonel frost had bidden his driver to lash the ponies to a gallop and go like the wind to malate but the appearance of the long ranks of sturdy infantry resting on their arms and beginning to look bored measurably reassured him before he reached his home once there however the sight of nita clinging hysterically to her sister and moaning on her bed was sufficient to determine his first move which was to wire for his launch to come around to the bay shore and take them off to the fleet the next was to send and ask for an officer and twenty men from the cuartel on receiving which message the major commanding standing on the dusty roadway in front of his men grinned under his grizzled mustache and said frosts got em again here gray you go over and tell him to keep his hair on that its nothing but a fake alarm and gray glad enough of the chance to go again into the presence of the woman who so fascinated him sped on his mission he was in a fury over his recent humiliation in her very sight he a commissioned officer tossed aside like a child and outwitted by this daring intruder in the shape of a private soldier he and his guard brushed away and derided by a young fellow in some strange regiment who had easily escaped along the beach to an adjoining inclosure into which he darted and was no more seen the streets were full of scurrying soldiers and it was the simplest thing in the world for him to mingle with them and make his way to his own command of course gray well knew who the man must be nitas troublesome lover of whom witchie had told him so much there was his chance to recover the letters and claim the reward but man and letters both had escaped his grasp and when he pulled up blown and exhausted after fruitless chase he was brought to his senses by the sight of his own men falling in for business and he had to scamper for his sword and join them that was a miserable evening margaret garrison was the only member of the household who seemed to have her wits about her and her nerves under control for frank her liege lord had his duty elsewhere and not until hours later trotted slowly home margaret plainly let gray understand how he had fallen in her estimation at being so easily tossed aside a warning finger was laid upon her lips not one word of what has happened while he is here she muttered and a nod of her fluffy head toward the perturbed colonel told plainly that the chief of the household really had no place in the family councils to the sisters that alarm was a blessing in disguise it was all sufficient to account for nitas prostration to the rash and reckless lad who claiming to be an orderly with a letter from the colonel had been passed by the gate guard to the open stairway it afforded ample cover for escape when alarmed by nitas cry gray and the corporal came springing to her aid to gray himself it gave only a few minutes forgetfulness of his trouble for smarting under the sting of a womans only halfhidden disdain he would have welcomed with almost savage joy some fierce battle with a skillful foe some scene in which he could compel her respect and admiration he was still smarting and stung when at last that opportunity came long will manila remember the night it followed close upon the heels of warnings that for weeks held every officer and man to his post of duty day after day the strain increased the insurgents crowding upon our outposts in front of santa mesa on the north and of santa ana on the south side of the pasig had heaped insult and threats upon our silent sentries compelled by orders to the very last to submit to anything but actual attack rather than bring on a battle the americans are afraid was the gleeful cry of aguinaldos officers the jeer and taunt of his men the regulars were soon to come and replace those volunteers said the wiseacre of his cabinet therefore strike now before the trained and disciplined troops arrive and sweep these big boors into the sea and on the still starlit night sooner perhaps than his confederates within the walls intended the rebel leader struck and long before the dawn of the lovely sunday morn that followed the fire flashed from forty thousand rifles in big semicircle around manila and the longexpected battle was on hours after dawn hours after the attack began the teenth were in extended battle order to the south of malate confronted by thickets of bamboo that fairly swarmed with insurgents yet only by the incessant zip and whiew of their deadly missiles and the ceaseless crackle of rifle fire could this be determined for with their smokeless powder and their indianlike skill in concealment nothing could be seen of their array over to the westward on the placid waters of the bay the huge monadnock was driving shell after shell into the dense underbrush across the abandoned rice fields and the marshy flats that lined the shore over to the east resounding cheers and crashing volleys punctuated by the sharp report of field guns told that the comrade brigade was heavily engaged and apparently driving the enemy before them to right and left their volunteer supports were banging into the brush with their heavy springfields and still there seemed no symptom of weakness along the immediate front no sign of yielding if anything the fury of the insurgent volleying increased as the sun climbed higher and all along the blueshirted line men grit their teeth and swore as they crouched or lay full length along the roadside peering through the filmy veil that drifted slowly across their front the smoke from the springfields of the volunteers to lie there longer with the bullets buzzing close overhead or biting deep into the low embankment sometimes tearing a stinging path through human flesh and bone was adding to the nerve strain of the hours gone by to rush headlong across that intervening open space through deep and muddy pools and stagnant ditch and hurl themselves upon the lurking enemy in the bamboo copse beyond had been the ardent longing of the line since daylight came to illumine the field before them yet stern orders withheld defend but do not advance said the generals message and the whisper went along from man to man there is trouble in town behind us and the chief may need us there but as eight oclock passed with no word of uprising in the rear and the cheering over toward santa ana grew loud and louder the nerve strain upon the teenth became wellnigh intolerable for gods sake cant we be doing something instead of lying here firing into a hornets nest was the murmur that arose in more than one company along the impatient line and the gruff voices of veteran sergeants could be heard ordering silence while moving up and down behind their men the line officers cautioned against waste of ammunition and needless exposure lie flat men keep down were the words we wont have to stand this forever youll soon get your chance and presently it came the cheering that had died away far over to the left beyond the wooded knolls that surrounded singalon and block house was suddenly taken up nearer at hand then crashing volleys sounded along the narrow roadway to the east and a bugle rang out shrill and clear above the noise of battle and then closer still though unseen in the gloom of the dense thicket in which they lay the men of the second battalion strung along a filipino trail that led away to the rice fields swung their big straw hats and yelled for joy a young officer his eyes flashing his face flushing with excitement came bounding out from the grove at the left of the crouching line and made straight to where the veteran battalion commander knelt in rear of his center it was billy gray adjutant of the third battalion acting that day as adjutant to the regimental commander the bullets whistled by his head as he darted springingly along and in their joy at sight of him even old hands forgot the reserve of the regular service and some man shouted now were off and the popular query whats the matter with lieutenant gray at any other time under any other circumstances both questioner and respondents who gleefully shouted hes all right would have been promptly and sternly suppressed but the senior captain at their head well knew the excitement tingling in the nerves of that longsuffering line and only smiled and nodded sympathy he saw too that gray was quivering with pentup feeling as the boy halted short saluted and striving to steady his eager voice said captain the colonel directs that you open sharp fire on the woods in your front and occupy the enemy there he is about to charge with the third battalion and drive them out of the trenches weve located over yonder and billy pointed eagerly to the left front the southeast the captains grizzled face took on a look of keen disappointment you mean weve got to stay here and see you fellows go in only for a few minutes sir the colonel says that for you to charge before hes got onto their flank would cost too many men youll get the word as soon as hes got the works well said billy boy that sounds almost epigrammatic hullo you hit stoop down here man dont try to get perforated my hat only was the answer as the boy stooped quickly to hide the irrepressible twitching about the muscles of his lips a remington had ripped from side to side tearing a way through the curly hair at the top of his head and almost scoring the scalp to save his soul he could not quite suppress the trembling of his knees but steadying himself by a great effort he continued the colonel says to commence firing by volley the moment our bugles sound the charge now i must get back all right youngster tell the colonel i savey and well do our level best only let us into it as quick as you can but gray heard only the first part of the sentence he was panting when he reached his placid graymustached chief and could only gasp out the captain understands sir and then the regimental commander simply turned to the battalion leader standing silent at his left in a little clump of timber another veteran captain grown gray as himself in long long years of service nows our time old man pitch in gray well go with him all along the line from right to left there ran the crosscountry road connecting the broader highway from malate to san rafael and paraсaque on the west and from west paco by way of singalon to pasay in front of the right wing all was swamp morass or rice fields in front of the left wing all was close dense bamboo and jungle save where the broad straight roadway led on past block house or the narrower cart track stretched southward overarched in places by spreading branches and commanded at its narrowest path by the swarm of dusky fighters in block house a year before the blueshirts stormed these forest strongholds from the south and took them from the troops of spain now they were compelled to turn and storm them from the north for just as stanley armstrong said at san francisco the filipinos had turned upon their ally and wouldbe friend aguinaldo had bearded uncle sam and while the volunteers and regulars to the right could only remain in support it fell to the lot of the left wing of this brave brigade to assault in almost impenetrable position an enemy armed with magazine rifles or breechloaders and entirely at home the bugles rang the signal the officers in silence took their stations and stepping into the narrow pathways through the jungle crouching along the roadways or crashing through the stiff bamboo the blueshirts drove ahead two three minutes and their purpose seemed undiscovered then suddenly block house blazed with fire and a storm of bullets swept the road the earthworks in the thickets to the right and left seemed to be crowded with a running flame and down on their faces fell the foremost soldiers their gallant leader shot through and through plunging headlong yet in his dying agony waving his surviving men to get to cover vengefully now the krags opened in reply to remington and mauser the blueshirts struggled on inch by inch through the network of bamboo still the storm swept up the roadway and no man could hope to face it and live but little by little the lowaimed steady volleys driven in by squad and section through the canebreak or by company and platoon across the westward swamps told on the nerve and discipline of the little brown men in the bamboo their shots flew swift but wild and higher then a daring lad in the rough field uniform of a subaltern of infantry sprang like a cat into the fireflashing lane and revolver in hand and a squad of devoted fellows at his heels dashed straight at the wooden walls ahead in frantic haste the occupants blazed shot after shot upon him and his heroic followers one after another three went down but in another instant the lieutenant leading they reached the block house and darted through the open doorway the last of its garrison fleeing in panic before such unheardof daring and determination and then came the rush of comrades cheering down the lane tumbling over the earthworks and the luckless gang that still crouching there held to their position and all the southward leading road was ours but over along the next lane a parallel track through the timber there had been as stern a check and the fury of the fire from the trenches in the thickets forced brave men to cover and dropped others in their tracks by god we must have it almost screamed a tall captain pointing with his sword to the flashing block house half hidden in the trees hear those fellows on the other road dont let them beat us come on lads and out he darted into the open an instant target for a score of mausers out too leaped half a dozen men one a tall lithe superbly built young athlete with a face aflame with resolution and rage of battle out leaped billy gray from the corner of the crossroad and cheering madly called on others to follow down went the captain shot through the knee down went the nearmost man the tall youth who was first to follow down went a brawny sergeant who had stopped to raise his fallen captain but on swept a score of others while the bamboos blazed with the fierce volleying of the krags forward in scores now yelling like apaches rushed the regulars and somehow he never just knew how it happened gray found himself a moment later straddling an old field gun in a whirl of dust and dirt and smoke and cheers was conscious of something wet and warm streaming down his side and of being tenderly lifted from his perch by brawny bluesleeved arms given a sip from a canteen and then halfled halfsupported back to where the surgeon was already kneeling by the tall young soldier on whose brow the last dew was settling on whose fine clearcut face the shadow of the death angels wings was already traced the poor fellows eyes opened wearily as he sipped the stimulant pressed upon him by eager sympathetic hands and glanced slowly about as though in search of some familiar face and so they fell on those of billy gray who forgetful for the moment of his own hurt threw himself by the strangers side and seized his clammy hand a half smile flitted over the pale face the other hand groped at the breast of his blue shirt and slowly drew forth a packet stained and dripping with the blood that welled slowly from a shothole in the broad white breast give to general drayton promise he gasped and pushed it painfully toward billy gray then the brave eyes closed the weary head fell back and gray staring as though in stupefaction into the placid face found himself drooping too growing dizzy and faint and reeling but still holding on to his trust dont some of you know him asked the surgeon hes past helping now poor lad here you drink this billy and he placed a little silver cup at grays pallid lips he came arunnin from over at block house with a note from division headquarters just as we went in said a veteran sergeant drawing the back of a powderstained hand across his dripping forehead then respectfully stepping back as a young officer bent down and glanced at gray much hurt billy old man no thank god for that look at who where why god of heaven its pat latrobe oh pat pat dear old boy has it come to this chapter xvii in the fortnight of incessant action that followed the mad attack of that starlit sunday morning there was no place for billy gray sorely wounded yet envied by many a fellow soldier for the glowing words in which the brigade commander praised his conduct and urged his brevet the boy had been carried back to the great reserve hospital at malate the breezy wards were filled with sick or wounded and certain of the rooms of the old convent once used for study and recitation had been set apart for officers there were three cots in the one to which they bore him and two were already occupied even in his pain and weakness he could hardly suppress a cry of dismay for there with his arm bandaged and in splints his face white from loss of blood his eyes closed in the sleep of utter exhaustion lay stanley armstrong time and again the boys heart and conscience had rebuked him for the estrangement that had arisen between him and this man who had proved his best friend time and again he had promised himself that he would strive to win back that friendship but well he knew that first he must reinstate himself in armstrongs respect and how could he hope for that so long as he surrendered to the fascinations that kept him dangling about the dainty skirts of witchie garrison oddly enough the boy had hardly bothered his head with any thought of what frank garrison might think of his attentions or devotions whatever they could be called to this very captivating and capricious helpmate when a husband is so overwhelmed with other cares or considerations that he never sees his wife from morn till night society seems to correspondingly lose sight of him down in the depths of his heart the boy was ashamed of himself he never heard armstrong mentioned that he did not wince he knew and she knew that coming suddenly upon them as armstrong had that tropic night on the queen he must have heard her words must have realized that some compact or understanding existed between them which neither gray nor mrs frank could palliate or explain it had not needed that episode to tell her that armstrong held her in contempt and yet when they chanced to meet she could smile up into his eyes as beamingly as guilelessly as though no shadow of sin had ever darkened her winsome face but not so gray he moaned in secret over the loss of a strong mans confidence and esteem he longed to find a way to win it back he had even thought to go to the colonel with his trouble make a clean breast of it tell him the truth that he had fallen deeply as it was possible for him to fall in love with amy lawrence had hoped his love was returned had found it was not that she had only a frank friendly kindly interest in him and that wounded and stung he had fretted himself into a fever at honolulu aided by cankers aspersions and then well any man is liable said billy to himself to get smitten with a woman who tenderly and skillfully nurses him day after day and thats just what witchie garrison did but somehow the opportunity to tell him never seemed to come and now now that armstrong and himself were thus thrown together with the prospect of being in the same room day and night for the best of the month a third officer a stranger lay there too and in his presence or hearing any confidences would be impossible even if armstrong encouraged them which he probably would not in this embarrassment billys wish was that the colonel were fifty miles away it was fate and a hard one thought he that brought him there an everpresent reproach it was luck of the worst kind that they should be confronted under such circumstances since neither could retreat he submitted in anxious silence to the keen quick examination of the skillful surgeon in charge and to the redressing of his wound he could have been proud and happy but for that shadow on his life of which armstrongs presence would so constantly remind him he could not even think how his dear old dragoon daddy would rejoice in the congratulations that would surely greet him when the story of the brave dash of the teenth billy among the foremost should reach the states he could not even dream how it might affect her amy lawrence he was beginning to be ashamed now in this presence to think how that other how margaret garrison might be impressed forgetting that to the army girl who has lived long years on the frontier tales of heroism are the rule not the exception he wondered how long it could be before she would come to him to bring him comfort surely by this time she knew that he had been seriously painfully wounded he did not know however that at the very first sound of battle frost had bundled the sisters aboard his launch and steamed away to the transports yet what comfort could her visit bring to him with that stern censor lying there seeing and hearing all billy gray that monday night could almost have wished that armstrongs slumber might be eternal never dreaming that before a second monday should come he would thank heaven with grateful heart for armstrongs presence vigilance and intervention in three days the colonel was able to sit up within the week he was permitted to take air and exercise in the spacious court of the old college his sword arm in its sling but gray and the young officer of volunteers were too seriously wounded to leave their pillows the teenth had occupied a new line far south of the old one but one at a time several of billys brother officers had dropped in to see him and tell him regimental news and one of them the young west pointer who had broken down at sight of the dying face that stirring sunday morning told him of latrobes soldier funeral and of general draytons presence and speechless grief and billys hand groped beneath the pillow for that little bloodstained packet still undelivered he had promptly caused the information to be conveyed to the veteran commander that it was his own lost nephew who had died his soldier death in front of the firing line but the packet still remained in his hands and even before the tiny thermometer confirmed his views the keen eye of the surgeon saw that something had heightened billys fever that day and so when just at sunset there came driving into the court the most stylish equipage in all manila and mrs garrison fluttered up the broad stairway and confidently asked to be announced to mr gray the steward in charge of the floor was very very sorry but the doctor had given instructions that no more visitors should see the young gentleman that day mrs frank smiled indulgently and asked for the doctor himself and beamed on him with all her witchery and begged for just a few words but the suave placid yet implacable doctor said he too was sorry sorry that mr gray was not able to see any one else but such was the case mrs garrison said she thought if mr gray knew that it was but perhaps dr frank didnt know it was she who had nursed mr gray so assiduously at honolulu dr frank did know that and more but he did not say so neither did he yield there were tears in her eyes as she sprang into her carriage again but they were tears of anger and defeat she dashed them away the very next instant and smiled joy and congratulation even adulation at sight of the tall stalwart officer his arm in a sling who stood the center of a staring group as her carriage flashed by she would have ordered stop but while the rest of the party had gazed as they lifted their caps armstrongs uninjured hand performed its duty his cap had been lifted with the others but not so much as a glance went her way and margaret garrison bitter in spirit drove on down past the old cuartel to her luxurious quarters where nita a piteous shadow of the sweet girl graduate of the year before was awaiting her coming with the insurgents retreat and the advance of the american lines there had been a gradual return of the refugees among the transports and frost had finally brought his birdling back to shore but nita dare not drive she said for fear of again seeing those stern reproachful eyes the guard at the gate had received orders to admit no more of the rank and file even when they came as messengers and so the child was safe said margaret as for herself she must drive she must see will gray but the instant she reentered the house mrs garrison knew that during her brief absence some new trouble had come good heavens could she never leave nitas side that harm did not befall her at the head of the broad flight of stairs stood her brotherinlaw a black frown on his brow go in and do what you can for her he briefly said i thought shed be glad to know that that fellow would trouble her no more that fellow she gasped you mean i mean yes latrobe killed and buried a whole week ago and you told her she cried clinching her little hands in impotent wrath you brute another week rolled by the tide of battle had swept inland and northward and all eyes were on the plucky advance of macarthurs strong division while far out to the south and east the thinned and depleted lines of anderson held an insurgent force that forever menaced but dare not attack the primeval dudes sorely missing their calmly energetic colonel had drifted into a war of words with their nearest neighbors on the firing line a far western regiment gifted with great command of language and small regard for style the latter had crowed mightily over their more rigorously disciplined comrades because of the compliments bestowed on them in an official report wherein the dudes received only honorable mention it was captain stricker of the volunteers who had led the dash on the rebel works across the tripa to the left of blockhouse it was their sergeant finney who whacked a filipino major with the butt of his springfield and tumbled out of him the batch of reports and records that gave the numbers and positions of every unit of pilars division on the southward zone it was their corporal norton who got the mauser through the shoulder just as foremost in the rush he bayoneted the last tagal at the krupp guns in the river redoubt it was his devoted bunky private latrobe who volunteered to carry the division commanders dispatch across the open rice field and the yawning ditches that separated the staff from the rest of the charging teenth and who died gloriously in the rush on the rebel works man after man of the woolly westerners had been referred to by name while but the dudes had nothing to show but their wounded colonels modest report that where every officer and man appeared to do his whole duty it would be unjust to make especial mention of even a limited few the dudes were getting hot over the taunts of the toughs as some one had misnamed their neighbors and one night when there was more or less interchange of pointed chaff in lieu of fight with a common foe there was heard a shrill voice from the flank of the rifle pit nearest the westerners and what it said was repeated in wonderment over the brigade before the dudes were another day older well dash your thievin gang we made our record for ourselves anyhow we didnt have to rely on any dashed deserters from the regulars as you did and that was why sergeant sterne of the dudes was sent for by the field officers of both regiments the following morning and bidden to explain which he did in few words he was ready to swear that the wounded corporal norton was the very same young man he saw in the adjutants office of the teenth regulars at camp merritt and was then called morton and that evening the veteran sergeant major of the teenth was bidden to report at the reserve hospital in ermita close to the malate line was conducted to the bedside of a pallid young soldier whose ticket bore the name of norton and was asked to tell whether he had ever seen him before i have sir said the veteran sadly and gravely he is a deserter from the teenth his name on our rolls was morton and that night colonel armstrong cabled to primate new york the single word found nor was it likely the lad would soon be lost again for a sentry with fixed bayonet stood within ten feet of his bed with orders not to let him out of his sight a second mrs garrison appeared at the hospital that very evening and heard of the episode and reached billy grays bedside looking harassed even haggard during the past three days she had been accorded admission for gray was so much improved there was no reason to longer forbid but on each occasion the wounded volunteer officer and the brace of attendants present had precluded all possibility of confidential talk she must bide her time gray would be up in a few days said the doctor and then nothing would do said mrs garrison but he must be moved to their big roomy lovely house on the bay side and be made strong and well again made to give up those letters too thought she for she had wormed it out of a bystander that a packet of some kind had been given by the dying soldier to the lieutenant and she well knew what it must be she had even penned him a little note since not a whisper could be safely exchanged and headed it give this back to me the moment you have read it in it she reminded him of his promise and did he need to be reminded of hers she knew that packet of nitas letters had been intrusted to his care she assured him she had it straight from the surgeon who attended both latrobe and himself and they must reach the hands of no man on earth but must come to her would he not give them at once or tell her where she could find them he gave back the note but closed his eyes and turned away in the presence of armstrong day after day and in the recollection of latrobes dying face and the last parting touch of his stricken hand grays eyes were opening to his own deplorable weakness she plainly saw her power was going if not gone he had wrapped a silk handkerchief about the packet and still kept it with his watch and purse beneath his pillow he would not tell her where it lay she smiled archly for the benefit of the attendant but her eyes again eagerly claimed a look from his her lips framed the word tomorrow but neither on that morrow nor yet the next day came her opportunity the gallant fellow who had lain there for days dumb and patient but a barrier to her plans had taken a turn for the worse and she was again denied admission then came the tidings that the barrier was removed the long fight was over and the heartless woman actually rejoiced now at last she could talk to will gray and when midnight came she knew that now at last she must for frank garrison worn and weary returning late from the front briefly announced that general drayton purposed visiting the hospital the following afternoon and long before noon long before visiting hours in fact she was there with flowers as winsome as her smile and some jelly as dainty as her own fair hands she was there and the instant the hour sounded was ushered in and billy gray propped on his pillows was writing to his father and alone no time was to be lost any moment the attendant might return she threw herself on her knees beside the homely narrow cot seized his hand in hers and looked him in the face where are they will she pleaded quick i must have them now but well she realized that the spell was broken that the old fascination had died its death then it was useless to hint at love and in a torrent of impassioned words she bade him think of all he owed her appealed to his sense of gratitude and honor and there too failed for admitting all she claimed he clumsily haltingly yet honestly told her he saw now that it was all for an object all done in the hope that he might become her instrument for the recovery of those compromising letters and now that fate had delivered them into his hands he was bound by honor and his promise unheard unspoken perhaps but all the same his promise to the dead to give them to general drayton then rising in fury and denunciation she played her last trump trembling from head to foot pale with baffled purpose and with growing dread she bent over him both hands clinched you mad fool she cried do you know what i can do will do unless you give them to me here and now as god hears me will gray i will give that other packet to general drayton myself and swear that colonel canker was right that you were the thief he thought you and that i got those letters from you for a moment she stood there menacing at his bedside looking down in almost malignant triumph on his amazed and incredulous face and then with an awful fear checking the beat of her heart and turning her veins to ice she grasped at the flimsy framework that supported the netting over the cot and stood swaying and staggering her eyes fixed in terror on the man in the uniform of a colonel who quietly entering stood between her and the door two papers in his halfextended hand a man whose voice long and too well known cut her to the very quick as she heard in calm and measured tone the words mrs garrison here are two reasons why you will do nothing of the kind shall i hand these to general drayton or to your husband chapter xviii the long wait for the coming of the big transports with the regulars was over for the first time in history america was sending her soldiery past the pyramids and through the indian sea landing them after forty days and nights of voyaging upon the low flat shores that hem manila bay and shoving them out to the hostile front before their sealegs could reach the swing and stride of the marching step yet to all appearance as unconcernedly at home as though they had been campaigning in the philippines since the date of their enlistment this to be sure in the case of more than half their number would have given them scant time in which to look about them since raw recruits were more numerous than seasoned men but no matter what may be his lack of drill or preparation the average anglosaxon never seems to know the time when he doesnt know how to fight so with all the easy assurance of a veteran our yankee tommies wriggled into their blanket rolls and trudged away to the posts assigned them and once more the army assumed the aggressive there were changes in the composition of the forces even before the move began the dudes and the toughs parted company and the former with stanley armstrong once more riding silent at their head joined forces with stewarts riddled regiment up the railway toward malolos colonel frost had succeeded in convincing the surgeons that he would be as out of place as his name itself in such a clime and climate and was in daily expectation of an order home billy gray mending only slowly had been sent to corregidor where the bracing breezes of the china sea drove their tonic forces through his lungs and veins and the faintly rising hue of coming health back into his hollow cheeks the boy had been harder hit than seemed the case at first said the fellows of the teenth but the wise young surgeon of the second reserve and a gravefaced colonel of infantry could have told of causes little dreamed of in the regiment were either given to telling the half of what he knew that something most unusual had occurred in the room of mr gray the day that the sadfaced kind old general visited the hospital at least half a dozen patients could have told for an attendant went running for one of the women nurses and the doctor himself hurried to the scene it was on his arm that half an hour later mrs garrison slowly descended the stairs her flimsy white veil down and silently bowed her thanks and adieux as the doctor closed the door of her carriage and nodded to the little coachman it was the doctor who suggested to colonel frost that manila air was not conducive to his wifes recovery and recommended nagasaki as the place for her recuperation until he could join her and take her home the esmeralda bore the white sisters over hongkong way within a week and they left without flourish of trumpet with hardly the flutter of a handkerchief for since the battle of the th of february neither had been seen upon the luneta their women friends were very few the men they knew were mainly at the front the story got out somehow that garrison had asked to be relieved from further duty as aidedecamp and returned to duty with his regiment and that drayton would not have it the generals manner toward that hardworking staff officer though often preoccupied as of old grew even kinder he did not see the sisters off for china he was far too busy was the explanation but he offered garrison a fortnights leave and urged his taking it and was obviously troubled when garrison declined you need rest and the change of air more than any man i know said he but garrison replied that change of scene and air would not help him there were two young fellows in khaki uniforms landed from the hospital launch on the back trip from corregidor one warm march day one wore the badge of a subaltern of the teenth regulars the other the chevrons of a corporal and the hatband of a famous fighting regiment of volunteers yet the same carriage bore them swiftly through the sentineled streets of the walled city and the guards at the ayuntamiento sprang to their arms and formed ranks at sight of it then dispersed at the lowtoned order of its commander when it was seen that instead of stopping at the curb and discharging an elderly general officer it whirled straight by and held two youths in field uniform one of ems young gray of the teenth he that was hit in the charge on the pasay road said the officer of the guard to a comrade but who the devils the other he had corporals chevrons on some fellow just got a commission perhaps and that was the only way the soldier could account for a corporal riding with a commissioned officer in a generals carriage they had a long whirl ahead of them these two and the corporal told gray as he already had the general and colonel armstrong much of the story of his friendship for pat latrobe of that poor fellows illness at san francisco and all the trouble it cost his friend and chum there was a strong bond between them he explained and the blush of shame that stole up in the face of the narrator found instant answer in that of billy gray determined to see service at the front and not return to punishment in his regiment never dreaming that in quitting a corps doomed apparently to inaction at home and joining one going straight to the enemys country he was committing the grave crime of desertion gov prime had spoken to some men in stewarts regiment and was bidden to come along and fetch his friend for they were just as ignorant as he having still considerable money gov had bought civilian clothes and all the supplies they needed while about town and hired a boat that rowed them with certain items contraband of war to the dark side of the transport as nightfall came and they were easily smuggled aboard and into uniform and then during the few days stay at honolulu were formally enlisted and no embarrassing questions asked and now poor pat was gone and primes father had been cabling for him to return home but there was that awkward matter about the desertion general drayton was trying to have it straightened out at washington for he had been kindness itself the day of his visit to the hospital where almost his first act had been to seek out the wounded young soldier who had been his beloved nephews boon companion and at one time sole support the sentry was relieved of his surveillance and corporal norton transferred to corregidor to recuperate and now that both lads were well on the road to recovery drayton had sent for them strictly speaking some one should have seen to it that corporal norton of the volunteers was shifted back to private norton of the teenth and the chevrons stripped from his sleeves but no one had cared to interfere where the worsted was concerned especially as the boy had won such praise for bravery at concordia bridge so there the chevrons stood when the two were ushered into the presence of the grayhaired chief and he arose and stepping forward held out a hand to each i want you boys said he to be ready to take the next transport home the doctors say you need a sea voyage gray so there is the order the doctors say your father needs you prime and the record will be duly straightened out in washington the charge of desertion no doubt will be removed its a matter of influence tonight you dine with me here and i have asked your good friend colonel armstrong to come again the blood rose guiltily to billys cheek not yet had he made his peace with his conscience and that valued counselor and invaluable friend from whose good graces he seemed to have fallen entirely not once had opportunity been afforded in which to speak and open his heart to him as for writing that seemed impossible billy could handle almost any implement better than a pen but even in the few minutes left him in which to think he knew that now at least he must face the music like the man his father would have him be even though it took more nerve than did that perilous dash on the tagal works that sunday morning billy would rather do that twice over than have to face armstrongs stern searching eyes and hear again the cold almost contemptuous tone in which the colonel said to him the day the doctor led his vanquished and hysterical charmer from the room dont try to thank man try to think what you risk what you deserve to lose for putting yourself in the power of such a woman from that day until this here on the banks of the swiftrunning pasig they had not met at all and it seemed to gray as though armstrong had aged a year there was a lump in his throat as he went straight up to the colonel his blue eyes never flinching though they seemed to fill and bravely spoke colonel armstrong i have an explanation that i owe to you will you give me a few minutes on the gallery certainly gray was the calm reply and the youngster led the way it was a broken story it told of his desperation and misery through cankers persecution of his severe illness then of the utter weakness and prostration then her coming and with her comfort peace reassurance gradual return to health and with that gradual surrender to his nurses fascinations then her demand upon him her plea her final insistence that he should prove his gratitude and devotion by getting for her those dangerous letters and his weakness in letting her believe he could and would do so that was the situation when they went on to manila and armstrong knew the rest knew that but for his timely aid she might have triumphed over his repentance but armstrong had come had vanquished her and poor latrobes last wishes were observed the fateful packet containing the three letters that were most important was placed in his uncles trembling hand but how was it what was it that so utterly crushed her asked billy when the colonel had once more extended his hand the evidences of her own forgery her own guilt said armstrong gravely one was the order she wrote in excellent imitation of her husbands hand and signature authorizing the changing of guard arrangements on the wharf the evening stewart sailed the other was a note in pencil also purporting to come from him directing old keeny you remember the generals irish orderly to search for a packet of letters that had come by mail and must be in the generals tent either about his desk or overcoat and to bring them at once to room number so and so at the palace of course neither the general nor garrison was there when he arrived with them but she was and with all her fascinations she got the irishman half drunk and told him a piteous story and made him swear hed never tell the general or anybody if questioned he could plead he had gone out and got a little full with the boys she gave him money a big bit too and he got more than full the very vehemence of his denials made me suspect him said armstrong but he was firm when examined the general never required him to remain at the tent at night he could go to town any evening he wished and to cover his appearing at the palace where the general long had a room and where he was well known he could say he was only in to have a word with one of the housemaids and to give mrs garrison a handkerchief one of the ladies must have dropped but one thing she failed in getting the letter back keeny had left it at camp in the pocket of his old blouse and when he sobered up and all the questions were asked he hung onto it in case the truth came out in order that he might save himself from punishment but it broke him he got to drinking oftener and the general had to send him to his regiment and then when we heard of cankers charge against you i saw the way to wring the truth out of him he worshiped your father as did every irish dragoon that ever rode under him and i told him you were to be brought to trial for the crime then he broke down and gave the truth and her penciled order to me in the silence that followed the soldier of forty and the lad of only twentyone sat looking gravely into each others face it was armstrong who spoke again gray it was manly in you to tell me your story and your trouble i could help you here but who can help you when you have to tell it next time next time father do you mean queried gray a puzzled look in his blue eyes i hadnt thought do you know to worry dear old dad unless he asked armstrongs grave face grew dark you ought to know what i mean gray this story may come up when least you think for and would you have it told miss lawrence before she hears it from you miss lawrence answered billy flushing isnt in the least interested do you mean that you are not that you were not engaged to her the colonel had been gazing out over the swirling river but now with curious contraction of brows with a strong light in his eyes he had turned full on the young officer engaged to her do you suppose i could have been been such an ass if she would have had me no she she had too much sense it was full a minute before armstrong spoke again for a few seconds he sat motionless gazing steadily into grays handsome blushing face then he turned once more and looked out over the pasig and the scarred level of the rice fields beyond and the long slant of the sunshine on distant towers and neighboring roofs and copse and wall and the unlovely landscape seemed all tinged with purple haze and tipped with gold the blare of a bugle summoning the men to supper seemed softened by distance or some new strange intonation and gave to the ugliest of all our service calls the effect of soft sweet melody and there was sympathy and genuine feeling in the deep voice as he once again held out his hand to billy forgive me lad for i judged you more harshly than you deserved one lovely summerlike evening some five weeks later in long heaving surges the deep blue waves of the pacific came lazily rolling toward the palmbordered beach at waikiki bursting into snowy foam on the pebbly strand and softly hissing swept like fleecy mantle up the slope of wet hardbeaten sand then broke lapping and whirling about the stone supports of the broad lanai of one of the many luxurious homes that dot the curving line of the bay to the east of honolulu dimly outlined in the fairy moonlight the shadowy mountains of the waianai range lay low upon the western horizon eastward the bare bold volcanic upheaval of diamond head gleamed in bold relief reflecting the silver rays here and there through the foliage shone the softcolored fires of chinese lanterns and farther away along the concave shore distant electric lights twinkled like answering signals to the stars in the vault of blue and the riding lights of the few transports or warships swinging at anchor on the tide from a little grove of palms close to the low sea wall came the soft tinkle of guitar and now and then a burst of joyous song while under the spreading roof of the broad portico or lanai the murmur of voices the occasional ripple of musical laughter the floating haze of cigarette smoke told where a party of worshipers were gathered rejoicing in the loveliness of nature and the night it was a reunited party too and in the welcome of their winsome hostess in the soft soothing influence of that summer clime and through the healing tonic of the long sea voyage faces that had been saddened by deep anxiety but a few weeks gone smiled gladness into one another now a tall grayhaired man reclined in an easy lounging chair his eyes intent on the clearcut face of a young soldier in trim white uniform who with much animation was telling of an event in the recent campaign by his side her humid eyes following his every gesture sat a tall dark stylish girl whose hand from time to time crept forth to caress his an evident case of sister worship close at hand another young fellow in spotless white his curly head bent far forward his elbows on his knees his fingertips joining was studying silently the effect of his comrades story on another a fair girl whose sweet face serene and composed was fully illumined by the silvery light of the unclouded moon coming by transport via honolulu govs cabled message had brought father and sister to meet him at these famed crossroads of the pacific and whither they journeyed amy lawrence too must go said they and glad of opportunity to see the land of perennial bloom and sunshine and wearied with long long months of labor in the service of the red cross the girl had willingly accepted their invitation coaled and provisioned the transport had pushed on for the sevenday run for san francisco but the recovering of his longlost son and the soft reposeful atmosphere of the lovely yet isolated island group had so benefited mr prime that in family council it had been decided wise for them to spend a week or ten days longer at the royal hawaiian and the boys had found no difficulty in holding over for the sedgwick that followed swift upon the heels of their own ship five joyous days had they together and this the fifth had been spent in sightseeing beyond the lofty pali of the northward side the o o liner was coming in from yokohama even as they drove away and as they sat at dinner on the open lanai long hours later it had been mentioned by their host that the sedgwick too had reached the harbor during the afternoon and that army people were passengers on both liner and transport billy gray for one began to wish that dinner were over he was eager to get the latest news from the philippines and the sedgwick left manila full a week behind their slower craft did you hear who came with her he somewhat eagerly asked or on the doric he continued with less enthusiasm i did not was the answer that is on the sedgwick and the gentleman baited lamely and glanced furtively and appealingly at his wife there was that embarrassing interrogative silence that makes one feel the futility of concealment it was miss lawrence who quickly came to his relief and dispelled the strain on the situation i should fancy very few army people would choose that roundabout way from manila when they can come direct by transport and have the ship to themselves well er yes certainly certainly answered the helpless master of the house dodging now the warning and reproach in the eyes of his wiser mate at the other end of the table the crack of a coachmans whip and the swift beat of trotting hoofs on the graveled road in front could be heard as he faltered on the gleam of cab lights came floating through the northward shrubbery except of course when they happen to be er already well you know at hongkong or nagasaki he lamely concluded there was an instant hurried glance exchanged between gray and prime then up spoke in silvery tone their hostess other officers you know are ordered home we have just heard today that colonel frost comes very soon his health seems quite shattered i believe you knew of them slightly that is to say miss prime did you not but even with her words she cast an anxious furtive glance along the dim reach of the lanai for the pitapat of footfalls the swish of feminine draperies was distinctly heard two dainty whiterobed forms came floating into view and with changing color their hostess suddenly arose and stepped forward to meet them just one second of silence intervened then all grace and gladness smiles and cordiality both her little hands outstretched mrs frank garrison came dancing into their midst her sister more timidly following dear mrs marsden how perfectly kiss kiss delicious yes this is the baby sister ive raved to you about we go right on with the doric but i had to bring her out with me that you might have just one glance at her why mr prime why what could be more charming than to find you here and gov too you wicked boy what wont i do to you for never telling me you were in manila and mildred kiss kiss despite a palpable dodge and heightened color on part of the halfdazed recipient and you too miss lawrence both hands but no kiss one hand calmly accepted ah then i know how happy you are mr willie gray beaming arch smiles upon that flushed and flustered young officer then turning again to twine a jeweled arm about the slim waist of their hostess to whom she clung as though defying any effort to dislodge yet pleading for protection who on earth could have foretold that we of all people should have met out here of all places how long did you say you had been here a week and of course dear mrs marsden has done everything to make it lovely for you i should have died without her and so the swift play of words went on the rapid fire of her fluent tongue covering the movement of her allies and drowning all possibility of reply it was an odd and trying moment mrs marsden well knowing as who in honolulu did not of mrs franks devotion to the young lieutenant barely six months agone was striving to welcome the shrinking little scarefaced thing that blindly and helplessly had drifted in in the elder sisters wake the introductions that followed after the american fashion were as perfunctory as wellbred women can permit the greetings were almost solemn smileless and on part of nita fluttering to the verge of a faint and nothing but witchies plucky and persistent support and the light flow of airy chat and laughter carried her through the ordeal the two young soldiers stood stiffly back redfaced and blackbrowed the father pallid and cold could hardly force himself to unbend yet his lips mumbled the name mrs frost as he bowed at presentation miss prime stood erect and trembling miss lawrence with brave eyes but heightened color to leave at once was impossible to remain was more than embarrassment most gallantly did they battle mrs marsden and mrs frank to lift the wet blanket from the group and relieve the strain reward came to crown their efforts in strange unlookedfor fashion hoofs wheels and flashing lights were again at the entrance gate even as mrs frank sparkling with animation distributing her gay good humor over the silent semicircle suddenly exclaimed oh if id only known you were here i could have provided the one thing to make our reunion complete if we were not going on at daybreak i should do it yet then hoofs and wheels and lights had come to a stop at the front of the house and in measured martial tread a mans footsteps were heard upon the lanai then all of a sudden with a cry of joy witchie burst in again should do it i shall do it said i not i was the fairy queen behold me summon my subjects from the ends of the obedient earth and waving her parasol as she would a wand gayly pirouetting as she had that night in the tent at old camp merritt she danced forward sound ye the trumpets slaves hail to the chief see the conquering hero comes enter brevet brigadiergeneral stanley armstrong though his arm is anything but strong bowing gravely to the sprite in front of him vaguely to the group in the shaded light at the edge of the lanai and joyously to the little hostess as almost hysterically she sprang forward and clasped his hands the colonel of the primeval dudes stood revealed before them colonel armstrong how when did you get here what does this mean is your arm quite well again why didnt you let us know you were coming were the questions rained upon him by mrs marsden immediately followed by the somewhat illogical statement that she was actually breathless with surprise shall i answer in their order said he smiling down at her flushed and joyous face by the sedgwick this afternoon that i wished to see you doing quite well because i didnt know myself until two days before we sailed then as he stood peering beyond her she would have turned him to her other guests had not mrs garrison made instant and impulsive rush upon him as fairy queen or fairy godmother i claim first speech she gayly cried what tidings of my liege lord and where is hers my fairy sisters she demanded waving in front of him her filmy parasol and pirouetting with almost girlish grace captain garrison was looking fairly well the day i sailed he answered briefly and colonel frost left for hongkong only a few hours before in hopes as we understood of finding mrs frost at yokohama permit me he added with grave courtesy i have but little time as i transfer to the doric tonight a shade spread over the radiant face one instant but was as quickly swept away and i have not met your guests he finished turning to mrs marsden as he spoke and quietly passing mrs garrison in so doing the next moment he was shaking hands with the entire party coming last of all to amy lawrence they told me of your being here he said looking straight into her clear beautiful eyes and i thought i might find you at mrs marsdens she was our best friend when we were in honolulu they told me too that you desired to go by the doric but feared she would be crowded he continued turning to mr prime there is one vacant stateroom now its occupants have decided to stay over and visit the islands there will be i think another and drawing a letter from an inner pocket he calmly turned to nita now shrinking almost fearfully behind her sister the colonel gave this to me to hand to you mrs frost on the chance of your being here he will arrive by next weeks steamer and pardon me it is something i think you should see at once as a change in your plans may be necessary it was vain for margaret to interpose the letter was safely lodged in her sisters hands and with so significant a message that it had to be opened and read without delay gayly excusing herself and with a low reverence and comprehensive smile to the assembled party she ushered her sister into the long parlor and the curtain fell behind them there followed a few minutes of brisk conference upon the lanai the marsdens pleading against the father and daughter for immediate return to the hotel there to claim the vacated rooms aboard the steamer in the eager discussion pro and con both young soldiers joined both saying go and promising to follow by the sedgwick in this family council despite the vivid interest armstrong felt in the result neither amy lawrence nor himself took any part side by side at the snowy railing over the breaking sea they stood almost silent listeners suddenly there came from the front again the sound of hoofs and wheels loud and distinct at the start then rapidly dying away with the increasing distance miss lawrence turned and looked inquiringly into the eyes she well knew were fixed upon her mrs marsden hesitated one moment then stepped across the lanai peered into the parlor and entered it was a minute before she returned and in that minute the decisive vote was cast the carriage ordered oh i ought to have known how it would be if i left you a moment she cried despairingly on her reappearance a little folded paper in her hand but at least you must stay half an hour we can telephone direct to the dock and secure the staterooms if go you must on the doric yes she continued lowering her voice they are not going farther until colonel frost comes mrs garrison explains that her sister was really too ill and too weak to come out here but she thought the drive might do her good she thought best to slip quietly away with her and bids me say goodnight to you all so when next day the doric sailed four new names appeared upon the passenger list and the last men down the stage already trembling on the rise were two young fellows in white uniform who turned as they sprang to the dock and waved their jaunty caps join you in ten days at frisco shouted the shorter of the two gazing upward and backward at the quartette on the promenade deck oh beg a thousand pardons he added hastily as he bumped against some slender object and wheeling about to pick up a flimsy white fan he found himself face to face with witchie garrison kerchief waving beaming smiling throwing kisses innumerable to the party he had so lately left the hot blood rushed to his forehead an angry light to his eyes as she nodded blithely forbearingly forgivingly at him dear boy she cried in her clear penetrating treble how could you be expected to see any one after leaving her but govs arm was linked in his at the very instant and led him glowering away leaving her close to the edge of the crowded dock smiling sweetness blessing and bliss upon a silent and unresponsive group and waving kerchief and kisses to them until far from shore the doric headed out to sea they were nearing home again day and night for nearly a week the good ship had borne them steadily onward over a sea of deepest blue calm and unruffled as the light that shone in amys eyes hours of each twentyfour armstrong had been the constant companion at first of the trio then of the two for mr prime had found a kindred spirit in a veteran merchant homeward bound from china then of one alone for miss prime had found another interest and favor in the eyes of a young tourist paying his first visit to our shores and so it happened that before the voyage all too brief was half over amy lawrence and armstrong walked the spacious deck for hours alone or sat in sheltered nooks gazing out upon the sea the soft summer breezes of the first few days had given place to keener chillier air the fog ahead told of the close proximity of the farallones heavier wraps had replaced the soft fabrics of the hawaiian saunterings but warmth and gladness coupled with a strange new shyness in his presence were glowing in her fresh young heart one day she had said to him you have not told me how you came to leave there just now and it was a moment before he answered that was the surgeons doing they sent me back from the front because the wound did not properly heal and then ordered a sea voyage until it did but i turn back at once from san francisco she was silent a few seconds this was unlooked for and unwelcome news i thought she said at least gov heard dr frank say it would be four months before you could use that arm she plucked at the fringe of the heavy shawl he had wrapped about her as she reclined in the low steamer chair but the white lids veiled her eyes possibly answered armstrong but you see i do not have to use it much at any time im all right otherwise and there will soon be need of me more campaigning she anxiously inquired her eyes one moment uplifting probably those fellows have no idea of quitting another interval of silence the long lazy rolling swell of the pacific had changed during the day to an abrupt and tumultuous upheaval that tossed the doric like a cork and made locomotion a problem the rising wind and sea sent the spray whirling from her bows and mildreds young man casting about for a dry corner had deposited his fair charge on a bench along the forward deck house and was scouting up and down for steamer chairs armstrong had drawn his close to that in which miss lawrence reclined her knitted steamer cap pulled well forward over her brow his feet were braced against a stanchion his eyes were intent upon her sweet face he had no thought for other men even those in similar plight his gaze though unhampered by the high peak of his forage cap comprehended nothing beyond the rounded outline of that soft cheek her eyes wellnigh hidden by her shrouding tam saw the searching son of albion and told her his need the best of women will find excuse for interruption at such moments when sure of the devotion of the man who sits with a fateful question quivering on his lips and even when she longs to hear those very words will find means to defer them as a kitten dallies with a captured mouse or a child saves to the very last the sweetest morsel of her birthday cake not ten minutes before when the honorable bertie shafto had started impulsively toward the vacant chair by armstrongs side a firm hand detained him and miss prime had hastily interposed not on any account said she imperiously cant you see and mr shafto adjusting his monocle had gazed long and fixedly and then transferring his gaze to her had said eh eh yes its not ours i suppose you mean but now amy lawrence was beckoning and he made a rush for the rail then worked his way aft hand over hand every movable on deck was taking a sudden slant to starboard and the sea went hissing by almost on level with the deck as next she spoke surely a soldier needs both arms in battle and you oh certainly mr shafto take that chair she added armstrong glanced up suddenly oh that you shafto yes take it by all means anything thought he rather than that they should come here the young briton stepped easily past between them and the rail behind there was no room and swinging the long awkwardly modeled fabric to his broad shoulder started back just as a huge wave heaved suddenly under the counter heeled the steamer far over to port threw him off his balance and his foot catching at the bottom of her chair hurled him load and all straight at amys reclining form one instant and even her uplifted hands could not have saved her face but in that instant armstrong had darted in caught the stumbling briton on one arm and the full force of the shooting chair crashing upon the other already pierced by filipino lead when a moment later she emerged safe and unscratched from the confused heap of men and furniture it was to cut off instantly the stutter and stammer of poor shaftos apologies to bid him go instantly for the ships doctor and with face the color of death to turn quickly to armstrong the blow had burst open the halfhealed wound and the blood was streaming to the deck both liner and transport turned back without stanley armstrong doric and sedgwick sailed unheeded for the highest surgical authority of the department of california had remanded him to quarters at the palace and forbidden his return to duty with an unhealed wound he was sitting up again somewhat pallid and not too strong but with every promise said the medico of complete recovery within two months but not a month would armstrong wait the puebla was to start within the week and he had made up his mind go said he i must they had been sitting about him the night this opinion was announced in the parlor of the suite of rooms the primes had taken billy gray had gone with his father to the club shafto had been hanging about in the agonies of an englishmans first love gov disappeared a moment and came back with tickets for the columbia bidding mildred get her hat and gloves at once and whispering shafto that he had a seat for him as the little mantel clock struck eight amy lawrence lifting up her eyes from the book she was trying hard to believe she meant to read saw that armstrong was rising from his easychair and springing to his side laying her white hand on his arm she faltered oh please you know the stipulation was that you were not to stir but then her heart began to flutter uncontrollably the blood went surging to her brows for all of a sudden as through impulse irresistible her hand was seized in his in both of his in fact and the deep voice that had pleaded at her behest for the cause of billy gray was now in impetuous flow of words that fell upon her ears like some strain of thrilling music pleading at last his own ever since that day in the radiant sunshine of the park she had learned to look up to him as a tower of strength a man of mark among his fellows a man to be honored and obeyed ever since that night at the palace when she saw his glowing eyes fixed intently upon her and knew that he was following her every move she had begun to realize the depth of his interest in her ever since that day when the china slipped from her moorings with witchie garrison singling him out for lavish farewell favors she had wondered why it so annoyed and stung her ever since the day she read the list of killed and wounded in the first fierce battling with the insurrectos she knew it was the sight of his name not billy grays that made her for the moment faint and dizzy and taught her the need of greater selfcontrol ever since that moonlit night upon the marsdens lanai when her heart leaped at the sudden sound of his voice she had realized what his coming meant to her and ever since that breezy day upon the broad pacific with the sailors song of land ho ringing from the bows and he her wounded soldier had sprung to shield her from the crash of shaftos hapless stumble and the deck was stained with the precious blood from that soldiers reopened wound shed for her for her who so revered him she had longed to hear him say the words that alone could unlock the gates of maidenly reserve and let her tell him tell him with glad and grateful heart that the love he bore her was answered by her own hovering over him only one minute her lips half parted her eyes still veiled her heart throbbing loud and fast with sudden movement she threw herself upon her knees at the side of the low chair and her burning face ever so lightly was buried in the darkblue sleeve above that blessed wound the end grosset dunlaps desirable editions of popular books the following books are printed from new large type plates on fine laid
