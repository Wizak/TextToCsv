in which prince corum learns a lesson and loses a limb introduction in those days there were oceans of light and cities in the skies and wild flying beasts of bronze there were herds of crimson cattle that roared and were taller than castles there were shrill viridian things that haunted bleak rivers it was a time of gods manifesting themselves upon our world in all her aspects a time of giants who walked on water of mindless sprites and misshapen creatures who could be summoned by an illconsidered thought but driven away only on pain of some fearful sacrifice of magics phantasms unstable nature impossible events insane paradoxes dreams come true dreams gone awry of nightmares assuming reality it was a rich time and a dark time the time of the sword rulers the time when the vadhagh and the nhadragh ageold enemies were dying the time when man the slave of fear was emerging unaware that much of the terror he experienced was the result of nothing else but the fact that he himself had come into existence it was one of many ironies connected with man who in the knight of the swords those days called his race mabden the mabden lived brief lives and bred prodigiously within a few centuries they rose to dominate the westerly continent on which they had evolved superstition stopped them from sending many of their ships towards vadhagh and nhadragh lands for another century or two but gradually they gained courage when no resistance was offered they began to feel jealous of the older races they began to feel malicious the vadhagh and the nhadragh were not aware of this they had dwelt a million or more years upon the planet which now at last seemed at rest they knew of the mabden but considered them not greatly different from other beasts though continuing to indulge their traditional hatreds of one another the vadhagh and the nhadragh spent their long hours in considering abstractions in the creation of works of art and the like rational sophisticated at one with themselves these older races were unable to believe in the changes that had come thus as it almost always is they ignored the signs there was no exchange of knowledge between the two ancient enemies even though they had fought their last battle many centuries before the vadhagh lived in family groups occupying isolated castles scattered across a continent called by them broanvadhagh there was scarcely any communication between these families for the vadhagh had long since lost the impulse to travel the nhadragh lived in their cities built on the islands in the reas to the north west of broanvadhagh they also had little contact even with their closest kin both races reckoned themselves invulnerable both were wrong upstart man was beginning to breed and spread like a pestilence across the world this pestilence struck down the old races wherever it touched them and it was not book one only death that man brought but terror too wilfully he made of the older world nothing but ruins and bones unwittingly he brought psychic and supernatural disruption of the magnitude which even the great old gods failed to comprehend and the great old gods began to know fear and man slave of fear arrogant in his ignorance continued his sttunbling progress he was blind to the huge disruptions aroused by his apparently petty ambitions as well man was deficient in sensitivity had no awareness of the multitude of dimensions that filled the universe each plane intersecting with several others not so the vadhagh or the nhadragh who had known what it was to move at will between the dimensions they termed the five planes they had glimpsed and understood the nature of the many planes other than the five through which the earth moved therefore it seemed a dreadful injustice that these wise races should perish at the hands of creatures who were still little more than animals it was as if vultures feasted on and squabbled over the paralysed body of the youthful poet who could only stare at them with puzzled eyes as they slowly robbed hiin of an exquisite existence they would never appreciate never know they were taking if they valued what they stole if they knew what they were destroying says the old vadhagh in the story the only autumn flower then i would be consoled it was unjust by creating man the universe had betrayed the old races but it was a perpetual and familiar injustice the sentient may perceive and love the universe but the universe cannot perceive and love the sentient the universe sees no distinction between the multitude of creatures and elements which comprise it all are equal the knight of the swords none is favoured the universe equipped with nothing but the materials and the power of creation continues to create something of this something of that it cannot control what it creates and it cannot it seems be controlled by its creations those who curse the workings of the universe curse that which is deaf those who strike out at those workings fight that which is inviolate those who shake their fists shake their fists at blind stars but this does not mean that there are some who will not try to do battle with and destroy the invulnerable there will always be such beings sometimes beings of great wisdom who cannot bear to believe in an insouciant universe prince corum jhaelen irsei was one of these perhaps the last of the vadhagh race he was sometimes known as the prince in the scarlet robe this chronicle concerns him the book of corum chapter one at castle erorn at castle erorn dwelt the family of the vadhagh prince khlonskey this family had occupied the castle for many cepturies it loved exceedingly the moody sea that washed erorns northern walls and the pleasant forest that crept close to her southern flank castle erorn was so ancient that she seemed to have fдsed entirely with the rock of the huge eminence that overlooked the sea outside it was a splendour of time book one worn turrets and saltsmoothed stones within it had moving walls which changed shape in tune with the elements and changed colour when the wind changed course and there were rooms full of arrangements of crystals and fountains playing exquisitely complicated fugues composed by members of the family some living some dead and there were gaileries filled with paintings brushed on velvet marble and glass by prince khlonskeys artist ancestors and there were libraries filled with manuscripts written by members of both the vadhagh and the nhadragh races and elsewhere in castle erorn were rooms of statues and there were aviaries and menageries observatories laboratories nurseries gardens chambers of meditation surgeries gymnasia collections of martial paraphernalia kitchens planetaria museums conjuratoria as well as rooms set aside for less specific purposes or rooms forming the apartments of those who lived in the castle twelve people lived in the castle now though once five hundred had occupied it the twelve were prince khlonskey himself a very ancient being his wife colatalarna who was in appearance much younger than her husband ilastru and pholhinra his twin daughters prince rhanan his brother sertreda his niece corum his son the remaining five were retainers distant cousins of the prince all had characteristic vadhagh features narrow long skulls ears that were almost without lobes and tapered flat alongside the head fine hair that a breeze would make rise like flimsy clouds about their faces large almond eyes that had yellow centres and purple surrounds wide fullupped mouths and skin that was a strange goldflecked rose pink their bodies were slim and tall and well proportioned and they moved with a leisurely grace that made the human gait seem like the shambling of a crippled ape the knight of the swords occupying themselves chiefly with remote intellectual pastimes the family of prince khlonskey had had no contact with other vadhagh folk for two hundred years and had not seen a nhadragh for three hundred no news of the outside world had come to them for over a century only once had they seen a mabden when a specimen had been brought to castle erorn by prince opash a naturalist and first cousin to prince khlonskey the mabden a female had been placed in the menageries where it was cared for well but it lived little more than fifty years and when it died was never replaced since then of course the mabden had multiplied and were it appeared even now inhabiting large areas of broanvadhagh there were even rumours that some vadhagh castles had been infested with mabden who had overwhelmed the inhabitants and eventually destroyed their homes altogether prince khlonskey found this hard to believe besides the speculation was of little interest to him or teis family there were so many other things to discuss so many more complex sources of speculation pleasanter topics of a hundred kinds prince khlonskeys skin was almost milkwhite and so thin that all the vems and muscles were clearly displayed beneath he had lived for over a thousand years and only recently had age begun to enfeeble him when teis weakness became unbearable when teis eyes began to dim he would end teis life in the manner of the vadhagh by going to the chamber of vapours and laying himself on the silk quilts and cushions and inhaling the various sweetsmelling gases until he died his hair had turned a golden brown with age and the colour of teis eyes had mellowed to a kind of reddish purple with pupils of dark orange his robes were now ratteer too large for teis body but although he carried a staff of plaited platinum in which ruby metal book one had been woven teis bearing was still proud and teis back was not bent one day he sought teis son prince corum in a chamber where music was formed by the arranging of hollow tubes vibrating wires and shifting stones the very simple quiet music was almost drowned by the sound of khlonskeys feet on the tapestries the tap of teis staff and the rustle of the breath in teis thin throat prince corum withdrew teis attention from the music and gave teis fatteer a look of polite enquiry fatteer corum forgive the interruption of course besides i was not satisfied with the work corum rose from teis cushions and drew teis scarlet robe about him it occurs to me corum that i will soon visit the chamber of vapours said prince khlonskey and in reaching this decision i had it in mind to indulge a whim of mine however i will need your help now prince corum loved teis fatteer and respected teis decision so he said gravely that help is yours father what can i do i would know something of the fate of my kinsmen of prince opash who dwells at castle sam in the east of princess lorim who is at castle crachah in the south and of prince faguin of castle gal in the north prince corum frowned very well father if i know son what you think that i could discover what i wish to know by occult means yet this is not so for some reason it is difficult to achieve intercourse with the other planes even my perception of them is dimmer than it should be try as i might to enter them with my senses and to enter them physically is almost impossible perhaps it is my age no father said prince corum for i too have found the knight of the sugords it difcult once it was easy to move through the five planes at will with a little more effort the ten planes could be contacted though as you know few could visit them physically now i am unable to do more than see and occasionally hear those other four planes which with ours form the spectrum through which our planet directly passes in its astral cycle i do not understand why this loss of sensibility has come about and neither do i agreed his father but i feel that it must be portentous it indicates some major change in the nature of our earth this is the chief reason why i would discover something of my relatives and perhaps learn if they know why our senses become bound to a single plane it is unnatural it is crippling to us are we to become like the beasts of this plane which are aware only of one dimension and have no understanding that the others exist at all is some process of devolution at work shall our children know nothing of our experiences and slowly return to the state of those aquatic mammals from which our race sprang i will admit to you my son that there are traces of fear in my mind prince corum did not attempt to reassure his father i read once of the blandhagna he said thoughtfully they were a race based on the third plane a people of great sophistication but something took hold of their genes and of their brains and within five generations they had reverted to a species of flying reptile still equipped with a vestige of their former intelligence enough to make them mad and ultimately destroy themselves completely what is it i wonder that produces these reversions only the sword rulers know his father said corum smiled and the sword rulers do not exist i understand your concern father you would have me visit these kinsmen of yours and bring them our greetings i should discover if they fare weil and if they have noticed book one what we have noticed at our castle erorn his father nodded if our perception dims to the level of a mabden then there is little point in continuing our race find out too if you can how the nhadragh fare if this dullness of the senses comes to them our races are of more or less equal age corum murmured perhaps they are similarly afflicted but did not your kinsman shulag have something to say when he visited you sonve centuries back aye shulag had it that the mabden had come in ships from the west and subjugated the nhadragh killing most and making slaves of those remaining yet i find it hard to believe that the mabden halfbeasts no matter how great iheir numbers would have the wit to defeat nhadragh cunning prince corum pursed his lips reflectively possibly they grew complacent be said his father tunned to leave the chamber his staff of nuby and platinum tapping softly on the richly embroidered cloth covering the flagstones his delicate hand clutching it more tightly than usual complacency is one thing be said and fear of an impossible doom is another both of course are ultimately destructive we need speculate no more for on your return you may bring us answers to these questions answers that we can understand when would you leave i have it in mind to complete my symphony prince corum said that will take another day or so i will leave on the morning after the day i finish it prince khlonskey nodded his old head in satisfaction thank you my son when he had gone prince corum returned his attention to his music but he found that it was difficuit for him to concentrate his imagination began to focus on the quest he had agreed to undertake a certain emotion took hold the knight of the sovords of him he believed that it must be excitement when he embarked on the quest it would be the first time in his life that he had left the environs of castle erorn he attempted to calm himself for it was against the customs of his people to allow an excess of emotion it will be instructive he murmured to himself to see the rest of this continent i wish that geography had interested me more i scarcely know the outlines of broanvadhagh let alone the rest of the world perhaps i should study some of the maps and travellers tales in the library yes i will go there tomorrow or perhaps the next day no sense of urgency filled prince corum even now the vadhagh being a longlived people they were used to acting at leisure considering their actions before performing them spending weeks or months in meditation before embarking on some study or creative work prince corum then decided to abandon his symphony on which he had been working for the past four years perhaps he would take it up again on his return perhaps not it was of no great consequence chapter two prince corum sets forth and so with the hooves of his horse hidden by the white mist of the morning prince corum rode out from castle erorn to begin his quest the pale light softened the lines of the castle so that it seemed more than ever to merge with the great high rock on which it stood and the trees that grew beside the path book one down which corum rode also appeared to melt and mingle with the mist so that the landscape was a silent vision of gentle golds and greens and greys tinged with the pink rays of a distant hidden sun and from beyond the rock the sea cloaked by the mist could be heard retreating from the shore as corum reached the sweetsmelling pines and birches of the forest a wren began to sing was answered by the croak of a rook and both fell silent as if startled by the sounds their own throats bad made corum rode on through the forest until the whisper of the sea dimmed behind him and the mist began to give way before the warming light of the rising sun this ancient forest was familiar to him and be loved it for it was here be had ridden as a boy and bad been taught the obsolete art of war which had been considered by his father as useful a way as any of making his body strong and quick here too he had lain through whole days watching the small animals that inhabited the forest the tiny horselike beast of grey and yellow which had a horn growing from its forehead and was no bigger than a dog the fanwinged gloriously coloured bird that could soar higher than the eye could see and yet which built its nests in abandoned fox and badger sets underground the large gentle pig with thick curly black hair that fed on moss and many others prince corum realised that he bad almost forgotten the pleasures of the forest he bad spent so long inside the castle a small smile touched his lips as he looked about him the forest he thought would endure for ever something so beautiful could not die but this thought put him for some reason in a melancholy mood and he urged his horse to a somewhat faster gait the horse was glad to gallop as fast as corum desired for the knight of the swords it also knew the forest and roas enjoying the exercise it roas a red vadhagh horse with a blueblack mane and tail and it roas strong tall and graceful unlike the shaggy wild ponies that inhabited the forest it roas mantled in yellow velvet and hung about with panniers two spears a plain round shield made of different thicknesses of timber brass leather and silver a long bone boro and a quiver holding a good quantity of arrows in one of the panniers were provisions for the journey and in another were books and maps for guidance and entertainment prince corum himself wore a conical silver helm which had his full name carved in three characters above the short peak corum jhaelen irsei which meant corum the prince in the scarlet robe it roas the custom of the vadhagh to choose a robe of distinctive colour and identify themselves by means of it as the nhadragh used crests and banners of greater complication corum wore the robe now it had long wide sleeves a full skirt that roas spread back over his horses rump and it roas open at the front at the shoulders roas fixed a hood large enough to go over his helmet it had been made from the fine thin skin of a creature that roas thought to dwell in another plane forgotten even by the vadhagh beneath the coat roas a double byrnie made up of a million tiny links the upper layer of this byrnie roas silver and the lower layer roas of brass for weapons other than boro and lance corum bore a longhafted vadhagh roaraxe of delicate and intricate workmanship a long strong sword of a nameless metal manufactured on a different plane of the earth with pommel and guard worked in silver and both red and black onyx his shirt roas of blue samite and his breeks and boots were of soft brushed leather as roas his saddle which roas finished in silver from beneath his helm some of prince corums fine book one silvery hair escaped and his youthful face now bore an expression that roas half introspection half excited anticipation at the prospect of his first sight of the ancient lands of his kinfolk he rode alone because none of the castles retainers could be spared and he rode on horseback rather than in a carriage because he wished to make the fastest possible speed it would be days before he would reach the first of the several castles he must visit but he tried to imagine how different these dwelling places of his kinfolk would be and how the people themselves would strike him perhaps he would even find a wife among them he knew that while his father had not mentioned this it had been an extra consideration in prince khlonskeys mind when the old man had begged him to go on this mission soon corum had left the forest and had reached the great plain called broggfythus where once the vadhagh and the nhadragh had met in bloody and mystical battle it had been the last battle ever fought between the two races and at its height it had raged through all five planes producing neither victor nor defeated it had destroyed more than two thirds of each of their races corum had heard that there were many empty castles across broanvadhagh now and many empty cities in the nhadragh isles which lay across the water from castle erorn towards the middle of the day corum found himself in the centre of broggfythus and he came to the spot that marked the boundaries of the territories he had roamed as a boy here roas the weedgroron wreckage of the vast sky city that during the monthlong battle of his ancestors had careered from one plane to another rupturing the fine fabric that divided the different dimensions of the earth until crashing at last upon the gathered ranks of the the knight of the swords vadhagh and the nhadragh it had destroyed them being of a different plane the tangled metal and stone of the sky city still retained that peculiar shifting effect now it had the appearance of a mirage though the weeds gorse and birch trees that twined around it looked solid enough on other less urgent occasions prince corum had enjoyed shifting his perspective out of this plane and into another to see different aspects of the city but the effort took too much energy these days and at the present moment the diaphanous wreckage represented nothing more than an obstacle around which be was forced to make various detours for it stretched in a circumference of more than twenty miles but at last he reached the edge of the plain called broggfythus and the sun set and he left behind him the world he knew and rode on towards the south west into lands he knew only from the maps he carried he rode steadily for three more days without pause until the red horse showed signs of tiredness and in a little valley through which a cold stream flowed he made camp and rested for a while corum ate a slice of the light nourishing bread of his people and sat with his back against the bole of an old oak while his horse cropped the grass of the river bank corums silver helm lay beside him together with his axe and sword he breathed the leafy air and relaxed as he contemplated the peaks of the mountains blue grey and white in the distance this was pleasant peaceful country and he was enjoying his journey through it once he knew it had been inhabited by several vadhagh estates but there was no trace of them now it was as if they had grown into the landscape or been engulfed by it once or twice he had seen strangely shaped rocks where vadhagh castles had stood hut they had been no more than rocks it occurred to him that these rocks were the transmogrified book one remains of vadhagh dwellings but his intellect rejected such an impossibility such imaginings were the stuff of poetry not of reason he smiled at his own foofishness and settled himself more comfortably against the tree in another three days he would be at castle crachah where his sunt the princess lorim lived he watched as his horse folded its legs and lay down beneath the trees to sleep and he wrapped his scarlet coat about him raised the hood and slept also chapter three the mabden herd towards the middle of the following morning prince corum was awakened by sounds that somehow did not fit the forest his horse had heard them too for it was up and sniffing at the air showing small signs of agitation corum frowned and went to the cool water of the river to wash his face and hands he paused listening again a thump a rattle a clank he thought he heard a voice shouting further down the valley and be peered in that direction and thought he saw something moving corum strode back to where he had left his gear and he picked up his helmet settling it on his head fixed his swords scabbard to his belt looped the axe on to his back then he began to saddle the horse as it lapped the river the sounds were stronger now and for some reason corum felt disquiet touch his mind he mounted his horse but continued to watch up the valley came a tide of beasts and vehicles some of the creatures were clothed in iron fur and leather corum the knight of the swords guessed that this was a mabden herd from the little he had read of mabden habits he knew the breed to be for the urost part a migratory species constantly on the move as it exhausted one area it would move on seeking fresh game and wild crops he was surprised to note how much like vadhagh arms and armour were the swords shields and helmets worn by some of the mabden closer they came and still corum observed them with intense curiosity as he would study any unusual beast he had not previously seen this was a large group riding in barbarically decorated chariots of timber and beaten bronze drawn by shaggy horses with harness of leather painted in dull reds yellows and blues behind the chariots came waggons some open and some with awnings perhaps these carried females corum thought for there were no females to be seen elsewhere the mabden had thick dirty beards long sweeping moustaches and matted hair flowing out from under their helurets as they moved they yelled at each other and passed wineskins from hand to hand astonished corum recognised the language as the common tongue of the vadhagh and the nhadragh though much corrupted and harshened so the mabden had learned a sophisticated form of speech again came the unaccountable sense of disquiet corum backed his horse into the shadows of the trees continumg to watch and now he could see why so inany of the helmets and weapons were familiar they were vadhagh helmets and vadhagh weapons corum frowned had these been looted from some old abandoned vadhagh castle were they gifts or had they been stolen the mabden also bore arms and armour of their own book one crude manufacture obviously copies of vadhagh workmanship as well as a few nhadragh artefacts a few had clothes of stolen sammite and linen but for the urost part they wore wolfskin cloaks bearskin hoods sealskin jerkins and breeks sheepskin jackets goatskin caps rabbitskin kilts pigskin boots shirts of deerskin or wool some had chains of gold bronze and iron hanging round their necks or wound about their arms or legs or even woven into their filthy hair now as corum watched they began to pass him he stified a cough as their smell reached his nose many were so drunk they were almost falling out of their chariots the heavy wheels rumbled and the hooves of the horses plodded on corum saw that the waggons did not contain females but booty much of it was vadhagh treasure there was no mistaking it the evidence was impossible to interpret in any other way this was a party of warriors a raiding party or a looting party corum could not be sure but he found it hard to accept that these creatures had lately done battle with vadhagh warriors and won now the last chariots of the caravan began to pass and corum saw that a few mabden walked behind ced to the chariots by ropes attached to their hands these mabden bore no weapons and were hardly clothed at all they were thin their feet were bare and bleeding they moaned and cried out from time to time often the response of the charioteer to whose chariot they were attached would be to curse or laugh and tug at the ropes to make them stumble one did stumble and fall and desperately tried to regain his feet as he was dragged along corum was horrified why did the mabden treat their own species in suck a way even the nhadragh who were counted more cruel than the vadhagh had not caused such pain to their vadhagh prisoners in the old days the knight of the swords these are peculiar brutes in truth nused corum halfaloud one of the mabden at the head of the caravan called out loudly and brought his chariot to a halt beside the river the other chariots and waggons began to stop corum saw that they intended to make camp here fascinated he continued to observe them stock still oas his horse hidden by the trees the mabden removed the yokes from the horses and led them to the water from the waggons they took cooking pots and poles and began to build fires by sunset they were eating though their prisoners still tied to the chariots were given nothing when they were done with eating they began to drink again and soon more than half the herd was insensible sprawled oas the grass and sleeping where they fell others were rolling about oas the ground engaged in mock fights many of which increased in savagery so that knives and axes were drawn and some blood spilled the mabden who had originally called for the caravan to stop roared at the fighting men and began to stagger among them a wineskin clutched in one hand kicking them and plainly ordering them to stop two refused to heed him and he drew the huge bronze waraxe from his belt and smashed it down oas the skull of the nearest man splitting his heluret and his head a silence came to the camp and corum with an effort made out the words the leader spoke by the dog iii have no more squabbling of this sort why spend your energies oas each other there is sport to be had yonder he pointed with his axe to the prisoners who were now sleeping a few of the mabden laughed and nodded and rose up moving through the faint light of the evening to where their prisoners lay they kicked them awake cut the ropes book one attachei to the chariots and forced them towards the main encampment where the warriors who had not succumbed to the wine were arranging themselves in a circle the prisoners were pushed into the centre of this circle and stood there staring in terror at the warriors the leader stepped into the circle and confronted the prisoners when we took you with us from your village i promised you that we denledhyssi hated only one thing more than we hated shefanhow do you remember what that was one of the prisoasers mumbled staring at the ground the mabden leader moved quickly pushing the head of his axe under the mans chin and lifting it up aye you have learned your lesson weil friend say it again the prisoners tongue was thick in his mouth his broken lips moved again and he turned his eyes to the darkening skies and tears fell down his checks and he yelled in a wild cracked voice those who lick shefanhow urine and a great groan shuddered from him and then he screamed the mabden leader smiled drew back his axe and rammed the haft into the mans stomach so that the scream was cut short and he doubled over in agony corum had never witnessed such cruelty and his frown deepened as he saw the mabden begin to tie down their prisoners staking them out oas the ground and bringing brands and knives to their limbs burning and cutting them so that they did not die but writhed in pain the leader laughed as he watched taking no part in the torture itself oh your spirits will remember me as they mingle with the shefanhow demons in the pits of the dog he chuckled oh they will remember the earl of the the knight of the swords denledhyssi glandythakrae the doom of the shefanhow corum found it difficult to work out what these words meant shefanhow could be a corruption of the vadhagh word sefano which roughly meant fiend but why did these mabden call themselves denledhyssi a corruption almost certainly of donledyssi meaning murderers were they proud that they were killers and was shefanhow a term used in general to describe their enemies and were as seemed unquestionably the case their enemies other mabden corum shook his head in puzzlement he understood the motives and behaviour of less developed animals better than he understood the mabden he found it difficult to retain a clinical interest in their customs was becoming quickly disturbed by them he turned his horse into the depths of the forest and rode away the only explanation he could find at present was that the mabden species had undergone a process of evolution and devolution more rapid than most it was possible that these were the mad remnants of the race if so then that was why they turned on their own kind as rabid foxes did a greater sense of urgency filled him now and he rode as fast as his horse could gallop heading for castle crachah princess lorim living in closer proximity to mabden herds might be able to give him clearer answers to his questions chapter four the bane of beauty the doom of truth save for dead fires and some utter prince corum saw no further signs of mabden before he breasted the high green hills that enclosed valley crachah and searched with his eyes for the castle of princess lorim the valley was full of poplars elms and birch and looked peaceful in the gentle light of the early afternoori but where was the castle he wondered corum drew his map again from within his byrnie and consulted it the castle should be almost in the centre of the valley surrounded by six rings of poplars and two outer rings of elms he boked again yes there were the rings of poplars and elms and near the centre no castle just a cloud of mist but there should be no mist on such a day it could only be smoke prince corum rode rapidly down the hill he rode until he reached the first of the rings of trees and he peered through the other rings but could as yet see nothing he sniffed the smoke he passed through more rings of trees and now the smoke stung his eyes and throat and he could see a few tiack shapes in it he passed through the final ring of poplars and he began choke as the smoke filled his lungs and his watering eyes roade out the shapes sharp crags tumbled rocks blistered metal burned beams prince corum saw a ruin it was without a doubt the ruin of castle crachah a smouldering ruin fire had the knight of the swords brought castle crachah down fire had eaten her folk for now corum as lic rode his snorting horse around the perimeter of the ruins made out blackened skeletons and beyond the ruins were signs of battle a broken mabden chariot some mabden corpses an old vadhagh woman chopped into several pieces even now the crows and the ravens were beginning to sidle in risking the smoke prince corum began to understand what sorrow must be he thought that the emotion he felt was that he called out once in the hope that some inhabitant of castle crachah lived but there was no reply slowly prince corum turned away he rode towards the east towards castle sarn he rode steadily for a week and the sense of sorrow remained but was joined by another nagging emotion prince corum began to think it must be a feeling of trepidation castle sam lay in the middle of a dense elder forest and was reached by a pathway down which the weary prince in the scarlet robe and his weary horse moved small animals scampered away from them and a thin rain fell from a brooding sky no smoke rose here and when corum came to the castle be saw that it was no longer burning its black stones were cold and the crows and ravens had already picked the corpses clean and gone away in search of other carrion and then tears came to corums eyes for the first time and he dismounted from his dusty horse and clambered over the stones and the bones and sat down and looked about him for several hours prince corum sat thus until a sound came from his throat it was a sound he had not heard before and he could not name it it was a thin sound that book one could not express what was within his stunned mind he had never known prince opash though his father bad spoken of him with great affection he had never known the family and retainers who had dwelt in castle sam but he wept for them until at length exhausted be stretched out upon the broken slab of stone and fell into a gloomy slumber the rain continued to fall on corums scarlet coat it fell on the ruins and it washed the bones the red horse sought the shelter of the elder trees and lay down for a while it chewed the grass and watched its prone master then it too slept when he eventually awoke and clambered back over the ruins to where his horse still lay corums mind was mcapable of speculation he knew now that this destruction must be mabden work for it was not the custom of the nhadragh to burn the castles of their enemies besides the nhadragh and the vadhagh bad been at peace for xnturies both had forgotten how to make war it bad occurred to corum that the mabden might have beeen inspired to their destruction by the nhadragh but elen this was unlikely there was an ancient code of war o which both races had no matter how fierce the fightinglw ays adhered and with the decline in their numbers mere had been no need for the nhadragh to expand theirerritories or for the vadhagh to defend theirs his face thin with weariness and strain coated with dust rnd streaked with tears prince corum aroused his horse and mounted him riding on towards the north where castle gal lay he hoped a little he hoped that the mabden herds moved only in the south and east that the orth would still be free of their encroachments as the west was a day later as he stopped to water his horse at a small luke he looked across the gorse moor and saw more smoke the knight of the swords curling he took out his map and consulted it no castle was marked there he hesitated was the smoke coming from another mabden camp if so they might have vadhagh prisoners whom corum should attempt to rescue he decided to ride towards the source of the smoke the smoke came from several sources this was indeed a mabden camp but it was a permanent camp not unlike the smaller settlements of the nhadragh though much cruder a collection of stone huts built close to the ground with thatched roofs and chimneys of slate from which the smoke came around this camp were fields that bad evidently contained crops though there were no crops now and others which had a few cows grazing in them for some reason corum did not feel wary of this camp as be had felt wary of the mabden caravan but he none the less approached it cautiously stopping his horse a hundred yards away and studying the camp for signs of life he waited an hour and saw none he moved his horse in closer until he was less than fifty yards away from the nearest singlestorey building still no mabden emerged from any of the low doorways corum cleared his throat a child began to scream and the scream was muffled suddenly mabden corum called and his voice was husky with weariness and sorrow i would speak with you why do you not come out of your dens from the nearby hovel a voice replied the voice was a mixture of fear and anger we have done no harm to the shefanhow they have done no harm to us but if we speak to you the book one denledhyssi will come back and take more of our food kill more of our menfolk rape more of our women go away shefanhow lord we beg you we have put the food in the sack by the door take it and leave us corum saw the sack now so it had been an offering to him did they not know that their heavy food would not settle in a vadhagh stomach i do not want food mabden he called back what do you want shefanhow lord we have nothing else but our souls i do not know what you urean i seek answers to questions the shefanhow know everything we know nothing why do you fear the denledhyssi why do you call me a fiend we vadhagh have never harmed you the denledhyssi call you shefanhow and because we dwelt in peace with your folk the denledhyssi punish us they say that mabden must kill the shefanhow the vadhagh and the nhadragh that you are evil they say our crime is to let evil live they say that the mabden are put upon this earth to destroy the shefanhow the denledhyssi are the servants of the great earl glandythakrae whose own liege is our liege king lyrabrode whose stone city called kalenwyr is in the high lands of the north east do you not know all this shefanhow lord i did not know it said prince corum softly turning his borse away and now that i know it i do not understand it he raised his voice farewell mabden ill give you no further cause for fear and then be paused but tell me one last thing what is that lord came the nervous voice why does a mabden destroy another mabden i do not understand you lord i have seen members of your race killing fellow members of that race is this something you often do the knight of the swords aye lord we do it quite often we punish those who break our laws we set an example to those who might consider breaking those laws prince corum sighed thank you mabden i ride away now the red horse trotted off over the moor leaving the village behind now prince corum knew that mabden power bad grown greater than any vadhagh would have suspected they bad a primitively complicated social order with leaders of different ranks permanent settlements of a variety of sizes the larger part of broanvadhagh seemed ruled by a single man king lyrabrode the name meant as much something like in their coarsened dialect king of all the land corum remenibered the rumours that vadhagh castles bad been taken by these halfbeasts that the nhadragh isles bad fallen completely to them and there were mabden who devoted their whole lives to seeking out members of the older races and destroying them why the older races did not threaten man what threat could they be to a species so numerous and fierce all that the vadhagh and the nhadragh bad was knowledge was it knowledge that the mabden feared for ten days pausing twice to rest prince corum rode north but now he bad a different vision of what castle gal would look like when he reached it but be must go there to make sure and he must warn prince faguin and bis family of their danger if they still lived the settlements of the mabden were seen often and prince corum avoided them some were of the size of the first be bad scen but marsy were larger built around grim stone towers sometimes he saw bands of warriors riding by and only the sharper senses of the vadhagh enabled him to see them before they sighted him book one once by a huge effort he was forced to move both himself and bis horse into the next dimension to avoid confrontation with mabden he watched them ride past him less than ten feet away completely unable to observe him like the others he bad scen these did not ride horses but bad chariots drawn by shaggy ponies as corum saw their faces pocked with disease thick with grease and filth their bodies strung with barbaric ornament he wondered at their powers of destruction it was still bard to believe that such insensitive beasts as hese who appeared to have no second sight at all could bring to ruin the great castles of the vadhagh and at last the prince in the scarlet robe reached the pottom of the hill on which castle gal stood and saw the black smoke billowing and the red flames leaping andknew from what fresh destruction the mabden beasts bad been riding but here there bad been a much longer siege by the jaok of it a battle bad raged here that bad lasted many days the vadhagh bad been more prepared at castle gal hoping that he would find some wounded kinsmen whom дc could help corum urged bis horse to gallop up the hill but the only thing that lived beyond the blazing castle a groaning mabden abandoned by bis fellows corum hored him he found three corpses of bis own folk not one of the ree bad died quickly or without what the mabden would doubtless consider humiliation there were two warriors who bad been stripped of their arms and armour and there was a child a girl of about six years corum bent and picked up the corpses one by one carrying them to the fire to be consumed he went to bis erse the wounded mabden called out corum paused it was the usual mabden accent the knight of the swords helg me master this was the liquid tongue of the vadhagh and the nhadragh was this a vadhagh who had disguised himself as a mabden to escape death corum began to walk back leading his horse through the billowing smoke he looked down at the mabden he wore a bulky wolfskin coat covered by a halfbyrnie of iron links a helmet that covered most of his face and which had slipped to blind him corum tugged at the heluret until it was free tossed it aside and then gasped this was no mabden nor was it a vadhagh it was the bloodied face of a nhadragh dark with flat features and hair growing down to the ridge of the eyesockets help me master said the nhadragh again i am not too badly hurt i can still be of service to whom nhadragh said corum softly he tore off a piece of the mans sleeve and wiped the blood free of the eyes the nhadragh blinked focusing on him who would you serve nhadragh would you serve me the nhadraghs dazed eyes cleared and then filled with an emotion corum could only surmise was hatred vadhagh snarled the being a vadhagh lives aye i live why do you hate mey all nhadragh hate the vadhagh they have hated them through eternity why are you not dead have you been hiding i am not from castle galm so i was right this was not the last vadhagh castle the being tried to stir tried to draw his knife but he was too weak he fell back hatred was not what the nhadragh had once corum said you wanted our lands yes but you fought us without this hatred and wc fought you without it you book orre have learned hatred from the mabden nhadragh not from your ancestors they knew honour you did not how could one of the older races make himself a mabden slave the nhadraghs lips smiled slightly all the nhadragh that remain are mabden slaves and have been for two hundred years they only suffer us to live in order to use us like dogs to sniff out those beings they call shefanhow we swore oaths of loyalty to them in order to continue living but could you not escape there are other planes the other planes were denied to us our historians had it that the last great battle of the vadhagh and the nhadragh so disrupted the equilibrium of those planes that they were closed to us by the gods so you have relearnt superstition too mused corum ah what do these mabden do to us the nhadragh began to laugh and the laugh turned into a cough and blood came out of his mouth and poured down his chin as corum wiped away the blood he said they supersede us vadhagh they bring the darkness and they bring the terror they are the bane of beauty and the doom of truth the world is mabden now we have no right to continue existing nature abhors us we should not be here corum sighed is that your thinking or theirs it is a fact corum shrugged perhaps it is a fact vadhagh you would be mad if you denied it you said you thought this the last of our castles not i i sensed there was another one i told them and they have gone to seek it yes corum gripped the beings shoulder where the knight of the swords the nhadragh smiled where where else but in the west corum rar to his horse stay croaked the nhadragh slay me i pray you vadhaghl do not let me linger i do not know how to kill corum replied as he mounted the horse then you must learn vadhagh you must learn rasped the dying being as corum frantically forced his horse to gallop down the hill chapter five a lesson learned and here was castle erorn her tinted towers entwined with greedy fires and still the surf boomed in the great black caverns within the headland on which erorn was raised and it seemed that the sea protested that the wind wailed its anger that the lashing foam sought desperately to drench the victorious flame castle erorn shuddered as she perished and the bearded mabden laughed at her downfall shaking the brass and gold trappings of their chariots casting triumphant glances at the little row of corpses lying in a semicircle before them they were vadhagh corpses four women and eight men in the shadows on the far side of the natural bridge of rock that led to the headland corum saw glimpses of the bloody faces and he knew them all prince khlonskey his father colatalarna his mother his twin sisters ilastru book one and pholhinra his uncle prince rhanan sertreda his cousin and the five retainers all second and third cousins three times corum counted the corpses as the cold grief transformed itself to fury and he heard the butchers yell to one another in their coarse dialect three times he counted and then he looked at them and his face really was the face of a shefanhow prince corum had discovered sorrow and he had discovered fear now he discovered rage for two weeks he had ridden almost without pause hoping to get ahead of the denledhyssi and warn his family of the barbarians coming and he had arrived a few hours too late the mabden had ridden out in their arrogance boro of ignorance and destroyed those whose arrogance was borr of wisdom it was the way of things doubtless corums father prince khlonskey had thought as much as he was hacked down with a stolen vadhagh waraxe but now corum could find no such philosophy within his own heart his eyes turred black with anger save for the irises which turred bright gold and he drew his tall spear and urged his weary horse over the causeway through the flamelit night towards the denledhyssi they were lounging in their chariots and pouring sweet vadhagh wine down their faces and into their gullets the sounds of the sea and the blaze hid the sound of corums approach until his spear pierced the face of a denledhyssi warrior and the man shrieked corum had learned how to kill he slid the spear point free and struck the dead mans companion through the back of the neck as he began to pull himself upright he twisted the spear corum had learned how to be cruel the knight of the swords another denledhyssi raised a bow and pulled back an arrow on the string bet corum hurled the spear now and it struck through the mans bronze breastplate entered his heart and knocked him over the side of the chariot corum drew his second spear but his horse was failing him he had ridden it to the point of exhaustion and now it could barely respond to his signals already the more distant charioteers were whipping their ponies into life turning their great groaning chariots around to bear down on the prince in the scarlet robe an arrow passed close and corum sought the archer and urged his tired horse forward to get close enough to drive his spear through the archers unprotected right eye and slip it out in time to block a blow from his comrades sword the metеlshod spear turned the blade and using both hands corum reversed the spear to smash the bult into the swordsmans face and knock him out of the chariot but now the other chariots were bearing down on him through the tumbling shadows cast by the roaring fires that ate at castle erorn they were led by one whom corum recognised he was laughing and yelling and whirling his huge waraxe about his head by the dog is this a vadhagh who knows how to fight like a mabden you have learned too late my friend you are the last of your race it was glandythakrae his grey eyes gleaming his cruel mouth snarling back over yellow fеngs corum flung his spear the whirling axe knocked it aside and glandyths chariot did not falter corum unslung his own waraxe and waited and as he waited the legs of his horse buckled and the beast book one collapsed to the ground desperately corum untangled his feet from the stirrups gripped his axe in both hands and leapt backwards and aside as the chariot came at him he aimed a blow at glandythakrae bet streck the brass edge of the chariot the shock of the blow numbed his hands so that he almost dropped the axe he was breathing harshly now and staggered other chariots raced by on both sides and a sword struck his heluret dazed he fell to one knee a spear hit his shoulder and he fell in the churned med then corum learned cunning instead of attempting to rise he lay where he had fallen until all the chariots had passed before they could begin to tum he pulled himself to his feet his shoulder was bruised bet the spear had not pierced it he stumbled through the darkness seeking to escape the barbarians then his feet struck something soft and he glanced down and saw the body of his mother and he saw what had been done to her before she died and a great moan escaped him and tears blinded him and he took a firmer grip on the axe in his left hand and painfully drew his sword screaming glandythakrae and corum had learned the lust for revenge the ground shook as the hooves of the horses beat upon it hauling the returning chariots towards him the tall tower of the castle suddenly cracked and crumbled into the ђlames which leapt higher and brightened the night to shhow earl glandyth whipping the horses as he bore down on corum once again corum stood over the corpse of his mother the gentle princess colatalarna his first blow split the forehead of the leading horse and it fell dragging the others down with it earl glandyth was flung forward almost over the edge the knight of the szvords of the chariot and be cursed behind him two other charioteers hastily tried to rein in their horses to stop from crashing into their leader the otbers not understanding why they were stopping also hauled at their reins corum clambered over the bodies of the horses and swung his sword at glandyths neck bet the blow was blocked by a gorget and the hage hairy head tumed and the pale grey eyes glared at corum then glandyth leapt from the chariot and corum leapt too to come face to face with the destroyer of his family they confronted each other in the firelight panting like foxes crouching and ready to spring corum moved first lunging with his sword at glandythakrae and swinging his axe at the same time glandyth jumped away from the sword and used his own axe to parry the blow kicking out at corums groin bet missing they began to circle corums black and gold eyes locked on the pale grey ones of the mabden earl for several minutes they circled while the other mabden looked on glandyths lips moved and began to voice a word bet corum sprang in again and this time the alien metal of his slender sword pierced glandyths armour at the shoulder join and slid in glandyth hissed and his axe swung round to strike the sword with such a blow that it was wrenched from corums aching hand and fell to the ground now murmured glandyth as if speaking to himself now vadhagh it is not my fate to be slain by a shefanhow corum swung his axe again glandyth dodged the blow again his axe came down and this time corums weapon was streck from his hand and be stood defenceless before the grinning mabden book one bet it is my fate to slay shefanhow he twisted his mouth in a snarling grin corum flung himself at glandyth trying to wrest the axe from him but corum bad spent the last of his strength he was too weak glandyth cried out to his men by the dog lads get this demon off me do not slay hдn well take our time with him after all be is the last vadhagh we shall ever have the chance to sport with corum heard them laugh and be streck out at them as they seized him he was shouting as a man shouts in a fever and be could not hear the words then one mabden plucked off his silver helm and another hit him on the back of the head with a sword pommel and corums body went suddenly limp and sank down into welcome darkness chapter six the maiming of corum the sen bad risen and set twice before corum awoke to find himself trussed in chains m the back of a mabden waggon he tried to raise his head and see through the gap in the awning bet be saw nothing save that it was daytime why bad they not killed him be wondered and then be shuddered as be understood that they were waiting for him to awake so that they could make his death both long and painful before be bad set off on his quest before be bad witnessed what bad happened to the vadhagh castles the knight of the swords before he had seen the blight that had come to broanvadhagh he might have accepted his fate and prepared himself to die as his kinfolk had died but the lessons he had learned remained with him he hated the mabden he mourned for his relativel he would be avenged on them if he could and this meant that he would have to live he closed his eyes conserving his strength there was one way to escape the mabden and that was to ease his body into another plane where they could not see hдn but to do this would demand much energy and there was little point in doing it while he remained in the waggon the guttural mabden voices drifted back to the waggon from time to time but he could not hear what they said he slept he stirred something cold was striking his face he blinked it was water he opened his eyes and saw the mabden standing over him he had been removed from the waggon and was lying on the ground cooking fires burned nearby it was night the shefanhow is with us again master called the mabden who had thrown the water he is ready for us i think corum winced as he moved his bruised body trying to stand upright in the chains even if he could escape to another plane the chains would come with him he would be little better off experimentally he tried to see into the next plane but his eyes began to ache and he gave up earl glandythakrae appeared now pushing his way through his men his pale eyes regarded corum triumphantly he put a hand to his beard which had been plaited into several strands and strung with rings of stolen gold and he smiled almost tenderly he reached down and pulled corum upright the chains and the cramped space of the waggon had served to cut off the circulation of book one blood to his legs they began to buckle rodlik here lad earl glandyth called behind him coming master a redheaded boy of about fourteen trotted forward he was dressed in soft vadhagh samite both green and white and there was an ermine cap on his head soft deerskin boots on his feet he had a pale face spotted with acne but otherwise handsome for a mabden he knelt before earl glandyth aye lord helg the shefanhow to stand lad glandyths low harsh voice contained something like a note of affection as he addressed the boy help him stand rodlik rodlik sprang up and took corums elbow steadying him the boys touch was cold and nervous all the mabden warriors looked expectantly at glandyth casually he took off his heavy helmet and shook out his hair which was curled and heavy with grease corum too watched glandyth he studied the mans red face decided that the grey eyes showed little real intelligence but much malice and pride why have you destroyed all the vadhagh said corum quietly his mouth moved painfully why earl of krae glandyth looked at him as if in surprise and he was slow to reply you should know we hate your sorcery we loathe your superior airs we desire your lands and those goods of yours which are of use to us so wc kill you he grinned besides we have not destroyed all the vadhagh not yet one left aye promised corum and one that will avenge his people if he is given the opportunity no glandyth put his hands on his hips he will not be you say you hate our sorcery but we have no sorcery just a little knowledge a little second sight ha we have seen your castles and the evil contraptions they contain we saw that one back there the one we the knight of the swords took a couple of nights ago full of sorcery corum wetted his lips yet even if we did have such sorcery that would be no reason for destroying us we have offered you no harm wc have let you come to our land without resisting you i think you hate us because you hate something in yourselves you are unfinished creatures i know you call us halfbeasts i care not what you think now vadhagh not now that your race is gone he spat on the ground and waved his hand at the youth let him go the youth sprang back corum swayed but did not fall he continued to stare in contempt at glandythakrae you and your race are insane earl you are like a canker you are a sickness suffered by this world earl glandyth spat again this time he spat straight into corums face i told you i know what the vadhagh think of us i know what the nhadragh thought before we made them our hunting dogs it was your pride that has destroyed you vadhagh the nhadragh learned to do away with pride and so some of them were spared they accepted us as their masters but you vadhagh could not when we came to your castles you ignored us when we demanded tribute you said nothing when wc told you that you senved us now you pretended you did not understand us so we set out to punish you and you would not resist we tortured you and in your pride you would not give us an oath that you would be our slaves as the nhadragh did we lost patience vadhagh we decided that you were not fit to live in the same land as the great king lyrabrode for you would not admit to being his subjects that is why wc set out to slay you all you earned this doom corum looked at the ground so it was complacency that book one had brought down the vadhagh race he lifted his head again and stared back at glandyth i hope however said corum that i will be able to show you that the last of the vadhagh can behave in a different way glandyth shrugged and turned to address his men he hardly knows what he will show us soon will he lads the mabden laughed prepare the board earl glandyth ordered i think we shall begin corum saw them bring up a wide plank of wood it was thick and pitted and stained near its four corners were fixed lengths of chain corum began to guess at the boards function two mabden grasped his arms and pushed him towards the board another brought a chisel and an iron hammer corum was pushed with his back against the board which now rested on the trunk of a tree using the chisel a mabden struck the chains from him then his arms and legs were seized and he was spreadeagled on the board while new rivets were driven into the links of chain securing him there corum could smell stale blood he could see where the board was scored with the marks of knives swords and axes where arrows had been shot into it he was on a butchers block the mabden bloodlust was rising their eyes gleamed in the firelight their breath steamed and their nostrils dilated red tongues licked thick lips and small anticipatory smiles were on several faces earl glandyth had been supervising the pinning of corum to the board now he came up and stood in front of the vadhagh and he drew a slim sharp blade from his belt the knight of the swords corum watched as the blade came towards his chest then there was a ripping sound as the knife tore the samite shirt away from his body slowly his grin spreading glandythakrae worked at the rest of corums clothing the knife only occasionally drawing a thin line of blood from his body until at last corum was completely naked glandyth stepped back now he said panting you are doubtless wondering what we intend to do with you i have seen others of my people whom you have slain corum said i think i know what you intend to do glandyth raised the little finger of his right hand while he tucked his dagger away with his left ah you see you do not know those other vadhagh died swiftly or relatively so because we had so many to find and to kill but you are the last we can take our time with you we think in fact that we will give you a chance to live if you can survive with your eyes gone your tongue put out your hands and feet removed and your genitals taken away then we will let you so survive corum stared at him in horror glandyth burst into laughter i see you appreciate our joke he signalled to his men bring the tools lets begin a great brazier was brought forward it was full of redhot charcoal and from it poked irons of various sorts these wereinstruments especially designed for torture thought corum what sort of race could conceive such things and call itself sane glandythakrae selected a long iron from the brazier and turned it this way and that inspecting the glowing tip we will begin with an eye and end with an eye ht book one raid the right eye i think if corum had eaten anything in the last few days he would have vomited then as it was bile came into his mouth and his stomach trembled and ached there were no further preliminaries glandyth began to advance with the heated iron it smoked in the cold night air now corum tried to forget the threat of torture and concentrate on his second sight trying to see into the next plane he sweated with a mixture of terror and the effork of his thought but his mind was confused alternately he saw glimpses of the next plane and the everadvancing tip of the iron coming closer and closer to his face the scene before him shivered but still glandyth came on the grey eyes burning with an unnatural lust corum twisted in the chains trying to avert his head then glandyths left hand shot and tangled itself in his hair forcing the head back bringing the iron down corum screamed as the redhot tip touched the lid of his closed eye pain filled his face and then his whole body he heard a mixture of laughter his own shouts glandyths rasping breathing and corum fainted corum wandered through the streets of a strange city the buildings were high and seemed but recently built though alrsady they were grimed and smeared with slimc there was still pain but it was remote dull he was blind in one eye from a balcony a womans voice called him he looked around it was his sister pholhinra when she saw his face she cried out in horror corum tried to put his hand to his injured eye but he eould not something held him he tried to wrench his left hand free the knight of the swords from whatever gripped it he pulled harder and harder now the wrist began to pulse with pain as he tugged pholhinra had disappeared but corum was now absorbed with nying to free his hand for some reason he could not turn to see what it was that held him sonve kind of beast perhaps holding on to his hand with its jaess corum gave one last huge tug and his wrist came free he put up the hand to touch the blind eye but still felt nothing he looked at the hand there was no hand just a wrist just a stump then he screamed again and he opened his eyes and saw the mabden holding the arm and bringing down whitehot swords on the stump to seal it they had cut off his hand and glandyth was still laughing holding corums severed hand up to show his men with corums blood still dripping from the knife he had used now corum saw the other plane distinctly superimposed as it were over the scene before him summoning all the energy borr of his fear and agony he shifted himself into that plane he saw the mabden clearly but their voices had become faint he heard them cry out in astonishment and point at him he saw glandyth wheel his eyes widening he heard the earl of krae call out to his men to search the woods for corum the board was abandoned as glandyth and his men lumbered off into the darkness seeking their vadhagh captive but their captive was still chained to the board for it like him existed on several planes and he still felt the pain they had caused him and he was still without his right book one eye and his left hand he could stay away from further mutilation for a little while but eventually his energy would give out completely and he would return to their plane and they would continue their work he struggled in the chains waving the stump of his left w rist in a futile attempt to free himself of those manacles still holding his other limbs but he knew it was hopeless he had only averted his doom for a diort while he would never be free never be able to exercise his vengeance on the murderer of his kin chapter seven the brown man corum sweated as he forced himself to remain in the other plane and he watched nervously for the return of glandyth and his men it was then that he saw a shape move cautiously out of the forest and approach the board at first corum thought it was a mabden warrior without a helmet and dressed in a huge fur jerkin then he realised that this was sonve other creature the creature moved cautiously towards the board looked about the mabden camp and then crept closer it lifted its head and stared directly at corum corum was astonished the beast could see him unike the mabden unlike the other creatures of the piane this one had second sight corums agony was so intense that he was forced to screw up his eye at the pain when he opened it again the the knight of the swords creature had come right up to the board it was a beast not unlike the mabden in general shape but it was wholly covered in its own fur its face was brown and seamed and apparently very ancient its features were flat it had large eyes round like a cats and gaping nostrils and a huge mouth filled with old yellowed fеngs yet there was a look of great sorrow on its face as it observed corum it gestured at him and grunted pointing into the forest as if it wanted corum to accompany him he shook his head indicating the manacles with a nod the creature stroked the curly brown fur of its own neck thoughtfully then it shuffled away again back into the darkness of the forest corum watched it go almost forgetful of his pain in his astonishment had the creature witnessed his torture was it trying to save him or perhaps this was an illusion like the illusion of the city and his bister induced by his agonies he felt his energy weakening a few more moments and he would be returning to the plane where the mabden would be able to see him and he knew that he would not find the strength again to leave the plane then the brown creature reappeared and it was leading something by one of its hands pointing at corum at first corum saw only a bulky shape looming over the brown creature a being that stood some twelve feet tall and was sonve six feet broad a being that like the furry beast walked on two legs corum looked up at it and saw that it had a face it was a dark face and the expression on it was sad concerned doomed the rest of its body though in outline the same as a mans seemed to refuse light no detail of it could be observed it reached out and it picked up the board as book one tenderly as a father might pick up a child it bore corum back with it into the forest unable to decide if this were fantasy or reafity corum gave up his efforts to remain on the other plane and merged back into the one he left but still the darkfated creature carried him the brown beast at its side deep into the forest moving at great speed until they were far away from the mabden camp corum fainted once again he awoke in dayfight and he saw the board lying some distance away he lay on the green grass of a valley and there was a spring nearby and close to that a little pile of nuts and fruit not far from the pile of food sat the brown beast it was watching hдn corum looked at his left arm something had been smeared on the stump and there was no pain there any more he put his right hand to his right eye and touched sticky stuff that must have been the same salve as that which was on his stump birds sang in the nearby woods the sky was clear and blue if it were not for his injuries corum might have thought the events of the last few weeks a black dream now the brown furry creature got up and shambled towards him it cleared its throat its expression was still one of sympathy it touched its own right eye its own left wrist how pain it said in a slurred tone obviously voicing the words with difficulty gone corum said i thank you brown man for your help in rescuing me the brown man frowned at him evidently not understanding all the words then it smiled and nodded its head and said good who are you corum said who was it you brought last night the knight of the swords the creature tapped its chest me serwde me friend of you serwde said corum pronouncing the name poorly i am corum and who was the other being serwde spoke a name that was far more difficult to pronounce than his own it seemed a complicated name who was he i have never seen a being like him i have never seen a being like yourself for that matter where do you come from serwde gestured about him me live here in forest forest called laahr my master live here we live here many many many days since before vadhagh you folk and where is your master now corum asked again he gone not want be seen folk and now corum dimly recalled a legend it was a legend of a creature that lived even further to the west than the people of castle erorn it was called by the legend the brown man of laahr and this was the legend come to life but be remembered no legend concerning the other being whose name he could not pronounce master say place nearby will tend you good said the brown man what sort of place serwde mabden place corum smiled crookedly no serwde the mabden will not be kind to me this different mabden all mabden are my enemies they hate me corum looked at his stump and i hate them these old mabden good mabden corum got up and staggered pain began to nag in his head his left wrist began to ache he was still completely naked and his body bore many bruises and small cuts but it had been washed book one slowly it began to dawn on hдn that he was a cripple he had been saved from the worst of what glandyth had planned for him but he was now less of a being than he had been his face was no longer pleasing for others to look at his body had become ugly and the wretch that he had become was all that was left of the noble vadhagh race he sat down again and he began to weep serwde grunted and shuffled about he touched corums shoulder with one of his handlike paws he patted corums head trying to comfort him corum wiped his face with his good hand do not worry serwde i must weep for if i did not i should almost certainly die i weep for my kin i am the last of my line there are no more vadhagh but me serwde too master too said the brown man of laahr we have no more people like us is that why you saved mey no we helped you because mabden were hurting you have the mabden ever hurt you no we hide from them their eyes bad never see us we hide from vadhagh the same why do you hide my master know we stay safe it would have been weil for the vadhagh if they had hidden but the mabden came so suddenly we were not warned we left our castles so rarely we communicated among ourselves so little we were not prepared serwde only half understood what corum was saying but he listened politely until corum stopped then he said you eat fruit good you sleep then we go to mabden place i want to find arms and armour serwde i want clothes i want a horse i want to go back to glandyth and follow him until i see him alone then i want to kill him the knight of the swords after that i will wish only to die serwde looked sadly at corum you kill only glandyth he killed my people serwde shook his head wadhagh not kill like that i do serwde i am the last vadhagh and i am the first to learn what it is to kill in malice i will be avenged on those who maimed me on those who took away my family serwde grunted miserably eat sleep corum stood up again and realised he was very weak perhaps you are right there perhaps i should try to restore my strength before i carry on he went to the pile of nuts and fruits and began to eat he could not eat much at first and lav down again to sleep confident that serwde would rouse hдn if danger threatened for five days corum staved in the valley with the brown man of laahr he hoped that the dark faced creature would come back and tell him more of his and serwdes origin but this did not happen at last his wounds had healed completely and he felt weil enough to set off on a journey on that morning he addressed serwde farewell brown man of laahr i thank you for saving me and i thank your master now i go corum saluted serwde and began to walk up the valley heading towards the east serwde came shambling after him corum corum you go wrong way i go back to where i shall find my enemies corum said that is not the wrong way my master say me take you that way serwde pointed towards the west there is only sea that way serwde it is the far tip of broanvadhagh book one my master say that way insisted serwde i am grateful for your concern serwde but i go this way to find the mabden and take my revenge you go that way serwde pointed again and put his paw on corums arm that way corum shook the paw off no this way he continued to walk up the valley towards the west then suddenly something struck him on the back of the head he reeled and turned to see what had struck him serwde stood there holding another stone ready corum cursed and was about to berate serwde when his senses left him once again and he fell fulllength on the grass he was awakened by the sound of the sea at first he could not decide what was happening to him and then he realised that he was being carried face down over serwdes shoulder he struggled but the brown man of laahr was much stronger than he appeared to be he held corum firmly corum looked to one side there was the sea green and foaming against the shingle he looked to the other side his blind side and managed to strain his head round to see what lav there it was the sea again he was being carried along a narrow piece of land that rose out of the water eventually though his head was bumping up and down as serwde jogged along he saw that they had left the mainland and were moving along some kind of natural causeway that stretched out into the ocean seabirds called corum shouted and struggled but serwde remained deaf to his curses and entreaties until the brown man stopped at last and dumped him to the ground corum got up the knight of the swords serwde i he paused looking about him they had come to the end of the causeway and were on an island that rose steeply from the sea at the peak of the island was a castle of a kind of architecture corum had never seen before was this the mabden place serwde had spoken of but serwde was already trotting back down the causeway corum called to him the brown man only increased his pace corum began to follow but he could not match the creatures speed serwde had reached the land long before corum bad crossed halfway and now his path was blocked for the tide was rising to cover the causeway corum paused in indecision looking back at the castle serwdes misguided help had placed him once again in danger now be saw mounted figures coming down the steep path from the castle they were warriors he saw the sun flash on their lances and on their breastplates unlike other mabden these did know how to ride horses and there was something in their bearing that made them look more like vadhagh than mabden but none the less they were enemies and corums choice was to face them naked or try to swim back to the mainland with only one hand he made up his mind and waded into the brine the cold water making him gasp heedless of the shouts of the riders behind him he managed to swim a little way until he was in deeper water and then the current seized him he fought to swim free of it but it was useless rapidly he was borne out to sea chapter eight the margravine of allomglyl corum had lost much blood during the mabden torturings and bad by no means recovered his original strength it was not long before he could fight the current no more and the cramps began to set in his limbs he began to drown destiny seemed determined that he should not live to take his vengeance on glandythakrae water filled his mouth and he fought to keep it from entering his tungs as he twisted and thrashed in the water then he heard a shout from above and tried to peer upwards through his good eye to locate the source of the voice stay still vadhagh youll frighten my beast theyre nervous monsters at the best of times now corum saw a dark shape hovering over him it bad great wings that spread four times the length of the largest eagles but it was not a bird and though its wings had a reptilian appearance it was not a reptile corum recognised it for what it was the ugly apelike face with its white thin fеngs was the face of a gigantic bеt and the bеt had a rider on it the rider tvas a lithe young mabden who appeared to have little in common with the mabden warriors of glandythakrae he was actually climbing down the side of the creature and making it flap lower sothat he could extend a hand to corum corum automatically stretched out his nearest arm and realised that it was the one without a hand the mabden was unconcerned he grabbed the limb near the elbow and the knight of the swords hauled corum up so that corum could use his single hand to grasp a tethering strap which secured a high saddle on the back of the great bat unceremoniously corums dripping body was hauled up and draped in front of the rider who called something in a shrill voice and made the bat climb high above the waves and turn back in the direction of the island castle the beast was evidently hard to control for the rider constantly corrected course and continued to speak to it in the highpitched language to which it responded but at length they had reached the island and were hovering over the castle corum could hardly believe that this was mabden architecture there were turrets and parapets of delicate workmanship roofwalks and balconies covered in ivy and flowers all fashioned from a fine white stone that shone in the sunshine the bat landed clumsily and the rider got off quickly pulling corum with him almost instantly the bat was up again wheeling in the sky and then diving towards a destination on the other side of the island they sleep in caves the rider explained we use them as little as possible theyre hard things to control as you saw corum said nothing for all that the mabden had saved his life and seemed both cheerful and courteous corum bad learned as an animal learns that the mabden were his enemies he glowered at the mabden what have you saved me for mabden the man looked surprised he dusted down his tunic of scarlet velvet and adjusted his swordbelt on his hips you were drowning he said why did you run away from our men when they came to greet you how did you know i was coming book one we were told by our margravine to expect you and who told your margravine i know not you are somewhat ungracious sir i thought the vadhagh a courteous folk and i thought the mabden vicious and mad corum replied but you ah you speak of the folk of the south and east eh you have met them then with his stump corum tapped his ruined eye they did this the young man nodded his head sympathetically i suppose i would have guessed mutilation is one of their favourite sports i am surprised you escaped i too well sir said the youth spreading his hand in an elaborate gesture towards a doorway in a tower would you go in corum hesitated we are not your mabden of the east sir i assure you possibly corum said harshly but mabden you are there are so many of you and now i find there are even varieties i suspect you share common traits however the young man showed signs of impatience as you like sir vadhagh i for one will go in i trust you will follow me at your leisure corum watched him enter the doorway and disappear he remained on the roof watching the seabirds drift dive and climb with his good hand he stroked the stump of his left hand and shivered a strong wind was beginning to blow and it was cold and he was naked he glanced towards the doorway a woman stood there she seemed quiet and selђcontained and had a gentleness about her her long black hair was soft and fell to below her shoulders she was wearing a gown of embroidered samite containing a the knight of the swords multitude of rich colours she smiled at him greetings she said i am rhalina who are you sir i am corum jhaelen irsei he replied her beauty was not that of a vadhagh but it affected him none the less the prince in the scarlet robe she was plainly amused i speak the old vadhagh tongue as well as the common speech you are misnamed prince corum i see no robe in fact i see no corum turned away do not mock me mabden i am resolved to suffer no further at the hands of your kind she moved nearer forgive me those who did this to you are not our kind though they be of the same race have you never heard of lywmanesh his brow furrowed the name of the land was familiar but meant nothing lywmanesh she continued is the name of the country from whence my people come that people is an ancient one and has lived in lywmanesh since well before the great battles of the vadhagh and the nhadragh shook the five planes you know of the five planes we once had seers who could look into them though their skills never matched those of the old folk your folk how do you know so much of the vadhaghy though the sense of curiosity atrophied in the vadhagh rnany centuries ago ours did not she said from time to time nhadragh ships were wrecked on our shores and though the nhadragh themselves vanished away books and tapestries and other artefacts were left behind we learned to read those books and interpret those tapestries in those days we had many scholars and now now i do not know we receive little news from the book one mainland what and it so close not that mainland prince corum said she with a nod in the direction of the shore she pointed out to sea that mainland lywmanesh or more specifically the duchy of bedwilralvanrywm on whose borders this margravate once lay prince corum watched the sea as it foamed on the rocks at the base of the island what ignorance was ours he mused when we thought we had so much wisdom why should such a race as the vadhagh be interested in the affairs of a mabden land she said our history was brief and without colour compared with yours but why a margrave here he continued what do you defend your land agarost other mabden prince corum glandyth and his kind i know of no glandyth i speak of the pony tribes they occupy the forests of yonder coast barbarians they ever represented a threat to lywmanesh the margravate was made as a bastion between those tribes and our land is the sea not sufficient a bastion the sea was not here when the margravate was established once this castle stood in a forest and the sea lay miles away to the north and the south but then the sea begav to eat our land away every year it devours more of our cliffs towns villages and castles have vanished in the space of weeks the people of the mainland retreat ever further back into the interior and you are left behind has not this castle ceased to finfil its function why do you not leave and join your folk she smiled and shrugged walking to the battlements and leaning out to watch the seabirds gather on the rocks the knight of the swords this is my home she said this is where my memories are the margrave left so many mementoes i could not leave the margrave earl moidel of allomglyl my husband ah lorum felt a strange twinge of disappointment the margravine rhalina continued to stare out to sea he is dead she said killed in a shipwreck he took our last ship and set off for the mainland seeking news of the fate of our folk a storm blew up shortly after he had gone the ship was barely seaworthy it sank corum said nothing as if the margravines words had reminded it of its temper the wind suddenly blew stronger plucking at her gown and making it swirl about her body she tunned to look at him it was a long thoughtful stare and now prince she said will you be my guest tell me one more thing lady rhalina how did you know of my coming why did the brown man bring me here he brought you at the behest of his master and his master told me to expect you and let you rest here until your mind and your body were healed i was more than willing to agree we have no visitors normally and certainly none of the vadhagh race but who is that strange being the brown mans master i saw him only briefly i could not distinguish his shape too weil though i knew he was twice my size and had a face of infinne sadness that is be he comes to the castle at night bringing sick domestic animals that have escaped our stables at some time or another we think he is a being from another plane or perhaps another age before even the age of the vadhagh and the nhadragh we cannot pronounce his book one name so wc call him simply the giant of laahr lorum smiled for the first time now i understand better to him perhaps i was another sick beast this is where he always brings sick beasts you could be right prince corum she indicated the doorway and if you are sick wc should be happy to help you mend a shadow passed over corums face as he followed her inside i fear that nothing can mend my sickness now lady it is a disease of the mabden and there are no cures known to the vadhagh weil she raid with forced lightness perhaps we mabden can devise something bitterness filled him then as they descended the steps into the mеn part of the castle be held up his stump and touched his eyeless socket but can the mabden give me back my hand and eye she tunned and paused on the steps she gave him an oddly candid look who knows she said quietly perhaps they can chapter nine concerning love and hatred although doubtless magnificent by mabden standards the margravines castle struck prince corum as simple and pleasant at her invitation he allowed himself to be bathed and oiled by castle servants and was offered a selection of clothing to wear he chose a saxvite shirt of dark blue embroidered in a design of light blue a pair of brown linen breeks the clothes fitted him weil the knight of the swords they were the margraves a girl servant told him shyly not looking at him directly none of the servants had seemed at ease with him he guessed that his appearance was repellent to them reminded of this he asked the girl would you bring me a mirror aye lord she ducked her head and left the chamber but it was the margravine herself who returred with the mirror she did not hand it to him immediately have you not seen your face since it was injured she asked he shook his head you were handsome i do not know she locked at him frankly yes she said you were handsome then she gave him the mirror the face he saw was framed by the same light golden hair but it was no longer youthful fear and agony had left their marks the face was lined and hard and the set of the mouth grim one eye of gold and purple stared bleakly back at him the other socket was an ugly hole made up of red starred tissue there was a small scar on his left cheek and another on his neck the face was still characteristically a vadhagh face but it had suffered abuse never suffered by a vadhagh before from the face of an angel it had been transformed by glandyths knives and irons into the face of a demon silently corum gave her back the mirror he passed his good hand over the scars of his face and he brooded if i was handsome i am ugly now she shrugged i have seen much worse then the rage began to fill him again and his eye blazed and he shook the stump of his hand and he shouted at her aye and you will see much worse when i have done with glandythakrae book one surprised she recoiled from him and then regained her composure if you did not know you were handsome if you were not vain then why has this affected you so much i need my hands and my eyes so that i may kill glandyth and watch hдn perish with only half of these i lose half the pleasure that is a childish statement prince corum it is not worthy of a vadhagh what else has this glandyth done corum realised that he had not told her that she would not know living in this remote place as tut off from the world as any vadhagh had been he has slain all the vadhagh he said glandyth has destroyed my race and would have destroyed me if it had not been for your friend the giant of laahr he has done what her voice was faint she was plainly shocked he has put all my folk to death for what reason have you been warring with this glandythy we did not know of his existence it did not occur to us to guard against the mabden they seemed so much like brutes incapable of harming us in our castles but they have razed all our castles every vadhagh save me is dead and most of the nhiidragh i learned who are not their cringing slaves are these the mabden whose king is called lyrabrode of kalenwyre they are i too did not know they bad become so powerful i had assumed that it was the pony tribes who had captured you i wondered why you were travelling alone so far from the rearest vadhagh castle what castle is that for a moment corum hoped that there were vadhagh still alive much further west than he the knight of the swords had guessed it is called castle eran erin some such name erorn aye that sounds the right name it is over five hundred miles from here five hundred miles have i come so far the giant of laahr must have carried me much further than i suspected that castle you mention my lady was our castle the mabden destroyed it it will take me longer than i thought to return and find earl glandyth and his denledhyssi suddenly corum realised just how alone he was it was as if he had entered another plane of earth where everything was alien to him he knew nothing of this world a world in which the mabden taled how proud his race had been how foolish if only they had concerned themselves with knowledge of the world around them instead of seeking after abstractions corum bowed his head the margravine rhalina seemed to understand his emotion she lightly touched his arm come prince of vadhagh you must eat he allowed her to lead him from the room and into another where a meal had been laid out for them both the food mainly fruit and forms of edible seaweed was much closer to his taste than any mabden food he had seen previously he realised that he was very hungry and that he was deeply tired his mind was confused and his only certainty was the hatred he still felt for glandyth and the vengeance he intended to take as soon as possible as they ate they did not speak but the margravine watched his face the whole time and once or twice she opened her lips as if to say something but then seemed to decide against it the room in which they ate was small and hung with book one rich tapestries covered in fine embroidery as he finished his food and began to observe the details of the tapestry the scenes thereon began to swim before his eyes he looked questioningly at the margravine but her face was expressionless his head felt light and he had lost the use of his limbs he tried to form words but they would not come he had been drugged the woman had poisoned his food once again he had allowed himself to become a victim of the mabden he rested his head on his arms and fell unwillingly into a deep sleep corum dreamed again he saw castle erom as he had left it when he had first ridden out he saw his fathers vise face speaking and strained to hear the words but could not he saw his mother at work writing her lotest treatise on mathematics he saw his sisters dancing to his uncles new music the atmosphere was joyful but now he realised that he could not understand their activities they seemed strange and pointless to him they were like children playing unaware that a savage beast stalked them he tried to cry out to warn them but he had no voice he saw fires begin to spring up in rooms saw mabden warriors who had entered the unprotected gates without the inhabitants being in the least aware of their presence laughing among themselves the mabden put the silk hangings and the furnishings to the torch now he saw his kinfolk again they had become aware of the tres and were rushing to seek their source his father came into a room in which glandythakrae stood hurling books on to a pyre he had erected in the middle the knight of the swords of the chamber hu fatteer watched in astomshment as glandyth burhed the books his fathers lips moved and teis eyes were questioning almost polite surprise glandyth turned and grinned at him drawing teis axe from teis belt he raised the axe now corum saw teis mother two mabden teeld teer while another heaved himself up and down on teer naked body corum tried to enter the scene but something stopped him he saw teis sisters and teis cousin suffering the same fate as teis mother again teis path to them was blocked by something invisible he struggled to get through but now the mabden were slitting the girls throats they quivered and died like slain fawns corum began to weep he was still weeping but he lay against a warm body and from somewhere in the distance came a soothing voice his head was being stroked and he was being rocked back and forth in a soft bed by the woman on whose breast he lay for a moment he tried to free himself but she held him tight he began to weep again freely this time great groans racking teis body until he slept again and now the sleep was free from dreams he awoke feeling anxious he felt that he had slept for too long that he must be up and doing something he half raised himself in the bed and then sank down again into the pillows it slowly came to him that he was much refreshed for the first time since he had set off on teis quest he felt full of energy and wellbeing even the darkness in teis mind seemed to have retreated book one so the margravine had drugged him but now it seemed it had been a drug to make him sleep to help him regain teis strength but how many days had he slept he stirred again in the bed and felt the soft warmth of another beside him on teis blind side he turhed teis head and there was rhalina teer eyes closed teer sweet face at peace he recalled teis dreaming he recalled the comfort he had been given as all the misery in him poured forth rhalina had comforted him he reached out with teis good hand to stroke the tumbled hair he felt affection for teer an affection almost as strong as he had felt for teis own family reminded of teis dead kin he stopped stroking teer pair and contemplated instead the puckered stump of teis left hand it was completely healed now leaving a rounded end of white skin he looked back at rhalina how could she bear to share teer bed with such a cripple as he looked at teer she opened teer eyes and smiled at him he thought he detected pity in that smile and was immediately resentful he began to climb from the bed but teer hand on teis shoulder stopped him stay with me corum for i need your comforting now he paused looked back at teer suspiciously please corum i believe that i love you he frowned love between vadhagh and mabden love of that kind he shook teis head impossible there could be no issue no children i know but love gives birth to other things i do not understand you i am sorry she raid i was selfish i am taking advantage of you she sat up in bed have slept with no the knight of the swords one else since my husband went away i arv not corum studied her body it moved him and yet it should not have done it was unnatural for one species to feel such emotion for another he reached down and kissed her breast she clasped his head they sank again into the sheets making gentle love learning of one another as only those truly in love may after some hours she raid to him corum you are the last of your race i will never see my people again save for those retainers who are here it is peaceful in this castle there is little that would disturb that peace would you not consider staying here with me at least for a few months i have sworn to avenge the deaths of my folk he reminded her softly and kissed her check such oaths are not true to your nature corum you are one who would rather love than hate i know i cannot answer that he replied for i will not consider my life fulfilled unless i destroy glandythakrae this wish is not so hatebegotten as you might think i feel perhaps like one who sees a disease spreading through a forest one hopes to tut out the diseased plants so that the others may grow straight and live that is my feeling concerning glandythakrae he has formed the habit of killing now that he has killed all the vadhagh he will want to kill others if he finds no more strangers he will begin to kill those wretches who occupy the villages taled by lyranbrode fate has given me the impetus i need to pursue this attitude of mine to its proper conclusion rhalina but why go from here now sooner or later we will receive news concerning this glandyth when that moment arrives then you can set forth to exact your vengeance book one he pursed his lips perhaps you are right and you must learn to do without your hand and your eye she said that will take much practice corum true so stay here with me i will agree to this much rhalina i will make no decision for a few more days and corum made no decision for a month after the horror of his encounters with the mabden raiders his brain needed time to heal and this was difficult with the constant reminder of his injuries every time he automatically tried to use his left hand or glimpsed his refiection when not with him rhalina spent much of her time in the castles library but corum had no taste for reading he would walk about the battlements of the castle or take a horse and ride over the causeway at low tide and ride for a while among the trees and though the darkness in his mind became less noticeable as the pleasant days passed it still remained and corum would sometimes pause in the middle of some action or stop when he witnessed some scene that reminded him of his horve the castle erorn the margravines castle was talled simply moidels castle and was raised on an island called moidels mount after the name of the family that had occupied it for centuries it was full of interesting things there were cabinets of porcelain and ivory figurines rooms filled with curiosities taken at different times from the sea chambers in which arms and armour were displayed paintings depicting scenes from the history of lywmanesh as well as scenes taken from the legends and folktales of that land which was rich in them such strange imaginings were rare among the vadhagh the knight of the swords who had been a rational people and they fascinated corum he came to realise that many of the stories concerning magical lands and weird beasts were derived from some knowledge of the other planes obviously the other planes had been glimpsed and the legendmakers had speculated freely from the fragments of knowledge thus gained it amused corum to trace a wild folktale back to its rather more mundane source particularly where these folktales concerned the old races the vadhagh and the nhadragh who were attributed with the most alarming range of supernatural powers he was also by this study offered some insight concerning the attitudes of the mabden of the east who seemed to have lived in awe of the old races before they had discovered that they were mortal and could be slain easily it seemed to corum that the vicious genocide engaged upon by these mabden was partly caused by their hatred of the vadhagh for not being the great seers and sorcerers the mabden had originally thought them to be but this line of thought brought back the memories and the sorrow and the hatred and corum would become depressed sometimes for days and even rhalinas love could not console him then but then one day he inspected a tapestry in a room he had not previously visited and it absorbed his attention as he looked at the pictures and studied the embroidered text this was a complete legend telling of the adventures of maganmag a popular folk hero maganmag had been returning from a magical land when his boat had been set upon by pirates these pirates had cut off maganmags arms and legs and thrown him overboard then they had cut off the head of his companion jhakorneelus and tossed his body after that of his master but kept the head apparently to eat eventually maganmags limbless body had been washed up on the shore of a mysterious island book one and jhakorneeluss headless body had arrived at a spot a little further up the beach these bodies were found by the servants of a magician who in return for maganmags services against his enemies offered to put back his limbs and make him as good as new maganmag had accepted on condition that the sorcerer find jhakorneelus a new head the sorcerer had agreed and furnished jhakorneelus with the head of a crane which seemed to please everyone the pair then went on to fight the sorcerers enemies and leave the island loaded down with his gifts corum could find no origin for this legend in the knowledge of his own folk it did not seem to fit with the others at first he dismissed his obsession with the legend as being fired by his own wish to get back the hand and the eye he had lost but he remained obsessed feeling embarrassed by his own interest he said nothing of the legend to rhalina for several weeks autumn came to moidels castle and with it a warm wind that stripped the trees bare and lashed the sea against the rocks and drove many of the birds away to seek a more restful clime and corum began to spend more and more time in the room where hung the tapestry concerning maganmag and the wonderful sorcerer corum began to realise that it was the text that chiefly interested him it seemed to speak with an authority that was elsewhere lacking in the others he had seen but he still could not bring himself to tax rhalina with questions concerning it then on one of the first days of winter she sought for him and found him in the room and she did not seem surprised however she did show a certain concern as if she had feared that he would find the tapestry sooner or later the knight of the swords you seem absorbed by the amusing adventures of maganmag she raid they are only tales something to entertain us but this one seems different corum said he turved to look at her she was biting her lip so it is different rhalina corum murmured you do know something about it she begav to shake her head then changed her mind i know only what the old tales say and the old tales are lies are they not pleasing lies truth is somewhere in this tale i feel you must tell me what you know rhalina i know more than is on this tapestry she said quietly i have been lately reading a book that relates to it i knew i had scen the book some years ago and i sought it out i find quite recent reports concerning an istand of the kind described and there is according to this book an old castle there the last person to see that island was an emissary of the duchy sailing here with supplies and greetings and that was the last emissary to visit us how long ago how long ago thirty years and then rhalina began to weep and shake her head and cough and try to control her tears he embraced her why do you weep rhalina i weep corum because this means you will leave me you will go away from moidels castle in the wintertime and you will seek that island and perhaps you too will be wrecked i weep because nothing i love stays with me corum took a step back has this thought been long in your mind it has been long in my mind and you have not spoken it because i love you so much corum book one you should not love me rhalina and i should not have allowed myself to love you though this island offers me the faintest of hopes i must seek it out i know and if i find the sorcerer and he gives me back my hand and eye madness corum he cannot exist but if he does and if he can do what i ask then i will go to find glandythakrae and i will kill him then if i live i will return but glandyth must die before i can know complete peace of mind rhalina she said softly there is no boat that is seaworthy but there are boats in the harbour caves that can be made seaworthy it will take several months to make one so will you lend me your servants to work on the boat yes then i will speak to them at once and corum left her hardening his heart to the sight of her grief blaming himself for letting himself fall in love with the woman with all the men he could muster who had some knowledge of shipcraft corum descended the steps that led from below the castle floor down through the rock to the seacaves where the ships lay he found one skiff that was in better repair than the others and he had it hauled upright and inspected rhalina had been right there was a great deal of work to be done before the skiff would safely ride the waters he would wait impatiently though now that he had a goal no matter how wild he began to feel a lessening of the weight that had been upon him he knew that he would never tire of loving rhalina but that he could never love her completely until his selfappointed task had been accomplished the knight of the swords he rushed back to the library to consult the book she had mentioned he found it and discovered that the name of the island was svianfanlabrool svianfanlabrool not a pleasant name as far as korum could make out it meant home of the gorged god what could that mean he inspected the text for an answer but found none the hours passed as he copied out the charts and reference points given by the captain of the ship that had isited moidels mount thirty years before and it was very late when he sought his bed and found rhalina there he looked down at her face she had plainly wept herself to sleep he knew that it was his turn to offer her comfort but he had no time he undressed he based himself into the bed between the liks and the furs trying not to disturb her but sheдrred scorum he did not reply he felt her body tremble for a moment but she did not peak again he sat up in bed his mind full of conflict he loved her e le should not love her he tried to settle back to go tц leep but he could not he reached out and stroked her shoulder rhalina yes corum he took a deep breath meaning to explain to her how trongly he needed to see glandyth dead to repeat that he svould return when his vengeance was taken instead he said storms blow strongly now around moidels castle i will set aside my plans until the spring i will stay until the spring book one she tumed in the bed and peered through the darkness at his face you must do as you desire pity destroys true love corum it is not pity that moves me is it your sense of justice that too is i tell myself that it is my sense of justice that makes me stay but i know otherwise then why would you stay my resolve to go has weakened what has weakened it corum something quieter in me yet something perhaps that is stronger it is my love for you rhalina that has conquered my desire to have immediate revenge on glandyth it is love that is all i can tell you and she begav to weep again but it was not from sorrow chapter ten a thousand swords winter reached its fiercest the towers seemed to shake with the force of the gales that raged around them the reas smashed against the rocks of moidels mount and somnetimes the waves seemed to rise higher than the castle itself days became almost as dark as night huge fires were lit in the castle but they could not keep out the chill that was everywhere wool and leather and fur had to be worn at all limes and the inhabitants of the castle lumbered about like bears in their thick garments yet corum and rhalina a man and a woman of alien species hardly noticed the winters brawling they sang the knight of the swords songs to each other and wrote simple sonnets concerning the depth and passion of their love it was a madness that was upon them but it was a pleasant madness a sweet madness yet madness it was when the worst of the winter had gone but before spring elected to show herself when there was still snow on the rocks below the castle and few birds sang in the grey skies above the bare and distant forests of the mainland when the sea had exhausted itself and now washed sullen and dark around the cliffs that was when the strange mabden were seen riding out of the black trees in the late morning their breath steaming and their horses stuurbling on the icy ground their harness and their arms rattling it was beldan who saw them first as he went on to the battlements to stretch his legs beldan the youth who had rescued corum from the sea turned and went hastily back into the tower and began to run down the steps until a figure blocked his way laughing at him the privy is above beldan not below beldan drew a breath and spoke slowly i was on the way to your apartments prince corum i have seen them from the battlements there is a large force corums face clouded and he seemed to be thinking a dozen thoughts at once do you recognise the force who are they mabden mabden without doubt i think they might be warriors of the pony tribes the folk against whom this margravate was built aye but they have not bothered us for a hundred years book one corum smiled grimly perhaps we all in time succumb to the ignorance that killed the vadhagh can we defend the castle beldan if it is a small force prince corum the pony tribes are normally disunited and their warriors rarely niove in bands of more than twenty or thirty and do you think it is a small force beldan shook his head no prince corum i fear it is a large one you had best alert the warriors what about the bat creatures they sleep in winter nothing will wake them what are your normal methods of defence beldan bit his lip welly we have none to speak of it has been so long since we needed to consider such things the pony tribes still fear the power of lwymanesh their fear is even superstitious since the land retreated beyond the horizon we relied on that fear then do your best beldan and ill join you shortly when ive taken a look at these warriors first they may not come in war for all wc know beldan raced away down the steps and corum climbed the tower and opened the door and went out on to the battlements he saw that the tide was beginning to go out and that when it did the natural causeway between the mainland and the castle would be exposed the sea was grey and chill the shore was bleak and the warriors were there they were shaggy men on shaggy ponies and they had helurets of iron with visors of brass beaten into the form of savage and evil faces they had cloaks of wolfskin or wool byrnies of iron jackets of leather trews of blue red or the knight of the swords yellow cloth bound around the feet and up to the knees with thongs they were armed with spears bows axes clubs and each man had a sword strapped to the saddle of his pony they were all new swords corum judged for they glinted as if freshly forged even in the dull light of that winters day there were several ranks of them already on the beach and more were trotting from the forest corum drew his sheepskin coat about him with his good hand and he kicked thoughtfully at one of the battlement stones as if to reassure himself that the castle was solid he looked at the warriors on the beach again he counted a thousand a thousand riders with a thousand newforged swords he frowned a thousand helmets of iron were turned towards moidels castle a thousand brass masks glared at corum across the water as the tide slowly receded and the causeway began to appear below the surface corum shivered a gannet flew low over the silent throng and it shrieked as if in startled terror and climbed high into the clouds a deep drum began to sound from the forest the metallic note was measured and slow and it echoed across the water it seemed that the thousand riders did not come in peace beldan came out and joined corum beldan looked pale i have spoken to the margravine and i have alerted our warriors we have a hundred and fifty able men the margravine is consulting her husbands notes he wrote a treatise on the best way to defend the castle in case of an attack of this kind he knew that the pony tribes would unite one day it seems i wish i had read that treatise said corum he book one swallowed a deep breath of the freezing air is there none here with actual experience of war none prince then we must learn rapidly aye there was a noise on the steps within the tower and brightly armoured men came out each was armed with a bow and many arrows each had a helmet on his head that was made from the curlyspined pink shell of a giant murex each controlled his fear we will try to parley with them murmured corum when the causeway is clear we will attempt to continue the conversation until the tide comes in again this will give us a few more hours in which to prepare ourselves they will suspect such a ruse surely beldan said corum nodded and rubbed at his cheek with his stump true but if we if we lie to them regarding our strength perhaps we shah be able to disconcert them a little beldan gave a wry smile but he said nothing his eyes began to shine with an odd light corum thought he recognised it as battlefever ill see what the margravine has learned from her husbands texts corum said stay here and watch beldan let me know if they begin to move that damned drum beldan pressed his hand to his temple it makes my brains shiver try to ignore it it is meant to weaken our resolve corum entered the tower and ran down the steps until he came to the floor where he and rhalina had their apartments she was seated at a table with manuscripts spread out before her she looked up as he entered and she tried to smile we are paying a price for the gift of love it seems he looked at her in surprise thats a mabden the knight of the swords conception i think i do not understand it and i am a fool to make so shallow a statement but i wish they had not chosen this time to come against us they have had a hundred years to choose from what have you learned from your husbands notes where our weakest positions are where our ramparts are best defended i have already stationed men there cauldrons of lead are being heated for what purpose you really do know little of war she said less than do i the molten lead will be poured on the heads of the invaders when they try to storm our walls corum shuddered must we be so crude we are not vadhagh we are not fighting nhadragh i believe you can expect these mabden to have certain crude battle practices of their own of course i had best cast an eye over the margraves manuscripts he was evidently a man who understood the realities aye she said softly handing him a sheet certain kinds of reality at any rate it was the first time he had heard her offer an opinion of teer husband he stared at her wanting to ask more but he waved a delicate hand you had best read swiftly you vill understand the writing easily enough my husband chose to write in the old high speech we learned from the vadhagh corum looked at the writing it was wellformed but without any individual character it seemed to him that it was a somewhat soulless imitation of vadhagh writing but it was as she had said easy enough to understand there was a knock on the main door to their apartments while corum read rhalina went to answer it a soldier stood there beldan sent me lady margravine he asked prince book one corum to join him on the battlements corum put down the sheets of manuscript i will come immediately rhalina will you see that my arms and armour are prepared she nodded he left the causeway was almost clear of water now beldan was yelling something across to the warriors on the bank speaking of a parley the drum continued its slow but steady beat the warriors did not reply beldan turned to corum they might be dead men for all theyll respond they seem singularly wellordered for barbarians i think there is some extra element to this situation that has not revealed itself as yet corum had the same feeling why did you send for me beldan i saw something in the treel a flash of gold i am not sure vadhagh eyes are said to be sharper than mabden eyes tell me prince if you can make anything out over there he pointed corums smile was bitter two mabden eyes are better than one vadhagh but none the less he peered in the direction beldan indicated sure enough there was something hidden by the treel he altered the angle of his vision to see if he could make it out more clearly and then he realised what it was it was a gold decorated chariot wheel as he watched the wheel began to turn horses emerged from the forest four shaggy horses slightly iarger than those ridden by the pony tribes drawing a huge chariot in which stood a tall warrior corum recognised the driver of the chariot the mabden was dressed in fur and leather and iron and had a vinged helmet and a great beard and held himself proudly the knight of the swords it is earl glandythakrae my enemy said corum softly beldan said is that the one who took off your hand and put out your eye corum nodded then perhaps it is he who has united the pony tribes and given them those bright new swords they carry and drilled them to the order they now hold i think it likely i have brought this upon moidels castle beldan beldan shrugged it would have come you made our margravine happy i have never known her happy before prince you mabden seem to think that happiness must be bought with misery i suppose we do it is not easy for a vadhagh to understand that we believe believed that happiness was a natural condition of reasoning beings now from the forest emerged another twenty chariots they arranged themselves behind glandyth so that the earl of krae was between the silent masked warriors and his own followers the denledhyssi the drum stopped its beating corum listened to the tide drawing back now the causeway was completely exposed he must have followed me learned where i was and spent the winter recruiting and training those warriors corum said but how did he discover your hiding place beldan said for answer the ranks of the pony tribes opened and glandyth drove his chariot down towards the causeway he bent and picked something from the floor of his book one chariot raised it above his head and flung it over the backs of his horses to fall upon the causeway corum shuddered when he recognised it beldan stiffened and stretched out his hand to grasp the stone of the battlement lowering his head is it the brown man prince corum it is the creature was so innocent so kind could not its master save it they must have tortured it to get the information concerning your whereabouts corum straightened his back his voice was soft and cold when he spoke next i once told your mistress that glandyth was a disease that must be stopped i should have sought him out sooner beldan he would have killed you but he would not have killed the brown man of laahr serwde would still be serving his sad master i think there is a doom upon me beldan i think i am meant to be dead and that all those who help me to continue living are doomed also i will go out now and fight glandyth alone then the castle will be saved beldan swallowed and spoke hoarsely we chose to help you you did not ask for that help let us choose when we shall take back that help no for if you do the margravine and all her people will surely perish they will perish anyway beldan told him not if i let glandyth take me glandyth must have offered the pony tribes this castle as a prize if they would assist him beldan pointed out they do not care about you they wish to destroy and ioot something that they have hated for centuries certainly it is likely that glandyth would be content with you he would go away but he would leave his thousand the knight of dm swords swords behind we must all fight together prince corum there is nothing else for it now chapter eleven the summoning corum returned to his apartments where his arms and his armour had been laid out for him the armour was unfamiliar consisting of breastplate backplate greaves and a kilt all made from the pearly blue shells of a sea creature called the anufec which had once inhabited the waters of the west the shell was stronger than the toughest iron and lighter than any byrnie a great spined helmet with a jutting peak had like the helurets of the other warriors of moidels castle been manufactured from the shell of the giant murex servants helped corum don his gear and they gave him a huge iron broadsword that was so weil balanced that he could hold it in his one good hand his shield which he had them strap to his handless arm was the shell of a massive crab which had once lived the servants told him in a place far beyond even lywmanesh and known as the land of the distant sea this armour had belonged to the dead margrave who had inherited it from his ancestors who had owned it long before it had been considered necessary to establish a margravate at all corum called to rhalina as he was prepared for battle but although he could see her through the doors dividing the chambers she didnot look up from her papers it was book one the last of the margraves manuscripts and it seemed to absorb her more than the others corum left to return to the battlements save for the fact that glandyths chariot was now on the approach to the causeway the ranks of the warriors had not shifted the little broken corpse of the brown man of laahr still lay on the causeway the drum had begun to beat again why do they not advance beldan said his voice sharp with tension perhaps for a twofold reason corum replied they are hoping to terrify us and banish the terror in themselves they are terrified of us the pony tribesmen probably are after all they have as you told me yourself lived in superstitious fear of the folk of lywmanesh for centuries they doubtless suspect we have supernatural means of defence beldan could not restrain an ironic grin you begin to understand the mabden at last prince corum better than i it seems corum gestured towards glandythakrae there is the mabden who gave me my first lesson he seems without fear at least he does not fear swords but he fears himself of all mabden traits i would say that that was the most destructive now glandyth was raising a gauntleted hand again silence fell wadhagh came the savage voice can you see who it is who has come to call on you in the castle of vermin corum did not reply hidden by a battlement he watched as glandyth scanned the ramparts seeking him out wadhagh are you there the knight of the swords beldan looked questioningly at corum who continued to remain silent vadhagh you see we have destroyed your demon familiar now wc are going to destroy you and those most despicable of mabden who have given you shelter vadhagh speak corum murmured to beldan we must stretch this pause as far as it will go every second brings the tide back to cover our causeway they will strike soon beldan said well before the fide returns vadhagh oh you are the most cowardly of a cowardly race corum now saw glandyth begin to turn his head back towards his men as if to give the order to attack he emerged from his cover and raised his voice his speech even in cold anger was liquid music compared with glandyths rasping tones here i am glandythakrae most wretched and pitiable of mabden disconcerted glandyth turned his head back then he burst into raucous laughter i am not the wretch he reached inside his furs and drew something out that was on a string round his neck would you come and fetch this hack from me corum felt bile come when he saw what glandyth ported it was corums ovrn mummified hand still benring the ring that his sister had given him and look glandyth took a small leather bag from his turs and waved it at corum i have also saved your eye corum controlled his hatred and his nausea and called you may have the rest glandyth if you will turn back your horde and depart from moidels castle in peace glandyth flung his chin towards the sky and roared with laughter oh no vadhagh they would not let me rob them of a fight let alone their prize they have waited book one many months for this they are going to slay all their ancient enemies and i am going to slay you i had planned to spend the winter in the comfort of lyranbrodes court instead i have had to camp in skin tents with our friends here i intend to slay you quickly vadhagh i promise you i have no more time to spend on a crippled piece of offal such as yourself he laughed again who is the athing now then you would not be afraid to fight me alone coruri called you could do battle on this causeway with me and doubtless kill me very quickly then you could leave the castle to your friends and return to your own land the faster glandyth frowned debating this with himself why should you sacrifice your life a little earller than you veed to i am tired of living as a cripple i am tued of fearing you and your men glandyth was not convinced corum was trying to buy time with his talk and his suggestion but on the other hand it did not matter to glandyth how much trouble the pony tribesmen would be forced to go to to take the castle after he had killed corum eventually he nodded shouting back very well vadhagh come down to the causeway i will tell my men to stand off until we have had our fight if you kill me i will have my charioteers leave the battle to the others i do not believe that part of your bargain corum replied i am not interested in it either i will come down corum took his time descending the steps he did not vant to die at glandyths hand and he knew that if glandyth did by some luck fall to him the earl of kraes men would swiftly leap to their masters assistance all he hoped for was to gain a few hours for the defenders rhalina met him outside their apartments the knight of the swords where go you corum i go to fight glandyth and most probably to die he said i shall die loving you rhalina her face was a mask of horror corum no t is necessary if this castle is to have a chance of withstanding those warriors no corum there may be a way to get help my husband speaks of it in his treatise a last resort what help he is vague on that score it is something passed on to him by his forefathers a summoning sorcery corum corum smiled sadly there is no such thing as sorcery rhalina what you call sorcery is a handful of halflearned scraps of vadhagh wisdom this is not vadhagh wisdom it is something else a summoning he made to move past her she held his arm corum let me try the summoning he pulled his arm away and sword in hand continued down the steps very well try what you will rhalina even if you are right you will need the time i can gain for you he heard her shout wordlessly and lic heard her sob and then be had reached the hall and was walking towards the great main gates of the castle a startled warrior let him through and he stood at last upon the causecvdy at the other end his chariot arid horses led away the body of the brown man kicked to one side stood earl glandythakrae and beside glandythakrae holding his waraxe for him was the gawky figure of the youth rodlik glandyth reached out and tousled his pages hair and bared his teeth in a wolfish grin he took the axe from the youths hand and began to advance along the causeway corum walked to meet him book one the sea slapped against the rocks of the causeway sometimes a seabird cried out there was no sound from the warriors of either side both defenders and attackers watched tensely as the two approached each other and then in the middle stopped about ten feet separated them corum saw that glandyth had grown a little thinner but the pale grey eyes still contained that strange unnatural glint and the face was just as red and unhealthy as the last time corum had scen it he held his waraxe down in front of him in his two hands his helmeted head on one side by the dog he said you have become hugely ugly vadhagh we make a fine pair then mabden for you have changed not at all glandyth sneered and you are hung all about with pretty shells i see like some sea gods daughter going to be wed to her fishy husband well you may become their nuptial feast when i throw your body into the sea corum wearied of these heavy insults he leapt forward and swung his great broadsword at glandyth who brought his metalshod axe haft up swiftly and blocked the blow staggering a little he kept his axe in his right hand and drew his long knife dropped to a crouch and aimed the axe at corums knees corum jumped high and the axe blade whistled under his feet he stabbed out at glandyth and the blade scraped the mabdens shoulder plate but did not harm him none the less glandyth cursed and tried the same trick again again corum jumped and the axe missed him glandyth sprang back and brought the axe down on the crabshell shield which creaked with the strain of the blow but did not shatter though corums arm was nutub from wrist to shoulder he retaliated with an overarm blow which glandyth blocked the knight of the swords corum kicked out at glandyths legs hoping to knock him off balance but the mabden ran backwards several paces before standing his ground again corum advanced cautiously towards him then glandyth cried out im tired of this we have him now archers shoot and then corum saw the charioteers who had moved quietly down to the fцrefront of the ranks and were aiming their bows at him he raised his shield to protect himself against their arrows glandyth was running back down the causeway corum had been betrayed there was still an hour before the tide came in it seemed he was going to die for nothing now another shout this time from the castles battlements and a wave of arrows swept down beldans archers had shot first the denledhyssi arrows rattled on corums shield and against his greaves he felt something bite into his leg just above the knee where he had scant protection he looked down it was an arrow it had passed completely through his leg and now half of it stuck out behind his knee he tried to stumble backwards but it was hard to run with the arrow in him to pull it out with his only hand would mean he would have to drцp his sword he glanced towards the shore as he had known they would the first of the horsemen were beginning to cross he began to drag himself back along the causeway for a few more yards and then he knew he would never reach the gates in time quickly he knelt on his good leg put his sword on the ground snapped off part of the arrow at the front and drew the rest through his leg flinging it to one side he picked up his sword again and prepared to stand his book one ground the warriors in the brass warmasks were galloping along the causeway two abreast their new swords in their hands corum struck at the first rider and his blow was a lucky one for it hurled the man from his saddle the other rider had tried to strike at corum but had missed and overshot corum swung himself up intц the ponys primitive saddle for stirrups there were just two leather loops hanging from the girth strap painfully corum managed to get his feet into these and block the sword blow from the returning rider another rider came up now and his sword clanged on corums shield the horres were snorting and trying to rear but the causeway was so narrow there was little room for manoeuvre and neither corum nor the other two could use their swords effectively as they tried to control their halfpanicked horses the rest of the masked riders were forced to rein in their beasts for fear of toppling off the causeway into the rea and this gave beldans archers the opportunity they required dark sheets of arrows sped from the battlements and into the ranks of the pony tribesmen more ponies went down than men but it added further to the confusion slowly corum retreated down the causeway until he was almost at the gate his shield arm was completely paralysed and his sword arm aching dreadfully but he still managed to continue defending himself against the riders glandyth was screaming at the pony barbarians trying to force them to retreat and regroup evidently his plans of attack had not been followed corum managed to grin at least that was something he bad gained now the gates of the castle suddenly opened behind him beldan stood there with fifty archers poised to shoot in corum quickly beldan cried understanding beldans intention corum flung himself the knight of the sovords from the back of the pony and bent double running towards the gates as the first flight of arrows rushed over his head then he was through the gates and they had closed corum leant panting against a pillar he felt he had failed in his intention but now beldan was slapping his shoulder the tides coming in corum we succeededl the slap was enough to topple corum he saw beldans surprised expression as he fell to the flagstones and for a moment he was amused by the situation before he passed out completely as he awoke in his own bed with rhalina sitting at the table nearby still reading from the manuscripts corum realised that no matter how weil he trained himself to fight no matter how weil he had survived during the battle of the causeway he would not survive long in the mabden world with both a hand and an eye gone i must have a new hand he said sitting upright i must have a new eye rhalina rhalina did not appear to hear him at first then she looked up her face was tired and drawn in lines of heavy concentration absently she said rest and returned to her reading there was a knock beldan came in quickly corum began to get out of bed he winced as he moved his wounded leg was stiff and his whole body was bruised they lost some thirty men in that encounter beldan said the tide goes out again just before sunset pm not sure if theyll try another attack then i would say they will wait until morning corum frowned it depends on glandyth id say he would judge that we wouldnt expect an evening attack and would therefore try to make one but if those pony tribesmen are as superstitious as we think they might be reluctant to fight at night we had best prepare for an book one attack цn the next tide and guard all sides of the castle how does that match with the margraves treatisp rhalina she locked up vaguely nodding weil enough corum began painfully to buckle on his armour beldan helped him they left for the battlements the denledhyssi had regrouped on the shore the dead men and their ponies as weil as the corpse of the brown man of laahr had been washed away by the sea a few corpses bobbed among the rocks below the castle they had formed the same ranks as earlier the mounted masked riders were massed some ten ranks deep with glandyth behind them and the charioteers behind glandyth cauldrons of lead bubbled on fires built on the battlements small catapults had been erected with piles of stone balls beside them for ammunition extra arrows and javelins were heaped by the far wall again the fide was retreating the metallic drum began to beat again there was the distant jingle of harness glandyth was speaking to some of the horsemen i think he will attack said corum the sun was low and all the world seemed turned to a dark chill grey they watched as the causeway gradually became exposed until only a foot or two of water covered it then the beat of the drum became more rapid there was a howl from the riders they began to move forward and splash on to the causeway the real battle for moidels castle had begun not all the horsemen rode along the causeway about twothirds of the force remained on the shore corum guessed what this meant the knight of the swords are all points of the castle guarded now beldany they are prince corum good i think theyll try to swim their horses round and get a hold on the rocks so that they can attack from all sides when darkness falls have flare arrows shot regularly at all quarters then the horsemen were storming the castle the cauldrons of lead were upended and beasts and riders screamed in pain as the whitehot metal flooded over them the sea hissed and steamed as the lead hit it some of the riders had brought up battering rams slung between their mounts they began to charge at the gates riders were shot from their saddles but the horses ran wildly on one of the rams struck the gates and smashed into them and through them becoming jammed the riders strove to extricate it but could not they were struck by a wave of boiling lead but the ram remained get archers to the gates corum commanded and have horses ready in case the main hall is breached it was almost dark but the fight continued some of the barbarians were riding round the lowers parts of the hill corum saw the next rank leave the shore and begin to swim their horses through the shallow waters but glandyth and his charioteers remained on the beach taking no part in the battle doubtless glandyth planned towait until the castle defences were breached before he crossed the causeway corums hatred of the earl of krae had increased since the betrayal earlier that day and now he saw him using the superstitious barbarians for his own purposes corum knew that his judgement of glandyth was right the man would corrupt anything with which he came in contact all around the castle now the defenders were dying from spear and arrow wounds at least fifty were dead or badly hurt and the remaining hundred were spread very book one thinly corum made a rapid tour of the defences encouraging the warriors to greater efforts but now the boiling lead was finished and arrows and spears were running short soon the handtohand fighting would begin night fell flare arrows revealed bands of barbarians all around the castle beacons burned on the battlements the fighting continued the barbarians reconcentrated on the main gates more rams were brought up the gates began to groan and give way corum took all the men he could spare into the main hall there they mounted their horses and formed a semicircle behind the archers waiting for the barbarians to come through more rams pierced the gates and corum heard the sound of swords and axes beating on the splintered timbers outside suddenly they were through yelling and howling firelight glinted on their masks of brass making them look even more evil and terrifying their ponies snorted and reared there was time for only one wave of arrows then the archers retreated to make way for corum and his cavalry to charge the disconcerted barbarians corums sword smashed into a mask sheared through it and destroyed the face beneath blood splashed high and a nearby brand fizzed as the liquid hit it forgetful of the pain of his wounds corum swung the sword back and forth knocking riders from their mounts striking heads from shoulders limbs from bodies but slowly he and his remaining men were retreating as fresh waves of pony tribesmen surged into the castle now they were at the far end of the hall where a stone stairway curled up to the next floor the archers were the knight of the swords positioned here along the stairs and began to shoot their arrows into the barbarians the barbarians not directly engaged with corums men retaliated with javelins and arrows and slowly moidels archers fell corum glanced around him as he fought there were few left with him perhaps a dozen and there were some fifty barbarians in the hall the fight was nearing its conclusion within moments he and his friends would all be dead he saw beldan begin to descend the stairs at first corum thought he was bringing up reinforcements but he had only two warriors with him corum corum corum was pressed by two barbarians he could not reply corum where is the lady rhalina corum found extra strength now he delivered a blow to the first barbarians skull which killed him he kicked the man from his saddle then stood on the back of his horse and jumped to the stairs what is the lady rhalina in danger i do not know prince i cannot discover where she is i fear corum raced up the stairs from below the noise of the battle was changing there seemed to be disconcerted shouts coming from the barbarians he paused and looked back the barbarians were beginning to retreat in panic corum could not understand what was happening but he had no more time to watch he reached his apartments rhalina rhalina no reply here and there were the bodfes of their own warriors and barbarians who had managed to sneak into the castle through poorly defended windows and balconies book one had rhalina been taken by a party of barbarians then from the balcony of her apartment he heard a strange sound it was a singing sound like nothing he had experienced before he paused then approached the balcony cautiously rhalina stood there and she was singing the wind caught her garments and spread them about her like strange multicoloured clouds her eyes were fixed on the far distance and her throat vibrated with the sounds she made she seemed to be in a trance and corum made no sound but watched the words she sang were in no language he knew doubtless it was an ancient mabden language it made him shudder then she stopped and tusned in his direction but she did not see him still in the trance she walked straight past him and back into the room corum peered around a buttress he had seen an odd green light shining in the direction of the mainland he saw nothing more but heard the yells of the barbarians as they splashed about near the causeway there was no doubt now but they were retreating corum entered the apartments rhalina was sitting in her chair by the table she was stiff and could not hear him when he murmured her name hoping that she would succumb no further to the peculiar trance he left the room and ran for the main battlements beldan was already there his jaw slack as he watched what was taking place there was a huge ship rounding the headland to the north it was the source of the strange green light and it sailed rapidly though there was no wind at all now the barbarians were scrambling on to their horses or plunging on foot through the water that was beginning to cover the the knight of the swords causeway they seemed mad with fear from the darkness on the shore corum heard glandyth cursing them and trying to make them go back the ship flickered with many small fires it seemed its masts and its hull seemed encrusted with dull jewels and corum saw what the barbarians had seen he saw the crew flesh rotted on their faces and limbs the ship was crewed by corpses what is it beldan he whispered sonve artful illusion beldans voice was hoarse i do not think it is an illusion prince corum then what it is a summoning that is the old margraves ship it has been drawn up to the surface its crew has been given something like life and see he pointed to the figure on the poop a skeletal creature in armour which like corums was made from great shells whose sunken eyes flickered with the same green fire that covered the ship like weed there is the margrave himself returved to save his castle corum forced himself to watch as the apparition drew closer and what else has he returved for i wonder he said chapter twelve the margraves bargain the ship reached the causeway and stopped it reeked of ozone and of decay if it be an illusion corum murmured grimly it is a book one good one beldan made no reply in the distance they heard the barbarians blundering off through the forest they heard the sound of the chariots turning as glandyth pursued his allies though ail the corpses were armed they did not move simply tumed their heads as one towards the main gate of the castle corum was transfixed in astonished terror the events he was witnessing were like something from the superstitious mind of a mabden they could have no existence in actuality such images were those created by ignorant fear and morbid imagination they were something from the crudest and most barbaric of the tapestries he had looked at in the castle what will they do now beldan i have no understanding of the occult prince the lady rhalina is the only one of us who has made some study of such things it was she who made this summoning i only know that there is said to be a bargain involved a bargain beldan gasped the margravine corum saw that rhalina still walking in a trance had left the gates and was moving calfdeep along the causeway towards the ship the head of the dead margrave tumed slightly and the green fire in his eyesockets seemed to burn more deeply no corum raced from the battlements leapt down the stairway and stumbled through the main hall over the corpses of the fallen no rhalina no he reached the causeway and began to wade after her the stench from the ship of the dead choking him the knight of the swords rhalina it was a dream worse than any he had had since glandyths destruction of castle erorn rhalina she had almost reached the ship when corum caught up with her and seized her by the arm with his good hand she seeming oblivious of him continued to try to reach the ship rhalina what bargain did you make to save us why did this ship of the dead come here her voice was cold toneless i will join my husband now no rhalina such a bargain cannot be honoured it is obscene it is evil it it he tried to express his knowledge that such things as this could not exist that they were all under some peculiar hallucination come back with me rhalina let the ship return to the depths i must go with it those were the terms of our bargain he clung to her trying to drag her back and then another voice spoke it was a voice that seemed without substance and yet which echoed in his skull and made him pause she sails with us prince of the vadhagh this must be corum looked up the dead margrave had raised his hand in a commanding gesture the eyes of fire burned deeply into corums single eye corum tried to alter his perspective to see into the other dimensions around him at last be succeeded but it made no difference the ship was in each of the five dimensions he could not escape it i will not let her sail with you corum rephed your bargain was unjust why should she die she does not die she will awaken soon what beneath the waves book one she has given this ship life without it wc shall sink again with her on board wc live live you do not live it is better than death then death must be something more mul than i imagined for us it is prince of the vadhagh wc are the slaves of shoolanjyvan for we died in the waters he rules now let us be rejoined my wife and myself no corum took a firmer grip on rhalinas arm who is this shoolanjyvan he is our master he is of svianfanlabrool the home of the gorged god the place where corum had meant to go before rhalinas love had kept him at moidels castle now let my wife come aboard what can you do to make me you are dead you have only the power to frighten away barbarians we saved your life now give us the means to live she must come with us the dead are selfish the corpse nodded and the green fire dimmed a little aye the dead are selfish now corum saw that the rest of the crew were beginning to move he heard the slithering of their feet on the slimegrown deck he saw their rotting flesh their glowing eyesockets he began to move backwards dragging rhalina with him but rhalina would not go willingly and he was completely exhausted panting he paused speaking urgently to her rhalina i know you never loved him even in life you love me i love you surely that is stronger than any bargain i must join my husband the dead crew had descended to the causeway and were moving towards them corum had left his sword behind the knight of the swords he had no weapons stand back he cried the dead have no right to take the living on came the corpses corum cried up to the figure of margrave still on the poop stop them take me instead of her make a bargain with me i cannot then let me sail with her what is the harm in that you will have two living beings to warm your dead souls the margrave appeared to consider this why should you do it the living have no liking for the dead i love rhalina it is love do you understand love the dead know nothing of love yet you want your wife with you she proposed the bargain shoolanjyvan heard her and sent us the shuffling corpses had completely surrounded them now corum gagged at their stench then i will come with you the dead margrave inclined his head escorted by the shuffiing corpses corum allowed himself and rhalina to be led aboard the ship it was covered in scum from the bottom of the sea weed draped it giving off the strange green fire what corum had thought were dull jewels were coloured barnacles which encrusted everything slime lay on all surfaces while the margrave watched from his poop corum and rhalina were taken to a cabin and made to enter it was almost pitchblack and it stank of decay he heard the rotting timbers creak and the ship began to move it sailed rapidly without wind or any other understandable means of propulsion book one it sailed for svianfanlabrool the island of the legends the home of the gorged god book two in wpich prince corum receives a gift and makes a pact chapter one the ambitious sorcerer as they sailed through the night corum made many attempts to waken rhalina from per trance but nothing worked she lay among the damp and rotting silks of a bunk and stared at the roof through a porthole too small to afford escape came a faint green light corum paced the cabin still barely able to believe his predicament these were plainly the dead margraves own quarters and if corum were not here now would the margrave be sharing the bunk with his wife corum shuddered and pressed his hand to his skull certain that he was insane or had been entranced certain that none of this could be as a vadhagh he was prepared for many events and situations that would have seemed strange to the mabden yet this was something that seemed completely unnatural to him it defied all he knew of science if he were sane and all was as it seemed then the mabdens powers were the knight of the swords greater than anything the vadhagh had known yet they were dark and morbid powers unhealthy powers that were qumtessentially evil corum was tired but he could not sleep everything be touched was slimy and made him feel ill he tested the lock on the cabin door although the wood was rotten the door seemed unusually strong some other force was at work here the timbers of the ship were bound by more than rivets and tar the weariness did not help his head to clear his thoughts remained confused and desperate he peered frequently through the porthole hoping to get some sort of bearing but it was impossible to see anything more than the occasional wave and a star in the sky then much later he noticed the first line of grey on the horizon and he was relieved that morning was coming this ship was a ship of the night it would disappear with the sun and he and rhalina would awake to find themselves in their own bed but what had frightened the barbarians or was that part of the dream perhaps his collapse within the gates after his fight with glandyth had induced a feverish dream perhaps his comrades were still fighting for their lives against the pony tribesmen he rubbed his head with the stump of his hand he licked his dry lips and tried to peer once again into the dimensions but the other dimensions were closed to him he paced the cabin waiting for the morning but then a strange droning sound came to his ears it made his brain itch he wrinkled his scalp he rubbed his face the droning increased his ears ached his teeth were on edge the volume grew he put his good hand to one ear and covered the other with his arm tears came into his eye in the socket where book two the other eye had been a huge pain pulsed he stumbled from side to side of the rotting cabin and even attempted to break through the door but his senses were leaving him the scene grew dim he stood in a dark hall with walls of fluted stone which curved over his head and touched to form the roof high above the workmanship of the hall was equal to anything the vadhagh had created but it was not beautiful rather it was sinister his head ached the air before him shimmered with a pale blue light and then a tall youth stood there the face was young but the eyes were ancient he was dressed in a simple flowing gown of yellow samite he bowed turned his back walked a little way and then sat down on a stone bench that had been built into the wall corum frowned you believe you dream master corum i am prince corum in the scarlet robe last of the vadhagh race there are no other princes here but me said the youth softly i will allow none if you understand that there will be no tension between us corum shrugged i believe i dream yes in a sense you do of course as we all dream for some while vadhagh you have been trapped in a mabden dream the rules of the mabden control your fate and you resent it where is the ship that brought me here where is rhalina the ship cannot sail by day it has returned to the depths rhalina the knight of the swords the youth smiled she has gone with it of course that was the bargain she made then she is dead no she lives how can she live when she is below the surface of the ocean she lives she always will she cheers the crew enormously who are you i believe you have guessed my name shoolanjyvan prince shoolanjyvan lord of all that is dead in the sca one of my several titles give me back rhalina i intend to corum looked suspiciously at the sorcerer alhaty you do not think i would bother to answer such a feeble attempt at a summoning as the one she made do you if i did not have other motives in mind your motive is clear you relished the horror of her predicament nonsense am i so childish i have outgrown such things i see you are beginning to argue in mabden terms it is just as weil for you if you wish to survive in this mabden dream it is a dream y of sorts real enough it is what you might call the dream of a god there again you might say that it is a dream that a god has allowed to become reality i refer of course to the knight of the swords who rules the five planes the sword rulers they do not exist it is a superstition once entertained by the vadhagh and the nhadragh the sword rulers do exist master cornun you have book two one of them at least to thank for your misfortunes it was the knight of the swords who decided to let the mabden grow strong and destroy the old races јwhy because he was bored by you who would not be the world has become more interesting now pm sure you will agree chaos and destruction is interesting corum made an impatient gesture i thought you had outgrown such childish ideas shoolanjyvan smiled perhaps i have but has the knight of the swordsy you do not speak plainly prince shoolu true a vice i firad impossible to give up still it enlivens a dull conversation sometimes if you are bored with this conversation return rhalina to me and i will leave shool smiled again i have it in my power to bring rhalina back to you and to set you free that is why i let master moidel answer her summoning i wished to meet you master corum you did not know i would come i thought it likely why did you wish to meet me i have something to offer you in case you refused my gift i thought it wise to have mistress rhalina on hand and why should i refuse a gift shool shrugged my gifts are sometimes refused folk are suspicious of me the nature of my calling disturbs them few have a kind word for a sorcerer master corum corum peered around him in the gloom where is the door i will seek rhalina myself i am very weary prince shool of course you are you have suffered much you the knight of the swords thought your own sweet dream a reality and you thought reality a dream a shock there is no door i have no need of them will you not hear me out if you choose to speak in a less elliptical manner aye you are a poor guest vadhagh i thought your race a courteous one i am no longer typical a shame that the last of a race should not typify its virtues however i am i hope a better host and i will comply with your request i am an ancient being i am not of the mabden and i am not of the folk you call the old races i came before you i belonged to a race which began to degenerate i did not wish to degenerate and so i concerned myself with the discovery of scientific ways in which i could preserve my mind in all its wisdom i discovered the ureans to do such a thing as you see i am essentially pure mind i can transfer myself from one body to another with some effort and thus am immortal efforts have been made to extinguish me over the millennia but they have never been successful it would have involved the destruction of too much therefore i have generally speaking been allowed to continue my existence and my experiments my wisdom has grown i control both life and death i can destroy and i can bring back to life i can give other beings immortality if i choose by my own mind and my own skill i have become in short a god perhaps not the urost powerful of gods but that will come eventually now you will understand that the gods who simply shool spread his hands popped into existence who exist only through some cosmic fluke why they resent me they refuse to acknowledge my godhood they are jealous they would like to have done with me for i disturb their selfesteem the knight of the swords is my enemy he wishes me dead so you see we have much in common master corum book rwo i am no god prince shool in fact until recently i had no belief in gods either the fact that you are not a god master corum is evident from your obtuseness that is not what i meant what i did urean was this we are both the last representatives of races whom for reasons of their own the sword rulers decided to destroy we are both in their eyes anachronisms which must be eradicated as they replaced my folk with the vadhagh and the nhadragh so they are replacing the vadhagh and the nhadragh with the mabden a similar degeneration is taking place in your people forgive me if i associate you with the nhadragh as it did in mine like me you have attempted to resist this to fight against it i chose science you chose the sword i will leave it to you to decide which was the wisest choice you seem somewhat petty for a god corum said losing his patience now i am a petty god at the moment you will find me more lordly and benign when i achieve the position of a greater god will you let me continue master corum can you not understand that i have acted so far out of fellow feeling for you nothing you have done so far seems to indicate your friendship i said fellow feeling not friendship i assure you master corum i could destroy you in an instant and your lady too i would feel more patience if i knew you had released her from ehat dreadful bargain she made and brought her here so that i could see for myself that she still lived and is capable of being saved you will have to take my word then destroy me prince shool got up his gestures were the testy gestures the knight of the swords of a very old man they did not match the youthful body at all and made the sight of him even more obscene you should have greater respect for me master corum why is that i have seen a few tricks and heard a great deal of pompous talk i am offering you much i warn you be more pleasant to me what are you offering me prince shools eyes narrowed i am offering you your life i could take it you have told me that i am offering you a new hand and a new eye corums interest evidently betrayed itself for prince shool chuckled i am offering you the return of this mabden female you have such a perverse affection for prince shool raised his hand oh very weil i apologise each to his own pleasures i suppose i am offering you the opportunity to take vengeance on the cause of your ills glandythakrae no no no the knight of the swords the knight of the swords the one who allowed the mabden to take root in the first place in this plane but what of glandyth i have sworn his destruction you accuse me of pettiness your ambitions are tiny with the powers i offer you you can destroy any nutuber of mabden earls continue continue continue have i not offered you enough you do not say how you propose to make these offers into something more than so much breath oh you are insulting the mabden fear me the mabden gibber when i materialise myself some of them die of terror when i make my powers manifest i have seen too much horror of late prince corum said book two that should make no difference your trouble is vadhagh that these horrors i employ are mabden horrors you associate with mabden but you are still a vadhagh the dark dreams of the mabden frighten you less than they frighten the mabden themselves if you had been a mabden i should have had an easier task of convincing you but you could not use a mabden for the task you have in mind corum said grimly am i right your brains axe sharpening that is exactly the truth no mabden could survive what you must survive and i am not sure thеt even a vadhagh what is the task to steal something i need if i am to develop my ambitions further could you not steal it yourself of course not how could i leave my island they would destroy me then of a certainty who would destroy you my rivals of course the sword rulers and the rest i only survive because i protect myself with all manner of devices and spells which though they have at this moment the power to break they dare not do so for fear of the consequences to break my spells might lead to the very dissolution of the fifteen planes and the extinction of the sword rulers themselves no you must do the thieving for me no other in this whole plane would have the courage or the motivation for if you do this thing i will restore rhalina to you and if you still wish it you will have the power to take your vengeance on glandythakrae but i assure you the real one to blame for the very existence of glandyth is the knight of the swords and by stealing this thing from him you will be thoroughly avenged corum said what must i steal shool chuckled his heart master corum the knight of the swords you wish me to kill a god and take his heart plainly you know nothing of gods if you killed the knight the consequences would be unimaginable he does not keep his heart in his breast it is better guarded than that his heart is kept on this plane his brain is kept on another and so on this protects him do you see corum sighed you must explain more later now release rhalina from that ship and i will try to do what you ask of me you are excessively obstinate master corum if i am the only one who can helg you further your ambitions prince shool then i can surely afford to be the young lips curled in a growl that was almost mabden i am glad you are not immortal master corum your arrogance will only plague me for a few hundred years at the most very weil i will show you rhalina i will show that she is safe but i will not release her i will keep her here and deliver her to you when the heart of the knight of the swords is brought to me what use is the heart to you with it i can bargain very weil you may have the ambitions of a god master shool but you have the methods of a pedlar prince shool your insults do not touch me now shool disappeared behind a cloud of milky green smoke that came from nowhere a scene formed in the smoke corum saw the ship of the dead and he saw the cabin he saw the corpse of the margrave embracing the living flesh of his wife rhalina the margravine and corum saw that rhalina was shouting with horror but unable to resist you said she would be unharmed shool you raid she would be safe so she is in the arms of a loving husband came an book two offended voice from nowhere release her shool ile scene dissolved rhalina stood panting and terrified in the chamber that had no door corum corum ran forward and held her but she drew away with a shudder is it corum are you some phantom i made a bargain to save corum i am corum in tum i have made a bargain to save you rhalina i had not realised it would be so foul i did not understand the terms he was going to even the dead have their pleasures mistress rhalina an anthropoid creature in a green coat and breeks stood behind them it noted corums astonishment with pleasure i have several bodies i can utilise this was an ancestor of the nhadragh i think one of those races who is it corum rhalina asked she drew closer to him and he held her comfortingly now her whole body shook her skin was oddly damp this is shoolanjyvan he claims to be a god it was he who saw that your summoning was answered he has suggested that i perform an errand for him and in return he will allow you to live safely here until i return then we will leave together but why did hey t was not you i wanted but your lover shool said impatiently now i have broken my promise to your husband i have lost my power over him it is irritating you have lost your power over moidel the margrave rhalina asked yes yes he is completely dead it would be far too much effort to revive him again i thank you for releasing him rhalina said it was no wish of mine master corum made me do it the knight of the swords prince shool sighed however there are plenty more corpses in the sea i shall have to find another ship i suppose rhalina fainted corum supported her with his good hand you see shool said with a trace of triumph the mabden fear me excellently we will need food fresh clothing beds and the like corum said before i will discuss anything further with you shool shool vanished a moment later the large room was full of furniture and everything else corum had desired corum could not doubt shools powers but he did doubt the beings sanity he undressed rhalina and washed her and put her into bed she awoke then and her eyes were still full of fear but she smiled at corum you are safe now he said sleep and she slept now corum bathed himself and inspected the clothes that had been laid out for him he pursed his lips as he picked up the folded garments and looked at the armour and weapons that had also been provided they were vadhagh clothes there was even a scarlet robe that was almost certainly his own he began to consider the implications of his alliance with the strange and amoral sorcerer of svianfanlabrool chapter two the eye of rhynn and the hand of kwll corum had been asleep now suddenly he was standing upright he opened his eyes welcome to my little shop shools voice came from behind him he turned this time he confronted a beautiful girl of about fifteen the chuckle that came from the young throat was obscene corum looked around the large room it was dark and it was cluttered all manner of plants and stuffed animals filled it books and manuscripts teetered on crazily leaning shelves there were crystals of a peculiar colour and cut bits of armour jewelled swords rotting sacks from which treasure as well as other nameless substances spilled there were paintings and figurines an assortment of instruments and gauges including balances and what appeared to be clocks with eccentric divisions marked in languages corum did not know living creatures scuffled among the piles or chittered in corners the place stank of dust and mould and death you do not i should think attract many customers corum said shool sniffed there are not many i should desire to serve now in his young girls form he went to a chest that was partially covered by the shining skins of a beast that must have been large and fierce in life he pushed away the skins and muttered something over the chest of its own accord the lid flew back a cloud of black stuff rose from within and shool staggered away a pace or mo waving his hands and screaming in a strange the knight of the swords speech the black cloud vanished cautiously shool approached the chest and peered in he smacked his lips in satisfaction here we are he drew out two sacks one smaller than the other he held them up grinning at corum your gifts i thought you were going to restore my hand and my eye not restore exactly i am going to give you a much more useful gift than that have you heard of the lost gods i have not the lost gods who were brothers their names were lord rhynn and lord kwll they existed even before i came to grace the universe they became involved in a struggle of some kind the nature of which is now obscured they vanished whether voluntarily or involuntarily i do not know but they left a little of themselves behind he held up the sacks again these corum gestured impatiently shool put out his girls tongue and licked his girls lips the old eyes glittered at corum the gifts i have here they once belonged to those warring gods i heard a legend that they fought to the death and only these remained to mark the fact that they had existed at all he opened the smaller sack a large jewelled object fell into his hand he held it out for corum to see it was jewelled and faceted the jewels shone with sombre colours deep reds and blues and blacks it is beautiful said corum but i wait shool emptied the larger sack on the lid of the chest which had closed he picked up the object and displayed it corum gasped it seemed to be a gauntlet with room for five slender fingers and a thumb it too was covered with strange dark jewels book two that gauntlet is of no use to me corum said it is for a left hand with six fingers i have five fingers and no left hand it is not a gauntlet it is kwlls hand he had four but he left one behind struck off by his brother i understand your jokes do not appeal to me sorcerer they are too ghoulish again you waste time you had best get used to my jokes as you call them master vadhagh i see no reason to these are the gifts to replace your missing eye i offer you the eye of rhynn to replace your missing hand the hand of kwll corums mouth curved with nausea ill have nothing of them i want no dead beings limbs i thought you would give me back my own you have tricked me sorcerer nonsense you do not understand the properties these things possess they will give you greater powers than any of your race or the mabden has ever known the eye can see into areas of time and space never observed before by a mortal and the hand the hand can summon aid from those areas you do not think i would send you into the lair of the knight of the swords without some supernatural aid do you what is the extent of their powers shool shrugged his young girls shoulders i have not had the opportunity to test them so there could be danger in using them why should there be corum became thoughtful should he accept shools disgusting gifts and risk the consequences in order to survive slay glandyth and rescue rhalina or should he prepare to die now and end the whole business shool said think of the knowledge these gifts will the knight oj the swords bring you think of the things you will see on your travels no mortal has ever been to the domain of the knight of the swords before you can add much to your wisdom master corum and remember it is the knight who is ultimately responsible for your doom and the deaths of your folk corum drew deeply of the musty air he made up his mind very well i will accept your gifts i am honoured shool said sardonically he pointed a finger at corum and corum reeled backwards fell among a pile of bones and tried to rise but he felt drowsy continue your slumbers master corum shool said he was back in the room in which he had originally met shool there was a fierce pain in the socket of his blind eye there was a terrible agony in the stump of his left hand he felt drained of energy he tried to look about him but his vision would not clear he heard a scream it was rhalina rhalina where are you i i am here corum what has been done to you your face your hand with his right hand he reached up to touch his blind socket something warm shifted beneath his fingers it was an eye but it was an eye of an unfamiliar texture and size he knew then that it was rhynns eye his vision began to clear then he saw rhalinas horrified face she was sitting up in bed her back stiff with horror he looked down at his left hand it was of similar proportions to the old but it was sixfingered and the skin was like that of a jewelled snake he staggered as he strove to accept what bad happened to him they are shools gifts he murmured inanely book two they are the eye of rhynn and the hand of kwll they were gods the lost gods shool said now i am whole again rhalina whole you are something more and something less than whole corum alhy did you accept such terrible gifts they are evil they will destroy you i accepted them so that i might accomplish the task that shool has set me and thus gain the freedom of us both i accepted them so that i might seek out glandyth and if possible strangle him with this alien hand i accepted them because if i did not accept them i would perish perhaps she said softly it would be better for us to perish chapter three beyond the fifteen planes alhat powers i have master corum i have made myself a god and i have made you a demigod they will have us in their legends soon you are already in their legends corum turned to tonfront shool who had appeared in the room in the guise of a bearlike creature wearing an elaborate plumed helmet and trews and for that matter so are the vadhagh we have our own cycle soon master corum that is what i meant to say how do you feel there is still some pain in my wrist and in my head but no sign of a join eh i am a master surgeon the grafting was perfect and accomplished with the minimum of spells i see nothing with the eye of rhynn however corum the knight of the swords said i am not sure it works sorcerer shool rubbed his paros together it will take time before your brain is accustomed to it here you will need this too he produced something resembling a miniature shield of jewels and enamelwork with a strap attached to it it is to put over your new eye and blind myself again well you do not want to be for ever peering into those worlds beyond the fifteen planes do you you urean the eye only segis there no it segis here too but not always in the same kind of perspective corum frowned suspiciously at the sorcerer the action made him blink suddenly through his new eye he saw many new images while still staring at shool with his ordinary eye they were dark images and they shifted until eventually one predominated shool what is this world i am not sure some say there are another fifteen planes which are a kind of distorted mirror image of our oron planes that could be such a place eh things boiled and bubbled appeared and disappeared creatures crept upon the scene and then crept back again flames curled land turned to liquid strange beasts grew to huge proportions and shrank again flesh seemed to flow and reform i am glad i do not belong to that world corum murmured here shool give me the shield he took the thing from the sorcerer and positioned it over the eye the scenes faded and now he saw only shool and rhalina but with both eyes ah i did not point out that the shield protects you from visions of the other worlds not of this one what did you see corum rhalina asked quietly he shook his head nothing i could easily describe book two rhalina looked at shool i wish you would take back your gifts prince shool such things are not for mortals shool grimaced he is not a mortal now i told you he is a demigod and what will the gods think of that well naturally some of them will be displeased if they ever discover master corums new state of being i think it unlikely however rhalina said grimly you talk of these matters too lightly sorcerer if corum does not understand the implications of what you have done to him i do there are laws which mortals must obey you have transgressed those laws and vou will be punished as your creations will be punished and destroyed shool waved his bears arms dismissively you forget that i have a great deal of power i shall soon be in a position to defy any god upstart enough to lock swords with me you are insane with pride she said you are only a mortal sorcerer be silent mistress rhalina be silent for i can send you to a far worse fate than that which you have just escaped if master corum here were not useful to me you would both be enjoying some foul form of suffering ev en now watch your tongue watch your tongue we are wasting time again corum put in i wish to get my task over with so that rhalina and i can leave this place shool calmed down turned and said you are a fool to give so much for this creature she like all her kind fears knowledge fears the deep dark wisdom that brings power well discuss the heart of the knight of the swords corum said how do i steal it come said shool the knight of the swords they stood in a garden of monstrous blossoms that gave off an almost overpoweringly sweet scent the sur was red in the sky above them the leaves of the plants were dark near black they rustled shool had returred to his earlier form of a youth dressed in a flowing blue robe he led corum along a path this garden i have cultivated for millennia it has many peculiar plants filling most of the island not filled by my castle it serves a useful purpose it is a peaceful place in which to relax it is hard for any unwanted guests to find their way through why is the island called the honve of the gorged god i narred it that after the being from whom i inherited it another god used to dwell here you see and all feared lim looking for a safe place where i could continue with my studies i found the island but i had heard that a fearsome god inhabited it and naturally i was wary i had only a fraction of my present wisdom then being little more than a few centuries old so i knew that i did not have the power to destroy a god a huge orchid reached out and stroked corums new hand he pulled it away then how did you take over this island he asked shool i heard that the god ate children one a day was sacrificed to lim by the ancestors of those you call the nhadragh having plenty of money it occurred to me to buy a good nutuber of children and feed them to lim all at once to see what would happen what did lappen he gobbled them all and fell into a gorged slumber and you crept up and killed limp no such thing i captured lim he is still in one of his own dungeons somewhere though he is no longer the fine being be was when i inherited his palace he was only a book two little god of course but sonve relative to the knight of swords that is another reason why the knight or any of the others does not trouble me too much for i hold pilproth prisoner to destroy your island would be to destroy their brother quite and that is another reason why you must employ me to do this piece of thievery you are afraid that if you leave they will be able to extinguish you afraid not at all but i exercise a reasonable degree of caution that is why i still exist where is the heart of the knight of the swordsy well it lies beyond the thousand league reef of which you have doubtless heard i believe i read a reference to it in some old geography it lies to the north does it not corum untangled a vine from his leg it does is that all you can tell me beyond the thousand league reef is a place called urde ehat is sometimes land and sometimes water beyond that is the desert called dhroonhazat beyond the desert are the flamelands where dwells the blind queen oorese and beyond the flamelands is the ice wilderness where the brikling wander corum paused to peel a sticky leaf from his face the thing seemed to have tiny red lips which kissed lim and beyond that he asked sardonically why beyond that is the domain of the knight of the swords these strange lands on which plane are they situated on all five where the knight has influence your power to move through the planes will be of no great use to you i regret the knight of the swords i am not sure i still have that power if you speak truth the knight of the swords has been taking it away from the vadhagh worry not you have powers that are just as good shool reached over and patted corums strange new hand that hand was now responding like any ordinary limb from curiosity corum used it to lift the jewelled patch that covered his jewelled eye he gasped and lowered the patch again quickly shool said what did you see i saw a place is that all a land over which a black sun burned light rose from the ground but the black suns rays almost extinguished it four figures stood before me i glimpsed their faces and corum licked his lips i could look no longer we touch on so many planes shool mused the horrors that exist and we only sometimes catch sight of them in dreams for instance however you must learn to confront those faces and all the other things you see with your new eye if you are to use your powers to the full it disturbs me shool to know that those dark evil planes do exist and that around me lurk so many monstrous creatures separated only by some thin astral fabric i have learned to live knowing such things and using such things you become used to almost everything in a few millennia corum pulled a creeper from around his waist your garden plants seem overfriendly they are affectionate they are my only real friends but it is interesting that they like you i tend to judge a being on how my plants react to him of course they are hungry poor things i must induce a ship or two to put in book two to the island soon we need meat we need meat all this preparation has made me forgetful of my regular duties you still have not described very closely how i may find the knight of the swords you are right well the knight lives in a place on top of a mountain that is in the very centre of both this planet and the five planes in the topmost tower of that palace he keeps his heart it is wellguarded i understand and is that all you know you do not know the nature of this protection i am employing you master corum because you have a few more brains a jot more resilience and a fraction more imagination and courage than the mabden it will be up to you to discover what is the nature of his protection you may rely upon one thing however what is it master shool prince shool you may rely upon the fact that he will not be expecting any kind of attack from a mortal such as yourself like the vadhagh master corum the sword rulers grow complacent we all climb up we all fall down shool chuckled and the planes go on turning eh and when you have climbed up will you not fall clowny doubtless in a few billennia who knows i could rise so high i could control the whole movement of the multiverse i could be the first truly omniscient and omnipotent god oh what games i could play we studied little of mysticism among the vadhagh folk corum put in but i understand all gods to be omniscient and omnipotent only on very limited levels some gods the mabden pantheon such as the dog and the horned bear are more or less omniscient concerning the affairs of mabden and they can if they wish control those affairs to a large the knight of the swords degree but they know nothing of my affairs and even less of those of the knight of the swords who knows most things save those that happen upon my wellprotected island this is an age of gods i am afraid master corum there are many big and small and they crowd the universe once it was not so sometimes i suspect the universe manages with none at all i had thought that it could come to pass it is thought shool tapped his skull that creates gods and gods who create thought there must be periods when thought which i sometimes consider overrated does not exist its existence or lack of it does not concern the universe after all but if i had the power i would make the universe concerned shools eyes shone i would alter its very nature i would change all the conditions you are wise to aid me master corum corum jerked his head back as something very much like a gigantic mauve tulip but with teeth snapped at hдn i doubt it shool but then i have no choice indeed you have not or at least your choice is much limited it is the ambition i hold not to be forced to make choices on however large a scale which drives me on master corum aye nodded corum ironically we are all mortal speak for yourself master corum book three in which prince corum achieves that which is both impossible and unwelcome chapter one the walking god corums leavetaking from rhalina had not been easy it had been full of tension there had been no love in her eyes as he had embraced her only concern for him and fear for both of them this had disturbed him but there had been nothing he could do shool had given him a quaintly shaped boat and he had sailed away now sea stretched in all directions with a lodestone to guide him corum sailed norrh for the thousand league reef corum knew that he was mad in vadhagh terms but he supposed that he was sane enough in mabden terms and this was after all now a mabden world he must learn to accept its peculiar disorders as normal if he were going to survive and there were many reasons why he wished to survive rhalina not least among them he was the last of the vadhagh yet he could not believe it the the knight of the swords powers available to sorcerers like shool might be controlled by others the nature of time could be tampered with the circling planes could be halted in their course perhaps reversed the events of the past year could be changed perhaps eradicated completely corum proposed to live and in living to learn and if lie learned enough perhaps lie would gain sufficient power to finfil his ambitions and restore a world to the vadhagh and the vadhagh to the world it would be just lie thought the boat was of beaten metal on which were many raised and asymmetrical designs it gave off a faint glow which offered corum both heat and light during the nights for the sailing was long its single mast bore a single square sail of samite smeared with a strange substance that also shone and turned without corums guidance to catch any wind corum sat in the hoat wrapped in his scarlet robe his wargear laid beside him his silver helin upon his head his double byrnie covering him from throat to knee from time to time lie would hold up his lodestone by its string the stone was shaped like an arrow and the head pointed always north he thought much of rhalina and his love for her such a love had never before existed between a vadhagh and a mabden his own folk might have considered his feelings for rhalina degenerate much as a mabden would suspect such feelings in a man for his mare but lie was attracted to her more than lie had been attracted to any vadhagh woman and lie knew that her intelligence was a match for his it was her moods lie found hard to understеnd her intimations of doom her superstition yet rhalina knew this world better than lie it could be that she was right to entertain such thoughts his lessons were not yet over book three on the third night corum slept his new hand on the boats tiller and in the morning lie was awakened by bright sunshine in his eyes ahead lay the thousand league reef it stretched from end to end of the horizon and there seemed to be no gap in the sharp fеngs of rock that rose from the foaming sea shool had warned him that few had ever found a passage through the reef and now lie could understand why the reef was unbroken it seemed not of naturеl origin at all but to have been placed there by some entity as a bastion against intruders perhaps the knight of the swords had built it corum decided to sail in an easterly direction along the reef hoping to find somewhere where lie could land the boat and perhaps drag it overland to the waters that lay beyond the reef he sailed for another four days without sleep and the reef offered neither a passage through nor a place to land a light mist tinged pink by the sun now covered the water in all directions and corum kept away from the reef by using his lodestone and by listening for the sounds of the surf on the rocks he drew out his maps pricked out on skin and tried to judge his position the maps were crude and probably inaccurate but they were the best shool had had he was nearing a narrow channel between the reef and a land marked on the map as khoolocrah shool had been unable to tell him much about the land save that a race called the raghadakheta lived thereabouts in the light from the boat lie peered at the maps hoping to distinguish some gap in the reef marked there but there was none then the boat began to rock rapidly and corum glanced about him seeking the source of this sudden eddy far the knight of the suwds away the surf boomed but then he heard another sound to the south of him and he boked there the sound was a regular rushing and slapping noise like that of a man wading through a stream was this sonve beast of the sea the mabden seemed to fear many such monsters corum clung desperately to the sides tryirig to keep the boat on course away from the rocks but the waves increased their agitation and the sound came closer corum picked up his long strong sword and readied himself he saw something in the mist then it was a tall bulky shape the outline of a man and the man was dragging something behind him a fishing net were the waters so shallow then corum leaned over the side and lowered his sword point downward into the sea it did not touch bottom he could make out the ocean floor a long way below him he looked back at the figure now he realised that his eyes and the mist had played tricks on him the figure was still some distance from him and it was gigantic far huger than the giant of laahr this was what made the waves so large this was why the boat rocked so corum made to call out to ask the gigantic creature to move away lest he sink the boat then he thought better of it beings like this were considered to think less kindly of mortals than did the giant of laahr now the giant still cloaked in mist changed his course still fishing he was behind corums boat and be trudged on through the water dragging his nets behind him the wash sent the boat flying away from the thousand league reef heading almost due east and there was nothing corum could do to stop it he fought with the sail and the tiller but they would not respond it was as if he was borne on a river rushing towards a chasm the giant book three bad set up a current which he could not fight there was nothing for it but to allow the boat to bear him where it would the giant had long since disappeared in the mist heading towards the thousand league reef where perhaps he lived like a shark pouncing on its prey the little boat nioved until suddenly it broke through the mist into hot sunshine and corum saw a coast cliffs rushed at him chapter two temgollep desperately corum tried to turn the hoat away from the cliffs his sixfingered left hand gripped the tiller and his right hand tugged at the sail then there was a grinding sound a shudder ran through the metal boat and it began to keel over corum grabbed at his weapons and managed to seize them before he was flung overboard and carried on by the wash he gasped as water filled his mouth he felt his body scrape on shingle and he tried to stagger upright as the current began to retreat he saw a rock and grasped it dropping his bow and his quiver of arrows which were instantly swept away the sea retreated he boked back and saw that his upturned boat had gone with it he let go of the rock and climbed to his feet buckling his swordhelt around his waist straightening his heluret on his head a sense of failure gradually creeping through him he walked a few paces up the beach and sat down beneath the tall black cliff he was stranded on a strange the knight of the swords shore his boat was gone and his goal now lay on the other side of an ocean at that moment corum did not care thoughts of love of hatred of vengeance disappeared he felt that be had left them all behind in the dreamworld that was svianfanlabrool all he had left of that world was the sixfingered hand and the jewelled eye reminded of the eye and what it had witnessed be shivered he reached up and touched the patch that covered it and then he knew that by accepting shools gifts he had accepted the logic of shools world he could not escape from it now sighing he got up and peered at the cliff it was unscaleable he began to walk along the grey shingle hoping to discover a place where be could climb to the top of the cliff and inspect the land in which he found himself he took a gauntlet given him by shool and drew it over his hand he remembered what shool had told him before he left about the powers of the hand he still only halfbelieved shools words and he was unwilling to test their veracity for more than an hour he trudged along the shore until he moved round a headland and saw a bay whose sides sloped gently upward and would be easily scaled the tide was beginning to come in and would soon cover the beach he began to run he reached the slopes and paused panting he had found safety in time the sea had already covered the largest part of the beach he climbed to the top of the slope and be saw the city it was a city of domes and minarets that blazed white in the fight of the sun but as he uispected it more closely corum saw that the towers and domes were not white but comprised of a multicoloured mosaic he had seen nothing book three like it he debated whether to avoid the city or approach it if the people of the city were friendly he might be able to get their help to find another boat if they were mabden then they were probably unfriendly were these the raghadakheta people mentioned on his maps he felt for his pouch but the maps had gone with the boat as had his lodestone despair returned he set off towards the city corum had travelled less than a mile before the bizarre cavalry came racing towards him warriors mounted on longnecked speckled beasts with curling horns and wattles like those of a lizard the spindly legs moved swiftly however and soon corum could see that the warriors were also very tall and extremely thin but with small rounded heads and round eyes these were not mabden but they were like no race he had ever heard of he stopped and waited there was nothing else he could do until he discovered if they were his enemies or not swiftly they surrounded him peering down at him through their huge staring eyes their noses and theеr mouths were also round and their expressions were ones of permanent surprise olanja ko said one wearing an elaborate cloak and hood of bright feathers and holding a club fashioned like the claw of a giant bird olanja ko drajer using the low speech of the vadhagh and the nhadragh which was the common tongue of the mabden corum replied i do not understand this language the creature in the feather cloak cocked his head to one side and closed his mouth the other warriors all dressed and armed similarly though not as elaborately muttered among themselves corum pointed roughly southwards i come from across the knight of the swords the sea now he used middle speech which vadhagh and nhadragh had spoken but not mabden the rider leaned forward as if this sound was more familiar to him but then he shook his head understanding none of the words olanja kro corum also shook his head the warrior looked puzzled and made a delicate scratching gesture at his cheek corum could not interpret the gesture the leader pointed at one of his followers mor naffa the man dismounted and waved one of his spindly arms at corum gesturing that he climb on the longnecked beast with some difficulty corum managed to swing himself into the narrow saddle and sit there feeling extreme discomfort hoj the leader waved to his men and turned his mount back towards the city hoj ala the beasts jogged off leaving the remaining warrior to make his way back to the city on foot the city was surrounded by a high wall patterned with many geometric designs of a thousand colours they entered it through a tall narrow gate moved through a series of walls that were probably designed as a simple maze and began to ride along a broad avenue of blooming trees towards a palace that lay at the centre of the city reaching the gates of the palace they all dismounted and servants as thin and tall as the warriors with the same astonished round faces took away the mounts corum was led through the gates up a staircase of more than a hundred steps into an enclave the designson the walls of the palace were less colourful but more elaborate than those on the outer walls of the city these were chiefly in gold white and pale blue although faintly barbaric the workmanship was beautiful and corum admired it book three they crossed the enclave and entered a courtyard that was surrounded by an enclosed walk and had a fountain in its centre under an awning was a large chair with a tapering back the chair was made of gold and a design was picked out upon it in rubies the warriors escorting corum came to a halt and almost immediately a figure emerged from the interior he had a huge high headdress of peacock feathers a great cloak also of many brilliant feathers and a kilt of thin gold cloth he took his place on the throne this then was the ruler of the city the leader of the warriors and his monarch conversed briefly in their own language and corum waited patiently not wishing to behave in any way that these people would judge to be unfriendly at length the two creatures stopped conversing the monarch addressed corum he seemed to speak several different tongues until at length corum heard him sдy in a strange accent are you of the mabden race it was of the old speech of the nhadragh which corum had learned as a child i am not he replied haltingly but you are not nhedregh yes i am not nhedregh you know of that folk two of them lived among us some centuries since what race are you the vadhagh the king sucked at his lips and smacked them the enemy yes of the nhedregh not now not now the king frowned all the vadhagh save me are dead corum explained and what is left of those you call nhedregh have become degenerate slaves of the mabden the knight of the swords but the mabden are barbarians now they are very powerful barbarians the krog nodded this was predicted he studied corum closely why are you not dead i chose not to die no choice was yours if arioch decided who is arioch the godv which god the god who rules our destinies duke arioch of the swords the knight of the swords i believe he is known by that title in the distant south the king seemed deeply disturbed now he licked his lips i am king temgollep this is my city arke he waved his thin hand these are my people the raghadakheta this land is called khoolocrah we too soon shall die why so it is mabden time arioch decides the king shrugged his narrow shoulders arioch decides soon the mabden will come and destroy us you will fight them of course no it is mabden time arioch commands he lets the raghadakheta live longer because they obey him because they do not resist him but soon we shah die corum shook his head do you not think that arioch is unjust to destroy you thus arioch decides it occurred to corum that these people had not once been so fatalistic perhaps they too were in a process of degeneration caused by the knight of the swords why should arioch destroy so much beauty and learning as you have here arioch decides king temgollep seemed to be more familiar with the book three knight of the swords and his plans than anyone corum had yet met living so much closer to his domain perhaps they had seen him has arioch told you this himself he has spoken through our wise ones and the wise ones they are certain of ariochs will they are certain corum sighed weil i intend to resist his plans i do not find them agreeable king temgollep drew his lids over his eyes and trembled slightly the warriors looked at him nervously evidently they recognised that the king was displeased i will speak no more about arioch king temgollep said but as our guest we must entertain you you will drink some wine with us i will drink some wine i thank you corum would have preferred food to begin with but he was still cautious of giving offence to the raghadakheta who might yet supply him with the boat he needed the king spoke to some servants who were waiting in the shadows near the door into the palace they went inside soon they returned with a tray on which were tall thin goblets and a golden jug the king reached out and took the tray in his own hands balancing it on his knee gravely he poured wine into one of the cups and handed it to corum corum stetched out his left hand to receive the goblet the hand quivered corum tried to control it but it knocked the goblet away the king looked startled and began to speak the hand plunged forward and its six fingers seized the kings throat king temgollep gurgled and kicked as corum tried to pull the hand of kwll away but the fingers were locked the knight of dm swords on the throat corum could feel himself squeezing the life from the king corum shouted for help before he realised that the warriors thought that he was attacking the krog on his own volition he drew his sword and hacked around him as they attacked with their oddlywrought clubs they were plainly unused to battle for their actions were clumsy and without proper coordination suddenly the hand released king temgollep and corum saw that he was dead his new hand had murdered a kindly and innocent creature and it had ruined his chances of getting help from the raghadakheta it might even have killed him for the warriors were very numerous standing over the corpse of the king he swept his sword this way and that striking limbs from bodies cutting into heads blood gushed everywhere and covered him but he fought on then suddenly there were no more living warriors he stood in the courtyard while the gentle sun heat down and the fountain played and he looked at all the corpses he raised his gauntleted alien hand and spat on it oh evil thing rhalina was right you have made me a murderer but the hand was his again it had no life of its own he flexed the six fingers it was now like any ordinary limb save for the splashing of the water from the fountain the courtyard was silent corum looked back at the dead king and shuddered he raised his sword he would cut the hand of kwll from him better to be crippled than to be the slave of so evil a thing and then the ground fell away from him and he plunged downwards to fall with a crash upon the back of a beast that spat and clawed at him chapter three the dark things come corum saw daylight above and then the flagstone slid back and he was in darkness with the beast that dwelled in the pit beneath the courtyard it was snarling in a corner somewhere he prepared to defend himself against it then the snarling stopped and there was silence for a moment corum waited he heard a shuffling he saw a spark the spark became a flame the flame came from a wick that burned in a clay vessel full of oil the clay vessel was held by a filthy hand and the hand belonged to a hairy creature whose eyes were full of anger who are you corum said the creature shuffled again and placed the crude lamp in a niche on the wall corum saw that the chamber was covered in dirty straw there was a pitcher and a plate and at the far end a heavy iron door the place reeked of human excrement can you understand me corum still spoke the nhadragh tongue stop your gabbling the creature spoke distantly as if he did not expect corum to know what he was saying he had spoken in the low speech you will be like me soon corum made no reply he sheathed his sword and walked about the cell inspecting it there seemed no obvious way of escape above him he heard footsteps on the flagstones of the courtyard he heard quite clearly the voices of the raghadakheta they were agitated almost hysterical the knight of the swords the creature cocked his head and listened so that is what happened he mused staring at corum and grinning to himself you killed the feeble little coward eh hm well i dont resent your company nearly so much though your stay will be short i fear i wonder how they will destroy you corum listened in silence still not revealing that he understood the creatures words he heard the sound of the corpses being dragged away overhead more voices came and went now they are in a quandary chuckled the creature they are only good at killing by stealth what did they try to do to you my friend poison you thats the way they usually get rid of those they fear poison corum frowned had the wine been poisoned he looked at the hand had it known was it in some way sentient he decided to break his silence who are you he said in the low speech the creature began to laugh so you can understand me weil since you are my guest i feel you should answer my questions first you look like a vadhagh to me yet i thought all the vadhagh perished long since name yourself and your folk friend corum said i am corum jhaelen irsei the prince in the scarlet robe and i am the last of the vadhagh and i am hanafax of pengarde something of a soldier something of a priest something of an explorer and something of a wretch as you see i hail from a land called lywmanesh a land far to the west where i know of lywmanesh i have been a guest of the magravine of the east what does that margravate still exist i had heard it had been washed away by the encroaching seas long since it may be destroyed by now the pony tribes book three by urleh pony tribes it is something from the histories how come you to be so far from your own land sir hanafaxy its a long tale prince corum arioch as he is called here does not smile on the folk of lywmanesh he expects all the mabden to do his work for him chiefly in the reduction of the older races such as your own as you doubtless know our folk have had no interest in destroying these races for they have never harmed us but urleh is a kind of vassal deity to the knight of the swords it was urleh that i served as a priest weil it seems that arioch grows impatient and commands urleh to command the people of lywmanesh to embark on a crusade to travel far to the west where a seafolk dwell these folk are only about fifty in all and live in castles built into coral they are called the shalafen urleh gave me ariochs command i decided to believe that this was a false command coming from another entity unfriendly to urleh my luck which was never of the best changed greatly then there was a murder i was blamed i fled my lands and stole a ship after several somewhat dull adventures i found myself among this twittering people who so patiently await ariochs destruction i attempted to band them together against arioch they offered me wine which i refused they seized me and placed me here where i have been for more than a few months what will they do with you i cannot say hope that i die eventually i suppose they are a misguided folk and a little stupid but they are not by nature cruel yet their terror of arioch is so great that they dare not do anything that might offend him in this way they hope he will let them live a year or two longer the knight of the swords and you do not know how they will deal with me i killed their king after all that is what i was considering the poison has failed they would be very reluctant to use violence on you themselves we shall have to see i have a mission to accomplish corum told him i cannot afford to wait hanafax grinned i think you will have to friend corum i am something of a sorcerer as i told you i have a few tricks but none will work in this place i know not why and if sorcery cannot aid us what can corum raised his alien hand and stared at it thoughtfully then he looked into the hairy face of his fellow prisoner have you ever heard of the hand of kwll hanafax frowned aye i believe i have the sole remains of a god one of two brothers who had some sort of feud a legend of course like so many corum held up his left hand this is the hand of kwli it was given me by a sorcerer along with this eye the eye of rhynn and both have great powers i am told you do not know i have had no opportunity to test them hanafax seemed disturbed yet such powers are too great for a mortal i would have thought the consequences of using them would be monstrous i do not believe i have any choice i have decided i will call upon the powers of the hand of kwll and the eye of rhynn i i trust you will renvind them that i am on your side prince corum corum stripped the gauntlet from his sixfingered hand he was shivering with the tension then he pushed the patch up to his forehead he began to see the darker planes again he saw the landscape on which a black sun shone again he saw the book three four cowled figures and this time he stared into their faces he screamed but he could not name the reason for his terror he boked again the hand of kwll stretched out towards the figures their heads moved as they saw the hand their terrible eyes seemed to draw all the heat from his body all the vitality from his soul but he continued to look at them the hand beckoned the dark figures moved towards corum he heard hanafax say i see nothing what are you summoning what do you see corum ignored him he was sweating now and every limb save the hand of kwii was shaking from beneath their robes the four figures drew huge scythes corum moved numbed lips here come to this plane obey me they came nearer and seemed to pass through a swirling curtain of mist then hanafax cried out in terror and disgust gods they are things from the pits of the dog shefanhow he jumped behind corum keep them off me vadhagh aah hollow voices issued from the strangely distorted mouths master we will do your will we will do the will of kwll destroy that door corum commanded will we have our prize master what prize is that a life for each of us master corum shuddered aye very weil youll have your prize the scythes rose up and the duor fell down and the four the knight of the swords creatures that were truly shefanhow led the way into a narrow passage my kite hanafax murmured to corum we can escape on that a kite aye it flies and can take both of us the shefanhow marched ahead from them radiated a force that froze the skin they mounted some steps and another door was burst by the scythes of the cloaked creatures there was daylight they found themselves in the main courtyard of the palace from all sides came warriors this time they did not scem so reluctant to kill corum and hanafax but they paused when they saw the four cloaked beings there are your prizes corum said take as many as you will and then return to whence you came the scythes whirled in the sunshine the raghadakheta fell back screaming the screaming grew louder the four began to titter then they began to roar then they began to echo the screams of their victims as their scythes swung and heads sprang from necks sickened corum and hanafax ran through the corridors of the palace hanafax led the way and eventually stopped outside a door everywhere now the screams sounded and the loudest screams of all were those of the four hanafax forced the door open it was dark within he began to rummage about in the room this is where i was when i was their guest before they decided that i had offended arioch i came here in my kite now corum saw more soldiers rushing down the corridor towards them book three find it quickly hanafax he said he leapt out to block the corridor with his sword the spindly beings came to a halt and looked at his sword they raised their own birdclaw clubs arid began cautiously to advance corums sword darted out and cut a warriors throat he collapsed in a tangle of legs and arms corum struck another in the eye the screams were dying now corums foul allies were returning to their own plane with their prizes behind corum hanafax was dragging forth a dusty arrangement of rods and silk i have it prince corum give me a short while to remember the spell i need rather than being frightened by the deaths of their comrades the raghadakheta seemed spurred on to fight more fiercely partly protected by a little mound of the slain corum fought on hanafax began to call out something in a strange tongue corum felt a wind rise that ruffled his scarlet robe something grabbed him from behind and then he was rising into the air over the heads of the raghadakheta speeding along the corridor and into the open he looked down nerv ously the city was rusning past below them hanafax dragged him into the box of yellow and green silk corum was sure he would fall but the kite held the ragged unkempt figure beside him was grinning so the will of arioch can be denied corum said unless we are his instruments in this said hanafax his grin fading chapter four in the flamelands corum got used to the flight though he still felt uncomfortable hanafax hummed to himself while he chopped at his hair and whiskers until a handsome youngish face was revealed apparently without concern he discarded his rags and drew on a clean doublet and pair of breeks he had brought with him in his bundle i feel a thousand times improved i thank you prince corum for visiting the city of arke before i had entirely rotted away corum had discovered that hanafax could not sustain his moods of introspection but was naturally of a cheerful disposition where is this flying thing taking us sir hanafaxy ah theres the problem hanafax said it is why i have found myself in more trouble than i sought i cannot um guide the kite it flies where it will they were over the sea now corum clung to the struts and fixed his eyes ahead of him while hanafax began a song which was not complimentary either to arioch or the dog god of the eastern mabden folk then corum saw something below and he said drily i would advise you to forget the insults to arioch we appear to be flying over the thousand league reef as i understand it his domain lies somewhere beyond that a fair distance though i hope the kite brings us down soon they reached the coast corum screwed up his eyes as he tried to make it out some of the time it seemed to consist of water alone a kind of huge inland sea and book three some of the time the water vanished completely and only land could be seen it was shifting all the time is that urde sir hanafax i think it must be the place urde by its position and appearance unstable matter prince corum created by the chaos lords the chaos lords i have not heard that term used before have you not well it is their will that rules you arioch is one of them long since there was a war between the forces of order and the forces of chaos the forces of chaos won and came to dominate the fifteen planes and as i understand it much that lies beyond them some say that order was defeated completely and all her gods vanished they say the cosmic balance tipped too far in one direction and that is why there are so many arbitrary events taking place in the world they say that once the world was round instead of dishshaped it is hard to accept i agree some vadhagh legends say it was once round aye well the vadhagh began their rise just before order was banished that is why the sword rulers hate the old races so much they are not their creation at all but the great gods are not allowed to interfere too directly in mortal affairs so they have worked through the mabden chiefly is this the truth it is a truth hanafax shrugged i know other versions of the same tale but i am inclined to believe this one these great gods you speak of the sword rulers aye the sword rulers and others then there are the great old gods to whom all the myriad planes of earth are merely a tiny fragment in a greater mosaic hanafax shrugged this is the cosmology i was taught when i was a priest i cannot vouch for its truth the knight of the swords corum frowned he looked below and now they were crossing a bleak yellow and brown desert it was the desert called dhroonhazat and it seemed entirely waterless by an accident of fate he was being borne towards the knight of the swords faster than he had expected or was it an accident of fate now the heat was increasing and the sand below shimmered and danced hanafax licked his lips were getting dangerously close to the flamelands prince corum look on the horizon corum saw a thin flickering line of red light the sky above it was also tinged red the kite sped nearer and the heat increased to his astonishment corum saw that they were approaching a wall of flame that stretched as far as he could see in both directions hanafax we shah be burned alive he said softly aye it seems likely is there no means of turring this kite of yours i have tried in the past it is not the first time it has taken me away from one danger and into a worse one the wall of fire was now so close that corum could feel its direct heat burning his face he heard it rumble and crackle and it seemed to feed on nothing but the air itself such a thing defies nature he gasped is that not a fair definition of all sorcery hanafax said this is chans work the disruption of the natural harmony is after all their pleasure ah this sorcery it wearies my mind i cannot grasp its logic that is because it has none it is arbitrary the lords of chans are the enemies of logic the jugglers of truth the moulders of beauty i should be surprised if they had not created these flamelands out of some aesthetic impulse beauty an everchanging beauty is all they book three live for an evil beauty i believe that such notions of good and evil do not exist for the chans lords i should like to make it exist for them corum mopped his sweating head with his coat sleeve and destroy all their beauty corum darted an odd look at hanafax was the mabden on the side of the knight had he in fact trapped corum into accompanying him there are other quieter kinds of beauty sir hanafax true everywhere below them now the flame yelled and leapt the kite began to increase its height as its silk started to smoulder corum was certain it would soon be destroyed by the fire and they would be plunged into the depths of the flame wall but now they were above it and in spite of the silk suddenly springing alive with little fires and corum feeling he was being roasted in his armour like a turtle in its shell they now saw the other side of the wall a piece of the kite fell blazing away hanafax his face a bright red his body running with sweat clung to a strut and gasped grasp a beam prince corum grasp a beam corum took hold of one of the beams beneath his body as the burring silk was ripped from the frame and fluttered into the fires below the kite dipped and threatened to follow the silk it was losing height rapidly corum coughed as the burring air entered his lungs blisters appeared on his right hand though his left hand seemed immune the kite lurched and began to fall corum was flung back and forth during the crazy descent but he managed to keep his hold on the strut the knight ofthe swords then there was a cracking sound a mighty thump and he lay amidst the wreckage on a surface of flat obsidian the wall of flame behind hдn he raised his bruised body upright it was still unbearably hot and the flames sang close to his back rising a hundred feet or more into the air the fused rock on which he stood was green and glistened and reflected the flame seeming to writhe beneath his feet a little distance to his left rar a sluggish river of molten lava a few flames fluttering on its surface everywhere corum locked was the same shining rock the same red rivers of fire he inspected the kite it was completely useless hanafax was lying among its struts cursing it he got up well he kicked at the blackened broken frame youll never fly me into any more dangers i think this danger is all we veed corum said it could be the last one wel ever face hanafax picked up his swordbelt from the wreckage and tied it round his shoulders aye i think you could speak truth prince corum a poor place to meet ones end eh according to some mabden legends corum said ve might already have met our ends and been consigned here are not certain mabden netherworlds said to be made of eternally burning flame hanafax snorted in the east perhaps well we cannot go back so i suppose we must go forward i was told that an ice wilderness lay towards the north corum said though how it does not melt being so near to the flamelands i do not know another quirk of the lords of chaos doubtless doubtless they began to make their way over the slippery rock that burved their feet with every step leaving the wall of flame behind them leaping over rivulets of lava moving so book three slowly and so circuitously that they were soon exhausted and paused to rest look back at the distant flame wall mop their brows exchange daunted looks thirst now plagued them and their voices were hoarse i think we are doomed prince corum corum nodded wearily he locked up red clouds boiled above like a dome of fire it seemed that all the world burred have you no spelis for bringing on rain sir hanafax i regret not we priests scom such primitive tricks useful tricks sorcerers seem to enjoy only the spectacular i am afraid it is so hanafax sighed what about your own powers can you not he shuddered summor some kind of aid from whatever netherworld it is your horrid allies came i fear those allies are only useful in battle i have no true conception of what they are or why they come i have ome to believe that the sorcerer who fitted me with this hand and eye had no clearer idea himself his work was дomething of an experiment it seems you have nцticed i take it that the sur does not appear to set in the flamelands we can expect no night to zome to relieve us corum was about to reply when he saw something move a rise of black obsidian a short distance away rush sir hanafax hanafax peered through the smoky heat what is it and then they revealed themselves there were about a score of them mounted on beasts lehose bodies were covered in thick scaly skin resembling poate armour they had four short legs and cloven feet a mest of horns jutted on heads and snouts and small red mes gleamed at them the riders were covered from head m foot in red garments of some shining material which hid the knight of the swords even their faces and hands they had long barbed lances for weapons silently they surrounded corum and hanafax for a few moments there was silence and then one of the riders spoke what do you in our flamelands strangers we are not here from choice replied corum an accident brought us to your country we are peaceful you are not peaceful you bear swords we did not know there were any inhabitants to these lands hanafax said we seek help we wish to leave none may leave the flamelands save to suffer a mighty doom the voice was sonorous even sad there is only one gateway and that is through the lions mouth can wc not the riders began to close in corum and hanafax drew their swords well prince corum it seems we are to die corums face was grim he pushed up his eye patch for a moment his vision clouded and then he saw into the netherworld once again he wondered for a moment if it would not be better to die at the hands of the flameland dwellers but now he was looking at a cavern in which tall figures stood as if frozen with a shock corum recognised them as the dead warriors of the raghadakheta their wounds now bloodless their eyes glazed their clothes and armour torn their weapons still in their hands they began to move towards him as his hand stretched out to summon them no these too are my enemies corum shouted hanafax unable to see what corum saw tunned his head in astonishment the dead warriors came on the scene behind them faded they materialised on the obsidian rock of the flamelands book three corum backed away gesticulating wildly the flameland warriors drew their mounts to a stop in surprise hanafaxs face was a mask of fear no i from the lips of the dead king temgollep came a whispering voice ve serve you master will you give us our prizes corum controlled himself slowly he nodded aye you may take your prizes the longlimbed warriors turned to face the mounted warriors of the flamelands the beasts snorted and tried to move back but were forced to stand their ground by their riders there were about fifty of the raghadakheta dividing into groups of two or three their clawed clubs raised they flung themselves at the mounted beings barbed lances came up and stabbed down at the raghadakheta many were struck but it did not deter them they began to drag the struggling riders from their saddles palefaced corum watched he knew now that he was consigning the flamelands warriors to the same netherworld from which he had summoned the raghadakheta and his actions had sent the raghadakheta to that netherworld in the first place on the gleaming rock around which ran rivers of red rock the ghastly battle continued the clawed clubs ripped the cloaks from the riders revealing a people whose faces were familiar stop corum cried stop that is enough kill no more temgollep tunned his glazed eyes on corum the dead king had a barbed spear sticking completely through his body but he seemed unaware of it his dead lips moved these are our prizes master we cannot stop but they are vadhagh they are like me they are mv the knight of dm swords own people hanafax put an arm on corums shoulder they are all dead now prince corum sobbing corum ran towards the corpses inspecting the faces they had the same long skulls the same huge almond eyes the same tapering bars how came vadhagh here hanafax murmured now temgollep was dragging one of the corpses away aided by two of his minions the scaled beasts scattered some of them splashing through the lava uncaringly through the eye of rhynn corum saw the raghadakheta pull the corpses into their cave with a shudder be replaced the eye patch save for a few weapons and tatters of armour and clothing save for the disappearing mounts nothing remained of the vadhagh of the flamelands i have destroyed my own folk corum screamed i have consigned them to a frightful doom in that netherworld sorcery has a way of recoiling suddenly upon its user hanafax said quietly it is an arbitrary power as i said corum wheeled on hanafax stop your prattling mabden do you not realise what i have done hanafax nodded soberly aye but it is done is it not our lives are saved now i add fratricide to my crimes corum fell to his knees dropping his sword on the rock and he wept who weeps it was a womans voice a sad voice who weeps for ciraanvenl the lands that are now flame who remembers her sweet meadows and her fair hills corum raised his head and got to his feet hanafax was already staring at the apparition on the rock above them who weeps there book hree the woman was old her face was handsome and grim and white and lined her grey hair swirled about her and she was dressed in a red cloak such as the warriors had worn mounted on a similar horned lxast she was a vadhagh woman and very frail where her eyes had been were white filmy pools of pain i am corum jhaelen irsei lady why are you blind i am blind through choice rather than witness what had become of my land i plucked my eyes from my head i am oorese queen of ciraanvenl and my people number twenty corums lips were dry i have slain your people lady that is why i weep her face did not alter they were doomed she said to die it is better that they are dead i thank you stranger for releasing them perhaps you would care to release me also i only live so that the memory of ciraanvenl may live she paused why do you use a vedragh name i am of the vadhagh the vedragh as you call them i am from the lands far to the south so vedragh did go south and is their land sweet it is very sweet and are you folk happy prince corum in the scarlet robey they are dead queen ooresй they are dead all dead then now save you and save yourself my queen a smile touched her lips he said we should all die wherever we were on whichever plane we existed but there was another prophecy that when we died so did he he chose to ignore it as i remember who said that lady the knight of the swords duke arioch of chaos he who inherited these five planes for his part in that longago battle between order and chaos who came here and the knight of the swords willed that smooth rock cover our pretty hills that boiling lava run in our gentle streams that flame spring where green forests had been duke arioch prince made that prediction but before he departed to the place of his banishment lord arkyn made another lord arkyn lord of law who ruled here before arioch ousted him he said that by destroying the old races he would destroy his own power over the five planes a pleasant wish murmured hanafax but i doubt if that is true perhaps we do deceive ourselves with happy lies you who speak with the accent of a mabden but then you do not know what wc know for you are ariochs children hanafax drew himself up his children we mat be queen oorese but his slaves we are not i am here because i defied ariochs will again she smiled her sad smile and some say that the vedragh doom was of their own doing that they fought the nhadragh and so defied lord arkyns scheme of things the gods are vengeful hanafax murmured but i am vengeful too sir mabden the queen said because we killed your warriors she waved an ancient hand in a gesture of dismissal no they attacked you you defended yourselves that is what that is i speak of duke arioch and his whim the whim that turned a beautiful land into this dreadful wasteland of eternal same you would be revenged then on duke arioch corum said my people once numbered hundreds one after the other i sent them through the lions mouth to destroy the knight of the swords none did so none returned what is the lions mouth hanafax asked we heard book three it was the only escape from the flamelands it is and it is no escape those who survive the passage through the lions mouth do not survive what lies beyond it the palace of duke arioch himself can none survive the blind queens face turned towards the rost sky only a great hero prince in the scarlet robe only a great hero once the vadhagh had no belief in heroes and such corum said bitterly she nodded i remember but then they needed no beliefs of that kind corum was silent for a moment then he said where is the lions mouth queen i will lead you to it prince corum chapter five through the lions mouth the queen gave them water from the cask that rested behind her saddle and called up two of the lumbering mounts for corum and hanafax to ride they climbed on to the beasts clasped the reins and then began to follow her over the black and green obsidian slabs between the rivers of flame though blind she guided her beast skilfully and she talked all the while of what had been here what had grown there as if she remembered every tree and flower that had once grown in her ruined land after a good space of time she stopped and pointed directly ahead what do you see there the knight of die swords corum peered through the rippling smoke it looks like a great rock we will ride closer she said and as they rode closer corum began to see what it was it was indeed a gigantic rock a rock of smooth and shining stone that glowed like mellowed gold and it was fashioned in perfect detail to resemble the head of a huge lion with its sharpfanged mouth wide open in a roar gods who made such a thing hanafax murmured arioch created it said queen oorese once our peaceful city lay there now we live kved in caves below the ground where water runs and it is a little cooler corum stared at the enormous lions head and he looked at queen oorese how old are you queen i do not know time does not exist in flamelands perhaps ten thousand years far away another wall of flame danced corum remarked upon it we are surrounded by flarne on all sides when arioch first created it many flung themselves into it rather than look upon what had become of their land my husband died in that manner and thus did my brothers and all my sisters perish corum noticed that hanafax was not his usual talkative self his head was bowed and he rubbed at it from time to time as if puzzled alhat is it friend hanafaxy nothing prince corum a pain in my head doubtless the heat causes it now a singular moaning sound came to their ears hanafax looked up his eyes wide and uncomprehending alhat is ity the lion sings said the queen he knows we approach book three then from hanafaxs throat a similar sound issued as a dog will imitate anothers howling hanafax my friend corum rode his beast close to the others is something ailing you hanafax stared at him vaguely no i told you the heat his face twisted aah the pain i will not i will not corum tumed to queen oorese have you known this happen before she frowned seeming to be thinking rather than displaying concern for hanafax no she said at last unless arioch i vill not hanafax began to pant then corums borrowed hand leapt up from the saddle where it had held the reins corum tried to control it but it shot straight towards hanafaxs face its fingers extended fingers drove into the mabdens eyes they pierced the head plunging deep into the brain hanafax screamed no corum please do not i can fight it aaaah and the hand of kwll withdrew itself the fingers dripping with hanafaxs blood and brains while the lifeless body of the mabden fell from the saddle alhat is happening queen oorese called corum stared at the mired hand now once again his it is nothing he murmured i have killed my friend he looked up suddenly above him on a hill he thought he saw the outline of a figure watching him then smoke drifted across the scene and he saw nothing so you guessed what i guessed prince in the scarlet robe said the queen i guessed nothing i have killed my friend that is all i know he helped me he showed me corum swallowed with difficulty the knight of the swords me was only a mabden prince corum only a mabden servant of arioch he hated arioch but arioch found him and entered him he would have tried to kill us you did right to destroy him he would have betrayed you prince corum stared at her through brooding eyes i should have let him kill me why should i live because you are of the vedragh the last of the vedragh who can avenge our race let it perish unavenged too many crimes have been committed so that that vengeance might be won too many unfortunates have suffered frightful fates will the vadhagh name be recalled with love or muttered in hatred it is already spoken with hatred arioch has seen to that there is the lions mouth farewell prince in the scarlet robe and queen oorese spurred her beast into a gallop and went plunging past the great rock on towards the valt wall of flame beyond corum knew what she would do he boked at the body of hanafax the cheerful fellow would smile no more and his soul was now doubtless suffering at the whim of arioch again he was alone he gave a shuddering sigh the strange moaning sound once again began to issue from the lions mouth it seemed to be calling him he shrugged what did it matter if he perished it would only mean that no more would die because of him slowly he began to ride towards the lions mouth as he drew nearer he gathered speed and then with a yell plunged through the gaping jaws and into the howling darkness beyond book three the beast stumbled lost its footing fell corum was thrown clear got up sought the rems with his groping hands but the beast had turned and was galloping back towards the daylight that flickered red and yellow at the entrance for an instant corums mind cooled and he made to follow it then he remembered the dead face of hanafax and he turned and began to trudge into the deeper darkness he walked thus for a long while it was cool within the lions mouth and he wondered if queen oorese had been voicing nothing more than a superstition for the interior seemed to be just a large cave then the rustung sounds began he thought he glimpsed eyes watching accusing eyes no merely malevolent he drew his sword he paused looking about him he took another step forward he was in whirling nothingness colours flashed past him something shrieked and laughter filled his head he tried to take another step he stood on a crystal plain and embedded in it beneath his feet were millions of beings vadhagh nhadragh mabden raghadakheta and many others he did not recognise there were males and females and all had their eyes open all had their faces pressed against the crystal all stretched out their hands as if seeking aid all stared at him he tried to hack at the crystal with his sword but the crystal would not crack he moved forward he saw all the five planes one superimposed upon the other as he had scen them as a child as his ancestors had known them he was in a canyon a forest a valley a field another forest he made to move into one particular plane but he was stopped screaming things came at him and pecked at his flesh the knight of the swords he fought them off with his sword they vanished he was crossing a bridge of ice it was metting fanged distorted things waited for him below the ice creaked he lost his footing he fell he fell into a whirlpool of seething matter that formed shapes and then destroyed them instantly he saw whole cities brought into existence and then obliterated he saw creatures sonve beautiful some disgustingly ugly he saw things that made him love them and things that made him scream with hatred and he was back in the blackness of the great cavern where things tittered at him and scampered away from beneath his feet and corum knew that anyone who had experienced the horrors that he had experienced would have been quite mad by now he had gained something from shool the sorcerer besides the eye of rhynn and the hand of kwll he had gained an ability to face the most evil of apparitions and be virtually unmoved and he thought this meant that he has lost something too he moved on another step he stood kneejeep in slithering flesh that was without shape but which lived it began to suck him down he struck about him with his sword now he was waistdeep he gasped and forced his body through the stuff he stood beneath a dome of ice and with him stood a million corums there he was innocent and gay before the coming of the mabden there he was moody and grim with his jewelled eye and his murderous hand there he was dyin another step blood flooded over him he tried to regain his feet the heads of foul reptilian creatures rose from the stuff and snapped at his face with their jaws book three his instinct was to draw back but he swam towards them he stood in a tunnel of silver and gold there was a door at the end and he could hear movement behind it sword in hand he stepped through strange desperate laughter filled the immense gallery in which he found himself he knew that he had reached the court of the knight of the swords chapter six the god feasters corum was dwarfed by the hugeness of the hall suddenly he saw his past adventures his emotions his desires his guilts as utterly inconsequential and feeble this mood was increased by the fact that he had expected to confront arioch the moment he reached his court but corum had entered the palace completely unnoticed the laughter came from a gallery high above where two scaled demons with long horns and longer tails were fighting as they fought they laughed though both seemed plainly near death it was on this fight that ariochs attention seemed fixed the knight of the swords the duke of chaos lay in a heap of filth and quaffed some illsmelling stuff from a dirty goblet he was enormously fat and the flesh erembled on hдn as he laughed he was completely naked and formed in all details like a mabden there seemed to be scabs and sores on his body particularly near his pelvis his face was flushed and it was ugly and his teeth when he the knight of the swords opened his mouth seemed decayed corum would not have known he was the god at all if it had not been for his size for arioch was as large as a castle and his sword the symbol of his power would have stood as high as the tallest tower of castle erorn if it had been placed upright the sides of the hall were liered uncountable tiers stretched high towards the distant dome of the ceiling which itself was wreathed in greasy smoke these tiers were occupied mainly with mabden of all ages corum saw that most were naked in many of the tiers they were copulating fighting torturing each other elsewhere were other beings mainly scaly shefanhow somewhat smaller than the two who were fighting together the sword was jet black and carved with many peculiar patterns mabden were at work on the sword they knelt on the blade and polished part of a design or they climbed the hilt and washed it or they sat astride the handgrip and mended the gold wire which bound it and other beings were busy too like lice they scampered and crawled over the gods huge bulk picking at his skin feeding off his blood and his flesh of all these activities arioch seemed oblivious his interest continued to be the fight to the death in the gallery above was this then the allpowerful arioch living like a drunken farmer in a pig sty was this the malevolent creature which had destroyed whole nations which pursued a vendetta upon all the races to spring up on the earth before his coming ariochs laughter shook the floor some of the parasitic mabden fell off his body a few were unhurt while others lay with their backs or their limbs broken unable to move their comrades ignored their plight and patiently climbed again upon the gods body tearing tiny pieces from him with their teeth book three ariochs hair was long lank and my here too mabden searched for and fought over the bits of food that clung to the strands elsewhere in the gods body hair mabden crept in and out hunting for scraps and crumbs or tender portions of his flesh the two demons fell back one of them was dead the other almost dead but still laughing weakly then the laughter stopped arioch slapped his body killing a dozen or so mabden and scratched his stomach he inspected the bloody remains in his palm and absently wiped them on his hair living mabden seized the scraps and devoured them then a huge sigh issued from the gods mouth and he began to pick his nose with a dirty finger that was the size of a tall poplar corum saw that there were openings beneath the galleries and stairways twisting upwards but he had no notion where the highest tower of the palace might be he began to move softfooted around the hall ariochs ears caught the sound and the god became alert he bent his head and peered about the floor the huge eyes fixed on corum and a monstrousiy large hand reached out to grasp him corum raised his sword and hacked at the hand but arioch laughed and drew the vadhagh prince towards him whats this the voice boomed not one of mine not one of mine corum continued to strike at the hand and arioch continued to seem unaware of the blows though the sword raised deep cuts in the flesh from over his shoulders behind his ears and from within his filthy hair mabden eyes regarded corum with terrified curiosity not one of mine arioch boomed again one of his aye one of his the knight of the swords whose corum shouted still struggling the one whose castle i recently inherited the dour fellow arkyn arkyn of law one of his i thought they were all gone by now i cannot keep an eye on little beings not of my own manufacture i do not understand their waysy arioch you have destroyed all my kin ah good all of them you say good is that the message you bring to me why did i not hear before from one of my own little creatures let me go corum screamed arioch opened his hand and corum staggered free gasping he had not expected arioch to comply and then the full injustice of his fate struck him arioch bore no malice towards the vadhagh he cared for them no more or less than he cared for the mabden parasites feeding off his body he was merely wiping his palette clean of old colours as a painter will before be begins a fresh canvas all the agony and the misery he and his had suffered was on behalf of the whim of a careless god who only occasionally turned his attention to the world that he had been given to rule then arioch vanished another figure stood in his place all the mabden were gone the other figure was beautiful and looked upon corum with a kind of haughty affection he was dressed all in black and silver with a miniature version of the black sword at his side his expression was quizzical he smiled he was the quintessence of evil who are you corum gasped i am duke arioch your master i am the lord of hell a noble of the realm of chaos the knight of the swords i am your enemy so you are my enemy the other form was not your book three true form i am anything you please prince corum what does true mean in this context i can be anything i choose or anything you choose if you prefer consider me evil and i will don the appearance of evil consider me good and i will take on a form that fits the part i care not my only wish is to exist in peace you see to while away my time and if you wish to play a drama some game of your own devising i will play it until it begins to bore me were your ambitions ever thus what what ever no i think not not when i was embattled with those lords of law who taled this plane before but now i have won why i deserve what i fought for do not all beings require the same corum nodded i suppose they do well arioch smiled what now little corum of the vadhagh you must be destroyed soon you know for my peace of mind you understand that is all you have done well to reach my court i will give you hospitality as a reward and rhen at some stage i will flick you away you know why now corum glowered i will not be flicked away duke arioch why should i be arioch raised a hand to his beautiful face and he yawned why should you not be now what can i do to entertain you corum hesitated then he said will you show me all y our castle i have never seen anything so huge arioch raised an eyebrow f that is all all for the moment arioch smiled very welt besides i have not scen all of it myself come he placed a soft hand on corums shoulder and led him through a doorway the knight of the swords as they walked along a magnificent gallery with walls of coruscating marble arioch spoke reasonably to corum in a low hypnotic voice you see friend corum these fifteen planes were stagnating what did you vadhagh and the rest do nothing you hardly moved from your cities and your castles nature gave birth to poppies and daisies the lords of law made sure that all was properly ordered nothing was happening at all we have brought so much more to your world my brother mabelode and my sister xiombarg who are the others you know them i think as the queen of the swords and the king of the swords they each rule five of the other ten planes we won them from the lords of law a little while ago and began your destruction of all that is truthful and wise if you say so mortal corum paused his understanding was weakening to ariochs persuasive voice he tumed i think you are lying to me duke arioch there must be more to your ambition than this it is a matter of perspective corum we follow our whims we are powerful now and nothing can harm us why should we be vindictive then you will be destroyed as the vadhagh were destroyed for the same reasons arioch shrugged perhaps you have a powerful enemy in shool of svianfanlabrool you should fear him i think you know of shool then arioch laughed musically poor shool he schemes and plots and maligns us he is amusing is he not he is merely amusing corum was disbelieving aye merely amusing book three he says you hate him because he is almost as powerful as yourself we hate no one i mistrust you arioch what mortal does not mistrust a god now they were walking up a spiral ramp that seemed comprised entirely of fight arioch paused i think we will explore some other part of the palace this leads only to a tower ahead corum saw a doorway on which pulsed a sign eight arrows arranged around a circle what is that sign ariochy nothing at all the arms of chaos then what lies beyond the door just a tower arioch became impatient come there are more interesting sights elsewhere reluctantly corum followed him back down the ramp he thought he had scen the place where arioch kept his heart for several more hours they wandered through the palace observing its wonders here all was light and beauty and there were no sinister sights this fact disturbed corum he was sure that arioch was deceiving him they returned to the hall the mabden lice had vanished the filth had disappeared in its place was a table laden with food and wine arioch gestured towards it will you dine with me prince corum corums grin was sardonic before you destroy me arioch laughed if you wish to continue your existence a while longer i have no objection you sannot leave my palace you see and while your nalvetй continues to entertain me why should i destroy you do you not fear me at all the knight of die swords i fear you not at all do you not fear what i represent what do you represent justice again arioch laughed oh you think so narrowly there is no such thing it existed when the lords of law ruled here everything may exist for a short while even justice but the true state of the universe is anarchy it is the mortals tragedy that he can never accept this corum could not reply he seated himself at the table and began to eat arioch did not eat with him but sat on the other side of the table and poured himself some wine corum stopped eating arioch smiled do not fear corum it is not poisoned why should i resort to such things as poison corum resumed eating when he had finished he said now i would rest if i am to be your guest ah arioch seemed perplexed yes well sleep then he waved his hand and corum fell face forward upon the table and slept chapter seven the bane of the sword rulers corum stirred and forced his eyes open the table had gone gone too was arioch the vast hall was in darkness illuminated only by faint light issuing from a few of the doorways and galleries he stood up was he dreaming or had he dreamed book three everything that had happened earlier certainly all the events had had the quality of dreams become reality but that was true of the entire world now since he had left the sanity of castle erorn so long ago but where had duke arioch gone had he left on some mission of the world doubtless he had thought his influence over corum would last longer after all that was why he wished the vadhagh all destroyed because he could not understand them could not predict everything they would do could not control their minds as he controlled those of the mabden corum realised suddenly that he now had an opportunity perhaps his only opportunity to try to reach the place where arioch kept his heart then he might escape while arioch was still away get back to shool and reclaim rhalina vengeance now no longer motivated him all he sought was an end to his adventure peace with the woman he loved security in the old castle by the sea he ran across the floor of the hall and up the stairway to the gallery with the walls of coruscating marble until he came to the ramp that seemed made of nothing but light the light had dimened to a glow now but high above was the doorway with the pulsating orange sign the eight arrows radiating from a central hub the sign of chaos breathing heavily he ran up the spiral ramp up and up he ran until the rest of the palace lay far below him until he reached the door which dwarfed him until he stopped and looked and wondered until he knew hed reached his goal the huge sign pulsed regularly like a living heart itself and it bathed corums face and body and armour in its redgold light corum pushed at the door but it was like a mouse pushing at the door of a sarcophagus he could not move it he needed aid he contemplated his left hand the the knight of the sovords hand of kwll could he summon help from the dark world not without a prize to offer them but then the hand of kwll bunched itself into a fist and began to glow with a fight that blinded corum and made hдn stretch his arm away as far as it would go flinging his other arm over his eyes he felt the hand of kwll rise into the air and then strike at the mighty door he heard a sound like the tolling of bells he heard a crack as if the earth herself bad split and then the hand of kwll was limp by his side and be opened his eyes and saw that a crack had appeared in the door it was a small crack in the bottom of the right corner but it was large enough for corum to wriggle through now you are aiding me as i would wish to be aided he murmured to the hand he got down on his knees and crawled through the crack another ramp stretched upwards over a gulf of sparkung emptiness strange sounds filled the air rising and dying coming close and then falling away there were hints of menace here hints of beauty hints of death hints of everlasting life hints of terror hints of tranquillity corum made to draw his sovord and then realised the uselessness of such an action he set foot on the ramp and began to climb again a wind seemed to spring up and his scarlet robe flew out behind him cool breezes wafted him and hot winds scoured his skin he saw faces all around him and many of the faces be thought he recognised some of the faces were huge and some were infinitely tiny eyes watched him lips grinned a sorrowful moaning came and went a dark cloud engulfed him a tinkling as of glass bells ringing filled his ears a voice called his name and it echoed and echoed and echoed away for ever a rainbow surrounded him entered him and made his whole body flash with colour steadily he continued his walk up the book three long ramp and now he saw he was coming to a platform that was at the end of the ramp but which hung over the gulf there was nothing beyond it on the platform was a dais on the dais was a plinth and on the plinth was something that throbbed and gave forth rays transfixed by these rays were several mabden warriors their bodies were frozen in attitudes of reaching for the source of the rays but their eyes moved as they saw corum approach the dais pain was in those eyes and curiosity and a warning corum stopped the thing on the plinth was a deep soft blue and it was quite small and it shone and it looked like a jewel that bad been fashioned into the shape of a heart at every pulse tubes of fight shot forth from it this could only be the heart of arioch but it protected itself as was evident from the frozen warriors surrounding it corum took a pace nearer a beam of fight struck his cheek and it tingled another pace nearer and two more beams of light hit his body and made it shiver but he was not frozen and now he was past the mabden warriors two more paces and the beams bombarded his whole head and body but the sensation was only pleasant he stretched out his right hand to seize the heart but his left hand moved first and the hand of kwll gripped the heart of arioch the world seems full of fragments of gods corum murmured he turned and saw that the mabden warriors were no longer frozen they were rubbing at their faces sheathing their swords corum spoke to the nearest why did you seek the heart of arioch the knight of the swords through no choice of my own a sorcerer sent me offering me my life in return for stealing the heart from ariochs palace was this shooly aye shool prince shool corum looked at the others they were all nodding shool sent me and me and shool sent me said corum i had not reaosed he had fried so many times before it is a game arioch plays with hдn murmured one of the mabden warriors i learned that shool has little power of his own at all arioch gives shool the power he thinks is his own for arioch enjoys the sport of having an enemy with whom he can play every action arioch makes is inspired by nothing bot boredom and now you have his heart plainly he did not expect the game to get so out of hand aye corum agreed it was only ariochs carelessness that allowed me to reach this place now i return i must find a way from the palace before he realises what has happened may we come with you the mabden asked corum nodded bot hurry they crept back down the ramp halfway down one of the mabden screamed flailed at the air staggered to the edge of the ramp and went drifting down into the sparkung emptiness their pace increased until they reached the tiny crack at the bottom of the huge door and crawled through it one by one down the ramp of light they went through the gallery of coruscating marble down the stairway into the darkened hall corum sought the silver door through which he had entered the palace he made one complete circuit of the book three hall and his feet were aching before he realised that the door had vanished the hall was suddenly alive with light again and the vast fat figure corum had originally seen was laughing on the floor lying amidst filth with the mabden parasites peering from out of the air beneath his arms from his navel from his ears ha ha you see corum i am kind i have let you have almost everything you desired of me you even have my heart but i cannot let you take it away from me corum without my heart i could not rule here i think i will restore it into this flesh of mine corums shoulders slumped he has tricked us he said to his terrified mabden companions but one mabden said he has used you sir vadhagh he could never have taken his heart himself did you not know that arioch laughed and his belly shook and mabden fell to the floor true true you have done me a service prince corum the heart of each sword ruler is kept in a place that is banned to him so that the others may know that he dwells only in his own domain and may travel to no other thus he cannot usurp some rival rulers power but you corum with your ancient blood with your peculiar characteristics were able to do that which i am unable to do now i have my heart and i may extend my domain wherever i choose or not of course if i choose not to then i have helped you corum said bitterly when i rished to hinder you ariochs laughter filled the hall yes exactly a fine oke eh now give me my heart little vadhagh corum pressed his back to the wall and drew his blade he stood there with the heart of arioch in his left hand and his sword in his right i think i will die first arioch as you please the knight of the swords the monstrous hand reached out for corum he dodged it arioch bellowed with laughter again and plucked two of the mabden warriors from the floor they screamed and writhed as he drew them towards his great wet mouth full of blackened teeth then he popped them into his maw and corum heard their bones crunch arioch swallowed and spat out a sword then he returned his gaze to corum corum jumped behind a pillar ariochs hand came round it feeling for him corum ran more laughter and the hall reverberated the gods mirth was echoed by the дttering voices of his mabden parasites a pillar crashed as arioch struck at it seeking corum corum dashed across the floor of the hall leaping over the broken bodies of the mabden who had fallen from the corpulent body of the god and then arioch saw him seized him and his chuckles subsided give me my heart now corum gasped for breath and freed his two hands from the soft flesh that enclosed him the giants great hand was warm and filthy the nails were broken give me my heart little being no corum drove his sword deep into the thumb but the god did not noдce mabden clung to the hair of the chest and watched their grins blank corums ribs were near to breaking but still he would not release the heart of arioch that lay in his left fist no matter said arioch his grip relaxing a trifle i can absorb both you and the heart at the same time now arioch began to carry his great hand towards his open mouth his breath came out in stinking blasts and corum choked on it but still he stabbed and stabbed a grin spread over the gigantic lips all corum could see book three now was that mouth the scabrous nostrils the huge eyes the mouth opened wider to swallow him he struck at the upper lip staring into the red darkness of the gods throat then his left hand contracted it squeezed the heart of arioch corums own strength could not have done it but once again the hand of kwll was possessed of a power of its own it squeezed ariochs laughter faded the vast eyes widened and a new light filled them a bellow came from the throat the hand of kwll squeezed tighter still arioch shrieked the heart began to crumble in the hand rays of a reddish blue fight sprang from between corums fingers pain flooded up his arm there was a high whistling sound arioch began to weep his grasp on corum weakened he staggered backwards no mortal no the voice was pathetic please mortal we can corum saw the gods bloated form begin to melt into the air the hand that held him began to lose its shape and then corum was falling towards the floor of the hall the broken pieces of ariochs heart scattering as he fell he landed with a crash tried to rise saw what was left of ariochs body writhing in the air heard a mournful sound and then corum lost consciousness hearing as he did so ariochs last whispered words corum of the vadhagh you have won the eternal bane of the sword rulers chapter eight a pause in the struggle corum saw a procession passing him beings of a hundred different races marched or rode or were carried in that procession and he knew that he watched all the mortal races that had ever existed since law and chaos had begun their struggle for domination over the multitudinous planes of the earth in the distance he saw the banners of law and chaos raised side by side the one bearing the eight radiating arrows the other bearing the single straight arrow of law and over all this hung a huge balance in perfect equilibrium in each of the balances cups were marshalled other beings not morzal corum saw arioch and the lords of chaos in one and he saw the lords of law in the other and corum heard a voice which said this is as it should be neither law nor chaos must dominate the destinies of the moral planes there must be equilibrium corum cried out but there is no equilibrium chaos rules all the voice replied saying the balance sometimes tips it must be rsghted and that is the power of mortals to adjust the balance how may i do that you have begun the work already now you must continue until it is finished you may perish before it is complete but sonve other will follow you corum shouted i do not want this i cannot bear such a burdenp you must the procession marched on not seeing corum not seeing the book three two banners flying not seeing the cosmic balance that hung over them corum hung in cloudy space and his heart was at peace shapes began to appear and then he saw that he was back in ariochs hall he sought for his sword but it was gone i will return your sword before you leave prince corum of the vadhagh the voice was level and it was clear corum turned he drew a suddea breath the giant of laahr the sad wise face smiled down on him i was called that when i was in exile but now i am no longer exiled and you may address me by my true name i am lord arkyn and this is my palace arioch has gone without his heart he cannot assume flesh on these planes without flesh he cannot wield power i rule here now as i ruled before the beings substance was still shadowy though not as formless as before lord arkyn smiled it will take time before i assume my old form only by a great power of will did i enable myself to remain on this plane at all i did not know when i rescued you corum that you would be the cause of my restoration i thank you i thank you my lord good breeds good lord arkyn said evil breeds evil corum smiled sometimes my lord lord arkyn chuckled quietly aye you are right sometimes well mortal i must return you to your own plane can you transport me to a particular place my lord i can prince in the scarlet robe lord arkyn you know why i embarked upon this course of mine i sought the remnants of the vadhagh the knight of the swords race my folk tell me are they all gone now lord arkyn lowered his head all save you and cannot you restore them the vadhagh were always the mortals i loved most prince corum but i have not the power to reverse the very cycle of time you are the last of the vadhagh and yet lord arkyn paused and yet there might come a moment when the vadhagh will return but i see nothing clearly and i must speak no more of that corum sighed weil i must be content and what of shool is rhalina safe i think so my senses are still not capable of seeing all that happens and shool was a thing of chaos and is therefore much harder for me to see but i believe that rhalina is in danger though shools power has waned with the passing of arioch then send me i beg you to svianfanlabrool for i love the margravine it is your capacity for love that makes you strong prince corum and my capacity for hate that directs your strength lord arkyn frowned as if there was something he could not understand you are sad in your triumph lord arkyn are you always sad the lord of law looked at corum almost in surprise i suppose i am still sad yes i mourn for the vadhagh as you moum i mourn for the one who was killed by your enemy glandythakrae the one you called the brown many he was a good creature does glandyth still bring death across the land of broanvadhagh he does you will meet him again i think and then i will kill him book three possibly lord arkyn vanished the palace vanished sword in hand corum stood before the low twisted door that was the entrance to shools dwelling behind him in the garden the plants craned up to drink the rain that fell from a pale sky a peculiar calm hung over the dark and oddly formed building but without hesitation corum plunged into it and began to run down eccentric corridors rhalina rhalina the house muffled his shouts no matter how loudly he uttered them rhalina through the murky dwelling he ran until he heard a whining voice he recognised shool shool where are you prince shool i will be given my proper rank you mock me now my enemies have beaten me corum entered a room and there was shool corum recognised only the eyes the rest was a withered decrepit thing that lay upon a bed unable to move shool whimpered you too come to torment me now that i am conquered thus it always is with mighty men brought low you only rose because it suited ariochs sense of humour to let you silence i will not be deceived arioch has taken vengeance upon me because i was more powerful than he you borrowed without knowing it a fraction of his power arioch is gone from the five planes shool you set events in motion which resulted in his banishment you wanted his heart so that you might make him your slave you sent many mabden to steal it all failed you should not have sent me shool for i did not fail and it resulted in your undoing the knight of the swords shool sobbed and shook his haggard head where is rhalina shool if she is harmed harmed a hollow laugh from the wizened lips i harm her it is she who placed me here take her away from me i know she means to poison me where is she i gave you gifts that new hand that new eye you would be crippled still if i had not been kind to you but you will not remember my generosity i know you will your gifts shool near crippled my soul where is rhalina promise you will not hurt me if i tell you why should i wish to hurt so pathetic a thing as you shool now tell me at the end of the passage is a stair at the top of the stair is a room she has locked herself in i would have made her my wife you know it would have been magnificent to be the wife of a god an immortal but she so you planned to betray me a god may do as he chooses corum left the room ran down the passage and up the short flight of stairs hammering with the hilt of his sword upon the duor rhalina a weary voice came from beyond the door so your power has returned shool you will not trick me again by disguising yourself as corum though he be dead i shall give myself to no other least of all rhalina this really is corum shool can do nothing the knight of the swords has been banished from this plane and with him went shools sorcery is it true open the door rhalina book three cautiously bolts were drawn back and there was rhalina she was tired she had plainly suffered much but she was still beautiful she looked deeply into corums eyes and her face flushed with relief with love she fainted corum picked her up and began to carry her down the stairway along the passage he paused at shools room the onetime sorcerer was gone suspecting a trick corum hurried to the main door through the rain along a path between the swaying plants hurried shool his ancient legs barely able to carry him he darted a look back at corum and chittered with fear he dived into the bushes there was a smacking sound a hiss a wail bile rose in corums throat shools plants were feeding for the last time warily he carried rhalina along the path tugging himself free from the vines and blooms that sought to hold him and kiss him and at last he reached the shore a boat was tied up there a small skiff which with careful handling would bear them back to moidels castle the sea was smooth beneath the grey rain that fell upon it on the horizon the sky began to lighten corum placed rhalina gently in the boat and set sail for moidels mount she woke up several hours later looked at him smiled sweetly then fell asleep again towards nightfall as the boat sailed steadily homeward she came and sat beside him he wrapped his scarlet robe around her and said nothing as the moon rose she reached up and kissed him on the cheek had not hoped she began and then she wept for the knight of die swords a little while and he comforted her corum she said at length how has our luck improved so and he began to tell her of what had befallen him he told her of the raghadakheta of the magical kite of the flamelands of arioch and of arkyn he told her all save two things he did not tell her how he or the hand of kwll had murdered king temgollep who had tried to poison him or her countryman hanafax who had tried to help him when he had finished her brow was unclouded and she sighed with her happiness so we have peace at last the conflict is over peace if we are lucky for a little while the sun had begun to rise he adjusted his course you will not leave me again law rules now surely andy law rules only upon this plane the lords of chaos will not be pleased with what has happened here ariochs last words to me were that i have incurred the bane of the sword rulers and lord arkyn knows that much more must be done before law is once again secure in the fifteen planes and glandythakrae will be heard of again you still seek vengeance against him no longer he was merely an instrument of arioch but he will not forget his hatred of me rhalina the sky cleared and was blue and golden a warm breeze blew are we then corum to have no peace we shall have some i think but it will be merely a pause in the struggle rhalina let us enjoy that pause while we may wc have won that much at least aye her tone became merry and peace and love that are won are more greatly appreciated than if they are book three merely inherited he held her in his arms the sun was strong in the sky its rays struck a jewelled hand and a jewelled eye and it made them burn brighdy and flash like fire but rhalina did not see them burning for she slept again in corums arms moidels mount came in sight its green slopes were washed by a gende blue sea and the sun shone on its white stone castle the tide was in covering the causeway corum looked down at rhalinas sleeping face he smiled and gently stroked her hair he saw the forest on the mainland nothing threatened he glanced up at the cloudless sky he hoped the pause would be a long one this ends the first book of corum
