roald dahl fantastic mr fox the three farmers down in the valley there were three farms the owners of these farms had done well they were rich men they were also nasty men all three of them were about as nasty and mean as any men you could meet their names were farmer boggis farmer bunce and farmer bean boggis was a chicken farmer he kept thousands of chickens he was enormously fat this was because he ate three boiled chickens smothered with dumplings every day for breakfast lunch and supper bunce was a duckandgoose farmer he kept thousands of ducks and geese he was a kind of potbellied dwarf he was so short his chin would have been underwater in the shallow end of any swimmingpool in the world his food was doughnuts and gooselivers he mashed the livers into a disgusting paste and then stuffed the paste into the doughnuts this diet gave him a tummyache and a beastly temper bean was a turkeyandapple farmer he kept thousands of turkeys in an orchard full of apple trees he never ate any food at all instead he drank gallons of strong cider which he made from the apples in his orchard he was as thin as a pencil and the cleverest of them all boggis and bunce and bean one fat one short one lean these horrible crooks so different in looks were none the less equally mean that is what the children round about used to sing when they saw them mr fox on a hill above the valley there was a wood in the wood there was a huge tree under the tree there was a hole in the hole lived mr fox and mrs fox and their four small foxes every evening as soon as it got dark mr fox would say to mrs fox well my darling what shall it be this time a plump chicken from boggis a duck or a goose from bunce or a nice turkey from bean and when mrs fox had told him what she wanted mr fox would creep down into the valley in the darkness of the night and help himself boggis and bunce and bean knew very well what was going on and it made them wild with rage they were not men who liked to give anything away less still did they like anything to be stolen from them so every night each of them would take his shotgun and hide in a dark place somewhere on his own farm hoping to catch the robber but mr fox was too clever for them he always approached a farm with the wind blowing in his face and this meant that if any man were lurking in the shadows ahead the wind would carry the smell of that man to mr foxs nose from far away thus if mr boggis was hiding behind his chicken house number one mr fox would smell him out from fifty yards off and quickly change direction heading for chicken house number four at the other end of the farm dang and blast that lousy beast cried boggis id like to rip his guts out said bunce he must be killed cried bean but how said boggis how on earth can we catch the blighter bean picked his nose delicately with a long finger i have a plan he said youve never had a decent plan yet said bunce shut up and listen said bean tomorrow night we will all hide just outside the hole where the fox lives we will wait there until he comes out then bang bangbangbang very clever said bunce but first we shall have to find the hole my dear bunce ive already found it said the crafty bean its up in the wood on the hill its under a huge tree the shooting well my darling said mr fox what shall it be tonight i think well have duck tonight said mrs fox bring us two fat ducks if you please one for you and me and one for the children ducks it shall be said mr fox bunces best now do be careful said mrs fox my darling said mr fox i can smell those goons a mile away i can even smell one from the other boggis gives off a filthy stink of rotten chickenskins bunce reeks of gooselivers and as for bean the fumes of apple cider hang around him like poisonous gases yes but just dont get careless said mrs fox you know theyll be waiting for you all three of them dont you worry about me said mr fox ill see you later but mr fox would not have been quite so cocky had he known exactly where the three farmers were waiting at that moment they were just outside the entrance to the hole each one crouching behind a tree with his gun loaded and what is more they had chosen their positions very carefully making sure that the wind was not blowing from them towards the foxs hole in fact it was blowing in the opposite direction there was no chance of them being smelled out mr fox crept up the dark tunnel to the mouth of his hole he poked his long handsome face out into the night air and sniffed once he moved an inch or two forward and stopped he sniffed again he was always especially careful when coming out from his hole he inched forward a little more the front half of his body was now in the open his black nose twitched from side to side sniffing and sniffing for the scent of danger he found none and he was just about to go trotting forward into the wood when he heard or thought he heard a tiny noise a soft rustling sound as though someone had moved a foot ever so gently through a patch of dry leaves mr fox flattened his body against the ground and lay very still his ears pricked he waited a long time but he heard nothing more it must have been a fieldmouse he told himself or some other small animal he crept a little further out of the hole then further still he was almost right out in the open now he took a last careful look around the wood was murky and very still somewhere in the sky the moon was shining just then his sharp nighteyes caught a glint of something bright behind a tree not far away it was a small silver speck of moonlight shining on a polished surface mr fox lay still watching it what on earth was it now it was moving it was coming up and up great heavens it was the barrel of a gun quick as a whip mr fox jumped back into his hole and at that same instant the entire wood seemed to explode around him bangbang bangbang bangbang the smoke from the three guns floated upward in the night air boggis and bunce and bean came out from behind their trees and walked towards the hole did we get him said bean one of them shone a flashlight on the hole and there on the ground in the circle of light half in and half out of the hole lay the poor tattered bloodstained remains of a foxs tail bean picked it up we got the tail but we missed the fox he said tossing the thing away dang and blast said boggis we shot too late we should have let fly the moment he poked his head out he wont be poking it out again in a hurry bunce said bean pulled a flask from his pocket and took a swig of cider then he said itll take three days at least before he gets hungry enough to come out again im not sitting around here waiting for that lets dig him out ah said boggis now youre talking sense we can dig him out in a couple of hours we know hes there i reckon theres a whole family of them down that hole bunce said then well have the lot said bean get the shovels the terrible shovels down the hole mrs fox was tenderly licking the stump of mr foxs tail to stop the bleeding it was the finest tail for miles around she said between licks it hurts said mr fox i know it does sweetheart but itll soon get better and it will soon grow again dad said one of the small foxes it will never grow again said mr fox i shall be tailless for the rest of my life he looked very glum there was no food for the foxes that night and soon the children dozed off then mrs fox dozed off but mr fox couldnt sleep because of the pain in the stump of his tail well he thought i suppose im lucky to be alive at all and now theyve found our hole were going to have to move out as soon as possible well never get any peace if we what was that he turned his head sharply and listened the noise he heard now was the most frightening noise a fox can ever hear the scrapescrapescraping of shovels digging into the soil wake up he shouted theyre digging us out mrs fox was wide awake in one second she sat up quivering all over are you sure thats it she whispered im positive listen theyll kill my children cried mrs fox never said mr fox but darling they will sobbed mrs fox you know they will scrunch scrunch scrunch went the shovels above their heads small stones and bits of earth began falling from the roof of the tunnel how will they kill us mummy asked one of the small foxes his round black eyes were huge with fright will there be dogs he said mrs fox began to cry she gathered her four children close to her and held them tight suddenly there was an especially loud crunch above their heads and the sharp end of a shovel came right through the ceiling the sight of this awful thing seemed to have an electric effect upon mr fox he jumped up and shouted ive got it come on theres not a moment to lose why didnt i think of it before think of what dad a fox can dig quicker than a man shouted mr fox beginning to dig nobody in the world can dig as quick as a fox the soil began to fly out furiously behind mr fox as he started to dig for dear life with his front feet mrs fox ran forward to help him so did the four children go downwards ordered mr fox weve got to go deep as deep as we possibly can the tunnel began to grow longer and longer it sloped steeply downward deeper and deeper below the surface of the ground it went the mother and the father and all four of the children were digging together their front legs were moving so fast you couldnt see them and gradually the scrunching and scraping of the shovels became fainter and fainter after about an hour mr fox stopped digging hold it he said they all stopped they turned and looked back up the long tunnel they had just dug all was quiet phew said mr fox i think weve done it theyll never get as deep as this well done everyone they all sat down panting for breath and mrs fox said to her children i should like you to know that if it wasnt for your father we should all be dead by now your father is a fantastic fox mr fox looked at his wife and she smiled he loved her more than ever when she said things like that the terrible tractors as the sun rose the next morning boggis and bunce and bean were still digging they had dug a hole so deep you could have put a house into it but they had not yet come to the end of the foxes tunnel they were all very tired and cross dang and blast said boggis whose rotten idea was this beans idea said bunce boggis and bunce both stared at bean bean took another swig of cider then put the flask back into his pocket without offering it to the others listen he said angrily i want that fox im going to get that fox im not giving in till ive strung him up over my front porch dead as a dumpling we cant get him by digging thats for sure said the fat boggis ive had enough of digging bunce the little potbellied dwarf looked up at bean and said have you got any more stupid ideas then what said bean i cant hear you bean never took a bath he never even washed as a result his earholes were clogged with all kinds of muck and wax and bits of chewinggum and dead flies and stuff like that this made him deaf speak louder he said to bunce and bunce shouted back got any more stupid ideas bean rubbed the back of his neck with a dirty finger he had a boil coming there and it itched what we need on this job he said is machines mechanical shovels well have him out in five minutes with mechanical shovels this was a pretty good idea and the other two had to admit it all right then bean said taking charge boggis you stay here and see the fox doesnt escape bunce and i will go and fetch our machinery if he tries to get out shoot him quick the long thin bean walked away the tiny bunce trotted after him the fat boggis stayed where he was with his gun pointing at the foxhole soon two enormous caterpillar tractors with mechanical shovels on their front ends came clanking into the wood bean was driving one bunce the other the machines were both black they were murderous brutallooking monsters here we go then shouted bean death to the fox shouted bunce the machines went to work biting huge mouthfuls of soil out of the hill the big tree under which mr fox had dug his hole in the first place was toppled like a matchstick on all sides rocks were sent flying and trees were falling and the noise was deafening down in the tunnel the foxes crouched listening to the terrible clanging and banging overhead whats happening dad cried the small foxes what are they doing mr fox didnt know what was happening or what they were doing its an earthquake cried mrs fox look said one of the small foxes our tunnels got shorter i can see daylight they all looked round and yes the mouth of the tunnel was only a few feet away from them now and in the circle of daylight beyond they could see the two huge black tractors almost on top of them tractors shouted mr fox and mechanical shovels dig for your lives dig dig dig the race now there began a desperate race the machines against the foxes in the beginning the hill looked like this after about an hour as the machines bit away more and more soil from the hilltop it looked like this sometimes the foxes would gain a little ground and the clanking noises would grow fainter and mr fox would say were going to make it im sure we are but then a few moments later the machines would come back at them and the crunch of the mighty shovels would get louder and louder once the foxes actually saw the sharp metal edge of one of the shovels as it scraped up the earth just behind them keep going my darlings panted mr fox dont give up keep going the fat boggis shouted to bunce and bean well get him any moment now have you caught sight of him yet bean called back not yet shouted boggis but i think youre close ill pick him up with my bucket shouted bunce ill chop him to pieces but by lunchtime the machines were still at it and so were the poor foxes the hill now looked like this the farmers didnt stop for lunch they were too keen to finish the job hey there mr fox yelled bunce leaning out of his tractor were coming to get you now youve had your last chicken yelled boggis youll never come prowling around my farm again a sort of madness had taken hold of the three men the tall skinny bean and dwarfish potbellied bunce were driving their machines like maniacs racing the motors and making the shovels dig at a terrific speed the fat boggis was hopping about like a dervish and shouting faster faster by five oclock in the afternoon this is what had happened to the hill the hole the machines had dug was like the crater of a volcano it was such an extraordinary sight that crowds of people came rushing out from the surrounding villages to have a look they stood on the edge of the crater and stared down at boggis and bunce and bean hey there boggis whats going on were after a fox you must be mad the people jeered and laughed but this only made the three farmers more furious and more obstinate and more determined than ever not to give up until they had caught the fox well never let him go at six oclock in the evening bean switched off the motor of his tractor and climbed down from the drivers seat bunce did the same both men had had enough they were tired and stiff from driving the tractors all day they were also hungry slowly they walked over to the small foxs hole in the bottom of the huge crater beans face was purple with rage bunce was cursing the fox with dirty words that cannot be printed boggis came waddling up dang and blast that filthy stinking fox he said what the heck do we do now ill tell you what we dont do bean said we dont let him go well never let him go bunce declared never never never cried boggis did you hear that mr fox yelled bean bending low and shouting down the hole its not over yet mr fox were not going home till weve strung you up dead as a dingbat whereupon the three men all shook hands with one another and swore a solemn oath that they would not go back to their farms until the fox was caught whats the next move asked bunce the potbellied dwarf were sending you down the hole to fetch him up said bean down you go you miserable midget not me screamed bunce running away bean made a sickly smile when he smiled you saw his scarlet gums you saw more gums than teeth then theres only one thing to do he said we starve him out we camp here day and night watching the hole hell come out in the end hell have to so boggis and bunce and bean sent messages down to their farms asking for tents sleepingbags and supper the foxes begin to starve that evening three tents were put up in the crater on the hill one for boggis one for bunce and one for bean the tents surrounded mr foxs hole and the three farmers sat outside their tents eating their supper boggis had three boiled chickens smothered in dumplings bunce had six doughnuts filled with disgusting gooseliver paste and bean had two gallons of cider all three of them kept their guns beside them boggis picked up a steaming chicken and held it close to the foxs hole can you smell this mr fox he shouted lovely tender chicken why dont you come up and get it the rich scent of chicken wafted down the tunnel to where the foxes were crouching oh dad said one of the small foxes couldnt we just sneak up and snatch it out of his hand dont you dare said mrs fox thats just what they want you to do but were so hungry they cried how long will it be till we get something to eat their mother didnt answer them nor did their father there was no answer to give as darkness fell bunce and bean switched on the powerful headlamps of the two tractors and shone them on to the hole now said bean well take it in turn to keep watch one watches while two sleep and so on all through the night boggis said what if the fox digs a hole right through the hill and comes out on the other side you didnt think of that one did you of course i did said bean pretending he had go on then tell us the answer said boggis bean picked something small and black out of his ear and flicked it away how many men have you got working on your farm he asked thirtyfive boggis said ive got thirtysix bunce said and ive got thirtyseven bean said that makes one hundred and eight men altogether we must order them to surround the hill each man will have a gun and a flashlight there will be no escape then for mr fox so the order went down to the farms and that night one hundred and eight men formed a tight ring around the bottom of the hill they were armed with sticks and guns and hatchets and pistols and all sorts of other horrible weapons this made it quite impossible for a fox or indeed for any other animal to escape from the hill the next day the watching and waiting went on boggis and bunce and bean sat upon small stools staring at the foxs hole they didnt talk much they just sat there with their guns on their laps every so often mr fox would creep a little closer towards the mouth of the tunnel and take a sniff then he would creep back again and say theyre still there are you quite sure mrs fox would ask positive said mr fox i can smell that man bean a mile away he stinks mr fox has a plan for three days and three nights this waitinggame went on how long can a fox go without food or water boggis asked on the third day not much longer now bean told him hell make a run for it soon hell have to bean was right down in the tunnel the foxes were slowly but surely starving to death if only we could have just a tiny sip of water said one of the small foxes oh dad cant you do something couldnt we make a dash for it dad wed have a little bit of a chance wouldnt we no chance at all snapped mrs fox i refuse to let you go up there and face those guns id sooner you stay down here and die in peace mr fox had not spoken for a long time he had been sitting quite still his eyes closed not even hearing what the others were saying mrs fox knew that he was trying desperately to think of a way out and now as she looked at him she saw him stir himself and get slowly to his feet he looked back at his wife there was a little spark of excitement dancing in his eyes what is it darling said mrs fox quickly ive just had a bit of an idea mr fox said carefully what they cried oh dad what is it come on said mrs fox tell us quickly well said mr fox then he stopped and sighed and sadly shook his head he sat down again its no good he said it wont work after all why not dad because it means more digging and we arent any of us strong enough for that after three days and nights without food yes we are dad cried the small foxes jumping up and running to their father we can do it you see if we cant so can you mr fox looked at the four small foxes and he smiled what fine children i have he thought they are starving to death and they havent had a drink for three days but they are still undefeated i must not let them down i i suppose we could give it a try he said lets go dad tell us what you want us to do slowly mrs fox got to her feet she was suffering more than any of them from the lack of food and water she was very weak i am so sorry she said but i dont think i am going to be much help you stay right where you are my darling said mr fox we can handle this by ourselves boggiss chicken house number one this time we must go in a very special direction said mr fox pointing sideways and downward so he and his four children started to dig once again the work went much more slowly now yet they kept at it with great courage and little by little the tunnel began to grow dad i wish you would tell us where we are going said one of the children i dare not do that said mr fox because this place i am hoping to get to is so marvellous that if i described it to you now you would go crazy with excitement and then if we failed to get there you would die of disappointment i dont want to raise your hopes too much my darlings for a long long time they kept on digging for how long they did not know because there were no days and no nights down there in the murky tunnel but at last mr fox gave the order to stop i think he said we had better take a peep upstairs now and see where we are i know where i want to be but i cant possibly be sure were anywhere near it slowly wearily the foxes began to slope the tunnel up towards the surface up and up it went until suddenly they came to something hard above their heads and they couldnt go up any further mr fox reached up to examine this hard thing its wood he whispered wooden planks what does that mean dad it means unless i am very much mistaken that we are right underneath somebodys house whispered mr fox be very quiet now while i take a peek carefully mr fox began pushing up one of the floorboards the board creaked most terribly and they all ducked down waiting for something awful to happen nothing did so mr fox pushed up a second board and then very very cautiously he poked his head up through the gap he let out a shriek of excitement ive done it he yelled ive done it first time ive done it ive done it he pulled himself up through the gap in the floor and started prancing and dancing with joy come on up he sang out come up and see where you are my darlings what a sight for a hungry fox hallelujah hooray hooray the four small foxes scrambled up out of the tunnel and what a fantastic sight it was that now met their eyes they were in a huge shed and the whole place was teeming with chickens there were white chickens and brown chickens and black chickens by the thousand boggiss chicken house number one cried mr fox its exactly what i was aiming at i hit it slap in the middle first time isnt that fantastic and if i may say so rather clever the small foxes went wild with excitement they started running around in all directions chasing the stupid chickens wait ordered mr fox dont lose your heads stand back calm down lets do this properly first of all everyone have a drink of water they all ran over to the chickens drinkingtrough and lapped up the lovely cool water then mr fox chose three of the plumpest hens and with a clever flick of his jaws he killed them instantly back to the tunnel he ordered come on no fooling around the quicker you move the quicker you shall have something to eat one after another they climbed down through the hole in the floor and soon they were all standing once again in the dark tunnel mr fox reached up and pulled the floorboards back into place he did this with great care he did it so that no one could tell they had ever been moved my son he said giving the three plump hens to the biggest of his four small children run back with these to your mother tell her to prepare a feast tell her the rest of us will be along in a jiffy as soon as we have made a few other little arrangements a surprise for mrs fox the small fox ran back along the tunnel as fast as he could carrying the three plump hens he was exploding with joy just wait he kept thinking just wait till mummy sees these he had a long way to run but he never stopped once on the way and he came bursting in upon mrs fox mummy he cried out of breath look mummy look wake up and see what ive brought you mrs fox who was weaker than ever now from lack of food opened one eye and looked at the hens im dreaming she murmured and closed the eye again youre not dreaming mummy theyre real chickens were saved were not going to starve mrs fox opened both eyes and sat up quickly but my dear child she cried where on earth boggiss chicken house number one spluttered the small fox we tunnelled right up under the floor and youve never seen so many big fat hens in all your life and dad said to prepare a feast theyll be back soon the sight of food seemed to give new strength to mrs fox a feast it shall be she said standing up oh what a fantastic fox your father is hurry up child and start plucking those chickens far away down in the tunnel the fantastic mr fox was saying now for the next bit my darlings this onell be as easy as pie all we have to do is dig another little tunnel from here to there to where dad dont ask so many questions start digging badger mr fox and the three remaining small foxes dug fast and straight they were all too excited now to feel tired or hungry they knew they were going to have a whacking great feast before long and the fact that it was none other than boggiss chickens they were going to eat made them churgle with laughter every time they thought of it it was lovely to realize that while the fat farmer was sitting up there on the hill waiting for them to starve he was also giving them their dinner without knowing it keep digging said mr fox its not much further all of a sudden a deep voice above their heads said who goes there the foxes jumped they looked up quickly and they saw peeking through a small hole in the roof of the tunnel a long black pointed furry face badger cried mr fox foxy cried badger my goodness me im glad ive found someone at last ive been digging around in circles for three days and nights and i havent the foggiest idea where i am badger made the hole in the ceiling bigger and dropped down beside the foxes a small badger dropped down after him havent you heard whats happening up on the hill badger said excitedly its chaos half the wood has disappeared and there are men with guns all over the countryside none of us can get out even at night were all starving to death who is we asked mr fox all us diggers thats me and mole and rabbit and all our wives and children even weasel who can usually sneak out of the tightest spots is right now hiding down my hole with mrs weasel and six kids what on earth are we going to do foxy i think were finished mr fox looked at his three children and he smiled the children smiled back at him sharing his secret my dear old badger he said this mess youre in is all my fault i know its your fault said badger furiously and the farmers are not going to give up till theyve got you unfortunately that means us as well it means everyone on the hill badger sat down and put a paw around his small son were done for he said softly my poor wife up there is so weak she cant dig another yard nor can mine said mr fox and yet at this very minute she is preparing for me and my children the most delicious feast of plump juicy chickens stop cried badger dont tease me i cant stand it its true cried the small foxes dads not teasing weve got chickens galore and because everything is entirely my fault said mr fox i invite you to share the feast i invite everyone to share it you and mole and rabbit and weasel and all your wives and children therell be plenty to go round i can assure you you mean it cried badger you really mean it mr fox pushed his face close to badgers and whispered darkly do you know where weve just been where right inside boggiss chicken house number one no yes but that is nothing to where we are going now you have come just at the right moment my dear badger you can help us dig and in the meanwhile your small son can run back to mrs badger and all the others and spread the good news mr fox turned to the small badger and said tell them they are invited to a foxs feast then bring them all down here and follow this tunnel back until you find my home yes mr fox said the small badger yes sir right away sir oh thank you sir and he scrambled quickly back through the hole in the roof of the tunnel and disappeared bunces giant storehouse my dear foxy cried badger what in the world has happened to your tail dont talk about it please said mr fox its a painful subject they were digging the new tunnel they dug on in silence badger was a great digger and the tunnel went forward at a terrific pace now that he was lending a paw soon they were crouching underneath yet another wooden floor mr fox grinned slyly showing sharp white teeth if i am not mistaken my dear badger he said we are now underneath the farm which belongs to that nasty little potbellied dwarf bunce we are in fact directly underneath the most interesting part of that farm ducks and geese cried the small foxes licking their lips juicy tender ducks and big fat geese exactly said mr fox but how in the world can you know where we are asked badger mr fox grinned again showing even more white teeth look he said i know my way around these farms blindfold for me its just as easy below ground as it is above it he reached high and pushed up one wooden floorboard then another he poked his head through the gap yes he shouted jumping up into the room above ive done it again ive hit it smack on the nose right in the bullseye come and look quickly badger and the three small foxes scrambled up after him they stopped and stared they stood and gaped they were so overwhelmed they couldnt speak for what they now saw was a kind of foxs dream a badgers dream a paradise for hungry animals this my dear old badger proclaimed mr fox is bunces mighty storehouse all his finest stuff is stored in here before he sends it off to market against all the four walls of the great room stacked in cupboards and piled upon shelves reaching from floor to ceiling were thousands and thousands of the finest and fattest ducks and geese plucked and ready for roasting and up above dangling from the rafters there must have been at least a hundred smoked hams and fifty sides of bacon just feast your eyes on that cried mr fox dancing up and down what dyou think of it eh pretty good grub suddenly as though springs had been released in their legs the three hungry small foxes and the ravenously hungry badger sprang forward to grab the luscious food stop ordered mr fox this is my party so i shall do the choosing the others fell back licking their chops mr fox began prowling around the storehouse examining the glorious display with an expert eye a thread of saliva slid down one side of his jaw and hung suspended in midair then snapped we mustnt overdo it he said mustnt give the game away mustnt let them know what weve been up to we must be neat and tidy and take just a few of the choicest morsels so to start with we shall have four plump young ducks he took them from the shelf oh how lovely and fat they are no wonder bunce gets a special price for them in the market all right badger lend me a hand to get them down you children can help as well there we go goodness me look how your mouths are watering and now i think we had better have a few geese three will be quite enough well take the biggest oh my oh my youll never see finer geese than these in a kings kitchen gently does it thats the way and what about a couple of nice smoked hams i adore smoked ham dont you badger fetch me that stepladder will you please mr fox climbed up the ladder and handed down three magnificent hams and do you like bacon badger im mad about bacon cried badger dancing with excitement lets have a side of bacon that big one up there and carrots dad said the smallest of the three small foxes we must take some of those carrots dont be a twerp said mr fox you know we never eat things like that its not for us dad its for the rabbits they only eat vegetables my goodness me youre right cried mr fox what a thoughtful little fellow you are take ten bunches of carrots soon all this lovely loot was lying in a neat heap upon the floor the small foxes crouched close their noses twitching their eyes shining like stars and now said mr fox we shall have to borrow from our friend bunce two of those useful pushcarts over in the corner he and badger fetched the pushcarts and the ducks and geese and hams and bacon were loaded on to them quickly the pushcarts were lowered through the hole in the floor the animals slid down after them back in the tunnel mr fox again pulled the floorboards very carefully into place so that no one could see they had been moved my darlings he said pointing to two of the three small foxes take a cart each and run back as fast as you can to your mother give her my love and tell her we are having guests for dinner the badgers the moles the rabbits and the weasels tell her it must be a truly great feast and tell her the rest of us will be home as soon as weve done one more little job yes dad right away dad they answered and they grabbed a trolley each and went rushing off down the tunnel badger has doubts just one more visit cried mr fox and ill bet i know where thatll be said the only small fox now left he was the smallest fox of them all where asked badger well said the smallest fox weve been to boggis and weve been to bunce but we havent been to bean it must be bean you are right said mr fox but what you dont know is which part of beans place we are about to visit which they said both together ahha said mr fox just you wait and see they were digging as they talked the tunnel was going forward fast suddenly badger said doesnt this worry you just a tiny bit foxy worry me said mr fox what all this this stealing mr fox stopped digging and stared at badger as though he had gone completely dotty my dear old furry frump he said do you know anyone in the whole world who wouldnt swipe a few chickens if his children were starving to death there was a short silence while badger thought deeply about this you are far too respectable said mr fox theres nothing wrong with being respectable badger said look said mr fox boggis and bunce and bean are out to kill us you realize that i hope i do foxy i do indeed said the gentle badger but were not going to stoop to their level we dont want to kill them i should hope not indeed said badger we wouldnt dream of it said mr fox we shall simply take a little food here and there to keep us and our families alive right i suppose well have to said badger if they want to be horrible let them said mr fox we down here are decent peaceloving people badger laid his head on one side and smiled at mr fox foxy he said i love you thank you said mr fox and now lets get on with the digging five minutes later badgers front paws hit against something flat and hard what on earth is this he said it looks like a solid stone wall he and mr fox scraped away the soil it was a wall but it was built of bricks not stones the wall was right in front of them blocking their way now who in the world would build a wall under the ground asked badger very simple said mr fox its the wall of an underground room and if i am not mistaken it is exactly what im looking for beans secret cider cellar mr fox examined the wall carefully he saw that the cement between the bricks was old and crumbly so he loosened a brick without much trouble and pulled it away suddenly out from the hole where the brick had been there popped a small sharp face with whiskers go away it snapped you cant come in here its private good lord said badger its rat you saucy beast said mr fox i should have guessed wed find you down here somewhere go away shrieked rat go on beat it this is my private pitch shut up said mr fox i will not shut up shrieked rat this is my place i got here first mr fox gave a brilliant smile flashing his white teeth my dear rat he said softly i am a hungry fellow and if you dont hop it quickly i shall eatyouupinonegulp that did it rat popped back fast out of sight mr fox laughed and began pulling more bricks out of the wall when he had made a biggish hole he crept through it badger and the smallest fox followed him in they found themselves in a vast damp gloomy cellar this is it cried mr fox this is what said badger the place is empty where are the turkeys asked the smallest fox staring into the gloom i thought bean was a turkey man he is a turkey man said mr fox but were not after turkeys now weve got plenty of food then what do we need dad take a good look round said mr fox dont you see anything that interests you badger and the smallest fox peered into the halfdarkness as their eyes became accustomed to the gloom they began to see what looked like a whole lot of big glass jars standing upon shelves around the walls they went closer they were jars there were hundreds of them and upon each one was written the word cider the smallest fox leaped high in the air oh dad he cried out look what weve found its cider exactly said mr fox tremendous shouted badger beans secret cider cellar said mr fox but go carefully my dears dont make a noise this cellar is right underneath the farmhouse itself cider said badger is especially good for badgers we take it as medicine one large glass three times a day with meals and another at bedtime it will make the feast into a banquet said mr fox while they were talking the smallest fox had sneaked a jar off the shelf and had taken a gulp wow he gasped wowee you must understand this was not the ordinary weak fizzy cider one buys in a store it was the real stuff a homebrewed fiery liquor that burned in your throat and boiled in your stomach ahhhhhh gasped the smallest fox this is some cider thats quite enough of that said mr fox grabbing the jar and putting it to his own lips he took a tremendous gulp its miraculous he whispered fighting for breath its fabulous its beautiful its my turn said badger taking the jar and tilting his head well back the cider gurgled and bubbled down his throat its its like melted gold he gasped oh foxy its like drinking sunbeams and rainbows youre poaching shrieked rat put that down at once therell be none left for me rat was perched upon the highest shelf in the cellar peering out from behind a huge jar there was a small rubber tube inserted in the neck of the jar and rat was using this tube to suck out the cider youre drunk said mr fox mind your own business shrieked rat and if you great clumsy brutes come messing about in here well all be caught get out and leave me to sip my cider in peace at that moment they heard a womans voice calling out in the house above them hurry up and get that cider mabel the voice called you know mr bean doesnt like to be kept waiting especially when hes been out all night in a tent the animals froze they stayed absolutely still their ears pricked their bodies tense then they heard the sound of a door being opened the door was at the top of a flight of stone steps leading down from the house to the cellar and now someone was starting to come down those steps the woman quick said mr fox hide he and badger and the smallest fox jumped up on to a shelf and crouched behind a row of big cider jars peering around the jars they saw a huge woman coming down into the cellar at the foot of the steps the woman paused looking to right and left then she turned and headed straight for the place where mr fox and badger and the smallest fox were hiding she stopped right in front of them the only thing between her and them was a row of cider jars she was so close mr fox could hear the sound of her breathing peeping through the crack between two bottles he noticed that she carried a big rollingpin in one hand how many will he want this time mrs bean the woman shouted and from the top of the steps the other voice called back bring up two or three jars he drank four yesterday mrs bean yes but he wont want that many today because hes not going to be up there more than a few hours longer he says the fox is bound to make a run for it this morning it cant possibly stay down that hole another day without food the woman in the cellar reached out and lifted a jar of cider from the shelf the jar she took was next but one to the jar behind which mr fox was crouching ill be glad when the rotten brute is killed and strung up on the front porch she called out and by the way mrs bean your husband promised i could have the tail as a souvenir the tails been all shot to pieces said the voice from upstairs didnt you know that you mean its ruined of course its ruined they shot the tail but missed the fox oh heck said the big woman i did so want that tail you can have the head instead mabel you can get it stuffed and hang it on your bedroom wall hurry up now with that cider yes maam im coming said the big woman and she took a second jar from the shelf if she takes one more shell see us thought mr fox he could feel the smallest foxs body pressed tightly against his own quivering with excitement will two be enough mrs bean or shall i take three my goodness mabel i dont care so long as you get a move on then two it is said the huge woman speaking to herself now he drinks too much anyway carrying a jar in each hand and with the rollingpin tucked under one arm she walked away across the cellar at the foot of the steps she paused and looked around sniffing the air theres rats down here again mrs bean i can smell em then poison them woman poison them you know where the poisons kept yes maam mabel said she climbed slowly out of sight up the steps the door slammed quick said mr fox grab a jar each and run for it rat stood on his high shelf and shrieked what did i tell you you nearly got nabbed didnt you you nearly gave the game away you keep out of here from now on i dont want you around this is my place you said mr fox are going to be poisoned poppycock said rat i sit up here and watch her putting the stuff down shell never get me mr fox and badger and the smallest fox ran across the cellar clutching a gallon jar each goodbye rat they called out as they disappeared through the hole in the wall thanks for the lovely cider thieves shrieked rat robbers bandits burglars the great feast back in the tunnel they paused so that mr fox could brick up the hole in the wall he was humming to himself as he put the bricks back in place i can still taste that glorious cider he said what an impudent fellow rat is he has bad manners badger said all rats have bad manners ive never met a polite rat yet and he drinks too much said mr fox putting the last brick in place there we are now home to the feast they grabbed their jars of cider and off they went mr fox was in front the smallest fox came next and badger last along the tunnel they flew past the turning that led to bunces mighty storehouse past boggiss chicken house number one and then up the long home stretch towards the place where they knew mrs fox would be waiting keep it up my darlings shouted mr fox well soon be there think whats waiting for us at the other end and just think what were bringing home with us in these jars that ought to cheer up poor mrs fox mr fox sang a little song as he ran home again swiftly i glide back to my beautiful bride shell not feel so rotten as soon as shes gotten some cider inside her inside then badger joined in oh poor mrs badger he cried so hungry she very near died but shell not feel so hollow if only shell swallow some cider inside her inside they were still singing as they rounded the final corner and burst in upon the most wonderful and amazing sight any of them had ever seen the feast was just beginning a large diningroom had been hollowed out of the earth and in the middle of it seated around a huge table were no less than twentynine animals they were mrs fox and three small foxes mrs badger and three small badgers mole and mrs mole and four small moles rabbit and mrs rabbit and five small rabbits weasel and mrs weasel and six small weasels the table was covered with chickens and ducks and geese and hams and bacon and everyone was tucking into the lovely food my darling cried mrs fox jumping up and hugging mr fox we couldnt wait please forgive us then she hugged the smallest fox of all and mrs badger hugged badger and everyone hugged everyone else amid shouts of joy the great jars of cider were placed upon the table and mr fox and badger and the smallest fox sat down with the others you must remember no one had eaten a thing for several days they were ravenous so for a while there was no conversation at all there was only the sound of crunching and chewing as the animals attacked the succulent food at last badger stood up he raised his glass of cider and called out a toast i want you all to stand and drink a toast to our dear friend who has saved our lives this day mr fox to mr fox they all shouted standing up and raising their glasses to mr fox long may he live then mrs fox got shyly to her feet and said i dont want to make a speech i just want to say one thing and it is this my husband is a fantastic fox everyone clapped and cheered then mr fox himself stood up this delicious meal he began then he stopped in the silence that followed he let fly a tremendous belch there was laughter and more clapping this delicious meal my friends he went on is by courtesy of messrs boggis bunce and bean and i hope you have enjoyed it as much as i have he let fly another colossal belch better out than in said badger thank you said mr fox grinning hugely but now my friends let us be serious let us think of tomorrow and the next day and the days after that if we go out we will be killed right right they shouted well be shot before weve gone a yard said badger exactly said mr fox but who wants to go out anyway let me ask you that we are all diggers every one of us we hate the outside the outside is full of enemies we only go out because we have to to get food for our families but now my friends we have an entirely new setup we have a safe tunnel leading to three of the finest stores in the world we do indeed said badger ive seen em and you know what this means said mr fox it means that none of us need ever go out into the open again there was a buzz of excitement around the table i therefore invite you all mr fox went on to stay here with me for ever for ever they cried my goodness how marvellous and rabbit said to mrs rabbit my dear just think were never going to be shot at again in our lives we will make said mr fox a little underground village with streets and houses on each side separate houses for badgers and moles and rabbits and weasels and foxes and every day i will go shopping for you all and every day we will eat like kings the cheering that followed this speech went on for many minutes still waiting outside the foxs hole boggis and bunce and bean sat beside their tents with their guns on their laps it was beginning to rain water was trickling down the necks of the three men and into their shoes he wont stay down there much longer now boggis said the brute must be famished bunce said thats right bean said hell be making a dash for it any moment keep your guns handy they sat there by the hole waiting for the fox to come out and so far as i know they are still waiting
