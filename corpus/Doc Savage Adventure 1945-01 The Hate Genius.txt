 i it came as soon as he saw lisbon the feeling of being afraid there had been fog a slatecolored depressing fog around the clipper during the last five hundred miles of flying and the plane popped out of it suddenly into bright sunlight and there directly below was their destination lisbon the westernmost of europes capitals with its white houses and colored tile roofs and parks and gardens fronting on the rada de lisboa with its elevenbyseven mile lake made by the widening of the tagus river he had expected to be afraid as soon as he saw lisbon and what he felt wasnt too bad so he was relieved not much relieved though the plane began circling he suspected something was wrong looking down he could see the castello de san jorge on its rocky hill in the alfama district and suddenly he realized that he could recall with an unnatural clarity the exact appearance of the ancient castello de san jorge there was no reason for such an abrupt and striking memory except nerves he frowned down at the old citadel which dominated the alfama section containing one of the nastiest slums in europe there was no use kidding himself nerves he was having the jitters as badly as he had expected to have them the clipper continued to circle then the control compartment door finally opened and the captain on a land plane he would have been called the pilot came out with a worried expression mr savage the captain said they wont let us land at the lower end what would happen if you went ahead and landed there anyway their antiaircraft batteries would fire on us he held back his irritation with difficulty he had a biting impulse to shout his anger he had directed the pilot to land on the remote end of the big lakelike rada de lisboa because he had hoped to get ashore unobserved at that point he was disappointed because the portuguese officials wouldnt let the plane land there it was a small disruption of his plans but it filled him with hot anger another sign of how much he was on edge go ahead and make a normal landing he said yes sir the captain said im sorry nothing to be sorry about its not your fault he said and the words had a harshness he didnt intend them to have the captain looked worried as he made his way back to the compartment the portuguese officials were being cranky they must have had enough tricks pulled on them in the course of the war to make them impatient with everyone the clipper shortly went into its procedure landing approach his ill luck continued when he stepped ashore he turned up his coat collar and tried to hurry through the bright modern new american transatlantic terminal building he was recognized however he could hear the word going around while they examined his credentials es la senor savaget that was in spanish but he heard it in portuguese also more attention he thought sourly than the leading bullfighter used to get before the war but he was flattered and embarrassed too he soon discovered that they were sending for a welcoming committee to be composed of persons of local consequence he hurried to put a stop to that he told them he was leaving immediately that he couldnt linger in lisbon to be entertained that he was most profoundly sorry and knew they probably didnt believe him but they were polite about it and he bowed out of their company entering the airways terminal managers office he got from the office to the street via a window he walked rapidly for two blocks then hailed a taxicab one of the type which manufactured its own propelling gas in a furnace affair which rode on the rear bumper and which was as likely as not to cough handfuls of sparks at the passengers drive to the cidac baixa he told the driver then settled back to watch out for sparks and to wonder if there was a redheaded young man following him there was not wishing to jump at conclusions in his state of nerves he could be imagining things he had the puffing smelling sparkbelching cab take him around several streets in cidae baixa the lower town he became certain the redheaded man was on his trail and that the fellow was fairly adept at snooping he said in portuguese driver do you know the hotel giocare the driver said he did he gave the driver an envelope and said i want you to take this to the hotel giocare drive with it to the hotel giocare and wait outside with it do not give it to the hotel clerk just wait outside across the street from the giocare is the ciriegia park where you can wait i will pay you the driver turned the envelope in his hands and frowned at it the envelope was sealed as a matter of fact it contained doc savages driving license pilot certificate a few courtesy cards a commission in the new york police department and some other matter he had emptied his billfold of the litter and put it in the envelope for no other reason than that the billfold was getting stuffed he had done this on the plane so the envelope still had been in his pocket what will you pay me the driver asked doc savage named an amount equal to the fare no it will cost you twice as much the driver insisted for evidently he had decided his passenger was one of the mysterious international gentlemen secretive about their business who had been plentiful in neutral lisbon for a couple of years all right doc said curtly to punish the driver for being greedy he carefully wrote down the mans name and identification and description letting the fellow see him do it they went on the streets were narrow the corners sharp he picked a sharp corner and after they were around it stepped hurriedly out of the car and ducked into the handiest doorway his cab went on the other machine the one occupied by the redheaded man was out of sight when he quit his own cab but it popped into view a moment later passing within handreach doc got a thorough look at the redheaded man the fellow was around forty not large but with an intense animal expression he was dapperly dressed with tan gloves and a cane he was leaning forward both gloved hands resting on the cane staring at the cab he was following his hair was about the color of a freshly cut carrot his lips had an expression that was not exactly a grin more of an ilikethissortofthing twist he was a complete stranger doc savage began walking toward a hostelry called the chiaro di luna he wondered about the redheaded man as he walked trying to figure out who the fellow might be and frightening himself with some of the possibilities the redheaded young man had seemed so vital and enthusiastic about doing his following lob he was so damned hearty about it whoever and whatever he was he liked his job and a man with enthusiasm for this kind of work was dangerous the hotel chiaro di luna was a gaudy noisy hostelry where you could go without attracting much attention the name meant in italian moonlight but something relative to a circus or carnival would have been more appropriate mr carlos napolena calling to see mr scimmia doc savage told the clerk his name was not carlos napolena and neither was monk mayfair named mr scimmia monk mayfair was lieutenant colonel andrew blodgett mayfair a chemist of great ability when he worked at it which wasnt very often because he liked excitement by golly monk said heartily by golly im glad you showed up monk looked and acted as if he were mentally about ten years old which was deceptive it would also have been entertaining but he frequently overdid it he was short wide homely hairy he had more than a general resemblance to an amiable ape and doc savage sometimes suspected he went out of his way to cultivate the mannerisms of one ham brooks was with monk ham was a lawyer calling ham a lawyer was somewhat like calling buckingham palace a house monk mayfair and ham brooks were members of a group of five who had worked with doc savage for a long time they were his associates his assistants he knew them quite well and so he was immediately sure that something was bothering them they were hiding something from him he decided he was badly scared monk and ham rarely deceived him and never except for good and vital reason he tossed his hat on a table trying to be casual and wondered if there was someone hiding in the room with trained and cocked pistols a wild idea of course but he was sure something was amiss you are doing all right by yourselves he said he meant the room it was a rich place although it ran a little more to red velvet than select taste dictated ham explained the snazzy jernt was monks idea this suite until recently was occupied we were told by the sultan of somethingorother and ten of his favorite wives the minute monk heard that nothing would do but that we should put up here doc asked who is paying for it monk monks financial condition was pretty continuously one of being strapped at lisbon prices the suite was rich for his purse paying with what doc asked idly still wondering what was wrong with monk and ham puzzled about their uneasiness monk said quickly im twobit rich for a change i sold a chemical formula to a fellow a formula for making nonrubber baby pants ham said monk winced i dont think it so funny i got paid for it doc savage took a deep breath and faced them all right now he said what is worrying you two fellows they looked at him too innocently watching them his own uneasiness crawled up like a nest of snakes and frightened him additionally he could not guess what might be wrong they had not he was sure been in lisbon more than a day when he had cabled them they were in london and he was in new york his cable had instructed them to go immediately to lisbon to the chiaro di luna hotel and wait for his appearance that was all he had told them he did not dare tell them anything more even in code he couldnt take chances with this matter he began to get angry it is always a short step from tight nerves to rage he scowled at them stop it he said youre behaving like kids monk and ham looked so uncomfortable that he was ashamed of his harshness he watched them and he was sure that they were going to confess whatever was worrying them but it would take a little time for them to get around to it he waited and he thought again of the redheaded stranger the thought of the fellow made him jump up and on his feet he realized how jittery he was becoming he went to the window and stared out seeing the people in the street the hucksters the country folk from almada and sixal the fishermen from trafaril monk finally spoke pat is here monk said doc savage wheeled the news was so much different from anything he had expected he almost laughed yet he wasnt pleased lord he said oh lord explanations and alibis poured out of monk and ham she was in london monk said she came over on a war correspondents clearance she had wangled out of some magazine they wouldnt the military people wouldnt let her go across and see action so you can guess what pat did she told everybody from eisenhower on down what she thought of them so they jerked her credentials except for a oneway pass back to new york pat refused to return to new york so she was stranded in london ham said we hid from her doc honest we did but she vamped some somebody in the intelligence office into giving her our address so she found us she found us a few hours before we got your message to come to lisbon monk spread his hands you know what happened she found out you had assigned us a job and came along why did you tell her about the cablegram doc demanded we didnt she found it out shes a mindreader ham said defensively she has never seen the cable we destroyed it before she got her hands on it doc frowned at them how on earth did she get from england to portugal in times like these when she didnt have credentials i dont know but i think she let them think she was returning to new york by plane and got herself routed through lisbon anyway shes here yes where ill get her monk said sheepishly shes got a room down the hall wait a minute doc said he went into the bedroom of the suite threw up a window he found there and examined a convenient fire escape come on he said were going to skip without seeing pat monk grinned i wish i could be around to hear what she has to say about it better get our clothes ham said or are we coming back here grab what youll need doc said ham and monk did some hasty scooping of garments into a handbag and ham climbed out on the fire escape monk followed him then doc they went down two floors and there was a clattering uproar and a crash as a champagne bottle fell off a window sill hit the areaway below and broke blazes monk said somebody had a thread stretched across pat savage put her head out of a window above and said thats right monk a thread and guess who put it there ii most males would admit that looking at patricia savage was an experience she was a cousin of doc savage a distant one but she had some of the family characteristics which made doc a striking figure she had his height and his remarkable bronze hair and she had almost the strange flakegold eyes which were docs outstanding peculiarity of appearance she was something to be shown in kodachrome i wont laugh at you she told them but its an effort not to monk asked sourly howd you know we would sneak out by the fire escape i figured that as soon as you told doc i was here he would get some such impulse she said whats going on going on now now dont keep me in suspense pat told him and dont beat around the bush why did you rush to lisbon why did doc rush to lisbon what is it this time i dont know monk said and thats the truth doc hasnt taken time to tell us anything but something is in the pot of course they had returned to the sinfullooking velvet interior of the suite which monk and ham occupied monk and ham skidded their handbags into the bedroom and waited for doc and pat to have a row doc would come out loser they surmised but it should be interesting to listen to doc savage lodged himself in a chair he knew monk and ham expected to hear a row and he knew pat expected him to start one and he decided to fool them he wouldnt have an argument with pat he looked thoughtfully at the floor and in a moment his fears and his nervousness wrapped around him like a clammy blanket his mood became like something from a grave ten thousand curses he thought gloomily upon whatever it was that made pat like dangerous excitement pat was okay she was lovely she was so beautiful she made men foolish and she had brains he wished to god she would marry some nice guy and mastermind him into becoming president or something if only she hadnt come to lisbon her presence here horrified him because he knew the extent of the danger he was half tempted to tell her what she was getting into just for the satisfaction of scaring the devil out of her he smothered the impulse because it would do no good it would scare pat stiff but she would string along with the thing because of that crazy yen she had for dangerous excitement im going to fool you he told her im going to let you in on our little party without an argument she looked at him suspiciously dont you feel all right she asked i mean this doesnt sound like you would you go back to new york if i asked you to he demanded i would not all right i wont argue he said i just give up stay if you want to she stared at him intently trying to read him youre scared she decided doc youre scared this is i think the first time i ever saw you plain out and out funked youre just so plain darn terrified that you dont feel like arguing with me he nodded and said heavily thats right he could tell that she was shocked that she was beginning to get scared herself why are we in lisbon she demanded what is this anyhow he decided not to tell her now there were several reasons for not doing so there might be a microphone in the room for one thing the main reason was that he had actually not the slightest intention of letting pat get involved in the affair he couldnt think of a way now of bustling her off to new york but he hoped to in the meantime he would keep her from finding out anything he said the man is a little less than average size ruddy complexion a few freckles a grin like a man about to bite a baby and red hair the reddest hair you ever saw know him not in my book monk said i dont recall such a person ham said pat looked interested does he laugh a lot when he talks and tell corny gags now and then seems to have a fancy cane and gloves to match every suit he wears about his talk i couldnt say but he had brown gloves and a cane doc admitted he got on my trail as soon as i stepped off the plane pat said he must be a fellow who has been popping his eyes at me didnt seem like a bad egg you met him he introduced himself what seemed to be his business monkey business the same as most guys who introduce themselves to me pat said he didnt strike me as a bad character although he gets you down with his jokes and you have the feeling that he has more energy than he knows what to do with know anything definite about him no i dont doc frowned and decided that they had better take a look at his redheaded man to make sure it was the same one pat knew he told monk ham and pat how the carrottop had followed him from the clipper base and explained the trick he had used to mislead the fellow the theory of the trick was that he will ask the cab driver where he left me and the cab driver will sell him the information then also sell him the fact that he the driver has an envelope which he was to keep and deliver to me later the envelope isnt sealed so they will immediately take a look at the contents and find that the stuff seems important so the redheaded man to get back on my trail will be watching the waiting cab driver in front of the hotel giocare he added dubiously if it all works out right it did thats my redheaded man pat said thats fullofjokes the redheaded man was sprawled on the grass in giriegia park he had spread newspapers out on the grass and was lying on them making a pretense of contemplating a statue of pedro iv emperor of portugal during the troublesome miguelite war period the cab driver had parked at the curb about forty yards distant and was sitting on the runningboard of his vehicle lunching on a bottle of wine and a long loaf of bread im sure pat said im positive thats the same redheaded fellow what would happen if you walked up to him doc asked how do you mean are you on good terms have you slapped him or anything the way youve been known to do not yet pat said although ive a hunch hes a fellow who could stand a little slapping what have you got on your mind doc explained we might as well rake that fellow in now and see what he can tell us grab him you mean doc nodded walk up to him pat stroll him around the corner well form a reception committee she said ill try it and went toward the redheaded man the redheaded man gave up contemplating the statue of pedro iv and grinned at pat he sprang to his feet and did a sweeping bow talked for a while with pat then began shaking his head pat turned and pointed at the waiting cab the redheaded man looked at the cab and while he was doing that pat hit him over the head with an object which she took from her purse the redheaded man sprawled down in the grass monk said astonished she knocked him cold thats pat doc agreed as subtle as a ton of bricks monk and ham hurried to join pat doc detoured past the cab to get his envelope from the driver and to tell the driver you keep on doublecrossing people and it will get you in trouble the driver looked frightened and lost no time getting into his machine and leaving doc joined pat why did you hit him like that he wouldnt go for a walk pat explained stretch him out and look concerned about him doc said if he starts to wake up belt him again ill go find a cab he had to walk three blocks before he found a cab returning with the machine he discovered that a small crowd of curious had gathered including two policemen our friend fainted pat was telling the cops blandly they carried the redheaded man to the cab loaded him inside and got in themselves the onlookers followed them giving advice doc was glad when the cab got moving what did you hit him with he asked pat my sixshooter she said its a wonder you didnt brain him it was about as subtle as shooting a sparrow with a cannon pat wasnt impressed monk jerked off the redheaded mans brown gloves the fellows hands were lean and strong but there was nothing unusual about them monk was disappointed thought he might be wearing gloves to cover up a scar or birthmark or something pat began going through the redheaded mans clothing she found quite a lot of moneypaper money and metal french swiss portuguese spanish and germanand that was all there was nothing but money in the mans pockets pat looked for suit labels and found none she pointed out that it was obviously a tailormade suit and there should have been labels she did not sound discouraged monk fanned through the mans roll of money admiringly he sure goes wellheeled who do you suppose he is pat looked at doc savage what im wondering is why we grabbed him doc dont you think youd better tell us what this is all about doc told their driver in portuguese drive out through the alcantara valley pat continued to watch him finally she said come on doc lets have some information he said now isnt the best time for that and glanced meaningly at the driver oh pat said and subsided later he asked patmind loaning me your gun what gun he told her patiently that portable howitzer you carry in your handbag i want to borrow it to influence our friend here pat got the piece of artillery out of her handbag i can do without your wise sayings about this gun this once she said doc said nothing but monk and ham laughed pats gun was an oldfashioned singleaction sixshooter of jesse james and wild bill hickok vintage it weighed more than four pounds which was as much as some hunting rifles the blunderbuss was a family heirloom and they had always wondered whether pat could hit anything with it their driver got a glimpse of the gun he became alarmed judging from the way his color changed from mahogany to slate doc selected a side road at random told the driver to take it then in a stretch of woods which looked lonesome had the cab stop ham you stay with the driver so he wont desert us doc suggested he seized the redheaded man and carried him into the woods the fellow was showing no signs of consciousness i didnt think i hit him that hard pat said uneasily his skull isnt cracked or anything is it he will wake up eventually he told her this was not exactly true the redheaded man was already awake he had been conscious for about fifteen minutes but doing a good job of pretending he wasnt doc lowered the redheaded man beside some bushes indicated monk and pat should watch the fellow and said ill look around to be sure we wont be bothered here he walked a few yards into the brush and unloaded pats overgrown gun putting the shells in his pocket then he went back coast seems clear he made a pretense of taking the redheaded mans pulse youre sure hes going to be all right pat demanded doc nodded id better tell you something before we start questioning him he said listen to me because there may not be time to repeat he hesitated dangling pats sixshooter thoughtfully he wanted to tell them some of the truth enough truth to serve a purpose but not too much it was difficult to know what to say and what not to say he said this is no time for too many details but here is the situation roughly we have been handed a job the job of finding a man it would be more correct to say that our job is to catch a man and dont get the idea that the matter isnt important because we have only one man to catch he paused considering how best to convince them with word and still not give specific facts that they were involved in something extraordinary it was a little like trying to describe the grand canyon to someone who had never heard of the place he hesitated to tell them in plain words how big it was knowing he would sound overdramatic so spectacular that it would be incredible it would sound too wild to say that the immediate course of the war the lives of innumerable men the future of european nations depended on whether they caught one man that was goofy stuff if you put it in words but it was not an exaggeration he said quietly if i told you how important it is that this one man be caught it wouldnt be quite believable i am afraid who wants us to catch the guy monk demanded the request came directly from the white house which sounds rather wild also he said uncomfortably he crouched beside the redheaded man still dangling pats sixgun idly in his fingers he added here is what im trying to tell you no one seems to know the whereabouts of this man we are to catch however i have a means of locating him which should work and will work providing no one interferes with us everything hinges on that no one interfering with us for that reason we have to get tough with this fellow here i do not know who he is or what his game was but hes out of luck we cant have him interfering now because if things work out right well be able to lay our hands right on this man were supposed to catch he closed his eyes and thought god help me that is close to lying he had never lied to monk or pat or ham not exactly he had shaved the truth a few times and always regretted it while he was repenting the redheaded man snatched the big sixshooter out of his hands the redheaded man was quick and violent he was coming to his feet when he said dont move babies or ill blow you apart the fellow stood there as if afraid to make another move he held the big gun too tightly and it shook a little enough to worry monk and pat and it would have worried doc if he hadnt unloaded it a while ago pat stared at the gun it was large so much larger when you were looking at the producing end age and use had made the metal shiny and smooth and the large ivory grips were as smooth as pearls from much use the redheaded mans hand looked so strained that it was a little yellow on the grips and it was sweating leaving a beautiful set of finger prints pat thought she hoped she wouldnt be shot with her own gun not with a weapon that was a cherished heirloom like this one the redheaded man began backing away doc said there are no shells in that gun the man laughed but not as if it was funny you should know he said thats right i should know doc said and went toward him the redheaded mans face suddenly blanched he pointed the gun at the ground he pulled the trigger nothing happened except the hammerfall click monk said damn its not loaded and he made for the man doc savage to stop monk pretended to stumble and got under monks feet bringing monk down they tied up in a pile in the grass the redheaded man threw the sixshooter at doc he threw it as hard as he could missed doc with the gun because doc dodged then whirled and tucked his elbows into his ribs and took out through the woods like a deer pat said something wild and angry and chased the fellow pat was fast on her feet for a girl but no equal of the redheaded man he outdistanced her doc told monk in a low voice dont catch him work at it but dont catch him monk was dumfounded ill be danged you deliberately let him get away doc said chase him make him think its real they did that they charged around through the thick woodland carefully finding no trace of the redheaded man doc said im going back and get pats gun weve got to keep that cannon away from her or shes going to shoot somebody monk and doc both searched for pats sixshooter in the brush and found it before pat joined them doc put the big weapon inside his shirt well just forget to tell pat we picked this up he told monk the way she likes to wave the thing around makes me nervous yeah she has buffalo bill tendencies when she gets excited monk said pat came back and began hunting for her heirloom doc and monk pretended to help for a few minutes then doc said well have to let it go but that gun was dads pat wailed i wouldnt take a fortune for it we cant kill more time doc said pat got mad look you pat poked docs chest angrily with a forefinger next time you rig a piece of funny business dont pass my sixshooter around so freely i put a lot of stock in that weapon he might have run off with it what makes you think the business was funny listen i know a goat when i see one why didnt you just say you wanted to hand that fellow some information then turn him loose they went back to the cab where ham was waiting what happened ham demanded a shenanygin pat said bitterly our fieryheaded friend was stuffed with information and turned loose ham stared at doc what was the idea doc savage glanced at his watch i am supposed to have a conference with a gentleman who handed us this job suppose you sit in on it youll get an idea of what were up against iii the building was nice but not spectacular it was on the terreiro do paco the spacious square facing the river the building itself did not face the river but was on one of the sides the side opposite the post office and some of the ministries inside the arcaded entrance there was a wine shop of the better type i want a port wine doc told one of the two middleaged clerks the brand i prefer is limperatore da liberade a particular vintage the clerk asked nineteen thirtyeight would you care to visit our cellars and make a selection the thing was done so naturally that pat wasnt sure that a code was passing she nudged monk and asked him about it and monk said damned if he could tell they went down a flight of steps into a typical vaulted wine cellar cool and spicy the clerk showed them some wine bottles and the bottles had spots of differentcolored paint on each doc selected a blue and yellow combination said i like this one but i would like more than you seem to have in stock perhaps you would consult the wholesaler person ally the clerk said apologetically i am sorry but we have had a slight misunderstanding with the fellow and he will not supply us more i will give you his address if you wish i would appreciate that doc assured him the clerk wrote an address i would suggest that you not mention our firm because it might irritate the distributor thank you i wont when they were out on the street pat said doc was that a code deal or not it was he told her he consulted the address the clerk had given him the spot seems to be north of black horse square it wasnt too far because black horse square was the name the british used for the praca do cornmercio which was also the terreiro do paco they passed the triumphal arch on the north side moved along rua augusta and turned into an office building there they bought some more winebottles paint marked blue and yellow from a slickhaired insultmg young man this is getting monotonous pat complained you will pay upstairs said the insulting young man the man they went to pay proved to be a red faced worried looking man who seized doc savages hand pumped it and said say were glad to see you savage weve been in a hit of a wind lest you not make it pat nudged ham said hey ive seen redface before somewhere ham said good god in a low impressed voice pat stared at him in surprise because ham was not easily impressed she wondered who the dickens the redfaced man could be but they were introduced before she could ask ham the redfaced man was presented as mr dilling but pat didnt feel that his name was mr dilling who is he pat whispered nudging ham after the introductions ham told her he told her as if he wasnt quite ready to believe a man so important would be out of england or at least in portugal which was a neutral country and infested with foreign agents hence somewhat dangerous hold your hat ham whispered i dont think doc was fooling when he said this thing was out of the ordinary pat was plagued by a feeling of unreality the redfaced man was no less an individual than the head of combined allied intelligence they were taken into a comfortable room where there were some other men waiting there was some handshaking but it was without much feeling as if no one was in a mood to waste time being social or polite mr dilling which wasnt his name got down to business by saying as i understand it mr savage you prefer to work alone in this matter not alone doc corrected him with my associates here he nodded at monk ham and pat are you planning for us to suspend efforts while you tackle the matter not at all that is just what i dont want i put out no claim of being infallible suppose you fellows laid off and we flopped mr dilling looked relieved thats sensible hope you can give me some information doc told him all i know about the situation is what you cabled me and that was pretty general stuff mr dilling nodded he indicated one of the other men and said this is festus of munich and this is melless our paris man doc savage listened to mr dilling name the men who were present and all of their names were familiar and of some of them he had heard a great deal it gave him a feeling of smallness of inadequacy to be in a room with so many men who were so capable along a special line he watched them particularly those of whom he had heard special things there was oland von zett for instance who had assassinated the german generalinchief neufsedt early in the war assassination was not the word the english and american general staff had used but zett with enormous cunning and patience had put six bullets through general neufsedt and gotten away with it general neufsedt had started ordering the execution of american prisoners of war and his assassination had put a stop to that there was also francis gonnerman who had maneuvered the italian coup which had resulted in the surrender of the italian government the italian fleet and the fight of mussolini that had been a nice job gonnerman had not appeared in the news papers in connection with the affair because it was gonnermans business not to appear in any newspapers at all they didnt look like the hard scheming unbelievably adept fellows they really were doc savage reflected von zett didnt look old nor did gonnerman neither seemed as tough even as a regular soldier they werent suave slickers either they were just nice healthy looking guys with whom youd like to have a poker game or a round of golf which proved that you shouldnt look at a package and be too sure of what was inside it mr dilling who was a more remarkable fellow than any of the others doc knew finished the introductions here is the situation mr dilling said doc savage listened and his stomach wanted to crawl mr dilling didnt make a long speech he tied a great deal up in a small matteroffact package of words and delivered it the war was near its end in europe and one of the axis leaders was fleeing his nation the man who was taking fight happened to be the only leader remaining with any great power he was one of the most villainous of the lot the man must be caught and punished this information mr dilling explained came to us through various sources and is absolutely true we are sure of the facts mr dilling took a large dossier of papers out of a briefcase here are the reports he said to substantiate what i have just told you and there are other reports to substantiate what i am going to tell you next he seemed to deviate because he began to talk about the state of the war he sounded for a moment like a lecturer who had gotten his material from the newspapers then he began to give facts and figures and names germany was coming apart at the seams the nazis had been pounded until like a great concrete block beaten with sledges it had cracked in innumerable places their leader as everybody knows is a fanatic mr dilling said whether or not he is crazy is a question but one thing is sure he is perfectly willing for every last german to die for nazi plans mr dilling scowled at his dossier of papers the man has put a double in his place he said he has disappeared and left the double over a period of years before the war even began there was talk of the man using doubles to take his place there was some truth in the talk he had however only one double a former shoe merchant named ludorff frorn minden who resembles him closely in appearance and voice the double is going to be assassinated so that the nazi chief will appear to have died a martyr you men know the german temperament so you know what will happen if the man appears to die a martyr germany will become solid again the cracks in that shattering concrete block will be cemented together the cement tying it together will be the supposed martyrdom of the nazi leader the assassination of their leader and the job is to be done so that it will appear to be the work of allied agents will prolong the war as to how many lives that will cost your guess is as good as mine thousands at least and there is another hellish probability nazism will be glorified in the minds of the german people by the death of the leader it will live and in time twenty years people are always saying we will have this mess again mr dilling had finished he said all right questions what ideas doc asked have you about where he might be not a damned one eh the fellow has disappeared absolutely we cant give you the least idea of where he is one of the other menit was francis gonnerman of the italian coupsaid gravely the thing has us grayheaded the basic problem is simple catch this fellow and show the german people the ratty trick he was pulling in skipping out and leaving a double to be murdered in his place doc asked how much time have we before they assassinate the double two days we are sure that we have two days and im telling you that isnt much time as soon as we catch the real leader and broadcast the fact they wont assassinate the double no there would be no point doc savage frowned the man has changed his appearance probably no doubt have you his fingerprints gonnerman smiled grimly we have the only set in existence as far as we know they were taken by a police sergeant named moestez in munich following the wellknown beer hall putsch later after the nazis came into power he had all his police records destroyed with particular attention to fingerprints but moestez kept these prints as a souvenir and we have them you are certain they are genuine quite gonnennan indicated the dossier which mr dilling was holding you will find a copy in there doc savage nodded he had now that he had heard the assignment a heavier feeling than before about the thing the fear was still with him the same fear that had started to plague him on the fight across the atlantic when hed had too much time to think out of this talk he had gotten a definite bitter feeling of hopelessness two days he thought two days wasnt much time and the immensity of the job was terrifying he wished with sharp aching violence that the infernally crazy world would finally come to its senses and things like this would no longer be happening it was a mad wild thing that one fanatic expaperhanger could cause so much terror and suffering and this present thing of taking fight and leaving a double to be murdered and martyred was as wild as anything before thinking how hairbrained it is doesnt help he reflected wryly he looked up and began to describe the redheaded man he gave a complete word picture of the man then asked know him any of you his name i think is hans berkshire no record he got on my trail doc said i thought he might be a nazi agent assigned to the job of finding out just why i was in lisbon so i caught him let him find out i was here to catch a man and turned him loose mr dilling didnt like that i dont understand why you would do such a thing it was an idea dilling frowned i dont get it doc leaned forward we have no idea where our man is to be found we might waste months hunting him yes but my idea is to draw attention to myself disclose that i am after the nazi leader that was my purpose in handling the redheaded man as my god youll pull them down on your head dilling said violently theyll try to wipe you out the minute they learn that you are on the job theyll drop everything and try to get rid of you and dont think they wont dont underestimate the effect youll have on those fellows mr savage doc said the attack on me will perhaps be made by someone in the confidence of the nazi leader of course it will they wouldnt take a chance of bringing in an outsider on a thing like this the nazi chief just took a few choice scamps into his confidence in this thing we know that then whoever jumps me will probably know where the fuehrer is yes but mr dilling squinted thoughtfully at savage well now i think i begin to get your thought it might work if it does itll definitely be a shortcut dilling said he began to show some enthusiasm you might get on their trail immediately you might at that i hope so can we help you when i get something definite in the way of information doc told him youll know it immediately if possible i have no intention of trying to wade through a thing as big as this singlehanded mr dilling looked relieved i was worried about that he said i had heard that you preferred to work alone only when it seems better doc said where can i go over the reports in your dossier there is a private room in the back doc savage made a rather queer request before he parted from monk ham and pat pat he said would you do me a favor eh loan me your sixshooter you could get hold of a lot better shooting iron pat said after all this was made before the day of jesse james but would you loan it to me sure pat said she was puzzled since doc had made an issue of having the gun she had a suspicion it had somehow become important iv monk and ham and pat had a conference they held it in the back of the room where they were by themselves and ham began it by remarking that he was impressed by the kind of men who were here the more you think about it the more it begins to stand your hair on end he said pat leaned forward and whispered nervously im not enthusiastic about this monk was surprised whats the matter with you pat therell be some helltearing excitement before this is over with and thats what you were interested in pat shook her head i didnt mean that no listen the nazis and everyone else has known for months that germany is licked so this scheme probably wasnt hatched up on the spur of the moment ham said you have something i would say take the matter of the fingerprints he had all his finger prints collected years ago which would indicate something like this has been in the back of his mind a long time pat nodded all right the thing is well prepared thats a safe bet therefore theyve got a tight vicious little group which is prepared to do anything to put this over ham began to get the drift of pats thinking he said more than that they can call on the whole german secret police service the gestapo and everything else in an emergency thats right monk muttered gloomily doc surely knows what hes doing he thought of all that before he decided to pull them down on his head thats right pat agreed but he should have consulted us about it i dont see why look fellows i dont know how it hits you but it strikes me that doc shouldnt be taking that risk himself ham admitted that worried me yes and me too lets not kid ourselves ham you and monk both are pretty good when you get mixed up in trouble but im not trying to belittle you when i say that youre not as good as doc ham said dont worry about hurting our feelings on that score he gestured at the men who had been present at the meeting do you think guys of that calibre would turn out in force to confer with is fat chance theyre here to meet doc savage if you noticed carefully you could see that every one of them was in awe of doc pouncing on that point pat said if doc takes this risk of drawing an attack on himself and loses theyll kill him and that would mean more than doc losing his life it would mean the nazi leader will probably get away with this final dirty trick ham frowned whatre you getting at suppose we serve as the bait not doc pat said grimly it took five minutes of soberfaced mumbling for them to decide to follow pats suggestion the telling would have to be done later because doc was sure to veto the idea now they would have to tell doc of course and preferably before the nazi group pounced on the bait when will we do this monk asked whats the matter with right now pat demanded they went into the inner room looking innocent where doc savage was seated at a desk going through mr dillings dossier on the case anything we can do to help ham asked doc shook his head there seems to be a great deal of detail here but it doesnt add anything to the basic fact that the nazi chief has disappeared and left a double in his place and the double is to be murdered in order to solidify the spirit of the germans doc separated several sheets from the dossier however you will want to go over these he added here are descriptions of the nazi agents involved intimately in the plot with the fuehrer you will want to memorize the data youll find photographs and fingerprints i suggest you get off by yourselves and hold a memorizing session monk took the identification sheets asked any objections to our going back to the hotel to study these better not doc said if that redheaded fellow passes the word around they will be watching the hotel pat said well go somewhere well call you in an hour or so all right they left the building monk with the identification sheets in his pocket they found a cab pat told the cab driver the hotel chiaro di luna hey doc said not to go there monk exclaimed we didnt say we wouldnt pat reminded him monk hesitated finally grinned without much genuine glee and sank back on the cushions i guess if were to take over that bait job ourselves now is as good a time as anyhe said ham frowned not pleased and not approving he had gone against docs wishes before and usually he landed in trouble he scowled at monk monk was a precipitous fellow who liked to tear directly into an obstacle preferably without any preliminary beating together of brains toward the end of the ride to the hotel ham got a wry expression for it dawned on him that pat had sucked them into one of her wild schemes the whole idea of their being the bait instead of doc was pats notion she had hatched it and she had sold it to them pat ham said yes i can see why doc hated to have you turn up in this affair says which youre a doubtful influence youre a shot of wild juice in other words you just sold us a bill of goods i sold you nothing pat said cheerfully i just had a good idea and you thought it was good and so here we are such innocence ham muttered will no doubt get us all in a mess they alighted from the cab in front of the hotel chiaro di luna discovered the fare was ten escudos and had a row with the pirate driver none of them could speak portuguese to any extent and in the middle of the fuss they got some volunteer help the volunteer was a lean blond younglooking man who grinned at pat and said i know some words for this fellow his words made the hack driver decide that one escudo which was about one dollar american was nearer the correct fee thanks pat said my name is carter the blond young man said well thank you again pat told him the young man didnt take leave of them instead he accompanied them into the hotel crowded into the small antique elevator with them and got out on the same floor he was following them monk lost his patience look blondy what goes on he demanded you forming an attachment o something the blond young man grinned i wanted to talk to you about berkshire eh berkshire not very tall redheaded some freckles weight about one sixty big grin and a fund of corny jokes hans berkshire oh monk said mr carter pat said you are perfectly welcome to trail right along with us but keep making words carter smiled examined pat again and said you are lovely if i may insert such a statement at this point monk had been examining mr carter doubtfully and finally came to the conclusion that he didnt think a lot of the guy so your name is carter monk said carter what just carter carter told him my name actually isnt carter so carter will do as good as any for a designation a name is but a handle on a man as the romans say they reached the ornate slightly sinful plushlined suites of rooms which monk and ham had taken monk looked in the closets and behind things found no one turned and asked carter any microphones hidden around here just one carter said where carter moved a chair under the light fixture which dangled from the ceiling climbed on to it and unscrewed one of the light bulbs from the fixture he passed the bulb down saying it isnt made of glass at all youll find and the bulb serves as a diaphragm for the microphone to install the thing they had to rewire the lighting circuit but the idea is rather clever youd think it was merely a burned out bulb you would unscrew it and throw it away without noticing the difference probably monk scowled how come you knew it was there ill get to that in a minute the blond young man said he got out a cigarette and a long amber holder and got the cigarette going im going to review the situation he said to put it briefly the nazi leader has fled leaving behind a double who is to be killed so that it will seem the leader died a martyrs death the object in doing this is twofold first the martyred death of the nazi chief will probably pull the german people together and make them fight a while longer will it monk interrupted havent they got more sense itll pull the germans together the way pearl harbor united the americans carter said you seem pretty sure i should be im a german you dont look it monk said suspiciously es steht bei ihnen carter told him warum nicht all upperclass europeans as a matter of fact look pretty much alike i am german all right i was lecturer in psychology specializing in isolates at the new university in dresden monk scowled brother you dont even have a fritz accent i hope not i went to oxford old fellow and if they dont take an accent out of you at oxford it cant be done just take it from me my boy im a genuine german one of the educated intelligent ones if you are willing to admit there could be such a german monk wasnt convinced but he could see nothing to hang an argument on what gives you a claim to being intelligent you figure carter leaned forward if the fuehrer gets away with this trick if he makes the german people believe he died a martyr the whole creed of nazism of national socialism and all that goes with it will live you may defeat it now but it will live it will become a faith something like religion something you cant stamp out carter paused to stare at them he looked grim hardlipped emphatic i wouldnt like that he said i belong to a group who wouldnt like it i and the men associated with me are trying to stop it because we dont want germany to be reborn after this war with nazism in its soul some of the violence left him and he looked at them again on that i base my claim for being an intelligent german that shuts me up monk admitted what about this redheaded berkshire carter smiled slightly and said it would be better if you would let me talk to him huh talk to berkshire the redheaded man carter said patiently just what monk asked gives you the idea we would do that didnt you capture him when was that i wish you didnt feel you had to be so innocent with me carter said as a matter of fact we know that miss patricia savage blackjacked berkshire in the park a couple of blocks from here then you carried him off in a cab so i presume you have him safe so you knew that carter laughed and the mirth sounded hearty and genuine i imagine berkshire has told you quite a remarkable story hasnt he how do you mean carter lost his mirthful expression and finally frowned look here why are you beating around the bush brother youre a great one to accuse us of bush beating monk told him violently youve been talking a blue streak since you came up here and the total of what youve said is practically nothing now what do you want anyway i want berkshire carter said bluntly why because i want him is that reason enough tough eh monk said the blond man took a hand out of his hat he had been holding the hat in his hands and the hat contained a shiny gun or would you prefer a reason of this sort he demanded monk stared at the gun and he had a queer feeling in the region back of his second vest button not because he was afraid of guns but because he saw they had been taken in he didnt fear guns but he respected them this one was a walther model pp known as the presentation model because of the flossy engraving gold plating and ivory grips it wasnt a bad gun german made monk indicated the weapon careful to make no sudden moves and asked you in earnest with that thing i would regret killing all three of you carter said in a flat meaningful way but i would do it pat said monk he means it monk wasnt sure he didnt care to find out he said at finding berkshire you are out of luck we had him hes gone he got away wie schade carter said and monk was suddenly sure the young man was german he hadnt been certain of it before but now carters speech had taken on a guttural quality that was completely teutonic mr carter pat said ja fraulein if you are a german patriot working against the fuehrer who does that make mr berkshire pat asked carter smiled thinly thoughtfully you really do not know who this berkshire is should we you are much less efficient than your reputations claim you to be if you dont know who he is pat said oh nuts talk talk and it gets us nowhere you want action it would be a change carter moved his gun menacingly all right well have some action your hands up please i am going to search you he went over them one at a time with quick efficiency he discovered that monk and ham were wearing bulletproof vests and made them remove these he said get over there in the corner when they were in the corner he demanded of pat where is that gun of yours what gun that howitzer i hear you pack carter said want it why he stared at pat and pat suddenly had an unnerving feeling that the man wanted her gun more than he wanted anything i havent got it pat said he stared at her a while longer thats good he said i wouldnt want to be shot with such a thing as i hear it is but he didnt sound satisfied or pleased he went to the window he took a yellow handkerchief out of his pocket tucked it in the pullcord of the window shade and let it hang there where it could be seen from the side street which the window faced it will take my friends a few minutes to get here he remarked monk and the others said nothing i wish you knew where berkshire is carter said gloomily we want that fellow very badly indeed wish we could help you pat said dryly carter stared at her by the way he said where is your oldfashioned western sixshooter i want that too i havent got it pat said carter developed a strange sick look v carters friends were half a dozen blocky gentlemen who looked as if they were without souls they knocked on the door then came in when carter invited them and each gave carter a heel click and a pokerfaced expression that could mean anything they were monk reflected as slabfaced a group as he had ever seen the butchers halfdozen pat whispered somebody has been feeding them on crows from their looks monk agreed carter told the newcomers m german they say they do not know where berkshire is they may be lying i do not think so because i gave them a very good story about being a patriotic german who wanted to thwart the plan monk said speak english dammit we dont understand german which was a lie because they could at least under stand german and it didnt fool carter you have a slopping acquaintance with german and about twenty other languages and you know it carter said monk demanded arent you a german patriot very carter said monk didnt agree youre a damned liar im a damned liar carter said carter then turned to the six newcomers again and told them in german that monk ham and pat must be taken from the hotel without attracting notice if notice was attracted carter told them they might as well make a good job of it and shoot monk and ham and pat on the spot and shoot anyone else whom they cared to the blankfaced gentlemen soaked this in with hairraising solemnity one of the blankfaces asked in excellent english why bother with them we dont intend to bother too much carter said also in english hope they understand that he turned to the prisoners do you you keep on and youll scare us monk muttered you will link arms with three of my friends carter told them the other three friends and myself will accompany you your three friends look like zombies pat told him one of the zombies gave a coldblooded laugh and gripped pats wrist she suddenly discovered there was a handcuff around her wrist she was fastened to the man she looked up at the man and the fellows expres sion gave her a fright the feeling she got was sudden and so clammy that she tried instinctively to jerk away she had the feeling abruptly of being close to something that was pretty awful it was about the same sensation that contact with a corpse would give her her face must have mirrored her feelings because ham brooks said grab the handlebars pat dont get to reeling i wish i was back in new york pat said then realized that what she had said and her tone sounded like a scared child i wonder why he wanted my sixshooter so bad she asked the blankfaced man jerked at her wrist tugging her out into the corridor she had with growing intensity a feeling of repellence a sensation of being actually attached to a cadaver she was suddenly convinced that the men would not hesitate to kill her the front entrance of the hotel consisted of two doors one on each side of a center post both doors were open and pat noticed that part of the group ahead went out through one door and the rest through the other monk through the right side and ham through the left it gave her an idea she pushed against her captor with the feeling she was against a corpse and persuaded him to go through the righthand door she was on his left attached to his left wrist with about six inches of handcuff linkage at the last minute pat stepped left went through the left side of the door reached out and gave the open door a quick jerk shut she was on one side of the center post her captor on the other when the heavy door slapped shut against the handcuff linkage pat did a good job in acting startled she gave a violent jump which was designed to wedge the handcuff chain inextricably it succeeded fairly well the chain was thin the door didnt fit too well and pats yank put considerable force on the thing were caught pat said innocently get me loose carter came back to her and said malevolently you did that on purpose but he didnt sound as if he was sure at this point the zombie on the other side of the door got panicky and gave the door a kick trying to force it open as a result the door wedged solid carter cursed the blankfaced mans stupidity monk out on the sidewalk said loudly look at the cops coming soderbarerweise carter blurted and jumped back to take a look down the street es ist he was german all right pat decided because that was the language he went back to when he was excited the men coming down the street were not city policemen they were military shore patrol armbanded and on duty which was worse carter said get them in the car monk and ham were bustled into a long swanky looking touring car which was parked at the curbing carter gave the door a couple of angry kicks on the other side the zombie was fighting the wedged panel pat figuring carter was the most likely to get it open managed to make a showing of helping and get in carters way so he couldnt kick the door effectively carter went around to the other side of the door i am going to kick your brains out he told the blankfaced man and he kicked the zombie in the pants it was the first time pat had ever seen a kick in the stem that didnt strike her as funny there is something comedians know infallibly funny about a kick in the rear but this one raised pats hair if a kick could have killed the man carter would have done it the kicked man made a hoarse dampsounding croak of agony i trust you have a happy time of it carter told the blank man then carter hurried to the car got in and the car drove away pat started to shriek an alarm she changed her mind convinced that if trouble started monk and ham would be shot immediately the shore police came abreast do you speak english pat asked smiling yes miss one of the soldiers said i am a detective pat said lying convincingly i was taking my prisoner out of the hotel and he managed to get us jammed in this door will you help me the soldiers grinned they were delighted by such a pretty girl we certainly will help one assured pat they began laboring with the wedged door two of them by shoving managed to get the door free pat stared at the blankfaced man wondering why he was taking this he could understand english she knew but he was doing nothing but stand there and look like a crook a part he was naturally equipped for hes got a gun of course pat thought will you search him for me please pat asked one of the helpful soldiers i am just wondering if one of his friends could have slipped him a gun of a certainty said a soldier gallantly he searched pats eyes popped the blankfaced man was unarmed he didnt have a thing in the way of a weapon hed had a gun how in the dickens pat pondered did he make away with the weapon the mystery dumfounded her for a minute then she sank to a knee made a pretense of adjusting her slipper tie and raked the floor with her eyes excuse me she said she went over to a divan and got the mans pistol from under the divan where he had scooted it without her noticing the gun was another walther this one black and ugly pat came back blithely and said i tossed my gun away when we got hung up i was afraid he would get it the military police laughed they were all young men and they thought she was cute they said so they told her she was too pretty to be a detective pat asked them to get her a taxicab they did one of them got her telephone number pat waved at them as the cab drove off she was pleased with herself her prisoner the blankfaced man was sitting sidewise on the seat to favor the place where carter had kicked him pat said it was a shame the way he kicked you you should pay him back for that in what way you could tell us where the fuehrer is the man didnt change expression when we get kicked we have it coming to us anyway i can kick someone of less rank than myself you pass those things along eh thats right are you going to tell me where the nazi chief is no want to bet you dont pat asked she was going to take the man to doc savage doc would get information out of him doc was by profession a surgeon and physician and he had a combination of lie detectors and truth serum which he used on fellows like this one and it was almost infallible pat hadnt noticed much about the driver except that the driver was very young boy she called to the driver take the rue augusta and i will tell you when to turn the driver wasnt a boy it was a girl redheaded and nice she pulled over to the curb stopped and said im sorry miss but i am not too familiar with the city yet would you show me on the map pat said okay wheres your map and the driver leaned back over the front seat with a map pat eyed the map and was putting her finger on the rue augusta when the driver moved quickly she snatched pats gun the redheaded girl got the gun and jerked back she let pat look at the business end of the thing you know whether its loaded or not pat dumfounded had a silly moment and said i wouldnt know a thing about whats in the gun ask old deadface here the zombie said it is not loaded he said it with a fiat matteroffactness that was utterly convincing and thento patthe unexpected happened the redheaded girl was taken in she jacked the slide of the automatic back to look in the chamber the blankfaced man lunged got hold of the gun watch him pat shrieked she was much more afraid of the man than of the girl she dived for the gun herself for what seemed minutes six hands fought for possession of the gun the expressionless man struggled without words or excitement coldly and viciously and pat got the sick feeling that he would begin shooting if he got the weapon finally to keep anyone from getting poss ssion of the walther pat began beating the cluster of hands against the edge of the window the gun flew out into the street the blankfaced man jerked away and piled out the other door of the cab he ran for the nearest side street pat scrambled out to get the gun she scooped it up worried with the safety a moment and leveled the weapon when she had what she hoped was a bead on the runners legs she fired the street became full of gunthunder the weapon was loaded all right it was full eight cartridges pat fired them all she apparently didnt scratch the zombie and he popped into the side street pat pointed the empty gun at the redheaded girl and screamed chase him run him down with the car the redheaded girl scrambled behind the wheel the old car jumped violently and stopped the engine roared nothing happened the gears are stripped the redheaded girl gasped pat said dont pull that on me she shoved the other girl over angrily and tried the gears herself nothing happened something had broken pat got out and ran to the side street but the blankfaced man was gone the redheaded girl followed pat and pat demanded shall we follow him hunt for him i mean i didnt like his looks the redheaded girl said i didnt either pat admitted lets get out of here when they had walked four blocks each block in a different direction the redhaired girl said my knees have got the shakes cant we stop somewhere its a good idea pat agreed heres a place she indicated a sidewalk cafe which seemed placid enough they got a table behind a cluster of phonylooking potted bushes and sank into chairs whew pat exclaimed things got to going too fast for me the redheaded girl said im barni cuadrado you do not know me of course a waiter came pat ordered coffee and hot milk half and half stumbling with the portuguese words until the other girl helped her out the waiter went away all right barni pat said grimly who the dickens are you and what were you trying to do barni cuadrado asked arent you patricia savage yes then i bungled what i was trying to do which was what the redheaded girl hesitated frowning its so simple to explain but i dont know exactly how to start suppose i begin this way something very big is happening something so important that whole nations and even the war itself are involved she bogged down looking dissatisfied with her words thats too general isnt it she continued the truth is this the fuehrer is fleeing germany he has left a double behind who is to be murdered so that the fuehrer will appear to have died a hero you have to know the german people to realize how horrible the plan is how it will unite them and prolong a hopeless war how it will glorify the nazi national socialist ideology in the minds of the german people until they will never forget it in other words how it will be the seed for another war in the futureу тthatхs amazingу pat exclaimed pretending she hadnхt known a thing about it barni cuadrado nodded тit is terrible but thereхs at least one organized group of germans who know it and they are out to thwart the plan to stop itу she looked at pat steadily тmy cousin hans berkshire is head of the group trying to stop the thingу she said тiхm helping himу pat hoped she didnхt look as amazed as she felt she said nothing barni continued тberkshire heard that the allied intelligence had heard of the fuehrerхs plan and that they had called in doc savage to stop the thing berkshire wishes to work with mr savageу тholy smokeу pat said softly doc she thought had made a bum guess doc had thought the redheaded berkshire was one of the fuehrerхs men тthings have gotten into a messу barni said тberkshire knew somehow that mr savage was coming by plane so he watched all the planes and he saw a man he thought was mr savage he tried to trail mr savage but mr savage laid some kind of trap and grabbed berkshire the unfortunate part of this was that berkshire wasnхt actually sure the man was mr savage the thing that got him to doubting was the way the man he supposed was mr savage gave away the fact that he was in europe to find the german leader berkshire didnхt think mr savage would be so careless anyway berkshire escapedу тwhere is he nowу pat demanded тhidingу barni explained тhe sent me to the hotel where you had been staying my job was to get you and find out if doc savage was really in y portugal thats why you were so handy outside the hotel then yes i was pretending to be a taxi driver it was just luck that the soldiers called me to pick up you and that fellow did you know that soberfaced fellow no was he one of the naa outfit i dont know he could be pat frowned does this berkshire know anything that would help doc savage he thinks he does barni nodded earnestly i should think he would he has an amazing fund of inside knowledge lets get him pat said and take him to doc barni stood up eagerly thats exactly what he wants vi a waiter came to them he looked upset almost sick he said in portuguese you must go immediately pat didnt understand him and asked him what hed said the waiter twisted his napkin in his hands got as red as a firecracker and began to pop like one when he spoke pat couldnt get portuguese spoken so fast but she saw barni show shock what is it pat demanded he was offered a thousand marks german to put something in our coffee barni explained lets get out of here pat said quickly they paid the check and pat gave the waiter some money not quite a thousand marks but all she could afford for his trouble she wanted his address so she could pay him more but he wouldnt give it to her barni gripped pats arm uneasily im scared all over again she said they must have found out where we were do you suppose it was poison he asked the waiter to put in our coffee what else could it have been pat was nervous herself she walked rapidly she wasnt much inclined to remember statistical facts but one popped into her thoughts fear the dictionary says is the painful emotion characteristic of the apprehension of evil thats what ive got pat reflected barni we even forgot to ask the waiter what the man looked like barni nodded all i could think of was getting out of there weve got to get berkshire then find doc savage pat said and quick how long will it take us to find berkshire an hour probably oh lord thats too long pat gasped well go to doc first ive got to tell him that monk and ham are in trouble where is he that pat thought is a slight problem she had seen enough of the allied intelligence headquarters north of black horse square to know that it was very hushhush a man as important as mr dilling who was in charge of the allied side of the affair couldnt afford to draw public attention she could imagine mr dillings exasperation if she walked in with a strange girl she had picked up even if the girl did have an interesting story well find doc pat said and began to wonder how they walked north then turned west it was late afternoon past the lazy siesta hour but not early enough for the promenade crowds the sidewalks were moderately crowded barni glanced behind frequently and finally she said tat i think were being followed pat discovered that her mouth had gone suddenly dry she had to swallow before she could say what does he look like and where is he a man in a black suit barni said hes on the other side of the street pat had to swallow again before she could say all right lets stop and admire this window and ill take a look she had no trouble locating the shadow black suits were not plentiful on lisbon streets at this hour she saw the man and her flesh seemed to crawl on her bones its one of the deadfaced men she gasped fear came into their hearts then pat who didnt scare easily was not proud of the way she began feeling fear had never bothered her much she had even boasted a few times that she enjoyed the sensation that it was a thrill of a certain sort something that she looked back on with appreciation she wouldnt look back on the way she felt now never the feeling was like worms it was the blankfaced man of course not just that one in the black suit following them there was another she saw him a moment later looking out of a passing car theyre all around us she told barni and her voice had a wooden coffin sound to her ears they walked rapidly and barni said i hope we find a policeman but they did not find a policeman there was not a uniform in sight pat said lets stay on the main streets i think this one has more of a crowd she started to turn then barni screamed snatched at pats arms and jerked her back as dark and silent as death coming in sleep a black limousine slipped through the spot pat would have occupied if barni hadnt stopped her pat shrank back she was certain her face had the color of a peeled banana she was certain there was another of the zombies in the car theyre trying to kill us barni said pat said come on what are you going to do run at least that will confuse them and its what i feel like doing so they ran they got in the middle of the sidewalk glued their elbows to their sides and ran it had no dignity but it covered ground running built up their fright pat felt panic growing but didnt know why then she knew that the running was feeding the fright but she didnt have the nerve to stop suddenly pat wheeled around making a uturn not slackening speed in here she gasped what luck she had discovered they were on the terrefro do paco and passing the wine shop where doc had gone to get his directions to the meeting with mr dilling and his group the same two middleaged clerks were on duty they gaped at pat theyre trying to kill us pat gasped watch the door the mildlooking old clerks acted confused senorita it is the police you should see one told her pat was in no mood for innocence one of the middleaged men wore a regimental necktie somewhat on the gaudy side pat got hold of the tie suddenly jerked the gentleman forward across the counter you get hold of doc savage and quick she said grimly tell him pat is in a mess and scared stiff the old fellow looked at her go into the back room he said and wait the back room proved to be an office ancient and genteel and subdued just like the libraries in the detective stories where they find the bodies pat thought one of the elderly clerks closed the door on them pat went over to the door quickly it was locked are they all right barni asked nervously i think so pat said then added uneasily on second thought i dont know what will we do wait i guess barni nodded she looked frightened after a few minutes as if to fight the silence in the room she began talking i am not used to this sort of thing she said i am swiss in switzerland your folks do not bring you up for such things as this ive been to switzerland pat said i liked it barni nodded i was born in interlaken which is a little town that all the tourists know my father was a woodcarver or rather he had a shop employing several woodcarvers who made those little gimcracks the tourists buy it was a very pleasant existence but i didnt like it interlaken is a little town and i resented it the way so many girls resent the small towns in which they grow up she looked at pat wryly wish i was back there have you been away long pat asked oh no im not an adventuress dont get that idea i have been in paris and rome but that was when i was a young girl before the war began actually this is the first time ive been out of switzerland in nearly five years is your cousin berkshire from switzerland oh no barni said hastily our family is of german descent or rather austrian my father was born in innsbruck of a big family he had five brothers and three sisters he left innsbruck and came to interlaken when he was out of school berkshire is the son of my fathers sister who married a berlin german who was a politician a customs employee hans is their only child he grew up in germany barni smiled im rambling arent i i guess the words come out of me because im nervous how did you get mixed up in this pat asked curiously oh i wrote an article for a swiss magazine a sort of antinazi article and hans saw it in berlin barni explained he wrote me we corresponded then hans came to see me and it developed that he wanted me to help out in an antinazi organization he wanted a swiss clearinghouse for his group i hate nazis so i was willing was it interesting in a way not exciting men and women would come to me and leave packages or messages or money and others would pick them up i was sort of a middleman theres nothing dull about the present situation pat reminded her no this just started four days ago hans arrived in switzerland in a wild state of nerves and wanted me to come to portugal and help him on this affair i did and thats all thats all the first real work i did for hans was tonight when he sent me to learn whether doc savage was really doc savage i was doing that when i met you as i told you barni got up and went to the door she tried it she pounded on it with her fists quick nervous beating that got no answer she was much paler when she came back the two girls sat in silence each minute pat had supposed and hoped that she wouldnt get more scared she was wrong her nerves were crawling she would think of the blankfaced men and stifle an impulse to be sick barni asked what about you you must lead an awfully exciting life associated with doc savage im not associated with him pat explained wryly i just barge in on his cases once in a while im only his third or fourth cousin not very closely related although we have the same coloring i supposed you were his sister possibly no no i was even born in canada doc is from the states i lived out in the wild west what time i wasnt being educated to the eyebrows my parents are dead i met doc when he was in canada on one of his wild cases and he sort of took me under his wing i own a beauty shop in new york now barni asked what about doc savage tell me a little about him ive heard of him frequently he must be a remarkable man he is pat said amazing he had a most peculiar youth something or other happened to docs father when doc was a baby i dont think even doc knows what it was that happened anyway it gave the elder savage a peculiar fixation that he must raise a son who would be a modernized sir galahad going into the far corners of the earth to right wrongs and aid the oppressed sounds silly doesnt it a bit unusual darned unusual his father got a bunch of scientists to take over the kids training he didnt have a normal youth at all a bunch of scientific experimenters had him from threecorneredpants age up until he was old enough for college they did their best to make a physical giant a mental marvel and a scientific genius out of doc pat grinned faintly the funny part is that they succeeded to some extent youd think a goofy training like that would have turned out a freak it didnt or at least hes not so much freak he has his freakish moments though ive seen his pictures he is very handsome save your time pat said why hes a womanpersecutor pat explained what do you mean by that he doesnt understand them and so hes scared of them as nearly as i can figure it out he has a longwinded explanation of his attitude he says that he cannot afford a close tie with any female because the first thing an enemy would do would be to strike at him through her thats just talk the real reason is that hes so darned scientific he expects to understand how things tick and he doesnt understand how women tick so hes afraid of them maybe the right one hasnt come along pat shrugged several have been past and some of them were pretty capable hussies barni smiled faintly i think you are prejudiced at least ive got you cheered up pat told her then pat lost color she felt as if she was losing nerves control courage everything and leaped to her feet the door was being unlocked vii doc savage came into the dignified old office asking now what have you gotten into pat wheres monk and ham relief hit pat such a pleasantly stunning blow that she was speechless you big ox she said when she had words why didnt you knock or something to let us know who you were i like to died they had us locked up in here doc nodded yes to keep you safe monk and ham are in a jam pat said rushing into explanations theyve been seized she poured out the story of how she and monk and ham had gone to the hotel had encountered carter and how carter had called in the blankfaced men she explained how they had been taken from the hotel and how she had jammed the handcuff links holding her to one of the blank men in the hotel door she dramatized this somewhat to favor herself then she described the meeting with barni the escape of the zombie and their ensuing troubles the thing pat carefully omitted was any reference to the fact that she had talked monk and ham into going to the hotel in the first place having sold them the idea of jumping in ahead of doc and offering themselves as bait she tried to get on to the subject of barni before doc could notice that they might not have had any business going to the hotel in the first place doc interrupted her with why did the three of you go back to the hotel why pat said it seemed a natural thing to do what was natural about it well you knew the place would be watched but was it because you knew the hotel would be watched that you went back pat fell back on her usual methods when she was caught she had found she could head doc off by yelling at him so she did some screaming dont browbeat me she shrieked im doing my best to tell you what happened mr savage barni interrupted you shouldnt bulldoze patricia she has just had a terrible experience not as terrible as she had coming doc said sourly what are you two doing sticking together against me whos against you the lord i sometimes think when he got that rib and made women doc said shut up barni pat said you get him stirred up and hell go to any length to get even barni sniffed mr savage we are dealing with a situation in which a great deal is involved i think i have some important information do you want to hear it pat who is this girl doc asked i was trying to tell you pat explained and went ahead to describe who barni was barni had better tell you the rest herself barni cuadrado told while doc savage listened intently substantially the same story which she had told pat it had somewhat more detail she repeated her own family history giving that no more detail than she had given when she told it to pat but of hans berkshire she told more particularly of how her cousin hans had looked her up after reading her antinazi article in the swiss publication the enthusiasm of hans she said had been intense and contagious he was bitterly antinazi with a subdued emotion and intensity that one could not encounter without being impressed and fired pat listening to barni talk about hans berkshire decided she would be impressed herself by berkshire mr savage i am sure that berkshire can help you barni said earnestly will you see him doc nodded naturally with the greatest of eagerness he looked uncomfortable for a moment is there a chance you would accept an apology for the brusqueness a few minutes ago barni smiled of course when can we see berkshire at once if you will go with me he is waiting doc said all right but will you two wait here while i explain to mr dilling that there is no immediate danger will it take long only a few minutes doc left the dignified old office closing the door behind him the two elderly clerks were waiting outside and he told them see that the girls stay in here the elder of the clerks nodded are they all here doc asked up two flights of stairs the second door to your left the stairway was ancient with the dignity of another age the second door in the second hallway had the same massive timeless appearance monk mayfair and ham brooks were in the room behind the door the blond man carter was there so were his friends the men with the blank faces monk asked how did it work doc pat is scared she should be scared monk said he indicated the blankfaced men our friends here are good they even had me about halfscared ham laughed half boy you were certain you were going to be a casualty the blankfaced man whose stern carter had kicked rubbed the spot which had been kicked i was the casualty if there was one carter told himsorry about that kick nick i overdid it it was a good touch nick said amiably that kick built you up as a nazi tough boy which was the part you were playing mr dilling came into the room saying sorry i am late did something go wrong the contrary doc told him we involuntarily netted a very pretty redheaded girl with an interesting story did we properly scare miss patricia i think so doc eyed the men with the expressionless faces you were fortunate to have such perfect talent on hand for a quick call mr dilling chuckled oh they are quite an asset weve been using them for a long time to frighten nazis our bugaboos we call them we keep them on tap to scare axis agents and they have done several fine jobs for us the blankfaced man who had been kicked said this was one of our less skillful efforts we had rather short notice very little time to plan those pretended efforts to take miss patricias life its a good thing she didnt question the waiter in the sidewalk cafe closely another zombie said the fellow wasnt any too bright and he wouldnt have fooled miss savage long if she had waited to grill him another blankfaced man said and i was very stupid the way i let her get my handcuff chain wedged in the hotel door monk said that wasnt your fault pat thinks fast the point is interrupted mr dilling did we frighten miss savage into going back to new york with another little push doc said she might do it ill help you give the push mr dilling offered this thing is really too dangerous for a young woman ill let you push her doc told him but first there is a redheaded girl named barni cuadrado who has a story he told them barni cuadrados story using his own words to shorten the story but managing to omit no details mr dilling was excited jove wed better move quickly on that doc indicated monk and ham and the blankfaced men these fellows will have to keep out of sight monk and ham are supposed to be kidnapped and these other fellows are supposed to be their kidnappers monk showed alarm now wait a minute the homely chemist exploded if you think ham and i are going back to new york with pat wait a minute doc interposed nobody said anything about your going back to new york what i want you to do is this follow me out to the place where we are to meet this hans berkshire keep out of sight but be ready to help monk was relieved sure carter asked does that include us better not doc said for more than one reason first a few of us may be able to do more than many second since you fellows have been scaring nazis some of the nazis may know who you are third there may be a chance of making the fuehrers gang of insiders think you are a mysterious unattached group of enemies in that last role you may be very useful later thats logical mr dilling said carter you and your friends keep out of it he turned to doc mr savage you and your two men will proceed alone is that it yes good would you care to throw a final scare into pat now doc asked just watch me mr dilling said doc savage would have sworn mr dillings face was pale when they went in to confront pat and barni mr dilling was a marvelous actor he began telling pat how lucky she had been to escape alive the tone he used and his concern his intensity was calculated to cause a bad case of cold chills it did for some reason they have marked you particularly for death mr dilling told pat can you think of any reason any particular reason pat couldnt they must think you have stumbled on to some very vital fact mr dilling continued think wrack your brain cant you think of anything not a thing pat said ive told doc everything well they must believe you have discovered something you havent that could be mr dilling did some alarmed clucking then he proceeded to tell pat that the blankfaced men were a very tough clever and sinister group mysterious fellows mr dilling gave the impression plainly that he could not assume to protect pat doc became alarmed because mr dilling was piling it on with a shovel here is what we will do to get them off your frail mr dilling told pat we will put you aboard a clipper plane leaving immediately for north africa at the first stop you will get off ride back and we will meet you to be sure they are no longer on your trail pat surprised doc by not objecting he could see that she was scared he wished that he had mr dillings ability to tell such baldfaced lies in such alarming fashion they loaded into automobiles which mr dilling had conveniently on hand doc told barni we will get pat aboard this plane then i will go with you barni agreed they drove to the clipper landing station found a ship with the motors running and the attendants waiting impatiently pat was rushed down the gangplank flanked by an impressive armed guard and popped into the plane oh doc she wailed that old gun of mine i hate to be foolish about it but i wish youd look for ft will you or send someone to search for it sure doc said the plane took off monk asked curiously doc what became of her artillery in my pocket then why didnt you give doc glanced at monk queerly monk dont tell anyone i have that gun and tip ham off not to tell anyone monk was puzzled sure but what bearing could that old gun have on anything doc hesitated started to speak then said hastily ill tell you later here comes dilling mr dilling arrived wiping his face with a handkerchief and asking how did you like that for a sendoff africa is hardly more than an hour or two flying she isnt going to africa because the plane isnt going to africa said mr dilling smugly no no indeed that plane is headed for new york and the pilot who is incidentally a tough cookie was informed that all kinds of hell would break around his ears if the young lady didnt make the full trip to new york then you think pat is on her way to new york willing or no i know so said mr dilling emphatically and i hope so doc told him would you mind telling me said mr dilling whether you usually have this much trouble discouraging her when she makes up her mind to enlist as one of your assistants this doc assured him was one of the milder instances doc moved toward the street he took off his hat and examined it intently then put it back on this being an old signal meaning that his aides should let him know but not too obviously whether they were around shortly he saw monk show himself monk and ham were keeping track of him but in the background as instructed mr dilling said you can use this roadster the car was an old italian one good as automobiles went in europe these days doc loaded barni into it all right now we can see berkshire he told her viii it did not take doc many blocks of driving to realize that he still had uneasiness about pat it was a sullen vague un sureness and he finally decided it was spawned by a doubt that pat had been taken in by mr dillings baldfaced lying he put the uneasiness away stopped letting it plague him what if pat did discover mr dilling had been telling whoppers there was nothing she could do about it or was there you have said barni cuadrado the expression of a man about to eat a grasshopper that doc admitted paints a good word picture you were thinking of patricia yes she will be safe now that wasnt the point what was bothering me was whether i could depend on being safe from her barni glanced at him pleasantly and said you shouldnt abuse pat she thinks youre wonderful i think shes wonderful too doc said she can get my plans balled up worse in five minutes than most people can in a week frequently she makes things come out all right which is bad if she were dumb and nothing she did worked it wouldnt be so disconcerting anyway she is safer out of this thing this is a very big thing somebody will probably get hart before it is over it is nothing for a woman which brings me around to the fact that we are going to put you someplace where it is safe as soon as i talk to berkshire you expect me to object to that dont you well i wouldnt say because i dont know you very well im going to surprise you i wont object im scared stiff and i dont like it the sooner im out of it the better where do we turn several blocks on she said he drove rapidly enough to give the appearance of being in a hurry but doing some unnecessary gear shifting and getting caught in traffic jams wherever he could in order to give monk and ham an easier time of following him there was a gray car trailing him he hoped it carried monk and ham she was pretty barni cuadrado she didnt look spanish or italian but the name was one or the other swiss of german stock she was supposed to be the red hair looked amply nordic and so did her features her features were very fine her eyes a cerulean blue that made him think of the gulf stream off bimini she was wearing he realized with surprise no makeup that he could detect he had never seen a girl quite so plain darned pretty without makeup boy she looked like a million in shining pennies and boy hed better get his mind on something else hed better turn his little cart around and hike i wish you werent as pretty as christmas morning he said she laughed ill try not to live up to it but youre not exactly something to scare babies yourself he grinned he felt foolish which meant he suspectedthat he was a damned fool because this was a time for dignity this was a time when the fate of the world was at stake it was a time when he should have his teeth clenched and his jaw shoved out instead of wearing a simple grin he made a mental note to turn her over to monk and ham as soon as possible monk and ham were terrific chasers he suspected they frequently saved him from making a lout of himself the house was on the strip of coast west of oeiras below cape roca the region was possibly one of the most beautiful in portugal comparing favorably with the riviera it was a highly developed section with fine villas hotels and gardenparks with the inevitable fine richlooking casinos where the food was excellent the music good and the gambling on the hairraising order the house itself had moorish lines it was rambling beginning at the edge of a road and going up a hill in steps with terraces and patios that overlooked the sea it was not a small house it was not exactly what doc had expected or rather it was definitely not what he had expected this was rich it was comfortable with that dignified extreme of comfort to which the rich but only those who have been rich for a long time become accustomed you say berkshire is a rich man doc asked i didnt say anything of the sort because he isnt barni replied why do you aska man who has been very rich for several years comes to value certain things and care less for others so that you get some idea of the man from his surroundings you sound like sherlock holmes barni said doc looked over the house is there an army of retainers or do we walk right in well find out barni said i have never seen anyone but berkshire and a couple of old servants around does he own or rent the place i thought he i dont know barni confessed is it important probably not doc said but a thing which arouses curiosity he thought is always important he saw no sign of monk and ham as he parked his car down the road a short distance and helped barni out but the two were probably in the neighborhood they would know from the way he had been driving that he was close to berkshires house which would be their cue to be particularly unnoticeable barni led the way to a small iron gate in a stone wall the gate doc noted whether by accident or not could hardly have been built with more strength and the wall was unscalable if you had a suspicious mind he thought it would be easy to conclude this place was a fort hans berkshire came through the gate grabbing at barni cuadrado with emotion somewhat more than cousinly he hugged her and said i have been frightfully worried about you he managed to repeat that he had been worried about her four or five times in as many consecutive sentences doc sized berkshire up during this display berkshire was older than doc had thought he was in fact middleaged the appearance of youth being given by his athletic body and the way he wore his hair his clothing the flaming red hair helped the effect of electric energy he was very tweedy his suit cloth was brown and coarse his cane was a heavy knobbed affair this time and his gloves rough and brown the man was dynamite he was pulsing energy and vital aggressiveness a fanatical antinazi barni had called him this man would be fanatical at anything he did hans berkshire swung to doc savage saying pardon me sir but you are doc savage i presume i was very worried about barni i should never have sent her on such a dangerous mission he reached for docs hand but you are doc savage im glad to meet you we met before doc reminded him ive been worried about barni ive been at my wits end although i probably didnt have far to go berkshire said he said it doc thought as if it were a little joke he had learned we met previously doc repeated so we did berkshire agreed what became of the young lady who whanged me over the head barni put in that was patricia savage hans she is on a plane for new york for safetys sake barni sighed patricia was very clever she has brains enough for two people that said berkshire is the kind of a girl i should marry this doc reflected sounds like a brokendown vaudeville act he said berkshire i understand you wanted to see me hans berkshire smiled looked as if he were trying to think of another gag and couldnt he said have you any remote idea who i am barni said hans i told him who you are that you are my cousin that you are connected with a german underground group which is trying to keep germany from being duped again by hitler berkshire looked relieved mr savage is there anything else you would like to know about me quite a few things doc reflected he selected one at random just why he asked are you calling on me for assistance isnt it logical you belong to an underground group as i understand it arent they functioning berkshire leaned forward suddenly dramatically let me give you an american example if a show was being produced in a new york theater with benny zilch for leading man benny zilch being an actor of medium ability and no reputation and someone like bing crosby turned up in town looking for a part in the same show wouldnt the producers be fools if they didnt grab crosby for leading man in place of zilch is that the situation roughly who are the producers of the show in this case you i take it are zilch who are the producers who wants to substitute me for you my organization said berkshire is a democratic organization they all want you if you are asking do i resent your taking the lead the answer is god no i am so relieved and pleased i could cry he looked as if he could shed tears he hadnt looked that way a moment ago doc said where is this organization i want to meet it you will doc letting some unpleasantness get in his voice said now i want to meet it now berkshire grimaced i cant theyre not here where are they they are working doc made an impatient gesture you had better tell me the whole story without forgetting anything hans berkshire was angry his rage showed in the guttural german accent that got into his speech now earlier his talk had been slangy almost american but he talked freely and rapidly he described his organization how it was made up of scholars and scientists for the most part the type of people who hadnt been popular with the nazis berkshire deviated to dwell for a while on the subject of why his comrades had not been popular they were brainy thinking men but their brains hadnt been the reason for their being in bad grace the nazis admired brains the world might think not but they did it was because his friends had the ability to think for themselves that had put them in the doghouse or was the reason for their going into the doghouse willingly they had ideals that was it they had definite humanitarian ideals and because of them they couldnt stomach the nazis the organization as an organization had been in existence a long time it had started as far back as in an informal way gradually the group had become a definite unit they had started functioning in more as an organizing unit than as a working machine they didnt actually do the work themselves but masterminded it an example berkshire said was the underground they had set up for getting allied fliers back to england none of the group personally met and helped allied aviators but they had organized and financed an underground setup which did they had gone about it scientifically taking their time and thoroughly testing the first underground then when it was right organizing others like it profiting from experience promoters was probably the best word getting down to the present situation the group had been rather fortunate in learning of hitlers plans for himself in case germany lost the war they had naturally developed excellent pipelines into hitlers private life how had allied intelligence learned of the fuehrers scheme to plant a double flee have the double murdered to make himself a martyr and enrage germany into a last spurt against the allies berkshires group had slipped allied intelligence the information that was how now berkshires group believed they knew where the fuehrer was personally hiding he could be captured but the group hadnt done it the group hadnt done it because they had a better plan if some british or american personality of great importance could do the actual seizing the world would believe the genuine hitler had been taken and not some phony the germans said berkshire intensely have got to be convinced their leader was pulling a snide trick they have got to believe it he leveled an arm at doc savage dramatically if you take the fuehrer he said germans will believe it doc savage was more fascinated than he wanted to be he discovered that he was actually aflame with impatience and excitement that he was filled with a rattlebrained ardor of the sort he usually managed to avoid this hans berkshire was a hypnotic speaker doc trying to be coldblooded and careful asked what about this house in what way who does it belong to me berkshire said i have owned it for about three years he paused and looked deliberately shamefaced i bought it in a moment of fear that i would be found out and have to flee germany it was to be my retreat that was so logical that doc lost all ability to be hardheaded there is no point in wasting more time he said why dont we get going berkshire asked you accept our proposition naturally relief made berkshires reddish eyebrows bunch together like pleased mice thats fine berkshire consulted a platinum jeweled watch an outlandishiy expensive piece it is now ten oclock dark we will send a signal he went on to the highest terrace of the rambling house where he placed a chair as if for reading then put a floor lamp near the chair he switched the lamp on and it was a fluorescent lamp giving a bright daylightblue light he switched the light off after he consulted his watch counting seconds fortyone seconds he switched it on again for nine seconds then off then on again and left it on that will bring us an airplane he said a seaplane i imagine he glanced at the sea yes it is a calm night so it will be a seaplane probably this was the first concrete evidence other than the mans fluent talk that berkshire was part of a group the idea that he could give a signal as simply as flashing a floor lamp was something doc found creepy doc pondered the signaling for a while his guess was that they used number signals and that the duration of the flashes fortyone and nine in his case was a transmission of the numbers he asked hans berkshire about it and berkshire stated he was correct how long will we have to wait that is very difficult to say berkshire said some hours i am afraid doc stood up i am going to look over the neighborhood berkshire nodded a good plan ix doc savage left by going over a side wall he checked carefully and found a metal rail along the top supported on insulators but it was not electrified and he was careful not to touch it anyway he looked back and saw the light on the balcony go out saw the shadowy figures of hans berkshire and barni cuadrado go into the house he went on stillness was all about for a while after doc savage left the quiet of night and the odor of flowers in the darkness the drowsy whispering of the sea swell on the rocks below the sky had a dappling of clouds and the sea was slick and silvery into the distance there a part of the darkness stirred and became a figure which joined another figure did he really go the first figure asked over the wall said the second it would have been easy so easy to close the switch and throw power into the wall as he went over that would have finished him you cannot be sure of that there is enough voltage he would not go over the wall without testing to see if the thing was electrified he probably tested and then he didnt touch the metal rail well i didnt do it anyway where did he go to find his two friends i suspect monk mayfair and ham brooks probably the two had been speaking german or rather whispering german there was more excitement in the sibilance of the whispers than in the text of the words by a great deal it would be so damned easy to kill him now immediately one said fiercely that would leave monk mayfair and ham brooks well we could get them later savage will bring them here perhaps then it will be simpler if he doesnt it will have to be arranged so that he will we just wait then not exactly you do not anyway eh you will proceed immediately to vimeiro and get aboard our power launch the password is april seventeenth you will pick up patricia savage so they got her they are getting her the other said you had better be moving the two figures separated one left the house furtively the clipper had been flying less than an hour and pat had discovered that it wasnt headed for america and asked the pilot what was what the pilot told her to go back and sit down which was the wrong thing to tell pat particularly in a smug youvebeenslicked tone ive been flimflammed pat said grimly youre just being taken to new york is all at whose orders doc savages pat did some thinking a quick adding of two and two and decided that she had been elaborately taken in it was characteristic of pat that once she smelled one rat everything and everybody looked like rats she concluded the blankfaced men had been working for doc the attempts on her life had been fakes and for good measure she decided barni cuadrado was probably a stooge of docs she remembered how scared she had been and she pulled out the cork and said what she thought there was no one to say it to but the clipper pilot who was a freckled young man who seemed to enjoy seeing a pretty girl get mad pat didnt use anything that was profanity technically but she got enough words out of the dictionary to make her feelings plain she included an opinion of the freckled pilots character and antecedents thats great said the pilot thats as expertly as i ever heard nice words used to remove hide and feathers now do you feel better pat went back and sat down she would probably wind up in new york and there was nothing she could do about it she became downcast probably she thought she should be ashamed of herself for causing doc savage so much trouble she had not helped docs effort by getting or trying to get into the excitement the only result had been that doc had been forced to take time off to trick her into going back to new york im a miserable nuisance she reflected i dont help i make doc mad i take up his time i dont do a bit of good i should stick with the beauty shop business she was in this sour mental state and was as near making a decision to forget excitement as she had ever been when a shuddering not too violent seized the plane for a moment she looked about and discovered two of the passengers staring in horror at one of the wings they were looking at a series of ragged bullet holes pat alarmed made a rush for the control compartment demanding whats happening the pilot was busy swiveling his neck to look at the sky and he said apparently not having heard her here he comes again pat followed his eyes and discovered another plane the plane looked distant small and black she had never been in an air dogfight so she didnt realize how an attacking plane would look this one seemed far off and harmless but the other plane came down the sky like a black wasp on a string having more than twice the airspeed of the clipper apparently red fires appeared briefly along its wing edges the tracer sparks floated past in front of the clipper the copilot suddenly clapped his palms against the radio headphones you hear that hell hes speaking english the pilot nodded we better do it he said do what pat screamed at them land get back in your seat the pilot said she had no intention of going back to her seat but the copilot turned and shoved her out of the control compartment yanked the door shut and latched it pat went back and sat down she saw the dark ship flash past and got a look at the cross on its fuselage nazi a blohm and voss ha she decided it didnt have twice the speed of the clipper after all but it had enough she watched the nazi ship roll and come back a nasty streamlined thing with its twin rudder fins then the copilot was at pats elbow weve got a little choice for you to make he said his face was gray and sick pat stared at him she suddenly felt gray herself they want you the copilot said me yes heres the situation they tell us over the radio if well land and put you aboard their ship theyll let us go if not theyll shoot us down pat saw what he meant there were about fifteen other passengers aboard the clipper four of them women it was one or fifteen ill get off she said and dont look so whitefaced about it the copilot swallowed a couple of times he muttered sorry i shoved you around a while ago ill go tell the pilot the clipper began a slow spiral toward the sea pat looking down anxiously decided that the sea was smooth enough that the clipper could land and take off safely in fact the sea was remarkably without its usual squirming swell there were waves but they were small like the waves on a pond she couldnt see the ha but she knew it must be circling above the clipper pilot made a good landing there was some shock and splash pat went forward the radioman put his head out of his cubby and said i slammed plenty of power into the radio during the talk with the fritzes the mainland probably picked it up it may not do any good thanks pat said the pilot and copilot were tussling with a bulky bundle liferaft the pilot explained were supposed to put you afloat on it and leave you you and your baggage thats a great future pat said and then won dered how she could say something that silly when she was so scared the pilot told her well circle back past here in half an hour or so and if theyre not around well pick you up or do you want us to youre darn right i want you to pat told him fervently okay i didnt know what was going on here neither do i pat said they put the raft into the water and helped pat into the thing it was a conventional life raft carried by planes at sea the copilot showed her a container of small packages sea trace he explained colors the water so another plane can see you from the air use it if youre here when we come back thanks and if they start machinegunning you just stick below the surface and stay down bullets wont go far into the water and they can only fire bursts that are short in one dive they wont be able to shoot at you for more than twenty seconds probably you can stay under that long pat watched them climb back into the clipper watched the clipper looking as big as a house and as safe as home and mother move away gather speed take off she gave her attention to the nazi the ha was orbiting slowly in the sky above the pilot waited all of five minutes until the clipper as large as it was became nothing but a sound as faint as a memory in the distance then the fritz came downstairs squared off cocked his nose up and set down the ship taxied over to pats vicinity a bullethead popped out and screamed konnen sie hier herkommen i guess i can pat said they wanted to know if she could come there she began to paddle with the folding oar that had been in the raft the man in charge of the torpedo bomber was a hard brown fellow with fox ears moist eyes and the most polite manner pat had encountered in a long time wie geht es ihnen fraulein he said and when pat said how about some english he smiled and said ach i vill do mine pest but i ham not goot he certainly wasnt goot he sounded like a katzenjammer kid he had more braid on him than an admiral pat stared and her eyes popped he was an admiral shades of little fishes pat thought an admiral the first real live admiral i ever met come to think of it and that is something even if he is a fritz admiral you are goot enough admiral she told him now what goes on he said with great politeness i vas to get you fraulein beyond dot i know nottings is dot all your baggage brother that accent is precious pat nearly said but she kept the words back thats all my baggage a handbag the ha bounced around on what swell there was and did a none too good job of getting off the sea is not the best landing for a seaplane even on the calmest of days and the smaller the plane the worse the prospects this one although it wasnt exactly small was none too stable on its streamlined floats pat knew enough about flying to nearly bite through her lower lip during the takeoff the admiral was worried too she saw him wipe perspiration off his forehead but once airborne the plane climbed with a roaring abandon there was not much room in the blohm and voss there is never much room in bombers no matter how large the craft and this was no exception pat had a small round iron stool on which to sit and nothing to lean against the only part of the outer world she could see was a small swatch of sky across which a cloud occasionally moved and once the moon she sat there they switched off the lights except the infrareds which lighted the fluorescent figures on the instrument panels the two motors drummed with a heavy force as if they were under the floor somewhere instead of out on the wings there was not much vibration and only a little lunging in air currents pat began to get a small feeling impressed was another way of putting it the admiral did that for her because no doubt he was her first admiral he wasnt a full admiral but he was part of a one and even partadmirals didnt go around personally forcing down passenger planes and taking off single passengers unless it was pretty important she remembered that they hadnt searched her not even her handbag hardly was that thought in her mind when the admiral pointed at her handbag you vill let me see dot nein he said pat let him see it he went through the purse he did it rapidly and pat could tell that he was looking for something and that he didnt find it he looked up at her you haff gun he asked i haff not pat said sourly where is dot gun what gun dot gross vun says which big gun he illustrated the approximate size of pats western type sixshooter with his hands where is you want to know where my pistol is pat demanded ja a little rabbit ate it pat said she spent the next hour wondering why in the dickens her sixshooter had become so important the ship was flying very high at the end of the hour they came back and gave pat a german altitude oxygen mask and showed her how to use it she was slightly altitude sick anyway when the pilot throttled the motors down to idling pulled on his heat and began to glide they glided for a long time the pilot the admiral the other two nazis in the crew were tight and nervous watching whatever was below the change in altitude made pats ears hurt she swallowed repeatedly tried yawning then unexpectedly the plane was on the sea again it floated there the motors still idling pilot and crew still had their tension the pilot punched at a switch signaling pat decided with his navigation lights the admiral came back to pat squirming through the thicket of mechanism that filled the bomber interior where is dot sixshooter he asked how bad do you want to know pat demanded the german was no fool he shrugged dot is too bad he said he went away again pat heard a motor a boat it came closer drew alongside she was transferred from the plane to a snaky launch large enough to be seagoing but built for speed of around fifty miles an hour the officer in the launch wasnt as polite he was brisk with her where is your baggage he demanded speaking good english this is it pat said exhibiting her handbag you cross the atlantic with only that i left in a hurry pat said where is the sixshooter oh nuts pat said the officer demanded again that she produce the pistol and she ignored him the officer then went on deck and shouted at the admiral in german pat could speak and understand german although she preferred not to use it she was not particularly fluent but she got what was going on outside the officer in the boat and the admiral in the plane were quarreling about the gun they were saying things to each other that werent polite pats first impression of the man in the boat was that he was a tough top sergeant or whatever the equivalent would be on a boat with no manners but listening to him fuss with the admiral she changed her ideas no sergeant would talk that way to an admiral the admiral was supposed to have gotten the sixshooter and he hadnt and he was being criticized the two men finished off by giving each other a roundhouse cussing then the boat got under way and the plane took off the tough guy put his head down the hatch to glare at pat you are in bad trouble he said then he switched out the lights and went to the wheel the boat stuck its nose up climbed half out of the water and made knots x there was some trace of daylight in the eastern sky when the speedboat snugged up against the old truck tires which served as fenders on a float in a small bay pat was bustled off the craft a man seized each of her arms another man was all ready with wide adhesive tape and he clapped it over her mouth before she knew what was going to happen after that the best noise she could make was a loud buzz through her nostrils the two who had her arms ran her up a path that twisted up the face of a near cliff the tough fellow trotted behind her with her handbag at the hilltop she changed hands again this time she nearly shrieked with relief mr carter she nearly cried but mr carter caught her eye and made with seeming casualness a gesture of dragging at the cigarette he was smoking and when he did that he laid a finger across his lips signaling for silence mr carter also demanded the sixshooter he did it even more angrily than the tough guy on the boat had demanded it of the admiral and the outcome was about the same the two fell to swearing at each other in german the parting of the two groups was extremely ill tempered the tough man went back to the speedboat pat heard the speedboat leave the bay mr carter told pat sharply get moving you will go with us and if you try to make a noise around that gag it will be bad pat had nearly forgotten the gag which would have prevented her crying out mr carters name he must have known that so he had signaled her to admonish her not to let on that she recognized him they began walking mr carter and pat alone at first then they were joined by three armed men two of the newcomers were some of mr carters blankfaced men and the third was a shouldersback young man who was obviously another nazi officer they did not walk far less than a kilometer which brought them to a stone house a pleasant place covered with vines and with bright blue shutters pat was taken into a large room which had a fireplace and pleasant furniture i will question the fraulein mr carter told the others leave us alone go outside and keep a sharp lookout the others left when they were alone mr carter dropped his voice and said urgently you mustnt let on that you know me keep on pretending as you have been it is very important pat gurgled pulled at the tape on her lips mr carter helped her undo it warning very quiet please getting the tape off was agonizing what on earth are you doing here pat gasped when she could speak i am very sorry i did not take you and mr savage into my confidence before mr carter said as a matter of fact i am supposed to be a german agent but you mr dilling said you and those those men with the blank faces were working for him thats my real job i dont its a bit confusing said mr carter first let me say that i am a dane by nationality and i do not like nazis there was a time when i was not intelligent enough to realize what nazis were and at that time i started doing spying work for them my profession in denmark was that of private detective and at first the nazis were just other clients for me later i realized the kind of fellows they were and i wanted to quit but i was too smart to tell them i wanted to he sighed as if the complexities of his past life distressed him i came to portugal to escape working for them he said but it didnt work they approached me here in portugal and told me to work for them and threatened my relatives in denmark if i didnt that made me very angry i assure you so i went to work for them but i also went to work for mr dilling who is an allied intelligence official i knew that about mr dilling pat said but what are you doing here i am supposed to get that sixshooter from you holy cow pat said that sixshooter again why is it so important i dont know said mr carter bitterly i wish i did can you tell me i have no idea pat assured him it mystifies me where is it what the sixshooter where is it the admiral got it pat lied mr carter seemed stupefied with astonishment what did you say that german admiral on the plane the very polite one he got it pat said why did he do that darned if i know pat said mr carter sat down in a chair his knees seemed to be weak this complicates things he said he took his head in his hands as if there was an ache inside his skull he sat there looking at nothing and saying nothing although his lips moved frequently without sound pat decided he was swearing to himself that damned admiral mr carter said finally must have taken a notion to look out for number one why would he do that pat demanded german admirals like german generals and bigwig nazis said mr carter are going to have troubles ahead of them and they can see it germany has lost the war there are going to be war atrocity trials a german admiral will need influence this one may figure he can buy influence with that gun but why in the dickens is the gun so in demand i wish i knew i sure do said mr carter fervently what is going to happen to me well watch out for you my dear mr carter assured her you will be safe i will take care of you i am supposed to get the whereabouts of the gun out of you by force if necessary who is giving you your orders mr carter grimaced i think they come straight from the biggest nazi of them all where is he i wish i knew that more than anything mr carter said fervently does doc savage know you are pretending to be a nazi agent not yet mr carter grimaced again you may have to vouch for me to him if he catches me in what seems to be a compromising position where is doc hes with that fellow hans berkshire and monk and ham theyre with doc savage i think all with berkshire yes and who is berkshire oh hes really what he says he is a german who is connected with a patriotic group of german antinazis mr carter said sourly you dont sound as if you liked berkshire ive never met him personally he is bungling around in this thing complicating it but he may actually know where hitler is theres always that chance mr carter lapsed into another spell of staring at nothing holding his head and muttering bad words in a low voice pat heard some of the words and they were danish the danish language seemed to have a very picturesque vocabulary of profanity then mr carter stood up i must report on my attempt to question you he said i will put the gag back on you you must continue to look very scared you going to tell them the admiral got the sixshooter pat asked oh no indeed why not because they might order me to kill you said mr carter seriously but as long as they think you may know where the gun is my surmise is that they will have you kept alive he sounded as if he wanted to shiver pat felt that way too she watched mr carter leave mr carter closed the door carefully after smiling at her and locked it he met one of the blankfaced men outside go back and watch that female wildcat he told the blankfaced man and expect anything she is a very smart girl yes sir the man said they had spoken german mr carter took a flowerbordered winding path to another house a smaller one about a hundred yards distant here there were three more of the expressionless men one of whom was working on a portable radio the other two were sharing a bottle at a table mr carter poured himself a drink that girl lied to me he said sourly i know in my bones she lied to me yet she did it so earnestly that i cant be sure what was her lie one of the others inquired that admiral gruehuntz took the sixshooter away from her and kept it for himself as you know very well that is a lie gruehuntz would not do that why wouldnt he mr carter made faces over his drink that is the hell of it why wouldnt he that is why i am not happy at all you think admiral gruehuntz maybe did take the gun it is possible i am not thinking at all mr carter said bitterly otherwise i would make more progress does the girl think you are really not a nazi agent if she lied to me why should she that scares me did you tell her we were not nazi agents either but just pretending to be yes of course mr carter said unable to remember whether he had told pat that or not yes you will be as safe as i am should doc savage catch us all you think that will happen the other demanded alarmed mr carter swore philosophically i think it is impossible absolutely impossible he said but here is the sensible other side of it doc savage just possibly could come out on top he leaned forward and deepened his voice dramatically to emphasize that he was merely speculating mr savage has an international reputation and a man does not get an international reputation for doing the things mr savage does without having a certain ability he said the point i am trying to make is this doubtless many other men have thought they had savage in a spot where he could not possibly succeed against them but he did so lets not be complete optimists when will savage be finished mr carter said savage and berkshire and savages two aides monk and ham will probably start out to grab the fuehrer very shortly they have certain clues which will lead them granting the devil sits with us into complete extermination what about the girl her lease on life mr carter told the man is hanging by two threads the sixshooter and the fact that doc savage is still among us she is also in the unenviable position that one thread will not support her continued mortality he was pleased with himself at waxing oratorical the other man they were speaking german was a little confused he was silent a while if savage is killed he said patiently wanting to get everything clear miss patricia will also be killed immediately would the other two monk and ham oh they would have to be included in the slaughter carter said and it will happen soon thats right the blankfaced man sighed he had just one more question and he put it plaintively in a tone that had in it a little of youhavedugawaythemolehillbutwhataboutthemountain who has got the sixshooter he asked mr carter swore at him unhappily xi doc savage had made his second trip away from hans berkshires house on his other trip into the night he had found monk and ham and told them to conduct a brief general investigation along any lines that occurred to them now he wanted to see what they had learned he found monk and ham under a tree making a breakfast on sweet rolls and milk which they must have bought in the village monk said i didnt find out too much its hard to find anybody to talk to that early in the morning though and everybody wants to talk portuguese you should have tried someone besides barmaids in the allnight joints ham suggested thats a lie well who did you try monk said sheepishly okay okay but it was only one barmaid and a good idea because they get all the gossip i found out that berkshire has owned the house three years or so that he doesnt mix very much but is a nice guy and fairly wellliked for a foreigner he kicks in regularly to the local charities his servants are local people and he pays them well he isnt here much he is supposed to be a holland dutchman with a business in lisbon that makes him travel a lot monk grimaced fairly innocent picture isnt it doc turned to ham what did you dig up it was a little more scientific than my homely friend here ham said i got the names of berkshires servants and worked on them theyre a nice grade of servants chosen for their ability as such most of them have been with berkshire steadily since he bought the house about three years ago berkshire is not there much of the time only at intervals and then for not much more than a week at the most what about berkshires habits doc asked okay as far as i could learn he speaks english french and spanish fluently and italian less fluently he seems to have quite a bit of money but he does not throw it around by giving large parties in fact there are very few friends as visitors at the house the servants like him ham frowned digging in his recollection for other facts berkshire likes american movies and he has a sound projector in the house he gets american sound films from lisbon and has private showings of them he runs the machine himself and will run the american films over and over monk said that doesnt sound so tough the guy probably has movies for a hobby ham nodded well there wasnt much more the servants are all for him as i said but they dont actually know much about him with a fine house like that they feel he should get married and settle down when barni cuadrado came to visit the place they were as pleased as the dickens because they thought it might be a match berkshire about to get a wife and thats about where the situation stands now except that the servants think theres a little scandal around the house now because berkshire gave them beginning yesterday a weeks vacation with pay and told them not to come around the place is that the first time anything of the sort has happened that seemed to be the extent of the news monk and ham had gathered doc told them to keep a sharp lookout and be ready to trail him or to give him some help if he needed it then he walked back to berkshires house barni cuadrado came flying down the path her hair tousled her eyes wild mr savage she cried a terrible thing has happened she took him inside to listen to the radio it was a good radio and she had it tuned to the shortwave program which was being beamed to spain and portugal at this hour he will be on again with the news in a few minutes she said a moment later the announcer in new york came on giving the news in english he talked about the gains in europe the progress in the pacific and some political stuff then came the news that pat had been removed from the clipper enroute from lisbon to new york the news seemed to freeze everything inside doc for a moment then he broke the shock faced berkshire and demanded where is your telephone he got a man named lander at the american embassy and he didnt know lander but lander must have been expecting his call because he had information ready he was able to tell doc in full detail how pat had been taken from the clipper by a german bomber lander said i am instructed to tell you that the germans were very insistent that miss savage bring all her baggage with her when she changed planes it was not just a routine request no it was extremely insistent they seemed to want miss savages baggage as much as they wanted her which would make it appear they thought she was carrying something they wanted that would be a good deduction the embassy had no more information so doc broke the connection he faced berkshire and said grimly look here what are we waiting on why are we sitting here in this house doing nothing berkshire said we can go now why didnt you say so intended to berkshire said mildly as a matter of fact the messenger is just coming so i could hardly have told you before he indicated the nearest window doc savage gripping at his nerves putting down rage and impatience and fear went to the window a man was coming a young man darkhaired and smoothcheeked wearing shorts and a light sweater berkshire introduced him to doc savage as kinder it was a nickname obviously the word kinder meant child so it was another way of calling the boy kid he looked like a soft gentle sweet character the plane is waiting the boy said it was a small plane as the world was in the habit of thinking of planes this one was no bomber that had cost a million nor a transport that had cost hundreds of thousands this one had cost not more than ten thousand dollars it could carry a pilot and three passengers berkshire explained it belongs to the boy to kinder he does a little commercial flying from switzerland and is a great help to us the plane had floats it was on a flat stretch of the river inland from lisbon doc asked where are we going switzerland exactly where in switzerland interlaken which lake the lower one thun or rather the arm of it called untersee nearest interlaken doc nodded all right one more question he said why are we being followed berkshire jumped violently said gott in a frightened voice barni cuadrado jumped visibly the darkhaired smoothcheeked boy became very still and looked at doc savage speculatively i think we were followed i could be wrong doc said wed better look into that berkshire muttered doc said you three stay here better get out of sight and keep your eyes open he could tell they were scared he knew that they had not known anyone was trailing them undergrowth around about was fairly thick doc walked into it going southwest but immediately changed his course when he was out of sight and went northeast he walked carefully silently and shortly he found monk monk was leaning against a small tree grinning they didnt see us did they apparently not doc said were you two in that dilapidated austin car thats right where is ham he is down getting a photograph of the plane we didnt know what might come up and a picture could be handy doc said get hold of a plane you had better get to mr dilling in a hurry because probably he can supply you with a plane if you do it quick enough and get a fastenough plane you can beat us to switzerland monk nodded okay where in switzerland interlaken thun lake the end nearest interlaken the neck of the lake is called untersee anything more definite no well get there monk said xii it was a typical swiss afternoon when they spiraled down to lake thun at high altitude they were able to see the perpetual glaciers and snow on monch elger and the jungfrau beyond the chasm that was the valley of lauterbrunen the clouds hung in layers against the peaks close to interlaken the lake water was crinkling and blue barni cuadrado gripped docs arm and said this is what i call gods country relief was a tinkling in her voice the redheaded girl was glad to get home doc studied her curiously asked your home is near here isnt it she tried to point then said the hills hid her home it was on the mountain above interlaken she said on the north side of the stream the darkhaired boy was a good flier he had army habits and they were german army habits the boy was luftwaffe trained he made a fine landing shut off the motor and let the wind sail the plane backward toward a dock ever in the german air force doc savage asked the boy the boy thought about it for a while evidently he concluded that his luftwaffe training had been evident yes he said i was in it i deserted how did you know every army trains its fliers a little differently doc told him you show luftwaffe traits im not proud of them the boy said he climbed out and jumped to the dock and fended the plane away while they got ashore the spot where they had landed was a little boatlanding typical of the swiss lakes nearby was a settlement not large enough to be a village three or four houses and a chapel and a general store selling everything from fine lace handkerchiefs to packsacks woodensoled shoes and cowbells of many sizes the scene was placid rural picturesque the air was cool pleasant but chilly with a little of the zip of the glaciers on jungfrau there was the sound of running water somewhere the pilot extended a hand solemnly to berkshire said good luck in fair english then he did the same with barni with doc savage his young face was solemnly inscrutable doc gathered he wasnt going along they started walking along a little road that was more of a path the pilot know whats up doc asked berkshire shook his head no he knows i am with an antigerman underground group but that is all he does know where are we going there is an inn near a car will come for us there they will have seen the plane arrive and send the car doc frowned how much more of this running around is there to be done very little berkshire said grimly the inn was made of logs and native stone they had dark coffee and rich cakes on the terrace berkshire seemed nervous expectant while barni was less uneasy now without being too obvious about it doc scrutinized the lake for some sign of a plane in which monk and ham might have come he didnt see one and he was depressed more than was reasonably necessary the lake was big and a plane could be anywhere in a score of coves or the plane might have put monk and ham ashore then gotten out of there which would be more logical but doc was beaten down a sign his nerves were on edge he was he decided aggravated with the way things were moving walk and talk walk and talk and all the while was the feeling that a lot of things were going on that were secret mysterious pat for instance how the devil had they known he was on the clipper for new york going over that in his thoughts doc was sure that no one but mr dilling and carter and a few of their men a very few had known pat was on the clipper had the nazis gotten the information from dilling or carter which one or had the nazis seen pat being put on the plane and why had they wanted pat so badly that they had sent a bomber to intercept the clipper the germans werent in the habit of going after commercial planes on the new yorktoportugal service in that fashion for one thing the portuguese would raise billyhell about it there had been a day when portugal wouldnt have meant much to the nazis but that day was gone why had the nazis particularly wanted pats baggage berkshire doc said yes you have agents here in switzerland havent you yes then why doc asked go to all this trouble to have me grab the fuehrer it may be a mighty tough job berkshire said you men arent afraid of tough jobs not if youve gone this far with the thing berkshire nodded thats right then why me i told you that before berkshire said the man who takes the fuehrer must be an important man a man the german people will believe you are such a man you in fact are the only one we could think of who had enough stature just anyone could not do this not effectively barni cuadrado said hans is right mr savage at first one would think that just anybody who captured the german leader would be effective but this is a particular situation the germans must know we have the genuine man in order to discredit the double who is now in berlin doc nodded gloomily that was logical and theyd told it to him before he shook his head at barni cuadrado you dont intend to follow this to the end i hope he said why not too dangerous she smiled somewhat thinly you havent much of an opinion of my ability have you i didnt say that or are you just lowrating women in general she asked he was angry and about to let her know he was angry when a middleaged man with a beard joined them and said in german das auto werden sie gleich fertig sein the car was ready the machine was an old touring with the top down berkshire with a violence that was unexpected berated the old man for a fool and told him to get the top up and the curtains on they lost time doing that doc watched berkshire and saw perspiration on the mans neck on his wrists above his gloves the man doc thought seems never to be without gloves and cane and that intense animalaliveness but the animalaliveness was growing now so they must be getting near the end of the trail is this going to be rough doc asked probably very rough then barni drops out now doc said i think shed better berkshire agreed but hans berkshire gestured impatiently interrupted do not argue please you will leave us and go home it is close enough to walk is it not she tried to argue but ive worked for this moment please do as i say there was an unexpected quality of authority in berkshires voice now the tone and manner somehow of a man who had given many orders and had them obeyed barni said angrily hans i am going to hate you for this berkshire shrugged i would hate myself if you got your pretty face shot off barni gave up she turned to doc i dont know whether i will see you again youll see him again berkshire said we will have a great celebration together when this is finished all right barni extended her hand until we celebrate then and good luck she shook hands with doc she did not leave but stood there until the top was up on the car and the side curtains were in place until the car got moving with doc savage and berkshire and turned a bend in the road she stood there until its sound had died below the tinkling of a small stream somewhere in the woods nearby then she began walking her home was not much more than two kilometers distant a little over a mile she did not walk far a man with a face as blank and expressionless as a cadaver came out of the brush beside the path you will not shriek or otherwise cause a commotion he said barni stared at him in horror because he was one of the men who had so terrified pat and herself in lisbon he shoved her a gun cocked very still he said in german this time another man came out of the shrubbery he walked behind barni and suddenly gripped her arms a third man appeared and slapped his hands over her person yanked her handbag out of her fingers you had better gag her the first man said they gagged her they put a roll of gauze in her mouth a large roll which filled her mouth completely then to keep her from getting rid of it they tied more gauze under her jaw and over the top of her head the man in charge approved the job it looks as if she had a bandaged jaw he said then he indicated the way the car had gone we walk that way he said barni stared at him in horror they are going into a trap he told her gleefully a most clever trap they began to walk holding each of her arms one waling ahead they walked steadily purposefully and barnis heart seemed to stop within her and terror moved through her body making her fingers cold and the world like a dream to her mind the walk was worse than she had imagined an experience could be the three deadfaced men stalked in silence and she wondered what was the matter with their faces what thing could be wrong that made them look as they looked but then they met a man and a woman walking arm in arm the man swinging one of those steelpointed canes which the vacationists buy to attach the little metal tabs they have purchased stamped with the names of the places they have visited this cane had fifteen or twenty tabs all new barnis captors underwent an astounding change they burst out in the expressions of men who were enjoying themselves completely smiles laughter glad little gestures and song they sang a little song kidding barnis bandaged jaw something about and she fell down and she broke her crown the two vacationists went on the singers stopped the deadpan looks went back on their faces fear made barnis nerves threads of ice because now she knew the men werent freaks they werent fellows with something wrong with their faces and they werent stupid they were coldblooded clever devils they were actors their minds were as quick as dynamite she was having difficulty walking she had never imagined she could become that terrorstricken she did not know at first what stopped them it was some kind of a signal something they must have heard they halted waited and mr carter came down the path barni felt a surge of relief at discovering the blond capablelooking mr carter he was supposed to be an employee of the allied intelligence surely he was alright he disillusioned her in a hurry youre a damned nuisance he told her sourly he wheeled on the blankfaced men you got here with her all right you didnt attract any attention they said they had met only a man and a woman vacationists and had fooled them all right come on carter said they didnt walk far half a kilometer the last third of it along a stony path through a large arching stone gate barni thought i know this place it is the old basel family estate and the last basel joaquil died four years ago the place was sold three years ago to her thoughts froze the estate about twenty hectares in area a lodge house a little lake a mansion of great size dating back beyond the napoleonic war days had been purchased by a rather mysterious person known as mr fruice an austrian a rumor had gotten around that mr fruice was a different man one time than another in other words more than one man had introduced himself as mr fruice there was a little mystery about it nothing exciting just mild curiosity and gossip mr fruice decided barni was the german leader certainty poured into her mind everything checked this was the hideout which had been purchased against the day when germany would be defeated it gave her the distinct feeling of having walked out into an abyss they took her into the lodge house which was a smaller building for the servants patricia savage occupied a chair in the large room she looked neat unruffled composed but there was a washed grayness about her face and a tightness around her eyes so they dragged you into the show too pat said mr carter removed the gag from barnis mouth he said screaming wont do you a bit of good and it might aggravate us our nerves are somewhat on edge anyway pat barni gasped why did they go to all the trouble of taking you off the plane so you heard about that it was broadcast on the radio oh pat was surprised does doc know about it yes pat grimaced i can imagine what he thought when he found out i was back in trouble again she glanced up where is doc barni started to answer didnt and looked meaningly at the men to show why she didnt i get it pat said well they havent got their hands on doc at least mr carter laughed just give us a few more minutes my dear pat frowned at him you want to hear a little story of what nature a story pat said about a mean little boy named stinky he liked to smash up things he used to get boxes of things out of the house and hit them with the axe to hear the noise and see things break one day he got a box out of the back yard got all set with his axe and hit a lick only this time the box was a hive full of bees and the bees were all over stinky in a minute get the moral carter in a tone uglier than any he had used so far said believe me i am not in the mood for cleverness he turned and stalked off pat glanced at barni did you get asked about the sixshooter the what the piece of artillery that my grandfather used to fight indians with pat said it sounds ridiculous but somehow or other the fate of germany seems to hinge on the thing xiii doc savage waited with berkshire while the middleaged man with the beard disappeared along a shrubberybordered walk was gone a few minutes and came back the way is clear the man said they went forward they were in the grounds of a sizable estate below and to the left doc savage could see a colored rooftop and berkshire had told him it was the lodgehouse of the estate but it was the house for which they were headed berkshire said ihis estate was originally owned by a native family named basel but the last basel died about four years ago a year later the place was sold to a man using the name of fruice this fruice was not hitler but a hitler agent his closest friend and a man who is on this present plot with him another place adjoining was acquired for hitler he is there now berkshire pointed just over the stone fence yonder he said so you see we are getting close the man with the beard took a dark pistol out of his clothing he glanced at them after he did that and his eyes looked wide wild that fellow doc thought wont be dependable in a tight spot he put the thought aside it was not very important put alongside the other things he had in his mind he was tight tense with much the feelings of a man who had been hunting tigers and now had come face to face with a sound in a bush that he knew was the tiger it wasnt any feeling of getting any nearer the fuehrer either he didnt believe he was any nearer not a bit nearer than he had been in lisbon probably rather his tension which was drawing and knotting until it was actually a pain came from the certainty that his suspicions were true he had told no one his real ideas about this thing had given no hint as to what those ideas were he had been secretive he had pretended to be moderately gulli ble not enough of a sucker to make it too obvious that he was pretending and had gone along letting people think they had tricked him probably some of them actually had fooled him too while he waited for the right moment there would be a time he believed when things would cage themselves for a moment and a quick act on his part would slam the cage door it was nasty for the nerves waiting man was made for action and patience was not given to him in large quantities and it was particularly bad now that he was fairly sure what was what violence would come soon if his deductions were correct they had he suspected a little more stagesetting and then they would try to snap the trap on him he gave them credit for a great deal of cleverness they were if he had them figured right going to chop just once and let that do the job which was good planning one quick complete massacre was a lot safer than a series of bushwhackings the old man with the beard went ahead again he came back he whispered to berkshire doc got some of what the old man was saying by watching his lips the old man was speaking german and saying that they had better wait in the house a few minutes but that everything was set we had better wait in the house a few minutes he says berkshire told doc the house was majestic it had been built back in the days when grandeur was mans god but the furniture was poor shabby they scuffled across the hall and into a walnutpaneled place with a fireplace nearly as big as the room berkshire got out his handkerchief and wiped the back of his neck again his wrists above his gloves he looked as if he would have liked to give one long loud scream the old man with the beard arranged chairs for them he moved casually as if they were just visitors and this was any ordinary day but his old skin was the color of a lead bullet and his eyes as wild as those of an animal they sat down the old man was still there when mr carter came in mr carter was already making shushing motions with his hands and he gave them a bigtoothed haveconfidenceinme smile im the last man you expected to see i know he said rapidly now take it easy dont get excited let me do some explaining how the dickens did you get here doc demanded carter grimaced im afraid he said that mr dilling lost his nerve by that i mean that he became afraid you couldnt handle this alone so he assigned me but how did you get here clues luck ill give you all the details later if you wish but right now berkshire was looking wildly concerned who is this man mr savage doc said sourly hes a slick customer who has been working for allied intelligence for two or three years and hoping they wont find out hes really a nazi man carter looked hurt really mr savage thats not in the least kind youre not a nazi no want to bet doc said skeptically then he added or better still want to look at something doc savage fished under his coat and brought out an object wrapped in cloth he unwrapped it and disclosed pats ornate old singleaction sixshooter mr carter stared at the sixshooter he lost color and his face lost shape then he began screaming he screamed jon panke jacke come here then he made a convulsive gesture evidently his idea of a very smooth way to draw a gun and make someone think he wasnt drawing a gun you mustnt move he told doc savage three men probably jon panke and jacke came galloping into the room prepared for the worst they were more of the men who could wear expressionless faces they wore neat civilianan clothes to which they had added steel helmets german army and bulletproof vests german luftwaffe and cartridge belts and grenade pouches they looked with all the regalia ridiculous once the three were in the room they didnt seem to know what to do with themselves doc savage was in a leather chair alongside him but a little ahead of him berkshire was sitting on a straightbacked chair crouched now gloved hands fastened so tightly to his cane that the gloveleather looked tight the mans hands had sweated so profusely from nervousness that the gloves were showing damp stains suddenly berkshire started to get up doc said sharply stay there berkshire this is no time to move around carter said savage give me that sixgun doc looked at carter its loaded he told carter five bullets fortyfour calibre enough to blow a man to pieces he continued to stare at carter scowling puzzled by his feelings fear or whatever emotion lastditch danger gave you should be his biggest emotion right now it wasnt his strongest feeling was one of elation at finally seeing through many things at finally understanding what was going on and why actually it wasnt exactly understanding hed had suspicions before now theyd checked out his guesses had been right he had gone he thought grimly a little far into the thing before finally deciding that his ideas were correct perhaps too far the next few minutes would tell that still he could not he thought quietly have been sure earlier the whole thing was a very cleverly woven net with few things being what they seemed to be and in a thing of this kind he had to be certain he was sure now it was worth having to go so far into danger to be sure even if he didnt come out of it it would be worth it it was a difficult matter to sit down and decide you would give your life for something he had never honestly to himself made such a decision he didnt know whether he could he doubted it when a man was dealing with his own life there were mental forces which were so practical that they transcended anything else sit still he told berkshire this isnt a time to move without thinking give me that sixshooter carter rasped doc savage didnt give him the sixgun he said let me tell you two or three things carter first i am wearing a bulletproof vest you will have to shoot me in the head when you shoot you arent sighting that gun at me and shooting from the hip there is an excellent chance of your missing if you miss you know who i will kill he frowned if you start to lift that gun to aim it i am going to shoot carter sat very still they say youve never shot a man he said could you think of a better time for me to begin carter said nothing he looked sick doc savage in a flat emotionless voice completely apart from his more deadly occupation of watching carter and the three men said i had a hunch what pats gun meant but i was not sure of it until she was taken off the plane and there was that report of her being ordered to bring all her baggage those attacks on pat and barni doc continued were a lot too realistic the way pat described them to be an act pat is not inexperienced and you knew too much about berkshire here when you talked to monk and ham and pat in the hotel room prior to the kidnapping which you were to stage and the obvious effort to get the sixshooter from pat all of those things were noticeable when the story was told to me later they didnt stand out but they were in the story and put together they had a meaning then of course when pat was taken off the clipper the thing was obvious you wanted the gun carter said nothing some more his eyes were small crowded by the nervous bunching of his eyebrows and the knotting of his jaw muscles he seemed to be completely uncertain as to what he was to do doc asked is this boring you yes carter said but go ahead its giving me time doc said time is not going to help you when you make up your mind to act the thing is going to happen somebody is going to get shot europe will lose its bad boy and germany its leader or that will not happen depending on how the dice fall carters tongue made a pass at dry lips go ahead and talk doc said there isnt much more it was an accident pats sixshooter becoming so important a freakish accident one that might never have happened but it came out the way it did and so you had to have the gun carter frowned silently what doc asked was the purpose of your elaborate business of decoying me to switzerland carter said i am going to yell you know the situation doc told him coldly holding pats sixshooter in his right hand do whatever you feel it is smart to do carter shouted kohl bring in the other prisoners but bring them in carefully the bringingin was done most carefully first came barni cuadrado battered somewhat her frock torn with fright on her face then monk and ham monk was in bad shape although probably not as battered as he looked ham was less mauled physically but he looked as if he was in more of a mental turmoil pat was last she was the most animated of the lot she said angrily doc theyre after that sixshooter of mine dont tell them and then she saw the gun in docs hands oh you that isnt my gun doc you shouldnt try to fool them with a different gun it was quick thinking on pats part it sounded perfectly truthful when she said the gun wasnt the one although it was a complete lie doc shook his head easy does it pat he said we have another hole card carter said coldly bitterly savage you miss the point im going to tell my men to kill your aids and you if you dont lay that gun down as coldly doc said go ahead carter blinked go ahead doc repeated and ill shoot your fuehrer ill shoot him dead and quick docs feelings got away for a moment his own tension mixed with contempt and hate and an actual bloodthirsty murderous desire to kill boiled up in him for a few seconds words and wildness came out of him without any real wish on his part ill kill him he repeated ill make him dead so much deader than any of the millions of people hes been responsible for killing he added between his teeth in a voice he hardly recognized itll be the most godgiven pleasure i ever had carter looked completely ill monk mayfair became bugeyed and asked you mean hes right here now yes doc said the identity could belong to only one man in the room and all eyes centered upon him as if drawn by a horrible magnet much the same thought must have been in all their minds there was no small fanatical man with a trick moustache in the room no one resembled the man who had been born adolfus schickelgruber son of an illegitmate father in the hotel zum pommer in braunau austria at half past six in the evening of april monk said but he speaks english hitler doesnt speak english he said it flatly wonderingly doc savage never taking his eyes from carter or the others who were armed said didnt it ever strike you as strange that the german chief of state always made quite a public show of not being able to speak english monk blinked you mean maybe he did what do you think my god monk breathed it could be a disguise but his red hair barni cuadrado came to her feet then as if something had taken her by the hair hans she said and her appearance expression and voice got sicker and sicker hans you are not what they say tell them the man they had known as berkshire sat very still they could see that he had the build of the eccentric screaming demagogue who had set europe and the world afire they could see that he had the facial contours the round ghoulish eyes and the intensity most of all the intensity barni brought both hands slowly to her cheeks fingers doubled and the fingers dug into her cheeks while her eyes became awful hans mother of god merciful this mustnt be doc said he fooled you but he has fooled the whole world at one time or another pat women are essentially more brutal to other women than man is to man demanded barni you said he was your cousin from berlin barni around hands digging at her cheeks said he he said he was didnt you ever demand proof no because he talked of our uncles and our family so naturally barnis voice was going down into an ill soundlessness oh god how could such a thing happen to anyone doc savage in a cold intent voice that brought sanity into the situation said i am going to shoot the fuehrer if anyone makes a move no one moved for a while then barni cuadrado made a low sickly noise like air blown into water through a straw and slid down to the floor and lay there without moving poor kid pat said hoarsely poor thing ham brooks said doc hitler used the name of berkshire and bought the house in lisbon as a hideout this place here is probably a second hideout doc said he glanced at carter or is it yours mine carters face was yellow just who are you doc asked carter carter swallowed i managed the thing for him i am his closest friend he didnt sound as if he knew why he was talking doc said lets get the rest of it straightened out the allied intelligence found out about this plot they sent for me carter was doubling as an allied agent so he was able to pass the information along berkshire to use the name we know him by decided to handle the thing personally he would meet me he would make me think he was a german patriot or kill me if he had to the first mishap was when he left his fingerprints on pats sixshooter that was why he wore gloves all the time he must have been afraid that somewhere someone would have a copy of his fingerprints monk said remember what dilling told us that hitler had gone to a lot of trouble to have copies of his fingerprints destroyed in germany as far back as four years ago the guy had the fingerprint heebygeebies great grief pat muttered monk took his gloves off and he grabbed up my sixgun without thinking and left his fingerprints on it thats why all the fuss over the gun there were no prints on the gun doc said none you could identify a gun almost never receives legible fingerprints regardless of what detective books say but they thought prints were on it thats right carter tried his trick then carter started to turn away from them then whirled back with his gun his intention being to shoot doc savage but monk had been watching him monk was leaning against a chair braced set to throw the chair he threw it with remarkable speed carter cried out as the chair hit him and upset monk went over not seeming in a hurry at all and stamped once hard on carters gun wrist they could hear the wrist bones break monk picked up the gun what happened then could not have been expected to happen anywhere under any other conditions uniess the man who was the leader of german national socialism was in the same room ham took advantage of the situation ham put back his head and bellowed dont shoot dont anybody shoot you want to kill the fuehrer monk calmly clubbed carter over the head making him shapeless on the floor doc had hold of berkshire by now he didnt fool around with gentleness he struck berkshire dazing him then he hauled berkshire in front of him and jumped to a position in front of pat and barni using the man as a shield until now during these first few seconds of it it had been as if they were acting against drugged men as if their opposition had no ability to think this changed suddenly someone said in german to throw down the guns to take doc and monk and the others barehanded the command was followed the room suddenly filled with flying figures blow sounds gaspings scufflings tearing of cloth and the mewing noises men make when they are in a fight and being hurt monk and ham were good at this sort of thing and they went into it with heart and vigor doc savage after he had clubbed berkshire and slammed him down on the floor told pat get hold of him hang on to him for us pat grabbed berkshire and said you really mean this guy is hitler he seems to be doc said pat said this is the height of something or other and she kicked berkshire where it would hurt him the most berkshire screamed and that helped to worry his men carter was conscious but in agony he got an idea get outside he screamed we have them cornered keep them in this room why he could have them cornered any more with his men outside than he had now was a fine point probably his pain was such that his only thought was getting out of there the nazis began going out monk got a grenade bag away from one of them after about seven of them had gone out through the door monk hooked the firing pin out of one of the grenades monk was at his best in a handtohand fight he looked at ham now holding the grenade in his hand and asked how long you hold these things before you throw them ham screamed throw it you fool monk tossed that grenade through the door he flung three others as rapidly as he could pull pins and heave them the resulting devastation and uproar practically ended the fight pat and ham got berkshire to his feet the man was loosebodied without fire or spirit or will to do anything somewhere in the confusion monk said ugh in a queer voice whats wrong ham shouted are you hurt carter i started to pick him up monk said hoarsely his head half of that last grenade must have gone through it lets go doc said they made it with an ease that was considering the magnitude of the whole affair an anticlimax a letdown mr dilling the chief of allied intelligence im mediately in charge of the hitlerescapingandleaving affair did some headshaking in the little hotel overlooking the river in interlaken that evening its gods wonder you didnt get slaughtered he told them but what happened was undoubtedly this the german fuehrer was in that room and his presence so overawed them that they couldnt fight couldnt fight hell monk told him you werent there they put up quite a scrap but there were nine of them dilling said how you licked nine picked nazi toughies in splitseconds i cant imagine unless it was that they were afraid to use their guns and grenades for fear of killing their leader youre the guy monk told dilling who put that carter bird in our hair ill probably never live that down dilling muttered youre danged right you wont monk said didnt you know he was the fuehrers right hand boy lord no dilling looked pained you sound pretty hot about it monk grinned ill cool down eventually it came out all right anyhow doc savage came into the room and asked dilling how is the international part of the mess coming now the swiss mr dilling grinned oh they are in an embarrassing spot but theyre going officially to know nothing whatever about it in other words if we get hitler out of switzerland and to england or america in a hurry they will be very innocent nothing happened here as far as they know doc nodded you think the assassination of the double will come off in berlin now not a chance mr dilling grinned again in fact we are sure of it word has come out by the grapevine that the killing is off doc savage was thoughtful for a while he examined the floor his own hands feeling selfconscious and unnatural tasting and feeling of an uncertainty which was still with him the whole thing had been somewhat unreal there were so many factors involved that he had not seen that he did not understand that he probably would never see or understand mr dilling doc said suddenly yes is that man that berkshire really adolf hitler doc asked mr dilling got a funny look its strange when things get so fantastic how a man would give anything for one single truth to hang his hat on isnt it doc nodded vaguely as if the answer didnt exactly make sense he said the girl barni cuadrado is going to need something like that something solid enough to cling to until the shock wears off how is she taking it hard doc said soberly she is pretty much in pieces over the part she unwittingly played you are serving as her doctor arent you yes youll probably put her back together again mr dilling said mr dilling grinned slightly it should be a pleasant job doc had an idea he was looking sheepish again the end
