nora roberts night shield night tales book chapter he didnt like cops his attitude had deep roots and stemmed from spending his formative years dodging them outrunning themusuallyor being hassled by them when his feet werent fast enough hed picked his share of pockets by the time hed turned twelve and knew the best and most lucrative channels for turning a hot watch into cold cash hed learned back then that knowing what time it was couldnt buy happiness but the twenty bucks the watch brought in paid for a nice slice of the happiness pie and twenty bucks cannily wagered swelled into sixty at threetoone the same year hed turned twelve hed invested his carefully hoarded takes and winnings in a small gambling enterprise that centered around point spreads and indulged his interest in sports he was a businessman at heart he hadnt run with gangs first of all hed never had the urge to join groups and more importantly he didnt care for the pecking order such organizations required someone had to be in chargeand he preferred it to be himself some people might say jonah blackhawk had a problem with authority they would be right he supposed the tide had turned right after hed turned thirteen his gambling interests had grown nicelya little too nicely to suit certain more established syndicates hed been warned off in the accepted wayhed had the hell beat out of him jonah acknowledged the bruised kidneys split lip and blackened eyes as a business risk but before he could make his decision to move territories or dig in hed been busted and busted solid cops were a great deal more of an annoyance than business rivals but the cop whod hauled his arrogant butt in had been different jonah had never pinned down what exactly separated this cop from the others in the line of shields and rule books so instead of being tossed into juvieto which he was no strangerhed found himself yanked into programs youth centers counseling oh hed squirmed and snapped in his own coldblooded way but this cop had a grip like a bear trap and hadnt let go the sheer tenacity had been a shock no one had held onto him before jonah had found himself rehabilitated almost despite himself at least enough to see there were certain advantages to if not working in the system at least working the system now at thirty no one would call him a pillar of denvers community but he was a legitimate businessman whose enterprises turned a solid profit and allowed him a lifestyle the hustling street kid couldnt have dreamed of he owed the cop and he always paid his debts otherwise hed have chosen to be chained naked and honeysmeared to a hill of fire ants rather than sit tamely in the outer office of the commissioner of police of denver even if the commissioner was boyd fletcher jonah didnt pace nervous motion was wasted motion and gave too much away the woman manning the station outside the commissioners double doors was young attractive with a very interesting and wanton mass of curling red hair but he didnt flirt it wasnt the wedding ring on her finger that stopped him as much as her proximity to boyd and through him the long blue line he sat patient and still in one of the huntergreen chairs in the waiting area a tall man with a longlegged tough build wearing a three thousand dollar jacket over a twentydollar tshirt his hair was ravenblack rain straight and thick that and the pale gold of his skin the whiplash of cheekbones were gifts from his greatgrandfather an apache the cool clear green eyes might have been a legacy from his irish greatgrandmother whod been stolen from her family by the apache and had given the brave whod claimed her three sons jonah knew little of his family history his own parents had been more interested in fighting with each other over the last beer in the sixpack than tucking their only son in with bedtime stories occasionally jonahs father had boasted about his lineage but jonah had never been sure what was fact and what was convenient fiction and didnt really give a damn you were what you made yourself that was a lesson boyd fletcher had taught him for that alone jonah would have walked on hot coals for him mr blackhawk the commissioner will see you now she offered a polite smile as she rose to get the door and shed taken a good long look at the commissioners ten oclock appointmenta wedding ring didnt strike a woman blind after all something about him made her tongue want to hang out and at the same time made her want to ran for cover his eyes warned a woman hed be dangerous he had a dangerous way of moving as well she mused graceful and sleek as a cat a woman could weave some very interesting fantasies about a man like thatand fantasies were probably the safest way to be involved with him then he flicked her a smile so full of power and charm she wanted to sigh like a teenager thanks she rolled her eyes as she shut the door behind him oh boy are you welcome jonah boyd was already up and coming around his desk one hand gripped jonahs while the other gave jonahs shoulder a hard squeeze in a kind of male hug thanks for coming hard to refuse a request from the commissioner the first time jonah had met boyd boyd had been a lieutenant his hair had been a dark streaked gold and his office small cramped and glass walled now boyds hair was deep solid silver and his office spacious the glass wall was a wide window that looked out on denver and the mountains that ringed it some things change jonah thought then looked into boyds steady bottlegreen eyes and some dont black coffee suit you always did have a seat boyd gestured to a chair then walked over to his coffee machine hed insisted on one of his own to save himself the annoyance of buzzing an assistant every time he wanted a hit sorry i kept you waiting i had a call to finish up politics he muttered as he poured two mugs with rich black coffee cant stand them jonah said nothing but the corner of his lips quirked and no smart remarks about me being a damn politician at this stage of my game never crossed my mind jonah accepted the coffee to say it you always were a sharp kid boyd sat on a chair beside jonahs rather than behind the desk he let out a long sigh never used to think id ride a desk miss the streets every day but you do what you do then you do the next thing hows the new club its good we draw a respectable crowd lots of gold cards they need them jonah added as he sipped his coffee we hose them on the designer drinks that so and here i was thinking of bringing cilia by for an evening out you bring your wife you get drinks and dinner on the houseis that allowed boyd hesitated tapped his finger against his mug well see i have a little problem jonah i think you might be able to help me with if i can weve had a series of burglaries the last couple of months mostly high dollar easily liquidated stuff jewelry small electronics cash same area no across the board single family homes out in the burbs downtown apartments condos weve had six hits in just under eight weeks very slick very clean well what can i do for you jonah rested his mug on his knee b and e was never my thing his smile flashed according to my record i always wondered about that but boyd lifted a hand waved it away the marks are as varied as the locations of the hits young couples older couples singles but they all have one thing in common they were all at a club on the night of the burglary jonahs eyes narrowed the only change of expression one of mine in five out of the six yours jonah drank his coffee looked out the wide window at the hard blue sky the tone of his voice remained pleasant casual but his eyes had gone cold are you asking me if im involved no jonah im not asking you if youre involved weve been beyond that for a long time boyd waited a beat the boy wasalways had beentouchy or i have with a nod jonah rose he walked back to the coffeemaker set down his cup there werent many people who mattered enough to him that he cared what they thought of him boyd mattered someones using my place to scope marks he said with his back to boyd i dont like it i didnt think you would which place the new one blackhawks he nodded again higher end clientele likely a bigger disposable income than the crowd at a sports bar like fast break he turned back what do you want from me retch id like your cooperation and id like you to agree to work with the investigating team most specifically with the detective in charge jonah swore and in a rare show of agitation raked his fingers through his hair you want me to rub shoulders with cops set them loose in my place boyd didnt bother to hide his amusement jonah theyve already been in your place not while i was there of that he could be sure he could sense cop at half a mile while he was running in the other direction in the dark and had no apparently not some of us work during daylight hours why with a half laugh boyd stretched out his legs did i ever tell you i met cilia when we were both on night shift no more than twenty or thirty times same smart mouth i always liked that about you thats not what you said when you threatened to staple it shut nothing wrong with your memory either i could use your help jonah boyds voice went soft serious id appreciate it hed avoided prisons all his life jonah thought until boyd the man had built a prison around him of loyalty and trust and affection youve got itfor what its worth its worth a great deal to me he rose offered his hand to jonah again right on time he said as his phone rang get yourself some more coffee i want you to meet the detective in charge of the case he rounded the desk picked up the receiver yes paula good were ready this time he sat at the desk i have a lot of faith in this particular cop the detective shields fairly new but it was well earned a rookie detective perfect resigned jonah poured more coffee he didnt bobble the pot when the door opened but his mind jumped he supposed it was a pleasant thing to realize he could still be surprised she was a longlegged lanky blonde with eyes tike prime whiskey she wore her hair in a straight sleek tail down the middle of her back over a trim wellcut jacket the color of steel when she flicked those eyes over him her wide pretty mouth stayed serious and unsmiling jonah realized hed have noticed the face first so classy and fineboned then hed have noticed the cop the package might have been distracting but hed have made her commissioner she had a voice like her eyes deep and dark and potent detective youre prompt jonah this is you dont have to introduce her casually jonah sipped fresh coffee she has your wifes eyes and your jaw nice to meet you detective fletcher mr blackhawk shed seen him before once she recalled when her father had gone to one of his high school baseball games and shed tagged along she remembered being impressed by his gutsy nearly violent base running she also knew his history and wasnt quite as trusting of former delinquents as her father and though she hated to admit it she was a little jealous of their relationship do you want some coffee ally no sir he was her father but she didnt sit until the commissioner gestured to a chair boyd spread his hands i thought wed be more comfortable having this meeting here ally jonahs agreed to cooperate with the investigation ive given him the overview i leave it to you to fill in the necessary details six burglaries in a period of under eight weeks estimated cumulative loss in the ballpark of eight hundred thousand dollars they go for easily fenced items heavy on the jewelry however in one case a victims porsche was stolen from the garage three of the homes had security systems they were disengaged there have been no signs of breakin in each case the residence was empty at the time of the burglary jonah crossed the room sat ive already got that muchexcept for the porsche so youve got someone who can boost cars as well as lift locks and likely has a channel to turn over a variety of merchandise none of the goods have turned up through any of the known channels in denver the operations well organized and efficient we suspect there are at least two probably three or more people involved your clubs been the main source and two of your employees at blackhawks have criminal records william sloan and frances cummings jonahs eyes went cold but didnt flicker will ran numbers and did his time hes been out and clean for five years frannie worked the stroll and its her business why now she tends bar instead of johns dont you believe in rehabilitation detective fletcher i believe your club is being used as a pool to hook fish and i intend to check all the lines logic indicates someone on the insides baiting the hook i know the people who work for me he shot boyd a furious look damn it fletch jonah hear us out i dont want my people hassled because they tripped over the law at some point in their lives no ones going to hassle your people or you ally added though you did plenty of tripping of your own she thought if wed wanted to interview them we would have we dont need your permission or your cooperation to question potential suspects you move them from my people to suspects very smoothly if you believe theyre innocent why worry okay simmer down boyd stayed behind the desk rubbed the back of his neck youre in an awkward and difficult position jonah we appreciate that he said pointedly with a subtle lift of his eyebrows for his daughter the goal is to root out whoevers in charge of this organization and put an end to it theyre using you i dont want will and frannie yanked down into interrogation thats not our intention so he had a hot button ally mused friendship loyalty or maybe he had a thing going with the exhooker it would be part of the job to find out we dont want to alert anyone on the inside to the investigation we need to find out whos targeting the marks and how we want you to put a cop on the inside im on me inside he reminded her then you should be able to make room for another waitress i can start tonight jonah let out a short laugh turned to boyd you want your daughter working tables in my club ally got to her feet slowly the commissioner wants one of his detectives undercover at your club and this is my case jonah rose as well lets clear this up i dont give a damn whose case it is your father asked me to cooperate so i will is this what you want me to do he asked boyd it is for now fine she can start tonight five oclock my office at blackhawks well go over what you need to know i owe you for this jonah youll never owe me for anything he walked to the door stopped shot a glance over his shoulder oh detective waitresses at blackhawks wear black black shirt or sweater black skirt short black skirt he added then let himself out ally pursed her lips and for the first time since shed come into the room relaxed enough to slip her hands casually into her pockets i dont think i like your friend dad hell grow on you what like mold no she corrected hes too cool for that i might end up with a little skin of ice though youre sure of him as sure as i am of you and that she thought said it all whoevers set up these b and es has brains connections and guts id say your pal there has all three she lifted her shoulders still if i cant trust your judgment whose can i trust boyd grinned your mother always liked him well then im half in love already that wiped the grin off his face she noted with amusement im still going to have a couple of men under as customers thats your call its been five days since the last hit theyre working too well not to want to move again soon she strode toward the coffeepot changed her mind and strode away again they might not use his club next time its not a given we cant cover every damn club in the city so you focus your energy on blackhawk thats smart and its logical one step at a time allison i know i learned that from the best i guess the first step is to go dig up a short black skirt boyd winced as she walked to the door not too short ally had the eighttofour shift at the precinct and even if she left on the dot and sprinted the four blocks from the station to her apartment she couldnt get home before she knew shed timed it and leaving at exactly four was as rare as finding diamonds in the mud but damned if she wanted to be late for her next meeting with blackhawk it was a matter of pride and principle she slammed into her apartment at thanks to the delay of a lastminute briefing by her lieutenantand peeled off her jacket as she raced to the bedroom blackhawks was a good twenty minutes away at a brisk jogand half again that much if she attempted to drive in rush hour traffic it was only her second undercover assignment behind her detectives shield she had no intention of screwing it up she released her shoulder harness and tossed it onto the bed her apartment was simple and uncluttered mostly because she wasnt there long enough for it to be otherwise the house where shed grown up was still home the station house was second on that list of priorities and the apartment where she slept occasionally ate and even more rarely loitered was a far down third shed always wanted to be a cop she hadnt made a big deal of it it simply was her dream she yanked open her closet door and pushed through a selection of clothesdesigner dresses tailored jackets and basketball jerseysin search of a suitable black skirt if she could manage a quick change she might actually have time to slap together a sandwich or stuff a handful of cookies into her mouth before she raced out again she pulled out a skirt winced at the length when she held it up then tossed that on the bed as well to dig through her dresser for a pair of black hose if she was going to wear a skirt that barely covered her butt she would damn well cover the rest with solid opaque black tonight could be the night she thought as she stripped off her trousers she had to stay calm about it cool controlled she would use jonah blackhawk but she would not be distracted by him she knew a great deal about him through her father and shed made it her business to find out more as a kid hed had light fingers quick feet and a nimble brain she could almost admire a boy with barely twelve years under his belt whod managed to organize a sports betting syndicate almost and she supposed she could come close to admiring someone whod turned those beginnings aroundat least on the surfaceand made himself into a successful businessman the fact was shed been in his sports bar and had enjoyed the atmosphere the service and the truly superior margaritas fast break provided the place had a terrific selection of pinball machines she recalled unless someone had broken her record in the last six months her initials were still in the number one slot on double play she really should make time to get back there and defend her championship status but that was beside the point she reminded herself right now the point was jonah blackhawk maybe his feathers were ruffled because shed made it clear that two of his employees were on her short list of suspects well that was too bad her father wanted her to trust the man so shed do her best to trust him as far as she could throw him by she was dressed in blackturtleneck skirt hose she shoved through the shoes on the floor of her closet and found a suitable pair of low heels with a nod to vanity she dragged the clip out of her hair brushed it clipped it back again then she closed her eyes and tried to think like a waitress in an upscale club lipstick perfume earrings an attractive waitress made more tips and tips had to be a goal she took the time for them then studied the results in the mirror sexy she supposed certainly feminine and in a satisfactory way practical and there was no place to hide her weapon damn it she hissed out a breath and settled on stuffing her nine millimeter in an oversize shoulder bag she tossed on a black leather jacket as a concession to the brisk spring evening then bolted for the door there was enough time to drive to the club if she got straight down to the garage and hit all the lights on green she pulled open the door swore dennis what are you doing dennis overton held up a bottle of california chardonnay and offered a big cheerful smile just in the neighborhood thought we could have a drink im on my way out fine he shifted the bottle tried to take her hand ill go with you dennis she didnt want to hurt him not again hed been so devastated when shed broken things off two months before and all his phone calls popins runintos since then had ended badly weve been through all this come on ally just a couple of hours i miss you he had that sad basset hound look in his eyes that pleading smile on his lips it had worked once she reminded herself more than once but she remembered how those same eyes could blaze with wild and misplaced jealousy snap with barely controlled fury shed cared for him once enough to forgive him his accusations to try to work through his mood swings enough to feel guilty over ending it she cared enough now to strap her temper at this last invasion of her time and her space im sorry dennis im in a hurry still smiling he blocked her way give me five minutes one drink for old times sake ally i dont have five minutes the smile vanished and that old dark gleam leaped into his eyes you never had time for me when i needed it it was always what you wanted and when you wanted it thats right youre well rid of me youre going to see someone else arent you brushing me off so you can run off to be with another man what if i am enough she thought was way past enough its no business of yours where i go what i do whom i see thats what you cant seem to get straight but youre going to have to work harder at it dennis because im sick of this stop coming here he grabbed her arm before she could walk by i want to talk to you she didnt jerk free only stared down at his hand then shifted her gaze icy as february to his eyes dont push it now step back whatre you going to do shoot me arrest me call your daddy the saint of the police to lock me up im going to ask you one more time to step back step way back dennis and do it now his mood swung again fast and smooth as a revolving door im sorry ally im sorry his eyes went damp and his mouth trembled im upset mats all just give me another chance i just need another chance ill make it work this time she pried his fingers off her arm it never worked go home dennis ive got nothing for you she walked away without looking back bleeding inside because she had to bleeding inside because she could chapter ally hit the doors of blackhawk at one strike against her she thought and took an extra minute to smooth down her hair catch her breath shed decided against the drive after all and had run the ten blocks not such a distance she thought but the heels she wore were a far cry from track shoes she stepped inside took stock the bar was a long gleaming black slab that curved into a snug semicircle and offered plenty of room for a troop of chrome stools with thick black leather cushions mirrored panels of black and silver ran down the rear wall tossed back reflections and shapes comfort she decided as well as style it said sit down relax and plunk down your money there were plenty of people to do so apparently happy hour was underway and every stool was occupied those who sat at the bar or kicked back at the chrome tables drank and nibbled to the tune of recorded music kept low enough to encourage conversation most of the patrons were the suitandtie crowd with briefcases dumped at their feet the business brigade she concluded whod managed to slip out of the office a little early or were using the club as a meeting arena to discuss deals or close them two waitresses worked the tables both wore black but she noted with a hiss through her teeth that they wore slacks rather than skirts a man was working the baryoung handsome and openly flirting with the trio of women on stools at the far end she wondered when frances cummings came on shift shed need to get work schedules from blackhawk you look a little lost ally shifted her gaze and studied the man who approached her with an easy smile brown hair brown eyes trim beard fiveten maybe onefifty his dark suit was well cut his gray tie neatly knotted william sloan looked a great deal more presentable tonight than he had for his last mug shot i hope not deciding a little agitation fit the role ally shifted her shoulder bag and offered a nervous smile im allison im supposed to see mr blackhawk at five i guess im late couple of minutes dont worry about it will sloan he offered a hand gave hers a quick brotherly squeeze the man told me to keep an eye out for you ill take you up thanks great place she commented you bet the mans in charge and he wants the best ill give you a quick gothrough with a hand on her back will led her through the bar area into a wide room with more tables a twolevel stage and a dance floor silver ceilings she mused glancing up set with pinpoint lights that blinked and shimmered the tables were black squares on pedestals that rose out of a smoky silver floor with those same little lights twinkling under the surface like stars behind clouds the art was modem towering canvases splashed or streaked with wild colors odd intriguing wall sculptures fashioned from metals or textiles the tables were bare but for a slim metal cylindrical lamp with cutouts in the shape of crescent moons deco meets the third millennium she decided jonah blackhawk had built himself a very classy joint you work clubs before shed already decided how to play it and rolled her eyes nothing like this pretty fancy the man wanted class the man gets class he turned down a corridor then punched a code into a control panel watch this when a panel in the wall slid open he wiggled his eyebrows cool huh major she stepped in with him watched him reenter the code any of us whove got to do business on the second level get a code you wont have to worry about it so you new in denver no actually i grew up here no bull me too ive been hanging with the man since we were kids life sure was different then the door opened again directly into jonahs office it was a large space split into business and pleasure with an area to one side devoted to a long leather sofa in his signature color two sinkintome armchairs and a widescreen tv where a night baseball game was being battled out in silence automatically she checked the stats in the top corner of the screen yankees at home against toronto bottom of the first two out one on no score the focus on sports didnt surprise her but the floortoceiling shelves of books did she shifted her attention to the business area it appeared to be as ruthlessly efficient as the rest of the room was indulgent the workstation held a computer and phone across from it stood a monitor that showed the club area the single window was shielded with blinds and the blinds were tightly shut the carpet was cozily thick and stonegray jonah sat at the desk his back to the wall and held up a hand as he completed a call ill get back to you on that no not before tomorrow he lifted a brow as if amused by what was said to him youll just have to wait he hung up sat back in his chair hello allison thanks will no problem catch you later allison thanks a lot jonah waited until the elevator door shut youre late i know it was unavoidable she turned to the monitor giving him an opportunity to skim his gaze down her back over those long legs very nice he thought very nice indeed you have security cameras throughout the public areas i like to know whats going on in my place she just bet he did do you keep the tapes we turn them over every three days id like to see what youve got because her back was to him she allowed her gaze to slide over and check the action in yankee stadium toronto brought one home on a line drive bullet itll help to study the tapes for that youll need a warrant she glanced back over her shoulder hed changed into a suitblack and to her expert eye of italian cut i thought youd agreed to cooperate to a point youre here arent you his phone rang and was ignored why dont you sit down well work out a game plan the game plans simple and she didnt sit i pose as a waitress talk to customers and staff i keep my eyes open and do my job you keep out of my way and do yours wrong plan i dont have to keep out of anyones way in my place now ever worked a club no ever waited tables no his cool patient look irked whats the big deal you take the order you put in the order you serve the order im not a moron he smiled now mat quick powerful strike i imagine it seems that way when youve spent your life on the other side of it youre about to get an education detective head waitress on your shift is beth shell help train you until youve got a handle on it youll bus tables that means i know what busing tables involves fine ive put you on six to two you get a fifteen minute break every two hours no drinking during shift any of the customers get overly friendly or out of line you report to me or to will i can handle myself youre not a cop here somebody puts hands on you in an inappropriate way you report to me or to will you get a lot of that only from the women they cant keep their hands off me haha out of the corner of his eye he noted the yankees ended the inning on a strikeout no we dont get a lot of it but it happens some guys cross lines when they drink they only cross them in my place once the crowd starts getting thick after eight entertainment starts at nine youll be busy he got to his feet walked to her walked around her youve got a nice cover over the cop in you you have to look hard to see it i like the skirt she waited until hed come around and they were facetoface ill need work schedules for all employees or do i need a warrant no i can help you out there he liked the scent of her cool and clearly female ill have printouts for you by closing anyone i hire who i dont know personallyand even some i dogoes through a full background check not everyone heres been lucky enough to come from a nice tidy family and live a nice tidy life jonah picked up a remote switched the angle of the cameras so the bar area popped on screen kid just coming off shift at the bar grew up with his grandparents when his mother ran off got into a little trouble when he was fifteen and what kind of trouble was that got tagged with a joint in his pocket he straightened out they sealed the records but he was upfront with me when he wanted the job hes putting himself through night school at the moment she wasnt interested in the young man going off shift at the bar she kept her eyes on jonah is everyone upfront with you the smart ones are thats beth he tapped the screen ally saw a little brunette about thirty come in through a door behind the bar bastard she was married to used to kick her around she cant weigh a hundred pounds shes got three kids at home sixteen twelve and ten shes been working for me on and off about five years used to come in every couple weeks with a black eye or split lip she took the kids and left him two years ago is he leaving her alone jonah shifted his gaze to allys he was persuaded to relocate i see and she did jonah blackhawk looked after his own she couldnt fault him for it did he relocate in one piece mostly ill take you down you can leave your bag up here if you want no thanks he pushed the button for the elevator i assume youve got your gun in there keep it in there theres a secure employee area off the bar you can lock it up in there this shift beth and frannie have keys will and i have keys or codes for all areas at all times tight ship blackhawk thats right whats the cover he asked as they stepped into the elevator howd i meet you i needed a job you gave me a job she shrugged keep it simple i caught you at your sports bar know anything about sports she sent him a smile anything that takes place off a field a court or outside an arena is just marking time where have you been all my life he took her arm as they stepped out on the main floor so jays or yankees yankees have stronger bats this season and rule the long ball but their gloves are sloppy the jays chip away with reliable base hits and their infields a ballet of guts and efficiency i go for guts and efficiency over the power stroke every time is that a baseball statement or a life statement blackhawk baseball is life now youve done it we have to get married my hearts all aflutter she said dryly and turned to scan the bar area the noise level had bumped up several notches they were two and three deep at the curved black slab now the after work before dinner crowd for some it was unwind time she thought for others a casual mating ritual but for someone it was a hunt people were so careless she mused she saw men leaning on the bar back pockets ripe for picking more than one handbag hung vulnerable on the back of a stool or chair coats and jackets some likely to have car or house keys in their pockets were tossed aside nobody ever thinks it can happen to them ally murmured then tapped jonahs arm inclined her head check out the guy at the barsix down with the newsanchor hair and teeth amused jonah tagged the guy from allys description and watched him flash his wallet choked with bills and credit cards hes trying to lure the redhead there or her pretty blond friend doesnt matter which odds are he hits with the blonde jonah concluded why call it a hunch he looked down at ally wanna bet you dont have a license for gambling on the premises as she watched the blonde sidled over and batted her lashes at the man with the wallet good call it was easy and sos the blonde he steered ally back toward the club area where beth and will huddled over the reservation book at a black podium hey boss beth plucked the pencil out of her thick curls and made a note in the book looks like were turning most tables over twice tonight big dinner crowd for midweek good thing i brought you some help beth dickerman allison fletcher she needs training ah another victim beth shot out a hand nice to meet you allison ally thanks you show her the ropes beth shell bus tables until you figure she can wait them well whip her into shape come on with me ally ill get you set up got any experience in food services she asked as she plowed through the crowd well i eat beth let out a bright cackle of a laugh welcome to my world frannie this is ally new waitress in training frannies captain of the bar here nice to meetcha frannie called out flipped a smile dumping ice into a blender with one hand and shooting soda into a glass with the other and that gorgeous specimen down the other end of the bars pete the big shouldered black man sent them a wink as he measured kahlua into a short glass now no flirting with pete cause hes my man and nobody elses that right pete youre the one for me sugar lips with another laugh beth unlocked a door marked employees only petes got a beautiful wife and a baby on the way we just tease now if you need to get in here for any reasonhey jan hey beth the curvy brunette on the other side of the door had her waistlength hair pulled back with combs from a lovely heartshaped face ally gauged her as midtwenties and a fashion plate shed gone for a skirt the approximate size of a table napkin and a clingy shirt with small silver buttons silver winked at her wrists ears and throat as she freshened her lipstick in a mirror this is ally fresh meat oh yeah the smile when she turned was friendly enough but there was a measuring gleam in her eye one female sizing up another and the competition jan works the bar area beth explained but shell pinch hit in the club if we need her there was a wild burst of laughter from outside the door tomtoms are beating i better get out there jan tied a short manypocketed black apron at her waist good luck ally and welcome aboard thanks everybodys so friendly ally said to beth when jan strolled out you get to be kind of a family when you work for jonah hes a good boss she pulled an apron out of a closet you work your butt off for him but he lets you know he notices and that he appreciates makes a difference here youll need this have you worked for him long about six years give or take i handled tables at fast break his sports bar and when he opened the club here he asked me if i wanted to switch its a classy place and closer to home you can leave your purse in here she opened a narrow locker you reset the combination by spinning around zero twice great ally set her purse inside palming her beeper out of it and hooking it on the waist of her skirt under the apron she shut the locker set the combination i guess thats it you want to freshen up or anything no im fine a little nervous i guess dont worry in a few hours your feet are going to ache so bad you wont think about nerves beth was right about the feet anyway by ten ally felt shed hiked twenty miles in the wrong shoes and lifted approximately three tons of trays loaded with dirty dishes she could have marched the trail from table to kitchen in her sleep the live band was considerably louder than the recorded music that had played until just after nine the crowd shouted above it crammed the dance floor and jammed together at the tables ally piled dishes on trays and watched the crowd there were plenty of designer clothes expensive watches cell phones and leather briefcases she saw a woman flash a lightning bolt diamond engagement ring for three friends plenty of money here she noted and plenty of marks hefting the loaded tray she headed off for the kitchen detouring toward an attractive couple when the man signaled her sweetheart can you get me and my lovely companion a refill here she leaned closer pasted on her sweetest smile and made a quiet and crude suggestion the man only grinned cops have such filthy mouths next case im going to be the one sitting on my butt hickman while you work out ally replied see anything i should know about nothings popped yet he grabbed the hand of the woman sitting next to him but carson and i are in love lydia carson gave hickmans hand a vicious squeeze in your dreams just keep your eyes open she aimed a stare at hickmans glass and that better be club soda shes so strict she heard hickman murmur as she walked away beth table ah sixteens looking for a refill im on it youre doing good ally go dump those and take your break you dont have to tell me twice the kitchen was a madhouse full of noise and shouted orders and heat gratefully ally set down her tray then lifted her eyebrows as she spotted frannie slipping out the back door ally stalled for ten seconds then followed frannie was already leaning against the outside wall and taking her first drag from a cigarette she blew out smoke with a long relieved sigh break time yeah i thought id grab some air zoo in there tonight blackhawks really packs them in she pulled the cigarettes out of her pocket offered them no thanks i dont smoke good for you i cant kick it no smoking in the employee lounge jonah gives me a break and lets me use his office if the weathers lousy so hows your first night my feet are killing me occupational hazard first paycheck you buy yourself one of those bubbling footbath things put some eucalyptus in it and go straight to heaven ill do that an attractive woman ally noted though the lines around frannies eyes made her look older than twentyeight she kept her dark red hair cut short and the makeup subtle her nails were short and unpainted her hands ringless like the rest of the staff she wore black and finished off the simple shirt and slacks with sturdy yet trendy black shoes the only touch of flash was the silver hoops that swung at her ears howd you get into tending bar ally asked her frannie hesitated then puffed on her cigarette i guess i hung out at bars a lot and when there came a time i was looking for what you could call gainful employment jonah asked me if i wanted a job trained me over at fast break its good work you need a decent memory and people skills you interested id better see if i make it through one shift busing before i start raising my sights you look like you can handle whatever comes along ally smiled into frannies considering eyes you think so observations one of those people skills and on short observation you dont strike me as the type who expects to make waiting tables her lifes work gotta start somewhere and paying the rents a priority dont i know it though frannie had already calculated that allys shoes equaled half a months rent on her own apartment well if you want to climb the ladder jonahs the one to give you a boost youd have figured that frannie dropped the cigarette crushed out the butt gotta get back pete pouts if i go over break the exhooker ally decided was proprietary when it came to jonah they were probably lovers she thought as she went back inside when you factored in his defensive attitude toward her it added up as lover as trusted employee frannie was in a prime position to cull out marks to pass the information along the bar faced the entrance whoever went in or out passed by her station people handed her credit cards and the name and account number led to addresses it would pay to look at her most closely jonah was doing his own looking from his office from the floor he knew enough about cons short and long to calculate who the targets might be he pegged three possibilities that would have topped his list if hed been running the game and since hed also spotted the cops at table sixteen he wandered over everything all right tonight the woman beamed up at him swept back her short swing of streaky blond hair with one hand everythings terrific its the first night on the town bob and i have managed in weeks with work keeping both of us so busy im glad you picked my place jonah laid a friendly hand on bobs shoulder leaned down next time ditch the cop shoes dead giveaway enjoy your evening he thought he heard the woman snort out a laugh as he walked away he headed for the table ally was busy cleaning how you holding up i havent broken any of your dishes yet and now you want a raise im going to stick with my day job thanks all the same id rather clean up the streets than tables absently she pressed a hand to the ache in the small of her back we go back to bar food at eleven so the busing slows down hallelujah he laid a hand on her arm before she could lift the tray you comer frannie outside excuse me she went out you went out she came in you came in im doing my job however i resisted shining a light in her eyes and smacking her in the face with my rubber hose now let me get on with it she hefted the tray shoved past him by the way allison she stopped a snarl working up her throat what the power ball trounced your guts and efficiency eight to two one game doesnt a season make she jerked up her chin and strode off on her way by the dance floor a man reached out and gave her butt a hopeful pat as jonah watched she stopped dead in her tracks turned slowly and gave him one long icy look the man stepped back lifted his hands in apology and quickly melted into the dancers handles herself beth said from beside him yeah yeah she does pulls her weight too and doesnt whine about it i like your girlfriend jonah he was too surprised to comment and only stared when beth hustled away he let out a short laugh and shook his head oh that one had slipped by him right on by him last call was enough to make ally all but weep with gratitude shed been on her feet since eight that morning her fondest wish was to go home fall into bed and sleep for the precious five hours she had before starting it all over again go on home beth ordered well go over closing tomorrow night you did fine thanks i mean it will let ally into the lounge will you no problem nice crowd tonight nothing i like better than a crowded club want a drink before you head out not unless i can stick my feet in it he chuckled patted her back frannie pour me one will you already on it i like a brandy at the end of a shift one glass of the good stuff you change your mind he said as he unlocked the door just pull up a stool the man he doesnt charge employees for an end of shift drink he went off whistling through his teeth ally shoved her apron into her locker pulled out her bag and jacket she was just putting the jacket on when jan breezed in heading out you look beat me im just hitting stride this time of night my stride hit me about an hour ago ally paused at the door dont your feet hurt nan i got arches of steel and most guys tip better if you walk around on skinny heels she bent to run a hand up her leg i believe in using what works yeah well good night ally stepped out of the lounge shutting the door behind her and bumped solidly into jonah whered you park he asked her i didnt i walked ran she remembered but it came to the same thing ill drive you home i can walk its not far its two in the morning a block is too far for heavens sake blackhawk im a cop so naturally bullets bounce off you before she could argue he caught her chin in his hand the gesture the firm grip of his fingers shocked her to silence youre not a cop at the moment he murmured youre a female employee and the daughter of a friend ill drive you home fine dandy my feet hurt anyway she started to shove his hand away but he beat her to it and shifted his grip to her arm night boss beth called out grinning at them as they passed get that girl off her feet thats my plan later will night frannie suspicion was buzzing in allys brain as will lifted his brandy snifter and frannie watched her with quiet and serious eyes what was that ally demanded when they stepped out in the cool air what exactly was that that was me saying goodnight to friends and employees im parked across the street excuse me my feet have gone numb not my brain you gave those people the very distinct impression that we have a thing here thats right i didnt consider it either until beth made some remark earlier it simplifies things she stopped beside a sleek black jaguar just how do you figure that having people think theres a personal thing between us simplifies anything and you call yourself a detective he unlocked the passenger door opened it youre a beautiful blonde with legs up to your ears i hire you out of the blue when you have basically no experience the first assumption from people who know me is im attracted to you the second would be youre attracted to me add all those together and you end up with romance or at least sex are you going to get in you havent explained how those deductions equal simple if people think were involved they wont think twice if i give you a little leeway if you come up to my office theyll be friendlier ally said nothing while she let it run through her head then she nodded all right theres an advantage to it going with impulse he shifted boxed her in between his body and the car door there was a light breeze just enough to stir her scent there was a threequarter moon bright enough to sprinkle silver into her eyes the moment he decided seemed to call for it could be more than one advantage to it the thrill that sprinted straight up her spine irritated her oh youre going to want to step back blackhawk berns at the window of the bar and shes got a romantic heart despite everything thats happened to her shes hoping for a moment here a long slow kiss the kind that slides over melting sighs and heats the blood his hands came to her hips as he spoke rode up to just under her breasts her mouth went dry and the ache in her belly was a wide stretch of longing youre going to have to disappoint her jonah skimmed his gaze down to her mouth shes not the only one but he released her stepped back dont worry detective i never hit on cops or daughters of friends then i guess ive got a double shield against your wild and irresistible charms good thing for both of us because i sure as hell like the look of you you getting in yeah im getting in she got into the car and waited until the door shut before letting out the long painful breath shed been holding wherever that spurt of lust inside her had come from it would just have to go away again cool off she ordered herself but her heart was bumping madly against her rib cage cool off and focus on the job jonah slid in beside her annoyed that his pulse wasnt quite steady where to when she rattled off the address he shoved the key into the ignition and aimed one hot look at her thats a damn mile why the hell did you walk because it was rush hour its quicker and its ten blocks thats just stupid she had a response for that the venom of it scalded her tongue as she rounded on him she didnt even recognize the vibration of her beeper for several seconds mistaking it for the vibration of rage she yanked it from her skirt checked the number damn it damn it from her purse she pulled out her cell phone and quickly dialed detective fletcher yeah i got it im on my way calming herself she shoved the phone back into her purse since youre determined to play cab driver lets get going ive got another b and e give me the address just take me home so i can get my car give me the address allison why waste time chapter jonah dropped her off in front of an attractive ranchstyle home in an upscale development convenient to the freeway in reasonable traffic the commute to downtown would take under twenty minutes the chamberses ally discovered were an attractive upscale couple both lawyers in their early thirties childless professionals who spent their comfortable income on the good life wine wardrobe jewelry art and music they got my diamond earrings and my cartier tank watch maggie chambers rubbed her eyes as she sat in what was left of her sprawling great room we havent gone through everything but there were dali and picasso lithographs on that wall there and in that niche there was an erte sculpture we bought at an auction two years ago joe collected cuff links i dont know how many pairs he had offhand but he had diamond ones and ruby for his birthstone and several antique pair theyre insured her husband reached out to take her hand squeeze it it doesnt matter its not the same those thugs were in our house in our house joe and theyve taken our things damn it they stole my car my brandnew bmw and it didnt have five thousand miles on it i loved that stupid car mrs chambers i know its hard maggie chambers whipped her gaze toward ally have you ever been robbed detective no ally set her notebook on her knee a moment but ive worked plenty of burglaries robberies muggings its not the same maggie shes just doing her job i know im sorry i know she covered her face with her hands drew air in slowly let it out ive got the shakes thats all i dont want to stay here tonight we dont have to well go to a hotel how much more do you need detective was it fletcher yes just a few more questions you said both of you were out all evening yeah maggie won a case today and we decided to go out and celebrate shes been piled under for more than a month we went to the starfire club with some friends as he spoke he rubbed soothing circles over his wifes back drinks dinner a little dancing like we told the other policeman we didnt get home until nearly two does anyone other than the two of you have a key our housekeeper would she also have the security code sure joe started to speak then blinked stuttered oh listen carols been cleaning for us for nearly ten years shes practically family its just procedure mr chambers could i have her full name and address for the record she took them through the entire evening looking for a connection a contact anything mat struck a chord but for the chamberses it had been nothing more than an entertaining evening out until theyd walked back in their own front door when ally left them she had a partial list of stolen items with a promise for the complete as well as the insurance information the crime scene unit was still working but shed gone over the scene herself she didnt expect the miracle of fingerprints or dropped clues the moon had set but the stars were out and brilliant the wind had picked up to dance down the street in little whirls and gusts the neighborhood was hushed the houses dark those who lived here had long since been tucked in for the night she doubted the canvass was going to turn up any handy eyewitnesses jonah was leaning against the hood of his car drinking what appeared to be a cup of takeout coffee with one of the uniforms when she approached the car jonah held out the half cup he had left thanks you can have a whole one theres a twentyfourhour place a few blocks down this is fine she replied taking the cup officer you and your partner were first on scene yes maam ill need your report on my desk by eleven hundred with a brisk nod the officer headed for his car ally sipped the coffee then turned to jonah and handed him the cup you didnt have to wait i can get a ride home in one of the radio cars i have a stake here he opened the car door were they at my place now why would you ask me when we both know you just got finished pumping that uniform hey i bought the coffee he handed it back to her then walked around to the drivers side so the perps picked their marks at the starfire tonight have they hit there before no youre still the only repeater theyll come back to you she shut her exhausted eyes its just a matter of time well that makes me feel lots better what kind of take did they get bmw roadster out of the garage some art high end electronics and heavy on the jewelry dont these people have safes these did a small one in the walkin closet of the master suite of course they had the combination for it written down on a piece of paper in the desk thatll discourage the criminal element they had a security system which they swear they engaged when they leftthough the wife didnt look quite so sure of that anyway the point is they felt secure nice house nice neighborhood people get sloppy eyes still closed she circled her head cracking out the tension theyre both lawyers well hell then what do we care she was tired enough to laugh watch it ace my aunts district attorney in urbana you going to drink that coffee or just hold onto it what oh no here i dont want anymore itll just keep me awake he doubted a tanker truck of coffee could keep her awake much longer her voice was going thick adding he thought to the inthegut sexiness of it fatigue had her unguarded enough to tilt her face toward him as she tried to find a comfortable resting spot her eyes were shut her lips soft and just parted he had a feeling he knew exactly how theyd taste warm and soft ripe with sleep at a stop sign he put the car in neutral engaged the emergency break then leaned over her to press the mechanism that lowered her seatback she jerked up rapped her head smartly against his even as he swore she slapped a hand on his chest back off relax fletcher im not jumping you i like my women awake when we make love im putting your seat back if youre going to sleep you might as well get as close to horizontal as we can manage im all right mortified but all right she thought i wasnt sleeping he put a hand on her forehead shoved her back shut up allison i wasnt sleeping i was thinking think tomorrow youre braindead he glanced over at her as he started to drive again how many hours have you been on duty thats math i cant do math if im braindead she gave up and yawned im on eight to fours its closing in on am that gives you twenty hours why dont you put in for night shift until this is over or do you have a death wish its not my only case shed already decided to talk to her lieutenant she couldnt give her best to the job on a couple of hours sleep a night but it wasnt any of jonahs business how she ran her life i guess denvers not safe without you on the job she might have been tired but she still had a pretty good ear for sarcasm thats right blackhawk without my watchful eye the citys in chaos its a heavy burden but well somebodys got to shoulder it just pull up at the corner my buildings only a half a block down he ignored her drove through the light and pulled smoothly to the curb in front of her building okay thanks she reached down to retrieve her bag from the floor he was already out of the car skirting around the hood maybe it was fatigue that had her reacting so slowly as if she were moving through syrup instead of air but he had the outside handle of the door seconds before she had the inside handle for about five seconds they battled for control then with a halfhearted snarl ally let him open the door for her what are you from another century do i look incapable of operating the complex mechanism of a car door no you look tired well i am so good night ill walk you up get a grip but he fell into step beside her and damn him reached the door one pace ahead of her saying nothing merely watching her with those impossibly clear green eyes he held it open for her ill have to curtsy in a minute she muttered under her breath he grinned at her back then crossed to the lobby elevators with her sliding his hands into his pockets i can make it from here ill take you to your door its not a damn date lack of sleeps making you irritable he stepped into the elevator with her no wait youre always irritable my mistake i dont like you she jabbed the button for the fourth floor thank god you cleared that up i was afraid you were falling for me the movement of the elevator tipped her already shaky balance she swayed and he closed a hand over her arm cut it out no she jerked at her arm he tightened his grip dont embarrass yourself fletcher youre asleep on your feet whats your apartment number he was right and it was stupid to pretend otherwise and foolish to take it out on him fourohnine let me go will you ill be all right after a couple hours sleep i dont doubt it but he held onto her when the elevator opened youre not coming in well there go my plans to toss you over my shoulder dump you in bed and have my wicked way with you next time key what her burnthoney eyes were blurry the delicate skin beneath them bruised the wave of tenderness that swept inside him was a complete surprise and far from comfortable honey give me your key oh im punchy she dug it out of her jacket pocket and dont call me honey i meant detective honey he heard her snicker as he unlocked her door he pulled the key back out of the lock took her hand dropped it in and closed her fingers around it good night yeah thanks for the lift because it seemed the thing to do she closed the door in his face hell of a face she thought as she stumbled toward the bedroom face that dangerous ought to be registered as a weapon a woman who trusted a face like that got exactly what she deserved and probably enjoyed every minute of it ally stripped off her jacket whimpering a little as she pried off her shoes she set her alarm then fell facedown and folly clothed on the bed and was instantly asleep four and a half hours later she was finishing up her morning meeting in the conference room at her station house and her fourth cup of coffee well canvass the neighborhood ally said we could get lucky in that kind of development people tend to look out for each other some sort of vehicle was necessary to get the perpetrators to the chamberses and to transport at least some of the stolen goods the sports car they boosted wouldnt hold that much we have a full description of the car and the apbs out on it lieutenant kiniki nodded he was a toughly built man in his midforties who enjoyed the way command sat on his shoulders the starfires a new pool for them i want two men over there to check out the setup soft clothes he added indicating he wanted his detectives to dress casually rather than in suit jackets lets keep it lowkey hickman and carson are canvassing pawn shops pressuring known fences ally glanced toward her two associates nothing there hickman lifted his hands lydia and ive got a couple of good sources and weve put the heat on nobody knows anything my take is that whoevers running this has an outside channel keep the heat on kiniki ordered what about the insurance angle it doesnt play out ally told him weve got nine hits and five different insurance companies were still trying to find a connection but so far thats a dead end weve got no common links between the victims that carry through she went on out of the nine weve got four different banks three different brokerage houses nine different doctors nine different places of employment she rubbed the ache at the back of her neck and went down her list two of the women go to the same hair salondifferent operators different schedules they use different cleaning services different mechanics now two of the targets used the same caterer in the last six months and were running that but it doesnt look like a hook the only common link so far is a night on the town give me the rundown on blackhawks kiniki ordered the place does a hell of a business ally began pulls in a big crowd and the crowd varies though its heavy on the upwardly mobile couples singles on the prowl groups hes got good security absently ally rubbed her eyes then remembered herself and lowered them hes got cameras and im working on getting the security tapes sloan is the floater he works the public areas has access to everything there are six tables in the bar area and thirtytwo in the club people push them together if they get friendly theres a coat check but not everybody bothers with it i couldnt count the number of handbags left on tables when the dancing started people mill lydia added especially the younger customers its a regular meeting ground for them and they tend to table hop lots of sex vibes she gave hickman a bland look when he chortled its a sexy place people get careless when their bloods hot theres a ripple when blackhawk comes through a ripple hickman repeated is that a technical term the women watch him they dont watch their bags thats accurate ally walked over to the board where the list of victims and stolen items were posted every hit involved a woman there are no single men on the list the females the prime target whats a woman carry in her purse that hickman said is one of lifes most complex mysteries her keys ally continued her walletwith id credit cards pictures of her kids if she has them none of the victims had children at home if we break this down to its basic element were looking first for a pickpocket somebody with good fingers who can get what he needs out of a bag then put it back before the victim knows shes been hit do an imprint of the key make a copy if you pick the pocket why put the stuff back hickman asked keep the victim unaware buy more time a woman goes into the bathroom she takes her purse if she reaches in for her lipstick and doesnt find her wallet shes going to send up an alarm this way the house is hit and the perpetrators are out before the victims get home whatever time they get home she turned back to the board twelvethirty onefifteen twelveten and so on somebody at the club alerts the burglars when the victims call for their check somebodys on the inside or a regular and repeat customer at blackhawks the average time between calling for the check and leaving the club was about twenty minutes we have two other clubs involved now besides blackhawks kinikis brow furrowed well need stakeouts on all of them yes sir but blackhawks is where theyll come back thats the money tree find a way to cut down the tree fletcher he got to his feet and take some personal time today get some sleep she took him up on it and curled up on the small sofa in the coffee room leaving word that she was to be notified when the reports she was waiting for came in she got ninety minutes and felt very close to human when hickman shook her shoulder did you steal my cheese bagel what she pushed herself up shoved back her hair you like cheese bagels i had one its gone im detecting shaking off sleep she dug her clip out of her pocket and pulled back her hair it didnt have your name on it did too she circled her shoulders is your name pineview bakery besides i only ate half of it she checked her watch the first on scenes reports in yet yeah and sos your warrant great she swung to her feet adjusted her weapon harness ill be in the field i want a cheese bagel back in that box by end of shift i only ate half of it she called out and stopped by her desk for the paperwork scanning it ignoring the backwash of noise from the detectives bullpen she hitched her harness into a more comfortable position then shrugged into her jacket she glanced up when the noise became a murmur and watched her father walk in like blackhawk she thought this was a man who created ripples she knew a few of her fellow officers harbored some resentment over her rapid rise to detective there were mutters now and then just loud enough for her to hear about favoritism and oiling the ranks shed earned her badge and knew it ally was too proud of her father and too secure in her own abilities to let mutters worry her commissioner detective got a minute a couple she pulled her shoulder bag from her bottom desk drawer can we walk and talk im on my way out got a warrant to serve on jonah blackhawk ah he stepped back to let her pass and his eyes scanned the room if there were any mutters they would wait until he was well out of range stairs okay with you she asked i didnt have time to work out this morning i think i can keep up with you whats the warrant to confiscate and view blackhawks security tapes he got pissy about it yesterday i seem to put his back up boyd pushed open the door to the stairwell men angled his head to study his daughters back as she passed through i seem to detect a few ruffled feathers on yours okay good eye we put each others backs up i figured you would you both like to do things your own way why would i want to do them someone elses way exactly boyd skimmed a hand down the long sleek tail of her hair his little girl had always had a mind of her own and a very hard head around it speaking of ruffled feathers i have a meeting with the mayor in an hour better you than me ally said cheerfully as she jogged down the stairs what can you tell me about last nights breakin same mo they hit a real treasure trove with the chamberses mrs chambers got me the loss list this morning the womans efficient they were fully insuredvalue of stolen items comes to a solid two hundred and twentyfive thousand thats the biggest haul so far yeah im hoping it makes them cocky they took some art this time i dont know if it was dumb luck or somebody knew what they had when they saw it they have to have somewhere to keep the goods before they turn them big enough for a car a decent chop shop could have a car dismantled and turned in a couple hours yeah but she started to push open the next door herself but her father beat her to it it reminded her oddly and not entirely happily of jonah but he prompted as they crossed the lobby i dont think thats the route somebody likes nice things somebody has really good taste at the second hit they took a collection of rare books but they left an antique clock it was appraised at five thousand but it was dead ugly its like they said please dont insult us thereve been other cars at other scenes but theyve only taken two cool cars burglars with standards yeah i think so when they stepped outside she blinked against the brilliant sunlight until she pulled out her shaded glasses and a kind of arrogance arrogance is a mistake thats going to turn it my way i hope so the pressures on ally he walked her to her car opened the door for her in a way that made her frown and mink of jonah again were getting press the kind that makes the mayor uncomfortable in my best judgment they wont wait more than a week theyre rolling now theyll come back to blackhawks they got a bigger slice of pie from the new place blackhawks is reliable once i spend a few nights under there ill start recognizing faces ill pin him dad i believe it he bent down to kiss her cheek and ill handle the mayor i believe it she slid behind the wheel question ask it youve known jonah blackhawk for what like fifteen years seventeen how come you never had him over to the house you know for dinner or football afternoons or one of your world favorite cookouts he wouldnt come always acknowledged the invitation thanked me and said he was busy seventeen years idly she tapped her fingers on the steering wheel thats a lot of busy well some people dont like socializing with cops some people boyd told her draw lines and never believe they have the right to cross them hed meet me at the station house the memory made boyd grin he didnt like it but hed do it hed meet me for coffee or a beer at the gym but hed never come to my home hed consider that crossing the line ive never convinced him otherwise funny he strikes me as being a man who considers himself good enough for anything or anyone there are a lot of twists and pockets in jonah and very little about him thats simple chapter she called ahead and had to admit she was surprised when jonah answered the phone in his office its fletcher i didnt think you were much on daylight hours im not some days are exceptions what can i do for you detective you can come downstairs and let me in ill be there in ten minutes im not going anywhere he waited a beat so what are you wearing she hated herself for laughing and hoped she managed to smother most of it my badge she told him and flicked the phone off jonah hung up sat back and entertained himself by imagining allison fletcher wearing her badge and nothing else the image came through entirely too clear entirely too appealing and had him shoving back from the desk he had no business imagining boyds daughter naked no business he reminded himself fantasizing about boyds daughter in any way whatsoever or wondering how her mouth would taste or what scent hed find on the flesh just under the line of that very stubborn jaw god he wanted to sink his teeth there right there just once forbidden fruit he told himself and paced since there was no one to see she was forbidden fruit and therefore all the more alluring she wasnt even his type maybe he liked leggy blondes maybe he liked leggy blondes with brains and a strong backbone but he preferred friendlier women friendlier unarmed women he thought amusing himself he hadnt been able to get her out of his head and the clearest most compelling picture had been the yielding and temporary he was certain fragility of her when shed fallen asleep in his car well hed always been a sucker for the needy he reminded himself as he pulled up the blinds on his office window which should solve his problem over allison despite that short interlude of vulnerability early that morning needy was one thing the gorgeous detective wasnt she had a use for him again temporary and when the job was done theyd both go back to their separate corners in their separate worlds and that would be the end of that he saw her pull up in front of the club at least shed had the sense to drive he noted and wasnt hiking all over denver today he took his time going down to let her in good morning detective he looked around her studied the flashy lines of the classic redandwhite stingray nice car is that the new police issue oh wait what was i thinking your daddys loaded if you think you can razz me over a car youre going to be disappointed nobody razzes like a precinct full of cops ill practice nice threads he commented and rubbed the lapel of her subtly patterned brown jacket between his thumb and forefinger very nice so we both like italian designers we can compare wardrobes later because he knew it would irritate her because he enjoyed the way the gold highlighted her eyes when he irritated her he shifted blocking her before she could step inside let me see the badge come off it blackhawk no lets see it eyes narrowed behind her sunglasses she pulled her badge out of her pocket pushed it close to his face see it yes badge number ill buy myself a lottery ticket and play your numbers heres something else you might want to look at she took out the warrant held it up fast work hed expected no less come on up ive been reviewing the tapes you look rested he said as they walked to his elevator i am any progress the investigation is ongoing hmm policy line he gestured her into the elevator we seem to be spending a lot of time in these close quarters you could do your heart a favor and take the stairs my hearts never caused me any problems how about yours whole and healthy thanks she walked out when the doors opened wow you actually let the sunlight in here im shocked lets have the tapes ill give a receipt she wasnt wearing perfume today he noted just soap and skin odd how erotic that simplicity could be in a hurry clocks ticking he strolled into an adjoining room after a small internal battle ally walked over to the doorway it was a small bedroom small she noted because it was twothirds bed a black pool of bed unframed and on a raised platform curious she looked up and was mildly disappointed there wasnt a mirror on the ceiling it would be too obvious jonah told her when her gaze skimmed back to his the beds already a statement an obvious one but not vain hmm to amuse herself she poked around the room on the walls were a number of framed blackandwhite photographs arty interesting and all stark or shadowy night scenes she recognized a couple of the artists pursed her lips so the man had a good eye for art and decent taste she admitted ive got this print she tapped a finger against a study of an ancient man in a ragged straw hat sleeping on a cracked concrete stoop a paper bag still clutched in his hand shade colby i like his work so do i and his wifes bryan mitchell thats one of hers beside it the old couple holding hands on the bench at the bus stop quite a contrast despair and hope lifes full of both apparently she wandered there was a closet closed an exit door securely locked and what she assumed was a bath or washroom just beyond she thought of the sex vibes lydia carson had referred to oh yeah this room had plenty of them it all but smoked with them so whats through there she jerked a thumb at another door instead of answering he gestured inviting her to see for herself she opened the door let out a long sigh of pleasure now were talking the fully equipped gym was a great deal more appealing to her than a lakesize bed he watched as she trailed her fingers over machines picked up free weights doing a few absent curls as she roamed very telling he thought that shed given the bed a sneer and was all but dewyeyed over his nautilus you got a sauna envy curled inside her as she pressed her nose to a little window of a wooden door and peered into the room beyond want to try it out she turned her head enough to slide her gaze in his direction and the sneer was back this is pretty elaborate when you could be at a fullservice health club in two minutes health clubs have membersthats the first strike they also have regular hours strike two and i dont like using someone elses equipment strike three youre a very particular man blackhawk thats right he took a bottle of water out of a clearfronted bar fridge want one no she replaced the free weight moved back to the doorway well thanks for the tour now the tapes blackhawk yeah clocks ticking he unscrewed the top of the bottle took a casual sip you know what i like about night work detective fletcher she looked deliberately toward the bed then back at him oh i think i can figure it out well theres that but what i really like about night work is that its always whatever time you want it to be my favorites the three oclock hour for most people thats the hard time if they dont sleep through it thats the time the mind wakes up and starts worrying about what they did or didnt do that day or what theyll do or not do the next and the next and right up until lifes over and you dont worry about yesterday or tomorrow you miss a lot of the now doing that theres only so much now to go around i dont have a lot of the now to stand around philosophizing with you take a minute he crossed to her leaning on one jamb as she leaned on the other a lot of people who come into my place are night peopleor those who want to remember when they were most have jobs now the kind of jobs that pay well and make them responsible citizens she took the water bottle from his hand drank your job pays well he grinned that quick jab was just one of the things that attracted him to her you saying im not a responsible citizen my lawyers and accountants would disagree however my point is that people come in here to forget about then responsibilities for a while to forget the clocks ticking and they have to punch in at am i give them a place without clocksat least till last call and this means she passed the bottle back to him forget about the facts a minute look at the shadows youre hunting night people and he was one of them she thought very much one of the night people with his black mane of hair and cool cats eyes im not arguing with that but are you thinking like them theyve picked their prey and when they move they move fast it would be less risky give them more time to study the lay of the land if they waited to make the hit during the day stake out the mark learn their patternswhen do they leave for the office when do they get back these guys could probably nail it down in a couple of days he lifted the bottle drank that would be more efficient why dont they play it that way because theyre arrogant yeah but thats only the top layer go down they like the kick the rush exactly theyre hungry and they like the thrill of working in the dark it irked almost as much as it intrigued her that his thought process so closely followed her own you think that hasnt occurred to me before i figure it has but i wonder if youve factored in that people who live at night are always more dangerous than people who live during the day does that include you damn right so warned she started to turn away then stopped stared down at the hand hed shot out to grip her arm whats your problem blackhawk i havent figured it out yet why didnt you send a uniform over here to pick up the tapes because its my case no no its not my case no thats not the reason im crowding you he edged forward to prove it why havent you decked me i dont make a habit of punching out civilians she angled her chin when he nudged her back against the doorjamb but i can make an exception your pulse is jumping it tends to when im irritated aroused shed nearly said aroused because that was the word that came into her head that was the sensation sliding through her body and enough was enough she shifted a smooth move that should have planted her elbow in his gut and moved him aside but he countered just as smoothly and changed his grip so mat his fingers wrapped tight around her wrist instinctively she pivoted started to hook her foot behind his to take him down he adjusted his weight used it to plaster her back against the door she told herself it was annoyance that quickened her breathing and not the way the lines of his body pressed against the lines of hers she bunched the hand at her side into a fist calculated the wisdom of using it for one shortarmed punch to the face and decided sarcasm was a more potent weapon against him next time ask me if i want to dance im not in the mood to she broke off when she saw something sharp come into his eyes something reckless that had her already rapid pulse tripping to a faster rate she forgot selfdefense forgot the fist she still held ready damn it blackhawk back off what do you want from me the hell with it he forgot the rules forgot the consequences of breaking them all he could see was her the hell with it lets find out he let the bottle drop and the water that remained in it spilled unnoticed on the bedroom rug he wanted his hands on her both his hands and used them to hold her arms over her head as his mouth came down on hers he felt her body jerk against his protest or invitation he didnt care one way or the other he was bound to be damned for this single outrageous act so he might as well make the most of it he used his teeth on her the way hed already imagined scraping them along the long line of her lower lip freeing the warmth the softness of it to him then absorbing it she made some sound something that seemed to claw up from her throat and was every bit as primitive as the need that raged through him the scent of hercool soap and skinthe flavor of her such a contrast of ripeness and heat overwhelmed him stirred every hunger hed ever known when his hands took her fingers sliding down gripping her hips he was ready to feed those hungers to take what he craved without a second thought then his hand bumped over her weapon he jerked back as if shed drawn it and shot him what was he doing what in gods name was he doing she said nothing only stared at him with eyes that had gone blurry at the edges her arms remained over her head as if his hands still pinned them there her body quaked that was a mistake she managed to say i know it a really serious mistake with her eyes open she fisted her hands in his hair and dragged his mouth back to hers this time it was his body that jerked and the shock of it vibrated through her down to the bone hed savaged her mouth with that first mad kiss and she wanted him to do it again he would damn well do it again until her system stopped screaming she couldnt breathe without breathing him and every desperate gulp of air was like the pump of a drug the power of it charged through her while their lips and tongues warred with one violent move he yanked her shirt out of the waistband of her slacks then snaked his hand beneath until it closed over her breast the groan came from both of them the minute i saw you he tore his mouth from hers to feast on her throat the first minute i saw you i know she wanted his mouth again had to have it i know he started to drag her jacket off had it halfway down her arms when sanity began to pound against madness the madness urged him to take herwhy shouldnt hefast and hard to take what he needed the way he needed it and please himself ally he said her name and the oldfashioned sweetness of it clicked reality back into place she saw him step backthough he didnt move she saw the deliberate distance he built between them by the change in his eyes those fascinating and clear green eyes okay she sucked in a breath okay okay in an almost absent move she patted his shoulder until he did indeed step back that was whoa she sidestepped paced away into his office okay that was something something or other i need a minute for my mind to clear shed never had passion slam into her with a force that blanked the mind but shed have to worry about that deal with that later right now it was essential she find her balance we probably both knew that was in there and its probably best we got it out she said to give himself a moment he bent down picked up the empty water bottle set it aside then he dipped his hands into his pockets because they werent altogether steady and followed her into the office ill agree with the first part and reserve judgment on the second what do we do now now we get over it just like that he thought shed cut him off at the knees and now he was supposed to just hobble away and get over it fine pride iced his voice he walked over took three tapes out of his desk drawer i believe these satisfy your warrant her palms were sweaty but she couldnt sacrifice the dignity she was trying to rebuild by wiping them off she took the tapes slipped them into her shoulder bag ill give you a receipt forget it ill give you a receipt she repeated and took out a pad its procedure we wouldnt want to tamper with procedure he held out his hand accepting the copy she offered dont let me keep you fletcher clocks ticking she strode to the door yanked it open dignity be damned she decided and spun back you can save the attitude you made the first move i made the second thats an even slate to me and now its done honeymake that detective honey if we were done wed both be feeling a lot better right now yeah well well live with it she muttered and sacrificed dignity for satisfaction by slamming the door ally wasnt cut out to be a waitress she was sure of it when during her second shift at blackhawks she poured the drink beth had allowed her to serve over the head of the idiot customer who grabbed her butt and invited her to engage in a sexual act that was illegal in several states the customer had objected rather strongly to her response but before she could flatten him will had appeared like smoke between them shed had to stand passively and be rescued it had grated for hours but if she was sure of her lack of waitress potential after her second shift she was desperate to shed her cover by the third she wanted action and not the kind that required her to serve wild wings in demon sauce and take orders for drinks called tornadoes to young executives on the make twenty minutes into her third night at blackhawks had given her a profound respect for those who served and cleared and tolerated impatience lousy tips and lewd propositions i hate people ally waited for her drink order at the bar while pete drew a beer off tap ah no you dont yes yes i do i really do theyre rude annoying oblivious and all of them are jammed into blackhawks and its only sixthirty please six thirtyfive every minute counts she glanced back at jan who worked the bar area all but dancing between tables as she cleared served and played up her assets how does she do it some are born for it blondie youll excuse my saying so but youre not not that you dont do the job but you dont have the passion she rolled her eyes i dont have the arches either she started to lift the tray eyes tracking the room as always then she let it drop again when she spotted the man coming in the front door oh hell pete ask jan to get this order to table eight club side i have to do something ally whatre you doing here it was all dennis got out of his mouth before ally grabbed his arm and hauled him through the bar into the kitchen and out the back door damn it dennis damn it whats the matter what did you drag me out here for he put on his best baffled look but shed seen it before shed seen the whole routine before im on the job youll blow my cover for gods sake i told you what would happen if you started following me again i dont know what youre talking about his injured air had worked on her once more than once you listen to me she stepped close jabbed a finger in his chest listen hard dennis were done we have been done for months theres no chance thats going to change and every chance if you keep hassling me ill slap a restraining order on your butt and make your life a living hell his mouth thinned his eyebrows lowered the way she knew they did when he was backed into a corner this is a public place all i did was walk into a public place im entitled to buy a drink in a bar when im in the mood youre not entitled to follow me or to jeopardize my cover in a police investigation you crossed the line and im calling the das office in the morning you dont have to do that come on ally how was i supposed to know you were on the job here i just happened to pass by and dont lie to me she balled her hand into a fist then in frustration tapped it against her own temple as she turned away dont lie i just miss you so much i think about you all the time i cant help it i know i shouldnt have followed you i didnt mean to i was just hoping we could talk thats all come on baby he took her shoulders buried his face in her hair in a way that made her skin crawl if we could just talk dont touch me she hunched her shoulders started to pull away but he wrapped his arms around her one hard squeeze of possession dont pull away you know it makes me crazy when you go cold like that she could have had him flat on his back with her foot on his throat in two moves she didnt want it to come to that dennis dont make me hurt you just leave me alone take your hands off me and leave me alone or its going to be so much worse than it already is no itll be better i swear itll be better you just have to take me back and thingsll be the way they used to be no they wont she stiffened braced to break the hold let me go light spilled out of the kitchen door as it opened id advise you to do what the lady asked jonah warned and do it fast she closed her eyes felt temper and embarrassment rise up under the frustration i can handle this maybe but you wont this is my place take your hands off her were having a private conversation dennis turned but pulled ally with him not anymore go inside ally this is none of your business denniss voice rose cracked it was a tenor shed heard before just butt out that wasnt the right response she moved now breaking free and stepping between the men when jonah moved forward there was a gleam in his eye that worried her like a flash of lightning against thin ice dont please anger wouldnt have stopped him nor would an order but the plea in her eyes the weariness in them did go back inside he said again but quietly as he laid a hand on her shoulder so thats the way it is dennis lifted bunched fists theres nobody else thats what you told me no there was nobody else just another lie just one more of your lies youve been sleeping with him all along havent you lying bitch jonah moved tike a snake shed seen street fights before had broken up her share while in uniform she only had time to swear and leap forward but jonah already had dennis up against the wall stop it she said again and grabbed his arm to try to pull him off she might as well have tried to shove aside a mountain he shot her one steely look no he said it casually like a shrug then he plowed his fist into denniss belly i dont like men who push women around or call them names his voice stayed cool and steady as he delivered a second blow i wont tolerate it in my place you got that he let go stepped back and dennis collapsed in a heap at his feet i think he got it great wonderful while dennis moaned ally pressed her fingers to her eyes you just gutpunched an assistant district attorney and your point would be help me get him up no before she could try to haul dennis to his feet jonah took her arm he walked in on his own hell walk away on his own i cant leave him here curled up like a damn shrimp on the pavement hell get up right dennis elegant and unruffled in black jonah crouched down beside the groaning man youre going to get up youre going to walk away and youre not going to come back here in this lifetime youre going to stay very far away from allison in fact if you find out that by some mischance youre breathing the same air youll hold your breath and run in the opposite direction dennis struggled to his hands and knees retched tears swam in his eyes but behind them was a rage that drilled in his head like a diamond bit youre welcome to her pain radiated through him as he stumbled to his feet shell use you then toss you aside just like she did me youre welcome to her he repeated then limped away looks like youre all mine now jonah straightened flicked fingers down his shirt as if removing some pesky lint but if youre going to start using me id prefer we do it inside its not funny no he studied her face the shadowed eyes and the pity in them i can see that im sorry why dont you come inside take a few minutes up in my office until youre feeling steadier im okay but she turned away dragged the clip out of her hair as if it were suddenly too tight i dont want to talk about it now all right he put his hands on her shoulders used his thumbs to press at the tension take a minute anyway i hate having him touch me and i feel lousy because i hate it i dont think it jeopardized the cover no according to pete some dude walked in you flipped and dragged him out anybody asks ill keep it close to the truth exboyfriend whos hassling me then stop worrying he turned her around and stop feeling guilty youre not responsible for other peoples feelings sure you are when you help make them anyway she lifted a hand to the one he still rested on her shoulder patted it thanks i could have handled him but thanks youre welcome he couldnt stop himself from leaning into her drawing her close he watched her lashes lower her mouth lift to his and was a breath away from tasting her when the light spilled over them oh sorry frannie stood framed in the door where kitchen noise clattered a lighter in one hand a cigarette at the ready in the other no ally broke away furious with herself for forgetting her priorities i was just going back in im already late she flicked one look at jonah then hurried back inside frannie waited until the door swung shut men stepped over to lean back against the wall she flicked on her lighter well she said well she blew out smoke on a sigh shes beautiful yes she is smart too it comes across yeah just your type this time he angled his head you think so sure the tip of her cigarette glowed as she lifted it to her lips classy class shows she suits you it troubled him more than hed imagined it would to dance around the truth with an old friend well see how well we fit frannie moved a shoulder but shed already seen they fit like lock and key was there trouble with that suit jonah glanced in the direction dennis had taken nothing major an ex who doesnt like being an ex figured it was something like that well if it matters i like her it matters frannie he walked to her touched a hand to her cheek you matter and always have chapter six days after the chamberses burglary ally stood in her lieutenants office to save time shed already changed into her waitress gear for the evening she had her badge in the pocket of her trousers and her clutch piece strapped just above her ankle we havent been able to trace one single piece of stolen property she knew it wasnt what he wanted to hear theres no news on the street even hickmans bottomless sources are dry whoevers pushing the buttons on this is smart private and patient youve been inside blackhawks for a week yes sir i cant tell you any more than i could the first day between the security tapes and my own inthefield observations ive tagged several regulars but nobody pops on the upside my covers secure fortunately shut the door detective her stomach sank a little but she did so and stood in the glass box of his office with the noise from the bullpen humming behind the clear wall on the matter of dennis overton shed known it was coming once shed made the complaint to the das office it was inevitable that some of the flak would scatter into her own house i regret the incident lieutenant however the way it ultimately played out added to my cover rather than detracting from it thats not my concern why didnt you report his behavior previously to the da to me they both heard the unspoken to your father it was personal business and until this last incident on my personal time i believed i could handle it without involving my superiors or denniss he understood the defensive stance because he understood her ive spoken with the district attorney in your complaint to him you state that overton has over a period of time beginning the first week of april harassed you with phone calls both here and at home has staked out your apartment followed you on and off duty he didnt interfere with the job she began then wisely closed her mouth when her lieutenant stared at her kiniki set aside a copy of her written statement folded his hands on it contacting you against your stated wishes when youre on duty as well as when youre off interferes are you unaware of the stalking laws detective no sir when it became apparent that the subject would not desist in his behavior could not be discouraged and could potentially interfere with this investigation i reported his behavior to his superior you havent filed charges no sir nor have you as yet requested a restraining order i believe a reprimand from his superior is sufficient that or being knocked back by jonah blackhawk she opened her mouth closed it again she hadnt mentioned that part of the incident to the da overton claims mat blackhawk attacked him unprovoked in a fit of jealous rage oh for gods sake the words and the disgust in them were out before she could stop them she yanked at her hair once then bit down on control that is completely inaccurate i didnt detail the incident lieutenant it didnt seem necessary but if dennis insists on making trouble here ill write out a full report do it i want a copy on my desk by tomorrow afternoon he could lose his job is that your problem no she blew out a breath no sir lieutenant dennis and i dated for a period of three months she hated this bringing her personal life into her superiors office we were intimate briefly he began to displayhell she dropped the copspeak approached the desk he got possessive jealous irrational if i was late or had to cancel hed accuse me of being with another man it got way out of hand and when i broke things off hed come by or call full of apologies and promises to be different when i didnt go for it hed either get nasty or fall apart lieutenant i slept with him part of this situation is my doing kiniki waited a moment pulling on his bottom lip while he studied her thats one of the few stupid remarks ive ever heard you make if a victim came to you describing this situation would you tell her it was her doing when she didnt answer he nodded i didnt think so you would follow procedure follow it now yes sir ally hed known her since she was five he tried to keep the personal separate as religiously as she but there were times have you told your father about this i dont want to bring him into it respectfully sir id prefer you didnt discuss it with him thats your choice the wrong one but yours ill agree to it if i have your word that if overton so much as breathes within ten feet of you you report it to me he cocked his head when her lips quivered thats amusing no sir yes she let go of the cop to cop stand jonah made nearly the same statement uncle lou i guess its sweet in a manly sort of way of course always had the smartest mouth go on get out of here and get me something on these burglaries since most waitressesintraining didnt drive classic corvettes ally was in the habit of parking two blocks away and walking the rest of the distance to blackhawks it gave her time to shift gears to appreciate what spring brought to denver shed always loved the city the way the buildings silver towers rode into the sky she loved seeing the mountains go from winterwhite to those steely jags laced by snow and forest and though she enjoyed the mountains had spent many wonderful days in her parents cabin she preferred to view them from city streets her city her city had scarredbooted cowboys walking down the same streets with armaniclad executives it was about cattle and commerce and nightlife it was about the wild coated with a sheen or polish but not quite tamed the east would never hold the same appeal for her and when spring was in full balmy life when the sun beamed on the whitetipped peaks that guarded denver when the air was thin and bright there was no place like it in the world she stepped out of the city and into blackhawks jonah was at the bar the far end leaning casually sipping what she knew was his habitual sparkling water and listening to one of his regular customers complain about his day those light and beautiful green eyes pinned her the minute she walked in stayed steady stayed level and gave away nothing he hadnt touched her since the night behind the club and had said little it was best that way she told herself mix duty and lust and you end up compromising one and being burnt by the other but it was frustrating to see him night after night to remain just close enough to maintain illusions and not be able to take a complete step forward or back and to want him the way shed never wanted anyone else she shrugged out of her jacket and got to work it was killing him by inches jonah knew what it was to want a woman to have one stir blood and loins and spin images in the mind it could be a kind of hunger that slowly churned in the belly gnawing there until it was finally satisfied this was a hunger his desire for ally but there was nothing of the slow churning in it this was sharp constant and painful no other woman had ever caused him pain he carried the taste of her inside him he couldnt rid himself of it that alone was infuriating it gave her an advantage hed never allowed another to have over him the fact that she didnt appear to know it didnt negate the weakness where you were weak you were vulnerable he wanted the investigation over he wanted her back in her own life her own world so he could regain his balance in his then he remembered the way shed erupted against him the way her mouth had scorched over his and her hands fisted in his hair and he began to worry hed never find his feet firmly planted again good thing we dont have a cop around jonahs fingers tightened on his glass but his eyes were mild as he turned to frannie what she pulled a beer poured a bump then served it a guy could get arrested for looking at a woman that way i think its called intent or something what you intend is pretty clear at least when shes not looking really and that he realized was another worry then i better watch myself shes doing plenty of watching frannie murmured as he walked away the mans got trouble on the brain will commented he liked coming over to frannies end of the bar so he could get a whiff of her hair or maybe work a smile out of her hes got woman on the brain and hes not altogether easy with this one she winked at him and squirted a glass of the soft drink will drank by the gallon during working hours women never trouble the man this one does well he sipped his drink scanned the bar crowd shes a looker thats not it looks are surface stuff this ones got him down in the gut you think will tugged on his little beard he didnt understand women and didnt pretend to to him they were simply amazing creatures of staggering power and wonderful shapes i know she patted wills hand and had his heart throbbing in his throat two margaritas frozen with salt two house drafts and a club soda with lime jan set down her tray and walked her fingers up wills arm in a teasing tickling motion hey big guy he blushed he always did hey jan i better do a round in the club he hurried off and had frannie shaking her head at jan you shouldnt tease him like that i cant help it hes so sweet she flipped her hair back listen theres this party tonight im going by after closing want to tag along after closing im going to be home in my own little bed dreaming of brad pitt dreaming never gets you anywhere dont i know it frannie muttered and sent the blender whirling allison carried a full tray of empties and had two tables worth of drink orders in the pad tucked in her bar apron only thirty minutes into shift she thought it was going to be a long night longer she realized when she spotted jonah coming toward her allison id like to speak with you about something anything five minutes alone with you might do it pitiful would you come up to my office on your break problem no he lied no problem fine but youd better tell will he guards your cave like a wolf take your break now come up with me cant thirsty people waiting but ill shake loose as soon as i can if its important she walked away quickly because shed heard it that underlying heat that told her what he wanted with her had nothing to do with duty she stopped at her station beside pete and ordered herself to settle down since he was in the middle of entertaining three of the stoolsitters with a long complicated joke she took the time to rest her feet and study the people scattered at table and bar a twentysomething couple who looked like they were on the leading edge of an argument three suits with ties loosened arguing baseball a flirtation in its early stages starting to cook between a lone woman and the betterlooking of a pair of guys at the bar lots of eye contact and smiles another couple at a table laughing together over some private joke holding hands she noted flirting some even though the hands wore wedding rings well married happy and financially secure if the designer handbag on the back of the womans chair and the matching shoes were any indication at the next table another couple sat having a quiet conversation that seemed to please them both there was an intimacy there as well ally noted body language gestures the smiling looks over sips of wine she envied that comfort she supposed of having someone who could sit across the table in a crowded place and focus on her care about what she said or what she didnt have to say it was what her parents hadthat innate rhythm and respect mat added real dimension to love and attraction if it was lovely to watch she wondered how much more lovely must it be to experience brooding over it she listened to the laughter break out at petes punch line she placed her orders listening absently to the chatter around her scanning always scanning the movements the faces she watched the handholding couple signal jan and the woman pointing to an item on the bar menu when the waitress moved to the table to take the order bending down jan waved a hand in front of her mouth rolled her eyes and made the woman laugh the hotter the better the woman claimed we dont have a club table until eight so theres plenty of time to cool down when jan had scribbled down the order and moved off ally found herself smiling at me way the man brought the womans hand to his mouth and nipped at her knuckles if it hadnt been for that kernel of envy that kept her attention focused on them she might have missed it as it was it took her several seconds to note the picture had changed the womans bag still hung over the back of her chair but at a different angle and the outside zipper pocket wasnt quite closed ally came to attention her first thought to focus on jan then she saw it the second woman sitting with her back to the first still smiling at her companion while under the table smooth and unhurried she slipped a set of keys into the purse she held on her lap bingo you gone to the moon ally pete tapped a finger on her shoulder i dont think anybodys waiting for vodka tonics up there no im right here as the woman rose tucked her purse under her arm ally lifted her tray fivefour she thought a hundred and twenty brown hair brown eyes late thirties with an olive complexion and strong features and just now heading toward the ladies room rather than break cover she hurried into the club spotted will and shoved the tray at him sorry table eights waiting for these tell jonah i need to speak with him i have to do something but hey i have to do something she repeated and walked briskly toward the rest rooms inside she scanned the bottom of the stalls located the right shoes making a wax mold of the keys ally concluded and turned to one of the sinks she ran water while she watched the shoes it would only take a few minutes but shed need privacy satisfied ally walked out ally i got tables filling up here wheres your tray sorry she shot beth an apologetic smile little emergency ill get on it she moved quickly catching the eye of one of her team members and pausing by the table white female late thirties brown and brown shell be coming out of the ladies room in a minute navy jacket and slacks shes sitting in the bar area with a white male early forties gray and blue in a green sweater keep them in sight but dont move in we handle it just like we outlined she walked back to the bar to pick up another tray as a prop the man in the green sweater was paying the tab cash he looked relaxed but ally noted he checked his watch and glanced back toward the rest rooms the woman came back in but rather than taking her seat stood between the tables and reached down for the short black cape shed draped over the chair for a matter of seconds her body blocked the view then she straightened beamed at her companion and handed him the cape smart hands ally thought very smart hands when jonah turned the corner of the bar she inclined her head and let her gaze slide over to the couple preparing to leave then back to him casually she crossed over and ran a hand affectionately up and down jonahs arm ive got two officers to tag them we want them to get through the setup all the way through i want to give it some time before i alert the targets when i do i need your office all right we need to keep business as usual down here if youll hang around i can let you know when i want to move you can tell beth you need me for something so she can juggle tables i dont want any alarms going off just let me know ill take care of it let me have the code for your elevator in case i need to take them up without you she leaned in her face tilted to his two seven he leaned down brushed his lips over hers five eight five got it yeah i got it see if you can keep attention off me until i move the targets out of the bar her energy was up but her mind was cool she waited fifteen minutes when the female target rose to use the rest room ally slipped in with her excuse me after a quick check of the stalls ally pulled her badge out of her pocket im detective fletcher denver pd the woman took a quick instinctive step in retreat whats this about i need your help with an investigation id like to speak with you and your husband if youd come with me i havent done anything no maam ill explain it all to you theres a private office upstairs if we could move up there as quietly as possible id appreciate your cooperation im not going anywhere without don ill get your husband if youd walk back out turn to the left and wait in the corridor i want to know what this is about ill explain it to both of you ally took the womans arm to hurry her along please just a few moments of your time i dont want any trouble please wait here ill get your husband because she didnt trust the woman to stay put long ally moved fast she paused at the couples table picked up empty glasses sir your wifes back there she asked if you could come back for a minute sure is she okay shes fine ally crossed to the bar set down the empties then ducked quickly back into the corridor detective fletcher she said with a quick flash of her badge as the man joined her i need to speak with you and your wife in private she was already keying in the code she wont say what its about don i dont see why i appreciate your cooperation ally said again and all but shoved them both into the elevator i dont appreciate being bullied by the police the woman said with an edge of nerves in her voice lynn calm down its okay im sorry to be abrupt ally stepped into jonans office gestured to the chairs if youd have a seat ill fill you in lynn crossed her arms hugged her elbows tight i dont want to sit down have it your way sister ally thought im investigating a series of burglaries in and around denver during the last several weeks the woman sniffed do we look like burglars no maam you look like a nice wellestablished upper class couple which has been to date the main target of this burglary ring and less than twenty minutes ago a woman we suspect is part of mat ring lifted your keys out of your purse thats impossible my purse has been right with me all night as if to prove it she started to unzip the pocket ally snagged her wrist please dont touch your keys how can i touch them if theyre not there the woman argued lynn shut up come on he squeezed his wifes shoulder whats going on he asked ally we believe molds are made of the keys theyre replaced and the targeted victim remains unaware then their house is broken into and their belongings are stolen wed like to prevent that from happening to you now sit down authority snapped in her voice this time visibly shaken the woman lowered herself into a chair if i could have your names please don and lynnmr and mrs barnes mr barnes would you give me your address he swallowed sat on the arm of his wifes chair and rattled it off while ally noted it down do you mean someones in our house right now robbing us right now i dont believe they can move quite that quickly in her mind she was calculating the drivetime is there anyone at that address right now no its just us man barnes ran a hand through his hair man this is weird im going to call in your address and begin setting up a stakeout give me a second she picked up the phone as the elevator doors opened and jonah walked it ive got it covered here she told him im sure you do mr and mrs barnes the man answered don and lynn barnes don can i offer you and your wife something to drink i realize this is very inconvenient and upsetting for you i could use a shot a good stiff bourbon i think cant blame you and lynn i she lifted a hand dropped it i just cant i dont understand maybe a little brandy jonah turned away opened a panel in the wall to reveal a small wellstocked bar you can put yourselves in detective fletchers capable hands he continued and he chose bottles and glasses and meanwhile well try to keep you as comfortable as possible thanks lynn took the brandy from him thank you so much mr barnes a little miffed at how smoothly jonah had settled ruffled feathers she yanked the mans attention back to her we have units on the way to your house right now can you describe your house for me the layout doors windows sure he laughed a little shakily hell im an architect he gave her a clear picture which she relayed to the team before she began to set up the coordinates for the stakeout you have dinner reservations here tonight ally asked them yeah eight oclock were making a night of it he said with a sour smile ally checked her watch theyll think they have plenty of time she wanted them to go back down to finish their time at the bar go into dinner and present the appearance of normality and one look at the womans face told her it was a long shot mrs barnes lynn ally came back around the desk sat on me edge of it weregoing to stop these people they wont take your things or damage your home but i need you

thosewhat was itthe wild wings you ordered didnt sit too well after all youre fine now but you were feeling a little sick blackhawks will cover your bar bill right naturally jonah offered lynn his hand to help her to her feet and the dinner tab ill take you down you just needed to stretch out for a few minutes and i offered to take you and your husband up to my office until you felt better good enough he asked ally as he pressed for the elevator perfect i need to make a couple more calls then ill be down im going to have to cut out before end of shift ive had a family emergency good luck with it he told her and led the barneses away chapter she got the key from jonah and went straight to the employee lounge for her bag she ran straight out doing no more than waving a hand when frannie called out to her from behind the bar she was trusting jonah to answer any questions no one could do it better she thought as she raced the blocks to her car a simple word a shrug from him and that would be that no one pumped a man like jonah blackhawk she had to get to federal heights before everything went down at first she thought she was seeing things but the night was clear and cool and her vision excellent there was no mistaking the fact that all four of her tires were slashed she swore kicked viciously at the mangled rubber a hell of a time she thought one hell of a time for dennis overton to get nasty digging into her bag she pulled out her cell phone and called for a radio car time wasted was all she could think two minutes five minutes ticking away while she paced the sidewalk and waited she had her badge out and her teeth clenched when the patrol car pulled up got some trouble detective yeah hit the sirens head north on ill tell you when to go silent you got it whats going down she settled into the back behind the two uniforms itching to have her hands on the wheel and her foot on the gas ill fill you in she took her weapon and harness out of her bag and felt more herself the minute she strapped it on call for a tow truck will you i dont want to leave my car on the street like that shame about that nice car yeah she forgot about it as they screamed up the interstate a block from the barneses address she hopped out of the car and arrowed straight to hickman give me the story they took their time getting here balou and dietz had the first leg of the tail and said they drove like solid citizens kept under the speed limit signaled for turns woman riding shotgun made a call on a cell phone he turned over the tail to me and carson when they got on they stopped for gas the woman gets in the back theyre driving a nice suburban minivan shes doing something back there but i couldnt get close enough to see making the keys i bet you two weeks pay shes got the works for it in the van do i look like i take sucker bets he glanced down the quiet street anyhow we had a unit here waiting the suspects were observed parking the van a block down from the target address they strolled up the street walked right up to the door unlocked it and went in like they owned the place barnes said they have a security system alarm didnt trip theyve been inside about ten minutes now lieutenants waiting for you weve got the area blocked off the house surrounded then lets move in and wrap this up he grinned handed her a walkietalkie saddle up god i love cowboy talk they moved fast kept low she spotted the cops positioned on the street behind trees in shadows hunched in cars glad you could join the party detective kiniki nodded toward the house ballsy arent they lights gleamed a homey glow against windows on the first and second floor while ally watched she saw a faint shadow move behind the lower window dietz and balou are covering the back weve got them closed in whats your play ally reached in her pocket pulled out keys we move in on all sides and go in the front when we move pull one of the radio cars across the driveway lets block that route call it she lifted the walkietalkie to establish positioning and give the orders and all hell broke loose three gunshots blasted the air the return fire slamming into the echoes even as ally drew her own weapon voices shouted through the walkietalkies dietz is down officer down shooters male heading east on foot officer down cops rushed the house ally hit the door first went in low blood pounded in her ears as she swept the area with her weapon hickman took her back and at her signal headed up the stairs while she turned right someone was shouting she heard it like a buzz in the brain lights flashed on the house opened out like a fan she brought the layout barnes had described into her mind as she and the rest of the team spread out at each doorway she led with eyes and weapon following training while her bream came short and shallow there was more gunfire from outside muffled pops she started to turn in that direction and saw the sliding door on what looked like a small solarium wasnt quite shut she caught a scent very female and following instinct turned away from the shouts and bolted for the door she saw the woman just the silhouette of her running hard toward a line of ornamental trees police stop where you are she would replay it a dozen times the woman continued to run weapon drawn ally raced after her calling out the warning shouting her position and situation into her hand unit she heard calls from behind her running feet theyd cut her off ally thought cut her off even before she reached the six foot fence that closed in the property nowhere to go she gained ground caught both the scent of perfume and panic sweat the woman left on the air moonlight picked her out of the shadows the swing of her dark hair the stream of the short black cape and when on the run the woman turned the moonlight bounced off the chrome plating of the revolver in her hand ally saw her lift it felt with a kind of detached shock the heat of the bullet that whined past her own head drop your weapon drop it now and as the woman pivoted and the gun jerked in her hand ally fired ally saw the woman stagger heard the thud as the gun fell from her hand and heard a kind of sighing gasp but what she would remember what seemed to burn on her brain like acid on glass was the dark stain that bloomed between the womans breasts even as she dropped it was bonedeep training that had her rushing forward stepping on the womans gun suspect down she said into her hand unit as she crouched to check for a pulse her voice didnt shake and neither did she not yet it was hickman who got to her first she heard his voice like something carried on the crest of a wave of churning water her head was full of sound a rushing liquid sound are you hit ally are you hit his hands were already moving over her tugging at her jacket to check for injury call an ambulance her lips were stiff they felt wooden splintered she reached forward crossing her hands over each other pressing the heels of them on the womans chest on the way come on get up she needs pressure on this wound she needs an ambulance ally he holstered his own weapon you cant do anything for her shes dead she didnt let herself be sick she made herself stand and watch as the wounded officer and the womans partner were loaded into ambulances she made herself watch when the woman was zipped into a thick black bag detective fletcher and she made herself turn face her lieutenant sir can you tell me dietzs condition im on my way to the hospital well know more later she rubbed the back of her hand over her mouth the suspect paramedics said hell make it itll be a couple of hours at least before we can question him am i will i be allowed to be in on the interrogation its still your case he took her arm to draw her away ally listen to me i know what it feels like ask yourself now right now if you could have done anything differently i dont know hickman was behind you and carson was coming in from the left i havent spoken with her as yet but hickmans report is you identified yourself ordered her to stop she turned and fired you ordered her to drop her weapon and she prepared to fire again you had no choice thats what i expect to hear from you during the standard inquiry tomorrow morning do you want me to call your father no please ill talk to him tomorrow after the inquiry then go home get some rest ill let you know about dietz sir unless im relieved of duty id rather go to the hospital stand by for dietz and be on hand to question the suspect when were cleared to do so it would be better for her he thought to do what came next you can ride with me panic was like an animal clawing at his throat hed never felt anything like it before jonah told himself it was just hospitals that did it to him hed always detested them the smell of them brought back the last hideous months of his fathers life and made nun all too aware that a turn here a turn there in a different direction might have damned him to experience the same fate his father had at fifty years old his source had assured him that ally wasnt hurt but all he knew for certain was that something had gone very wrong at the bust and she was at the hospital that had been enough to have him heading straight out just to see for himself he thought he found her slumped in a chair in the hallway of intensive care the panic digging into his throat released shed taken the clip out of her hair as he knew she did when she was tense or tired the gilt curtain of hair fanned down the side of her face concealing it but the tired slouch the hands she gripped together on her knees told him what to expect he stepped in front of her crouched down and saw as hed known he would pale skin and dark bruised eyes hey he gave into the need to lay his hand over hers bad day pretty bad it seemed like wires were crossed in her brain she didnt think to wonder why he was there one of my teams in critical condition they dont know if hell make it till morning im sorry yeah me too the doctors wont let us talk to the son of a bitch who shot him male suspect identified as richard fricks hes sleeping comfortably under a nice haze of drugs while dietz fights for his life and his wifes down in the chapel praying for it she wanted to close her eyes to go into the dark but kept them open and on his and for a bonus i killed a woman tonight one shot through the heart like she was a target i aced at practice her hands trembled once under his then fisted yeah thats a pretty bad day come on come where home im taking you home when she looked at him blankly he pulled her to her feet she felt featherlight her hands fragile as glass theres nothing you can do here now ally she closed her eyes groped for a breath thats what hickman said at the scene theres nothing you can do looks like youre both right she let him lead her to the elevator there was no point in staying or arguing or pretending she wanted to be alone i can get a ride youve got one no she thought no point in arguing or in resisting the supporting arm he slipped around her waist how did you know to come here a cop came by to take the barneses home i got enough out of him to know thered been trouble and where you were why isnt your father with you he doesnt know ill tell him about it tomorrow what the hells wrong with you she blinked like a woman coming out of a dark room into the light what he pulled her out of the elevator across the hospital lobby do you want him to hear about this from someone else to not hear your voice hear you tell him youre not hurt what are you thinking i i wasnt thinking youre right she fumbled in her purse for her phone as they crossed the lot i need a minute i just need a minute she got into the car steadying herself steadying her breathing okay she whispered it to herself as jonah started the car she punched in the number waited through the first ring then heard her mothers voice mom her breath hitched she bore down holding a hand over the phone until she was sure her voice would be normal im fine everything okay there uhhuh listen im on my way home and i need to speak to dad a minute yeah thats right cop talk thanks now she closed her eyes listened to her mother call out heard the warm mix of their laughter before her fathers voice sounded in her ear ally whats up dad her voice wanted to crack but she refused to let it dont say anything to upset mom there was a pause all right im okay im not hurt and im on my way home it went down tonight and things went wrong ah one of the team was wounded and hes in the hospital one of the suspects is in there too well know more tomorrow on both youre all right allison yes i wasnt hurt dad dad i had to fire my weapon they were armed both suspects were armed and

about it tomorrow im so tired now if thats what you want it is i promise im all right ally who went down dietz len dietz she lifted her free hand pressed her fingers to her lips they didnt feel stiff now but soft painfully soft hes critical the lieutenants still at the hospital ill contact him try to get some sleep but you call anytime if you change your mind i can be there we both can i know ill call you in the morning i think itll be easier in the morning i love you she broke the connection let the phone slide into her purse she opened her eyes and saw they were already in front of her apartment thanks for jonah said nothing simply got out came around to her door opening it he held out a hand for hers i cant seem to get my thoughts lined up what time is it it doesnt matter give me your key oh yeah the traditionalist she dug it out unaware her other hand was clutching his like a lifeline im going to start expecting flowers next she walked through the lobby to the elevator it seems like theres something i have to do i cant get a rope around what it is though there should be something i have to do we identified her she had id anyway madeline fricks madeline ellen fricks she murmured floating like a dream out of the elevator age thirtyseven she had an address in englewood somebodys checking it out i should be checking it out he unlocked the door drew her inside sit down ally yeah i could sit down she looked blankly around the living room it was just the way shed left it that morning nothing had changed why did it seem as if everything had changed jonah solved the matter by picking her up and carrying her toward the bedroom where are we going youre going to lie down got anything to drink around here stuff fine ill go find some stuff he laid her on the bed ill be okay thats right he left her to hunt through the kitchen in a narrow cupboard he found an unopened bottle of brandy he broke the seal poured three fingers when he brought it back she was sitting up in the bed her knees rammed into her chest her arms roped around them ive got the shakes she kept her face pressed to her knees if i had something to do i wouldnt have the shakes heres what you need to do he sat on the bed cupped a hand under her chin and lifted it drink this she took the first sip obediently when he lifted the glass to her lips then she coughed and turned her head away i hate brandy somebody gave me that last christmas god knows why i meant to she trailed off began to rock have some more come on fletcher take your medicine he gave her little choice but to gulp down another swallow her eyes watered and color flooded her cheeks we had the place closed in surrounded the house cordoned off the area in a threeblock radius they couldnt have gotten through they had no place to run she needed to talk through it jonah set the brandy aside but they ran anyway we were just about to move in and hefrickscame out the back already firing he hit dietz with two rounds some of us went around the back covering both sides some of us went in the front i was first in hickman was behind me we spread out started the sweep she could still see it in her head moving through fast and steady the lights blazing i could hear more gunfire and shouting from outside i nearly turned back thinking they were both out of the house and runningthat they were together but i sawtheres this bumpout sunroom deal on the house and the sliding door leading out wasnt closed not all the way closed i spotted her as soon as i stepped out going in the opposite direction as her partner splitting us up i guess i called out told her to stop i was in pursuit and she fired a round sloppy shot i ordered her to stop to drop her weapon i didnt see she had a choice where the hell could she go but she spun around she spun around ally repeated the moon was very bright very bright and it was on her face in her eyes shining on the gun and i shot her did you have a choice her lips trembled open no in my head thats clear jonah thats so clear ive gone over it step after step a dozen times already but they dont prepare you for what its like they cant they cant tell you how it feels the first tear spilled over and she wiped it impatiently away i dont even know what im crying for or who it doesnt matter he put his arms around her drew her head down on his shoulder and held her while she wept and while she wept he went back over what shed told him sloppy shot shed said almost skimming over the fact that someone had tried to kill her yet she wept because shed had no choice but to take a life cops he turned his cheek against her hair hed never understand cops she slept for two hours dropping into oblivion like a stone in a pool and staying deep at the bottom when she woke she was wrapped around him in the dark she lay still a moment orienting herself while his heart beat strong and steady under her palm with her eyes open and her mind clearing she went through a mental check list she had a vague headache but nothing majorjust a hangover from the crying jag there was a stronger feeling of embarrassment but she thought she could live with that too she wiggled her toes and discovered she was barefoot and her ankle holster was gone so she realized was her shoulder harness hed disarmed her she thought in more ways than one shed blubbered out her story cried on his shoulder and was now wrapped around him in the dark worse than all of that was realizing she wanted to stay there believing him asleep she started to inch away feel any better she didnt jolt but it was close yeah considerably i guess i owe you i guess you do in the dark he found her mouth with his and sank in soft unexpectedly soft warm deliciously warm yes she wanted to stay there and so she opened for him sliding her hand from his heart to his face yielding when he turned his body to press hers into the mattress the good solid weight of him the hard lines of his body the dragging heat of his mouth was exactly what she wanted her arms came around him holding him there as he had held her in tears and in sleep he gave himself the moment the dark taste of her mouth the sleepy sigh she made the feminine give of her beneath him hed lain beside her his body alert his mind restless while hers slept wanting her wanting her so it was like a fever in the blood yet when she woke he found himself drowning in tenderness yet when she surrendered he found himself unwilling unable to take he drew back skimmed a thumb over the curve of her cheek bad timing he said and rolled off the bed i she cleared her throat her body had just started to ache her mind had just started to float now she floundered free look if you have some weird idea that you were taking advantage youre wrong am i i know how to say yes or no and while i appreciate you bringing me home hearing me out and not leaving me alone im not grateful enough for any of that to pay you back with sex i think too much of myself hell i think too much of sex he laughed sat on the edge of the bed again you do feel better i said i did so she slid over tossing her hair back and nuzzling his throat his pulse tripped and a fireball burst in his belly thats tempting he was lucky to be able to breathe and still casually patted her hand and got to his feet but no thanks insult came first and something vile nearly spilled off her tongue because it made her think of dennis she yanked herself back okay mind if i ask why under the current circumstances that seems like a reasonable question two reasons he switched on the bedside light watched her eyes narrow in defense and the look of her slammed into him like a fist in the throat god youre beautiful a little thrill jumped up her spine and thats why you dont want to make love with me i want you enough that its starting to hurt that ticks me off idly he took the ends of her hair wrapped a length of it around his hand released it youre on my mind ally too often for comfort i like to be comfortable so reason one is that i havent decided if i want to get tangled up with you if i do half of the very interesting things i have in mind to do with you im going to be tangled she sat back on her heels i imagine you know how to cut line when you want to ive never had any trouble before youre trouble its that simple insult and annoyance had vanished this is fascinating here i had you pegged as somebody who took what he wanted when he wanted it and the hell with the consequences no i prefer calculating then eliminating consequences then i take what i want in other words i make you nervous oh yeah go ahead and grin he said with a nod i cant blame you she laughed lifted her eyebrows you said there were two reasons whats the second thats easy he stepped to the bed bent down and caught her chin in his hand i dont like cops he said and brushed his lips lightly over hers when he would have leaned away from the kiss she leaned in sliding up so that her body rubbed over his she felt his body quiver and nothing had ever been more satisfying yeah youre trouble he muttered im leaving coward okay that stings but ill get over it he walked over to shrug on the jacket hed tossed into a chair slip his feet back in his shoes she didnt just feel better ally realized she felt fabulous invincible why dont you come on back here and fight like a man he glanced at her she knelt on the side of the bed her eyes dark and challenging her hair a tumble of gold around her face and shoulders the taste of her was still sizzling on his tongue but he shook his head walked to the door tormented himself with one last look im going to hate both of us in the morning he told her then strode away while her laughter followed him chapter ally was up at six and ready to roll out the door at seven she nearly rolled right over her parents who were at her front door mom she flicked her eyes up to her father started to speak but her mother already had her caught in a hard hug mom she said again im all right indulge me cilia held on tight heart pressed to heart cheek pressed to cheek stupid cilia thought so stupid to have kept it together all night and to feel herself falling apart now that her child was in her arms she couldnt wouldnt allow it okay she laid her lips on allys temple for a moment then drew back far enough to study her daughters face i had to see for myself youre lucky your father held me off this long i didnt want you to worry its my job to worry and i believe in doing a job well ally watched her mothers lips curve saw the tears willed away and knew it cost her you do everything well cilia oroarke fletchers eyes were the same goldenbrown as her daughters her short sweep of hair a luxuriant black that suited her angular features and smoky voice but ive got worry down to a science she said since they were almost of identical heights ally had only to shift closer to kiss cilias cheek well you can take a break im fine really i suppose you look it come on inside i can make some more coffee no youre on your way out i just needed to see you to touch you cilia thought my baby im heading into work im interviewing a new sales manager at khip your dads dropping me off you can use my car today how did you know i needed a car i have connections boyd told her you should have yours back by midafternoon i wouldve handled it ally shut the door behind her frowned meaning you would have handled the car and overton and the tangle of bureaucracy cilia put in i hope i didnt raise a daughter whos ungrateful and who expects her father to stand back with his hands in his pockets when something happens to her cilia tilted her head lifted her brows id be very disappointed if i had boyd grinned slipped an arm around cilias shoulders and pressed his lips to her hair good one ally muttered properly chastised thank you dad youre welcome allison now which one of us is going to go beat the tar out of dennis overton cilia rubbed her hands together or can we all do it in which case i get to go first she has violent tendencies ally pointed out tell me about it down girl he told cilia let the system work now detective boyd draped his arm around his daughters shoulders as well as they walked to the elevator youre to report to the hospital first theres a suspect who needs to be questioned the inquiry into the shooting will proceed this morning youll need to give your statement and file your report by ten hundred detective hickman filed his last night which gives a very clear picture you dont have anything to worry about im not worried i know i did what i had to do it gave me some bad moments last night she blew out a breath some pretty bad ones but im okay with it now as okay as it gets i guess you shouldnt have been alone last night cilia said actually i had a friend with me for a while boyd opened his mouth shut it again after allys call the night before hed contacted kiniki immediately he knew that jonah had driven ally home from the hospital so he had a good idea just who the friend was but he had no idea how he felt about it ally pulled in to the hospital visitors lot circled until she found a space she spotted hickman as she set the locks and alarm nice ride he commented hands in pockets eyes squinted into slits against the brilliant sunshine not every cops got themselves a mercedes as a backup vehicle its my mothers you got some mother hed seen cilia so he knew it was true so hows it going okay she fell into step beside him look i know you already filed your report on last nights incident i appreciate you getting it in so fast and backing me up it happened the way it happened if it smoothes any edges for you you should know that you fired about a split hair before i did if id been in the lead instead of you idve been the one to take her out thanks any word on dietz still critical hickmans expression darkened he made it through the night so thats hopeful i want a round with the son of a bitch who put him here get in line you know how you want to play it ive been thinking about it they moved together across the lobby to the bank of elevators she made a call from her cell phone that puts at least one other person in on the deal i say two whoevers inside the club and somebody pushing the buttons organizing our guy here shot a cop so he knows hes going down hard his wifes dead his operations broken and hes looking at death row doesnt give him much incentive to talk you going to deal him a life sentence thats the road lets make sure he walks it she showed her badge to the uniform on guard at frickss door walked through fricks lay in bed his skin pale slightly gray his eyes were blurred but open his gaze passed over ally and hickman then returned to contemplate the ceiling i have nothing to say i want a lawyer well that makes our job easier hickman walked over to the bed pursed his lips doesnt look like a cop killer does he fletcher hes not yet dietz might make it of course this guy heres still looking at being strapped to a table and being put down like a sick dog nighttime b and e burglary possession of an unregistered weapon assault with a deadly attempted murder of a police officer she moved her shoulders and plenty more where that came from i have nothing to say then shut up she suggested why try to help yourself trust a lawyer to take care of everything but im not in the mood to make deals with lawyers how about you hickman nope cant say thats my mood at this time were not in the mood ally repeated not when we have a fellow officer fighting for his life up in intensive care that really puts us off lawyers who look for ways to wiggle cop killers out of the noose right hickman yeah puts me right off i dont see any reason we should give this guy any kind of a break i say let him hang for it all by himself well we ought to look at the big picture though show a little compassion he lost his wife last night she watched the ripple of pain run over frickss face before he closed his eyes there she thought was the key to him thats rough his wifes dead and hes lying here shot up and looking at a death sentence ally lifted her shoulders let them fall maybe hes not thinking how other people people who helped put him in this situation could walk away clean clean and rich while hes twisting in the wind on a very short rope and his wife gets put in the ground she leaned over the bed but he ought to be thinking about it of course maybe he didnt love his wife dont talk to me about madeline his voice wavered she was my heart really im touched that touches me now mat might not hold any weight with hickman here but me ive got a soft spot for true love since i do im going to tell you you ought to be thinking how you can help yourself now because if you were her heart she wouldnt want you to go down for this alone his eyes flickered then closed you ought to be thinking that if you cooperate and tell us what we want to know well go to the da and press for a little leniency show some remorse now richard reach out thatll go a long way toward keeping you off a table in a little room a few years down the road i talk im already dead ally shot hickman a glance youll get protection frickss eyes were still closed but tears began to leak out of them i loved my wife i know you did ally lowered the bed guard so she could sit beside him intimacy now she thought sympathy and infused her voice with both i saw you together at blackhawks the way you looked at each other tells me you had something special between you sheshes gone but you tried to save her didnt you richard you ran out of the house first to cover for her thats why youre in this jam she loved you shed want you to help yourself shed want you to go on living to do whatever you had to do to go on richard you tried to save her last night drawing the cops off her so she could get away you did what you could now youve got to save yourself no one was supposed to get hurt the guns were just a precaution to scare anybody off if something went wrong thats right you didnt plan on this i believe that thatll make a difference how this all comes out for you things just got out of control nothing ever went wrong before she panicked thats all she just panicked and i couldnt think of anything else to do you didnt mean to hurt anybody ally kept her voice quiet compassionate even while the image of dietz bleeding on the ground ran through her mind you just wanted to give her time to get away she took a moment while he wept howd you get past the alarm systems ive got a knack for electronics he took the tissues she handed him wiped his eyes i worked in security people dont always remember to set their alarms anyway but when they did i could usually disarm them if i couldnt it was a wash and we walked away where have they put madeline where is she well talk about that help me out here and ill do what i can to arrange for you to see her who called you from the club richard to tell you something was wrong with the barneses was it the same person madeline called from the car he let out a sobbing breath shook his head i want immunity hickman let out a snort made a move to draw ally off the bed make her the protector the son of a bitch wants immunity youre bending over backward to help him out and he wants a walk screw him let him hang hold on just hold on cant you see the mans upset lying here like this he cant even make arrangements for his wifes funeral she fricks turned his head away and his chest heaved once she wanted to be cremated it was important to her we can help you arrange that we can help you give her what she wanted you have to give us something back immunity listen richard you cant ask for the moon and stars on this one now i could make you promises but im being straight with you best i can do is leniency we dont need him ally hickman picked up the chart at the foot of the bed scanned it we got him cold and well pick up the rest of the pieces within a couple of days hes right ally let out a sigh looked back at fricks a couple of days maybe less well have all the answers but if you save us some time some trouble prove youre remorseful over shooting that cop i can promise to go to bat for you we know there are other people involved its just a matter of time before we get to them help me out ill help you ill help you do what you need to do for madeline thats fair it was her brother he said it between his teeth then opened his eyes they were no longer blurry no longer wet but burning dry with hate he talked her into it he could talk her into anything it was going to be an adventure exciting he set it up all of it hes the reason shes dead where is he he has a house down in littleton big house on the lake his names matthew lyle and hell be coming after me for what happened to madeline hes crazy i tell you hes crazy and hes obsessed with her hell kill me okay dont worry he wont get near you ally took out her notebook tell me more about matthew lyle at four that afternoon jonah was settled behind his desk trying to work he was furious with himself for calling ally three times twice at home once at the station and equally furious shed made no attempt to get back to him hed decided hed made a very big mistake by walking out of her apartment instead of staying with her in the dark in the bed instead of taking what he wanted it was a mistake hed have to live with and he was certain he could live with it more comfortably than live with the options all he wanted now was the simple courtesy of information damn it she owed him that hed let her into his life into his business let her work side by side with his friends while she deceived them while he deceived them now by god he wanted answers he snatched the phone up again just as the elevator doors slid open and ally walked through i still had your code saying nothing he replaced the receiver she was dressed for work he noted cop work ill make a note to have it changed her eyebrows rose but she continued across the room and dropped comfortably into the chair across from his desk i figured youd want an update you figured correctly something was in his craw she noted theyd get to that later fricks rolled over on his brotherinlaw matthew lyle aka lyle matthews aka lyle delaney computer crimes mostly with some assaults hes got a long sheet but most of the charges were dumped insufficient evidence deals did some psych time though hes cleared out we hit his place a couple of hours ago and hes gone she paused long enough to rub her eyes didnt have time to take everything with him the house was packed with stolen goods from what it looks like theyve turned very little if anything place looked like an auction house oh and youre going to be short a waitress tonight i didnt think youd be reporting for work tonight no i didnt mean me jan according to fricks she and lyle are she lifted a hand crossed two fingers very close shes the inside man scanned for the marks passed the credit card number to lyle via beeper the fricks move in she helps cover for them while they lift the keys then she alerts them with another code when the targets call for their check gives the fricks time to finish up clear out very smooth all in all have you got her no doesnt look like she went home last night my guess is she went straight to lyle and they went under together we will get her well get them both i dont doubt it i suppose that ends your association with blackhawks looks like she rose wandered to the window he had the blinds shut today so she tapped a slat up looked out ill need to interview your people i thought theyd feel more comfortable if i did it here do you have any problem with me using your office for it no great ill start with you get it out of the way she came back to sit took out her notepad tell me what you know about jan shes worked here about a year she was good at her job a favorite with a number of the regulars had a knack for remembering names she was reliable and efficient did you have a personal relationship with her no but youre aware she lives in the same apartment building as frannie is that against the law how did you come to hire her she applied for the job frannie has nothing to do with this i didnt say she did ally took a photo out of her bag have you ever seen this man in here jonah glanced at the police photo of a darkhaired man of about thirty no see him anywhere else no is this lyle thats right why are you angry with me irritated he corrected coolly id classify it as irritated i dont care to be interrogated by the police im a cop jonah thats a fact she put the photo back into her bag ive got a job to finish thats another fact and im hung up on you theres fact number three now maybe all of mat irritates you but thats the way it is id like to start the interviews now he got to his feet as she did youre right it all irritates me there you go id appreciate it if youd send will up now and stay downstairs i might need to speak with you again he came around the desk her eyes narrowed flashed a cold warning as he approached her they stayed level and cool when he gripped the lapels of her jacket and hauled her to her toes a dozen desires all of them impossible ran through his mind you push too many of my buttons he muttered and releasing her walked away same goes but she said it quietly after hed gone so frannie lit a cigarette peered at ally through the haze of smoke youre a cop i mightve figured it if jonah hadnt been with you he doesnt like cops any more than i do frannie had put on an attitude ally noted and nodded now theres breaking news listen lets make this as painless as possible for everyone youve got the rundown on the burglary ring how the club was used jans part in it ive got what youve decided to tell me now that youre wearing your badge thats right and thats all you need how long have you known her about a year and a half i guess i ran into her in the laundry room of my apartment building she was waiting tables in a bar i worked in a bar frannie lifted her shoulders we hung out together now and again i liked her well enough when jonah opened this place i helped get her a job does that make me an accessory no it makes you a jerk for copping an attitude with me she ever mention a boyfriend she liked men and men liked her frannie ally shifted decided to play another angle maybe you dont like cops but theres one on the critical list right now and hes a friend of mine theyre still not sure hell make it hes got two kids and a wife who loves him another womans dead somebody loved her too you want to go a round with me on personal business fine lets just get this done first frannie made a little shrugging movement again she talked about this one guy sometimes never told me his name liked to be mysterious about it but she said things like pretty soon she wouldnt be hauling trays and bagging tips she got up crossed over to open the panel to the bar in a way that told ally she was very at home in jonahs space she pulled out a soft drink twisted off the cap i figured it was talk she liked to talk big about men conquests you know did you ever see her with this guy ally nudged the photo across the desk sipping from the bottle frannie walked back studied the photo maybe yeah frannie scratched her jaw i saw them come into the building together a couple of times didnt seem like her type is what i thought hes kinda short a little pudgy ordinary jan she went more for flash studs with platinum cards was her usual type catching herself frannie shook her head dropped into a chair that sounds hard i liked her look shes young maybe a little foolish but shes not mean you might want to keep in mind that she used you jonah and this place now did she ever mention anyplace they went together any plans no well she mightve said something about a place on a lake i didnt pay much attention when she started bragging most of it was just air ally questioned her for another fifteen minutes but didnt jiggle anything loose okay if you think of anything id appreciate a call rising ally offered frannie a card sure frannie skimmed her eyes over it detective fletcher would you ask beth to come up please why the hell dont you leave her alone she doesnt know anything but i have such a good time intimidating and threatening potential witnesses she came around the desk sat on the corner okay theres the bell go ahead with your personal round i dont like the way you came in here the way you used us and spied on us i know how it works you did a background check on everybody pried into all our lives and sat in judgment i guess youre sorry it turned out to be jan instead of the former hooker youre wrong i like you off balance frannie sat again bull why shouldnt i like you you got yourself out of a spiral that only goes down youve got a legitimate job and youre good at it the only problem i have with you is jonah what do you mean jonah youve got a relationship with him im attracted to him thats makes you a personal problem for me baffled now frannie took out another cigarette i dont get you you mean it about jonah she said after a minute youve got a thing for him it looks like but the problems mine like i said i like you in fact i admire the way you turned your life around i never had to do that never had to face those kinds of things make those kind of choices id like to think id do as well as you have if i had damn it frannie pushed to her feet paced the room damn it she repeated okay first i dont have a relationship with jonah not like you mean never did he never bought me when i was for sale and he never touched me that way when i was free even when i offered though a fine sense of relief ran through her ally kept her voice mild is he blind or stupid frannie stopped pacing took a long hard look i dont want to like you youre sure making it tough not to i love him a long time ago i loved him different than i do now we grew up together more or less i mean weve known each other since we were kids me and jonah and will we go back i know it shows when i was working corners jonahd come by sometimes pay me for the night then hed take me for coffee or something to eat and that was it frannies eyes softened he always was a sucker are we talking about the same man if he cares about you thats it hell keep pulling you up no matter how many times you fall down again bite his hand hell just ignore you and haul you up you cant fight that you cant fight that kind of thing for long i didnt make it easy for him with a sigh she walked over to sit again picked up the soft drink finished it off a few years ago i was scraping the bottom of the gutter id been on the stroll since i was fifteen by the time i hit twenty i was used up so i figured what the hell lets just get out of this whole mess i started to slash my wrists seemed just dramatic enough she held out a hand turned it over to expose the scar on the inside of her left wrist only got to the one and didnt do such a hot job on it what stopped you first the blood really put me off the idea she said with a surprisingly cheerful laugh anyway im standing there in this filthy bathroom stoned bleeding and i got scared really scared i called jonah i dont know what wouldve happened if i hadnt reached him if he hadnt come he got me to the hospital then he got me into detox she sat back tracing a finger over the scar as if it brought the memory back with more clarity then he asked me something hed asked me a hundred times before he asked me if i wanted a life this time i said yes then he helped me make one along the way i thought i should pay him back and i offered what i was used to offering men it was the only time he ever really got pissed off she smiled a little he thought more of me than i did of myself nobody else ever had if i knew anything about jan or this business id tell you because hed want me to and theres nothing i wouldnt do for him from where im standing you both got a good deal ive never once had a man look at me the way ive seen him look at you then youve got your eyes shut it was allys turn to smile keep them open tonight when will asks for his afterclosing brandy will come on keep your eyes open ally said again are we square here yeah sure i guess confused frannie got to her feet again ask beth to come up just give me five minutes to find my brass knuckles with a half laugh frannie went to the elevator after pushing the button she glanced back will knows what i was i guess he knows what you are too she wrapped up the last interview by seven circled her shoulders and wondered if there was a possibility of food any time in her near future the clock told her she was officially off duty and since she had nothing to add to the current status of the case her reports and followups could wait till morning still she helped herself to the use of jonahs phone checking in giving updates she was sitting quietly at his desk when he came in dietz the cop who was shot last night theyve upgraded his condition from critical to serious closing her eyes she pressed her fingers against them it looks like hes going to make it im glad to hear it yeah she pulled the clip out of her hair ran her fingers through it it sure fills this big hole in my gut i appreciate the use of your office i can tell you that the rest of your people arent suspects at this time at this time i cant give you more than that blackhawk all evidence points to the fact that jan and jan alone worked the inside its the best i can do she tossed the clip on his desk now ive got something else to say which is im off duty can i have a drink i happen to have a club just downstairs i was thinking of a private drink from your private bar she gestured toward the panel if you could spare a glass of wine i noticed a nice sauvignon blanc in there he turned toward the panel opened it selected the bottle why dont you join me im still on duty i dont drink during working hours i noticed that dont drink dont smoke dont hit on the customers during working hours she added he turned back the glass of pale gold wine in his hand and watched her take off her jacket i hope you dont mind she said then shrugged out of her holster i find it awkward to seduce men when im wearing my weapon she laid it on his desk then walked toward him chapter one might have taken off her gun jonah thought but she wasnt unarmed a woman with eyes as potent as whiskey and a voice like smoke would never be without a weapon worse she knew it that longbow mouth was curved up just a little like a cats when the canary cage was open he didnt much care for his role as target your wine he held out the glass a deliberate move to keep an armspan of distance between then and though i appreciate the thought i dont have time for a seduction at the moment oh it shouldnt take very long she imagined hed devastated countless women with that careless almost absent dismissal for her it was only a challenge she had every confidence of meeting she took the wine and moved right in grabbing a fistful of his shirt to hold him in place i really like the look of you blackhawk hot mouth cool eyes she took a sip of wine watching him over the rim i want to see more his senses went blade sharp the muscles of his belly tied themselves into a dozen hard and tangled knots you get right to it dont you you said you were in a hurry she rose on her toes to nip her teeth into his bottom lip and sliced a jagged line of need straight through him so im picking up the pace i dont like sexually aggressive women her laugh was low mocking you dont like cops either thats exactly right then this is going to be very unpleasant for you thats a shame she leaned in skimmed her tongue up the side of his neck i want you to touch me i want you to put your hands on me he kept them at his sides but in his mind they were already ripping at her shirt already taking like i said its a nice offer but i can feel your heart pounding she shook her hair back and the scent of it slithered into his system i can feel the way you want me the same way i want you some of us learn to shelve certain wants she saw the change in his eyes the faintest deepening of green dead giveaway she thought and some of us dont she took another sip of wine then moved forward walking him backward i guess im going to have to get rough mortified shed put him in retreat he stopped short nearly groaning when her body bumped his youre going to embarrass yourself drink your wine detective fletcher and go home she imagined he thought his voice was clipped dismissive but it was thick and strained and his heart was a fury under her fist what is that answer youre always giving me no yes thats it she drained her glass so the wine pumped in with the reckless power surging through her no she said again and tossing the glass aside hooked a hand in the waistband of his trousers aroused and furious he retreated again cut it out make me she threw her head back then leaped arms wrapping around his neck legs vised around his waist come on and make me youve got plenty of moves her mouth swooped down to tease his and she tasted a wild wonderful mix of desire and temper take me down she whispered raking her hands through his hair finish it finish me his blood was raging the taste of her hot and female with the faint zip of wine was on his tongue youre asking for trouble so she rubbed her lips over his as if imprinting her flavor on him give it to me control snapped he could hear it echo in his head like the violent crack of hammer against stone he gripped her hair wrapping it around his hand yanking it back so that she let out a little gasp as her head flew back the lines crossed his eyes werent cool now they simmered as if a bolt of lightning had struck a pool youll give me everything i want what you dont give ill take thats the deal her breath was already quickened done his gaze lowered to the long vulnerable curve of her throat then he set his teeth on her her body jerked against his as the shock of that threat of pain that lance of pleasure stabbed into her then she was falling clinging to him as she tumbled into the shadows into the dark she lost her breath when she hit the bed lost her grip when his body covered hers then for a moment when he tore her shirt open she lost her mind floundering for balance she threw an arm up her knuckles thudded against the bedspread then her fingers dug in wait no his mouth was on her breast ravaging tender flesh with lips and teeth and tongue she fought for air fought to find the power that had been hers just moments before instead she found herself spinning past control past reason his hands were on her as she had demanded and they were hard and fast ruthlessly exploiting weakness secrets she hadnt known shed possessed then his mouth came back to hers hot and greedy the low sound in her throat was equal parts terror and triumph leaping recklessly toward the heat she met demand with demand she went wild beneath him writhing bucking reaching hed wanted nothing less if he was to sin he would sin fully and reap all the pleasure before the punishment her skin seemed to burn under his hands his mouth he craved the long clean lines of her the taut and ready strength the delicate give of curves he rolled with her over the wide pool of the bed taking what and how he wanted she tugged at his shirt sending buttons flying then letting out a sound of feral delight when flesh met flesh when he dragged her to her knees she trembled but there was nothing of fear left in her she could see his eyes the predatory gleam of them from the backwash of light from the office she let out a ragged breath as she ran her hands up his chest into his hair more she told him and crushed her mouth to his and there was more lightning quick flashes of unbearable ecstasy gusts of shuddering desperation and a flood of needs that swamped them both he tugged the slacks down her hips following the path of exposed flesh with his mouth until she was shuddering and mindlessly murmuring his name in that hoarse erotic voice he couldnt get out of head his teeth scraped her inner thigh sent the strong muscles quivering when she arched opened he feasted on her she cried out as the orgasm ripped through her fisted her hands in the bedclothes and let each glorious aftershock batter her until her system wept with the pleasure of it heat swarmed up her body through her and she embraced it reveled in the breathless power of what they made together now jonah no he couldnt get enough of her each time he thought desperation would overpower him he found something new to tantalize him the subtle flare of her hips the narrow dip of her waist he wanted to feel the bite of her nails on him again hear that choked cry of release when he dragged her over the next edge her breath was sobbing his own so clogged in his lungs he thought they would burst from it he moved up her again while her hands raced over him and her body bucked he could see her eyes and nothing else just the dark glint of them watching him as he rose over her he held back for one quivering instant then plunged here was everything the thought stabbed through him then shattered in his brain as she closed hot and tight around him she rose to him fell with him the slick slide of bodies mating sighed with him as pleasure shimmered her heart thundered against his beat for beat their breath mixed drawing him deeper so that his mouth was on hers another link as they moved together the tempo quickened so that the slide became a slap and sighs broke into gasps and moans her hips pistoned as he pounded into her as sensations staggered her she raked her nails down his back dug them into his hips urging him on even as she was swamped by the next crest he felt himself slipa glorious feeling of surrenderand with his face buried in the tumbled mass of her hair he fell it was over for him he knew it the minute his system leveled and his mind began to work again hed never get over her never get past her with one sweep shed destroyed a lifetime of careful avoidance now he was stupidly helplessly irretrievably in love with her nothing could be more impossible or more dangerous she could slice him to pieces no one had ever been allowed to have that kind of control or power over him he didnt mean to let that change now he needed some sort of defense and determined to start building it he rolled away from her she simply rolled with him stretched that long limber body of hers over his and said mmmmm another time he might have laughed or at least felt that kneejerk of pure male satisfaction instead he felt a light trip of panic well you got what you wanted fletcher instead of being insulted which would have given him a little room to regroup she just nuzzled his neck damn right to please herself she hooked a leg around him then shifted to straddle him and slick back her hair i like your body blackhawk all tough and rangy and taut she trailed a finger over his chest admiring the contrast of her skin against his youve got some native american blood right apache very diluted it looks good on you he twirled a lock of her hair around his finger white bread he said dryly but it looks good on you she leaned down until they were nose to nose now that were all cozy and complimentary how about doing me a favor and that would be food im starving want a menu no umm she tilted her head teased his mouth with hers just something thats on it maybe you could send down for something she trailed her lips down to his jaw back up to his mouth and we could you know fuel up mind if i grab a shower no he rolled her onto her back but youll have to wait until im done with you oh she smiled well a deals a deal and when he was done with her she staggered more than walked into the bathroom she closed the door leaned back against it and let out a long puff of breath shed never had to work harder to maintain a careless sophisticated image then again shed never had anyone turn her inside out and leave her jittering like a mass of jelly before not that she was complaining ally told herself as she rubbed the heel of her hand over her heart but her idea that sex was simply a pleasant occupation between two consenting adults who hopefully cared about each other had been forever shattered pleasant didnt begin to describe making love with jonah blackhawk waiting for her system to level again she scanned the bathroom hed indulged himself here she noted with the deep whydontyoujoinme whirlpool tub in his customary jetblack though it looked tempting she thought shed settle for the separate shower enclosed by seeded glass the sink was a wide scoop in a sheer black counter nothing stood on it no pieces of him left out for the casual eye to study just as there were no pieces no odds and ends memorabilia or personal photographs in his office or bedroom she was tempted to poke in the cabinet rifle through a couple of the drawerswhat kind of shaving cream did he use what brand of toothpastebut it seemed so pitifully obvious instead she crossed the white tiles and studied her own face in the mirror her eyes were soft her mouth still swollen from that wonderful assault of his there were a number of faint bruises shadowing her skin all in all she decided she looked just the way she felt like a woman happily used but what did he see when he looked at her she wondered when he looked at her in that cool distant way he wanted her she could have no doubts about that but did he feel nothing else did he think she hadnt noticed the way hed drawn back from her both times after passion had been spent as if his need for separation was as deep as his desire and why was she letting it hurt her it was such a female reaction well i am a female damn it she muttered and turned to switch on the shower if he thought he was going to get away with nudging her back whenever he pleased he was very much mistaken the man was not going to rock her to her toes then stroll away while she was still teetering she stuck her head under the spray mumbling to herself she expected a lot more giveandtake in a relationship and if he couldnt trouble himself to give her a little affection along with the heat well then he could she trailed off winced she sounded like dennis she thought or at least close enough at least she could stop that before she dug herself a hole too deep to crawl out of the only relationship she had with jonah was a physical one and she herself had insisted on it both of them knew the ground rules and were smart enough not to need them spelled out if she needed to mix emotion in with desire that was fine that was okay but it was also her problem satisfied shed solved the matter in her own mind she turned off the taps turned for a towel and let out one wild yelp when she saw jonah holding one out for her most people sing in the shower he commented youre the first ive come across who talks to herself in the shower i was not she snatched the towel okay it was more unintelligible mumbling fine most people knock before they come into an occupied bathroom i did but you couldnt hear me because you were talking to yourself i thought you might want this he held up his other hand and the black silk robe that dangled from his fingers yeah thanks she wrapped the towel around herself anchored it with a hand between her breasts dinnerll be up in a minute idly he skimmed a fingertip down her arm sliding water over flesh good i need to get my weapon off your desk i moved it frowning now he traced the curve of her shoulder i put it in the bedroom the doors closed theyll just leave the tray on my desk works for me when she felt the brush of his finger over her collarbone she released her hold on the towel let it fall to her feet is this what youre looking for i shouldnt want you again already eyes on hers he backed her against the wall i shouldnt need you again then walk away she tugged down the zipper on the trousers hed pulled on whos stopping you he closed a hand around her throat though the pulse under his fingers jumped she merely lifted her chin and dared him tell me you want me he demanded say my name and that you want me jonah she took the first step onto a bridge she knew could burn away under her feet ive never wanted anyone the way i want you her breath hitched as she drew it in but her eyes remained steady give it back to me allison he lowered his forehead to hers in a gesture so weary and sweet she reached out to comfort him i cant think for wanting you just you he murmured then took her mouth took her body desperately i gotta say ally commented as she ate like a starving wolf youve got a really good kitchen a lot of clubs the foods mediocre at best but yours um she licked barbecue sauce from her thumb its firstclass she shook her head when he picked up the wine to top off her glass no uhuh im driving stay another rule broken he thought he never asked a woman to stay i would if i could smiling she tugged on the lapel of the borrowed robe but i dont have a change for tomorrow and im back on eighttofours as it is im going to have to borrow a shirt from you to get home you did a number on mine he did no more than pick up his own glass but she felt him retreat ask me to come back tomorrow and stay he looked back at her come back tomorrow and stay okay look at that look at that that runner was safe out by a half step jonah corrected amused that shed nearly come off the sofa when the play on the wide screen caught her eye bull you watch the instant replay they hit the bag at the same time tie goes to the runner see managers coming out give him hell anyway satisfied the requisite argument would proceed over a controversial call she turned her attention back to jonah she smiled rubbed her bare feet intimately against his hip pretty good deal from my point of view good sex good food and a ball game to some he reached down to trace a finger up her instep paradise since were in paradise can i ask you something really important all right are you going to eat all those fries he grinned at her shoved the plate in her direction then leaned over to answer the phone blackhawk yes he held out the portable receiver for you detective i left this number when i logged out she told him and took the phone fletcher she straightened on the sofa and her eyes went flat where im on my way she was already on her feet when she tossed the receiver on the hook they found jan where is she on her way to the morgue i have to go im going with you theres no point in it she worked for me he said simply and walked into the bedroom jonah had seen and done a great deal in the first half of his life hed thought hed seen and done everything hed seen death but hed never seen it stripped bare in cold antiseptic surroundings he looked through the glass at the young woman and felt nothing but raw pity i can verify id ally said beside him but its cleaner procedure if the visual comes from somebody else who knew her is that janet norton yes she nodded to the technician behind the glass and he lowered the blinds i dont know how long ill be ill wait theres coffee down this corridor and to the left its crap but its usually hot and strong she reached for the door hesitated listen if you change your mind and want to go just go ill wait he said again it didnt take her long when she came out he was sitting in one of the molded plastic chairs at the end of the hallway her footsteps clicked on the linoleum and the clicks echoed nothing much to do until the autopsy reports in how did she die when ally shook her head he got to his feet how it cant be that big a dent in the rules to tell me she was stabbed multiple wounds by what appears to be a long bladed knife with a serrated edge her body was dumped on the side of the road off southbound just a few miles outside of denver he threw her purse out with her he wanted us to find her and id her quickly and thats it for you just identify her and put another piece in the puzzle she didnt snap back she recognized the chill in his eyes as temper on a short leash and her own was straining lets get out of here ally headed out she wanted to fill her lungs with fresh air from the number of wounds it appears she was killed with considerable rage wheres yours he shoved the door open or dont you feel any she strode out ahead of him dont slap at me he grabbed her arm whirled her around she led with her fist and pulled it an inch from his jaw you want rage she shoved away from him ill give you some rage from the looks of things she was getting sliced to pieces while i was rolling around on the sheets with you now ask how i feel he caught her before she got to the car and wrenched the door open im sorry she tried to shrug him off then push him away but when she spun around snarling he just wrapped his arms around her im sorry he said it quietly pressing his lips to her hair i was out of line we both know it wouldnt have made any difference where we were or what we were doing this would have happened no it wouldnt have made any difference and still two people are dead she drew away i cant afford rage can you understand that yes he took the clip out of her hair rubbed the back of her neck id like to go home with you id like to be with you tonight good because thats what id like too she slid into the car waiting for him to climb into the passenger seat they both needed to set aside the rage she knew and the guilt i have to get up really early he smiled at her i dont okay she pulled out of the lot that means you get to make up the bed and do the dishes thats the deal does it also mean that you make the coffee it does ill take the deal when she reached her building she pulled into the underground garage tomorrow might be a long one she told him does it matter what time i get to your place no he got out of the car came around to her side then held out his hand for her keys so what did you take like a charm school course or something top of my class i have a plaque he pressed the button for the elevator now some women are insecure and find the simple courtesy of a man opening doors for them or pulling out then chair whatever troubling naturally youre secure enough in your own power and femininity not to be troubled naturally she agreed and rolled her eyes as he gestured her into the elevator then he took her hand and made her smile i like your style blackhawk i havent been able to pin it down not exactly but i like it she angled her head to study him you used to play baseball right that and your father kept me in high school basketball was my game you ever shoot hoops now and then want to shoot some with me on sunday i might he walked out of the elevator with her what time oh lets say two ill pick you up we can go she broke off shifting in front of him fast and pulling her weapon keep back dont touch anything he saw it now the fresh scrape and pry marks on the door she used two fingers on the knob turned it then booted the door open with her foot she went in low slapping the lights on starting her sweep even as jonah stepped in front of her get back what are you crazy one of the things i learned in charm school was not to use a woman as a shield this woman happens to be the one with the badge and the gun i noticed besides hed already scanned the debris of the room hes long gone she knew it felt it but there were rules and procedure well pardon the hell out of me while i play cop and make sure dont touch anything she said again and stepping over a broken lamp checked the rest of the apartment she was swearing in a low steady voice as she headed for the phone your old friend dennis jonah asked maybe but i dont think so lyle was heading south out of denver she jabbed her fingers into the keypad on the phone i think i just found out what he was doing here this is detective fletcher ive had a breakin even before the crime scene unit arrived ally snapped on protective gloves and began to do inventory her stereo components good ones hadnt been stolen but they had been smashed her laptop computer and the small tv that stood above the stereo had received the same treatment every table lamp in the placeincluding the antique bookkeepers light shed bought for her deskwas broken her sofa had a long gash from end to end and the guts of it spilled out in nasty puffs hed poured the half gallon of paint shed bought then had never gotten around to using in the middle of her bed over the bed hed slopped a message in the same paint try to sleep at night he blames me for his sisters death he knows i was the one how does he know jan jonah said from behind her she has to be the one who warned them something was wrong that night he continued when ally turned you got the barneses back to their table but they were still both gone for an unusual amount of time they were nervous upset she picked up on it maybe she nodded as she walked back out of the bedroom it was enough to make her start thinking worrying she didnt notice when i left she was busy but frannie did she might have mentioned it to jan in passing she picked her way through the living room into the kitchen so she called it off but just a little too late too late to save his sister doesnt look like he bothered much in here nothing worth smashing i guess she broke off walked slowly to the counter oh god when she turned her eyes were wide and horrified my bread knife she laid her fingertips on the knife block with one empty slot long blade with serrated edge god jonah he killed her with my own knife chapter one wasnt going to let it shake her she couldnt for a cop she reminded herself nerves were as costly as rage and just as dangerous the breakin at her apartment was a direct and personal attack her only choice was to stand up to it maintain her objectivity and do the job shed sworn to do when the crime scene unit had left adding their wreckage to what lyle had left behind him she hadnt argued with jonah hed told her to pack what she thought she needed she was moving in with him until it was over neither of them talked about the giant step they were taking they told themselves it was simply a logical and convenient arrangement then they had slept tangled together for what was left of the night weve doubled the guards on fricks kiniki told her at the morning briefing lyle cant get to him hes too smart to try ally stood in her lieutenants office hands in pockets the horror had dulled and the thin edge of fear was over he can wait and he will hes not in any hurry to pay fricks back for what he might see as his part in his sisters death behind the glass wall of kinikis office the phones in the bullpen rang and detectives went about the business of the day ally put herself into the mind of a dead woman shed known for a matter of days jan norton was easy it was all an adventure to her romantic exciting she was with him and thought she was safe with him the canvass of my building turned up two neighbors who saw a couple fitting lyles and jans description enter the building at around eight oclock holding hands she added she helped him trash my place then once they were on the road again he killed her she stopped having a purpose shed had plenty of time to think it through lying awake through the darkest hours of the night in jonahs bed he doesnt do anything without a purpose theres a lot of anger in him for what he sees as the privileged class theres a pattern in his background in his previous arrests all of them involve crimes against wealththe hacking the burglaries even the assaults were against wealthy superiors at his job when he held a computer programming position she pulled her hands out of her pockets ticked off her fingers wealth authority authority wealth theyre synonymous to him and both need to be taken down a peg hes smarter than they are why should they have the easy life in her mind she flipped through the steadily growing file of data on lyle matthews he grew up on the bottom rung of lower middle class not quite poor but never really comfortable his father had a history of unemployment always moving from one job to another his stepfather was arrogant and domineering lyle followed the same patterns the supervisors and coworkers ive been able to contact all said the same basic thing hes brilliant with tech stuff but socially retarded hes arrogant belligerent and a loner he came from a broken home and both of his parents are dead the only person he was ever close to was his sister ally walked to the glass wall looked out his sister played into his weaknesses fed his monumental ego one enabled the other now shes gone and hes got no one but himself where would he go not far ally calculated hes not finished yet he has me to deal with the barneses blackhawk i think your instincts are on target weve put mr and mrs barnes in a safe house that leaves you and blackhawk she turned back i dont intend to take any unnecessary chances but i have to keep visible maintain a routine or hell just go under and wait me out he has my name my address hes probably got a reasonable description he wants me to know it to sweat it well stake out your building he may come back there he doesnt want to just pick me off its not personal enough and i dont think ill be his first target blackhawk yeah in order of importance jonahs next and as for blackhawk hes not cooperating and it still irked that hed dismissed her idea of arranging protection we can keep a couple of men on him at a distance you could keep them two miles away and hed spot them then hed lose them on principle lieutenant im close to him he trusts me i can take care of it you have an investigation to run detective and your own butt to cover i can do a considerable amount of all three at his club and the fact is i believe we might lure lyle out push him into making a move if he sees me with blackhawk routinely its doubtful he knows you killed his sister weve had a lid on that since the incident but he knows i was part of the operation the part inside the club that blackhawk and i worked together and started the steps that caused his sisters death agreed im putting two men on blackhawk for the next seventytwo hours then well reevaluate yes sir on a different matter youre aware that dennis overtons fingerprints were found on your hubcaps your wheel wells a search of his car turned up a recently purchased hunting knife the lab work isnt back but there were bits of tire rubber on the blade hes been fired from the district attorneys office theyd like to file formal charges sir toughen your spine fletcher if you dont file charges he can walk if you do the da will recommend psych evaluation he needs it or do you want to wait until he shifts his obsession from you to somebody else no no i dont ill take care of it do it now one lunatic out there after one of my detectives is enough the fact that he was right didnt make it any easier ally walked out to the squad room plopped down at her desk and decided she deserved at least thirty seconds to brood shed made mistakes with dennis right from the beginning hadnt paid enough attention hadnt picked up on the cues none of that was any excuse for his behavior but it did weigh into her part in triggering it whats the problem fletcher the boss ream you she glanced up at hickman who made himself at home with his butt on the edge of her desk no im about to ream somebody he bit into his midmorning danish that usually puts me in a pretty chipper mood thats because youre a heartless jerk i love it when you flatter me if i tell you youre a brainless moron would you do me a favor he took another bite sprinkled crumbs on her desk my life for you baby i have to file on dennis overton when the warrant comes through would you pick him up he knows you it might be a little easier on him sure ally hes not worth the regrets i know it she got to her feet pulled her jacket from the back of her chair then she smiled broke off a corner of his danish and popped it into her mouth youre ugly too girl of my dreams marry me grateful hickman knew how to lighten her mood ally headed out two hours later she was walking into her fathers office he met her at the door this time ran his hands up and down her arms while he studied her face then he simply pulled her into his good to see you he murmured she burrowed in let herself absorb his strength his stability youre always there you and mom no matter what youre right there i just wanted to say that first shes worried about you i know im sorry for it listen she gave him an extra squeeze then drew back i know youre uptodate but i wanted you to know im okay and im handling it lyle cant wait long to make a move hes got nobody now everything weve got on him indicates he needs somebody a woman to admire him feed his ego play his games with him alone hell break i agree and its my assessment mat its a woman hell want most to punish youre elected agreed hes already made his first big mistake by breaking into my place he exposed himself he left prints everywhere his grief his anger pushed him to show me what he is and what he wants using my knife to kill jan mat was his way of saying it could have been me so far we have no argument why are you alone he wont move on me during the day he works at night im not going to take stupid chances dad thats a promise i wanted you to know ive filed charges against dennis good i dont want you hassled and i dont want you distracted i went by your apartment this morning ive got some serious redecorating to do you cant stay there come home for a few days until this is closed ive ah already made arrangements she tucked her hands into her pockets rocked back on her heels this part she thought would be tricky im staying at blackhawks you cant bunk in a club he began then it hit him a sneaky jab to the solar plexus oh boyd ran a hand through his hair walked to his desk shook his head walked to the coffeepot you ah hell im sleeping with jonah his back still to her boyd lifted a hand waved it from side to side acknowledging the signal ally closed her mouth and waited youre a grown woman he got that much out then set the coffeepot back down damn it is that a comment on my age or my relationship with blackhawk both he turned back she was so lovely he thought this woman whod come from him do you have anything against him youre my daughter hes a man there you go dont grin at me when im having a paternal crisis obediently she folded her lips sorry if you dont mind i think ill imagine you and jonah are spending your time together discussing great works of literature and playing gin rummy whatever gets you through dad id like to bring him to the sunday barbecue he wont come oh yes ally smiled thinly he will she spent the rest of her shift doing followups on the case and dealing with the threads of two others assigned to her she closed one on sexual assault opened another on armed robbery she parked her car in a secured lot and backtracked the block and a half to blackhawks she spotted the stakeout car from the end of the block and had no doubt jonah had tagged it as well the first person she saw when she walked into the club was hickman sitting hunched at the bar she figured she could have spotted his black eye from a block away as well she went to him tapped a finger under his chin and studied his face while he sulked who popped you your good friend and general jerkface dennis overton youre kidding he resisted ran like a jackrabbit he glanced toward frannie tapped his glass for a refill had to chase him down before i could cuff him he caught me he picked up his dwindling beer sipped morosely now im wearing this and ive taken about all the razzing im going to sorry hickman to prove it she leaned over and touched her lips to the swollen bruise when she leaned back she noticed jonah had turned the corner into the bar he merely lifted a brow at seeing her with her arm around hickmans shoulders then signaled to will i never figured him for a rabbit with a heavy sigh hickman scooped up a handful of bar nuts then i take him down and got this he shifted on the stool to show her the hole in the knee of his trousers and hes flopping around like a landed trout and crying like a baby oh god one ounce one ounce of sympathy in his direction fletcher and ill pop you myself instead hickman began popping the nuts into his mouth he swings back and his elbow catches me right here right on the cheekbone i saw whole planets erupt stupid son of a bitch can do his crying in a cage tonight what the helld you ever see in him beats me frannie put my pals drinks on my tab will you im switching to the imported stuff then she laughed then glanced over her shoulder when will came up behind her never used to have cops in here but he said it with an easy smile and winked at frannie you want some ice on that eye officer hickman shook his head nan he used his good one to give will the onceover you got a problem with cops not in about five years say is sergeant maloney still down at the sixtythird he busted me twice was always straight about it amused hickman turned around on the stool yeah hes still there still working vice too you see him you tell him will sloan said hi he was always square with me ill be sure to do that anyway the man says i should have some dinner sent out to your friends in the ford across the street figures theyll get hungry sitting out mere all night twiddling their thumbs im sure theyll appreciate that ally said dryly least we can do giving hickman a friendly slap on the back will headed toward the kitchen ive got a couple of things to do ally gave hickmans black eye another look put some ice on that she advised then made her way into the club area to track down beth got a minute beth continued to key in codes on the register its friday night were booked solid and were a couple of waitresses short ally acknowledged the sting of the cool tone but didnt back down i can wait until your break i dont know when ill be able to take one were busy ill wait i wont take up much of your time suit yourself without a glance at her beth strode away shes feeling pretty raw will commented ally turned around are you everywhere mostly he lifted his shoulders thats my job she trained jan like you know she trained you i guess were all pretty shaken up about what happened and blaming me i dont you were doing your job thats how it works beth shell come around she thinks too much of the man not to you want me to get you a table bands going to start in about an hour and its a hot one so there wont be a square inch of free space if you wait no i dont need a table give a yell if you change your mind will she touched his arm before he could walk away thanks he gave her a wide easy smile no problem i got nothing but respect for cops in the last five years beth made her wait an hour and ally was having her eardrums rattled by the bands second number when the head waitress quickly strode up to her ive got ten minutes you can have five of them thatll have to be enough fine she had to lift her voice to a shout can we go back in the employee lounge or would you rather yell at each other right here saying nothing beth spun around and marched out of the club area she unlocked the door to the lounge walked to the sofa and sitting took off her shoes more questions detective fletcher ally closed the door and shut off the worst of the racket behind it ill keep it brief and to the point youre aware of what happened to jan yes im very aware of it her next of kin have been notified ally said in the same flat tone her parents will be in denver tomorrow and would like her things id like to box up whatever she might have in her locker and have it available for them it would be easier on them that way beths lips trembled and she looked away i dont have the combination to her lock i do she had it written down in her address book then do what you have to do you dont need me i need a witness id appreciate it if youd verify that i list any and all items in her work locker that i put nothing in from the outside or misappropriate any of her property thats all it is to you all what happened to her is to you another bit of business the sooner i cover every bit of business the sooner we find the man who did this to her she was nothing to you none of us were you lied to us yes i lied and since under the same circumstances id lie again i cant apologize for it ally walked to the locker spun the combination lock to your knowledge did anyone have the combination to this except janet norton no ally removed the lock opened the door as she scanned the contents she took a large evidence bag from her purse it smells like her beths voice trembled then broke you can smell her perfume whatever she did she didnt deserve to be killed to be thrown out on the side of the road like trash no she didnt i want the man who did it to her to pay as much as you do more why because there has to be justice or theres nothing because her parents loved her and their hearts are broken because i can smell her perfume cosmetic bag ally snapped out grabbing the hotpink case yanking the zipper two lipsticks powder compact three eyeliner pencils she broke off when beth touched her arm let me help you ill write it down she took a tissue out of her pocket wiped her eyes men stuffed it away again to take out her pad i liked you you see i liked who i thought you were it was a kind of an insult to find out you were someone else now you know maybe we can start from here maybe beth pulled out her pencil and began to write ally ordered a light meal at the bar and kept her eye on jonah his friday night crowd was thick and they were rowdy the longer she sat watching listening the more she began to see the myriad problems of keeping him safe she saw just as many problems convincing him he needed to make adjustments in his lifestyle until matthew lyle was in custody because she considered herself on duty she stuck with coffee and when the caffeine started to jiggle her system switched to bottled water when the inactivity threatened to drive her mad she informed frannie she was going to help out with the bar tables and grabbed a tray i believe i fired you jonah said as she hauled a tray of empties to the bar no you didnt i quit house draft and a bump pete campari and soda merlot with ice on the side and the complimentary ginger ale for the designated driver you got it blondie go upstairs get off your feet youre tired ally merely narrowed her eyes at jonahs orders pete this guys making insulting remarks about my looks and he just put his hand on my butt ill break his face for you honey just as soon as i have a free hand my new boyfriend here has biceps like oil tankers ally warned jonah and executed a stylish hair flip so you better watch your step pretty boy he grabbed her chin lifted her to her toes by it then kissed her until her eyes threatened to roll back in her head im not paying you he said mildly and strolled away id work for that kind of tip the woman on the stool beside her commented anytime anywhere yeah ally let out a long breath who wouldnt she worked through last call then grabbed a table in the club and put her feet up while the band broke down and the staff prepared for closing and sitting fell asleep jonah sat across from her while the club went quiet anything i can do for you before i head out he glanced up at will no thanks guess shes wornout shell bounce back well will jiggled the change in his pockets im just going to have my nightcap then head home ill see frannie off and lock up see you tomorrow the man was sunk was all will could think as he walked back to the bar who couldve figured it the man was sunk and over a cop a cop will slid onto a stool on cue frannie set down his nightly brandy the mans hooked on the cop you just clued into that i guess he tugged on his beard you think itll work out im no judge of romantic relationships they look good together though and they wont be able to run over each other since both of them have heads like bricks she conked out in there will jerked his head toward the club then sipped his brandy hes just sitting watching her sleep i think you can mostly tell whats going on in a man by the way he watches a woman and because he caught himself watching frannie as she mopped up the bar he flushed and stared down at his drink as if the brandy suddenly contained the solution to a very complex problem but she caught it this tune she caught it because she was looking for it she continued to wipe the bar dry as she inventoried her reaction a nice little tug she realized and just a little heat to go with it she hadnt feltor hadnt let herselffeel either for a man in a very very long time i guess youre heading home she said casually i guess you i was thinking about ordering a pizza and watching this horror movie marathon on cable he smiled over at her you always had a thing for monster movies yeah nothing like giant tarantulas or bloodsucking vampires to chase away your troubles still its not a lot of fun by myself you up for it up for brandy sloshed over the rim of his snifter and onto her clean bar sorry damn im clumsy no youre not she slid the cloth over the spilled brandy then looked him dead in the eye do you want to split a pizza with me will and watch old blackandwhite monster movies and neck on my sofa iyou hed have gotten to his feet if he could have felt them are you talking to me she smiled spread her cloth over the rim of the bar sink ill get my jacket ill get it he pushed to his feet relieved when they held him upright frannie yes will i think youre beautiful i just wanted to say that right out in case im too nervous later and forget if you forget later ill remind you yeah okay good ill get your jacket he said and leaving her grinning dashed off jonah waited until the club was empty until he heard will and frannie call out their goodnights he rose leaving ally sleeping as he checked the locks and alarms himself his heels clicked on the silver floor as he crossed it to go backstage he chose the light pattern and music loop that suited his mood and set them satisfied he went back to ally and bending down kissed her awake she floated to the surface on the taste of him warm a little rough and very ready when she opened her eyes it was as though a thousand stars were twinkling against the night jonah dance with me his mouth continued to nibble on hers as he lifted her to her feet she already was before the clouds cleared from her brain she was moving with him body molded to body as music rippled around them the platters she stroked her cheek against his thats so weird you dont like it i can put on something else no i love it she angled her head to give his lips freer access to her neck this number its my parents song only you you know my mother was a night shift dj at khip before she was station manager there this is the song she played over the radio for my father the night she agreed to marry him its a nice story ive heard pieces of it you should see the way they look at each other when they dance to this its beautiful she dipped her fingers into his hair as they glided over the stars in the floor very smooth she whispered youre very smooth blackhawk i shouldve figured it she turned her head on his shoulder watched the lights gleam is everyone gone yes theres only you he thought brushing his lips over her hair only you chapter for the first time in weeks ally woke without the need to jump out of bed and rush into the day glorious sunday since saturday night at blackhawks had been more crowded than the night before shed spent most of the time on her feet and all of it mentally on duty jonah might have shrugged off the guards outside the club but she didnt think hed take having her standing as his shield quite so casually some things were best left undisclosed and undiscussed besides they were doing each other a favor she couldnt stay in her apartment until it was cleaned out and refurnished he was giving her a comfortable place to stay and she was giving him a bodyguard to her it was a fair and rational deal and the deal had a distinctively superior side benefit intent on indulging in it she ran her hand over his chest and began to nibble on the body she was more than happy to shield and protect he shot awake fully aroused with her mouth hot and greedy on his let me let me exhilarated she chanted it already straddling him already riding she hadnt known her blood could leap so fast that her own needs could bolt from lazy to desperate in one hammer beat of the heart she took him in surrounded him her own body shuddering and bowing back as the sharp claws of pleasure raked her he kept the bedroom dark it was all shadows and movement as he reared up to wrap his arms around her possession it drove them both he found her mouth her throat her breast fed the hunger shed unleashed in him before he could think before he could do anything but feel her release came like a whiplash snapping and slicing the system and when she melted against him he laid her back began to love her a kiss soft as the shadows a touch tender as the night when she reached for him he took her hands cupping them together and bringing them to his lips in a gesture that had something rich something sumptuous sliding through her to tangle with needs still raw now let me this was different this was patient and sweet and slow a fire banked and left to simmer with light she yielded herself a surrender as powerful as seduction he was murmuring to her quiet words that stirred the soul even as he stirred her blood as her breathing thickened she floated on the thin and delicate layers of silky sensations the brush of his fingertips of his hair the warmth of his lips the glide of his tongue urged her higher gradually higher as the rise of desire became a deep and liquid yearning that spread to an aching need she moaned his name he slid her over the first satin edge he needed to touch her this way to take her this way he needed at least in the shadows to have the right to here she could belong to him her arms came around him as he sank into a kiss took it deep fathoms deeper until he was lost in it and lost he slipped inside her held there linked and desperately helplessly in love when at last they lay quiet she turned her face into his throat wanting the taste of him to linger just a little longer no dont move she whispered not yet her body was gold pulsing gold she would have sworn even the dark had gilt edges its still night she stroked her hands down his back up again as long as were like this its still night it can be night for as long as you want her lips curved against him just a little longer she sighed again content to hold and be held i was going to get up and use your equipment but then well there you were and it just seemed like a much better idea to use you good thinking he closed his eyes and kept her close she let the morning slide away enjoyed a fast hard workout with him in his gym while they argued over sports highlights that flashed by on the portable tv they shared a breakfast of bagels and coffee along with the sunday paper while spread out lazily in bed natural normal almost domestic habits ally thought as they dressed for the day not that a man like blackhawk could or should be domesticated but a slow uncomplicated sunday morning was a nice change of pace she sat on the side of the bed and laced up her ancient hightops jonah tugged on a tshirt studied the endless line of her legs is your plan to wear those little shorts to distract me from whipping your excellent ass on the court she lifted both eyebrows please with my innate skill i dont need such pitiful ploys good because once i start a game nothing distracts me until my opponent is crushed she stood rolled strong shoulders shown to advantage in the sleeveless jersey well see whos crushed blackhawk when the buzzer sounds now are you going to stand around here bragging or are you ready to rock and roll more than ready detective honey she waited until they were in his car she thought the timing best besides the longer she waited to bring it up the shorter amount of time hed have to argue with her casually she stretched out her legs and prepared to enjoy the ride and smirked just a little when she saw his gaze shift and slide down the length of her legs so are you ever going to let me drive this machine jonah switched on the engine no i can handle it then buy your own jag wheres the court where you want to go down in inglorious defeat you mean wheres the court where i plan to beat you into a whimpering pulp of humiliation ill give you directions of course if i were driving i could just take us there he merely flicked her a pitying glance then slipped on his sunglasses wheres the court fletcher out near cherry lake why the hell do you want to shoot hoops way out there there are a halfdozen gyms around here its too nice a day to play indoors of course if youre afraid of a little fresh air he reversed and drove out of the parking lot what do you do besides use that gorgeous equipment in your apartment over the club when you have a free day she asked him catch a game check out a gallery he sent her a slow smile pick up women she tipped down her own sunglasses peered at him over the tops what kind of game depends on the season if its got a ball or a puck ill probably watch it me too ive got no resistance what kind of gallery whatever appeals at the time youve got some great art in the club and in your apartment i like it so what kind of women the easy kind she laughed and tucked her glasses back in place you calling me easy ace no youre work i like a change of pace now and again lucky me youve got a lot of books she commented she studied his profile the sexy angular lines of it the way the dark glasses concealed the fascinating contrast of those eyes of pure light green its hard to picture you curling up with a good book stretching out he said correcting her women curl up with books guys stretch out oh i see thats entirely different this is your exit coming up youll take the twotwofive and watch your speed the traffic cops just love to nail pretty boys like you in their hot cars i have pull in the police department you think im going to fix a ticket for you when you wont even let me drive this thing it so happens i know the police commissioner as soon as he said it it clicked you said out in cherry lake thats right he got off the first exit and pulled into a convenience store parking lot problem your family lives in cherry lake thats right and they have a basketball courtwell half court it was all we could push my parents into even though my brothers and i campaigned pretty hard they also have a barbecue pit which my father puts to very good use we try to get together a couple sundays a month why didnt you tell me we were going to your parents she recognized the tone anger ruthlessly tethered what difference does it make im not intruding on your family he shoved the car in reverse again ill drop you off you can get a ride back when youre done hold on she reached over switched off the ignition if he was angry fine theyd fight but shed be damned if hed freeze her out what do you mean intruding were going to shoot some baskets eat some steak you dont need an engraved invitation im not spending sunday afternoon with your family with a cops family he pulled his sunglasses off tossed them aside that has nothing to do with it then what does im good enough to sleep with but im not good enough for this thats ridiculous he shoved out of the car stalked to the end of the lot and stared out on a narrow grassy area then tell me something that isnt ridiculous she marched up to him jabbed his shoulder why are you so angry that i want you to spend a few hours with my family you conned me into this allison thats first why should i have to con you into it why is it jonah that youve known my father for more man half your life but youve never accepted a single invitation to our home because its his home and i have no place there because i owe him im sleeping with his daughter for gods sake im aware of that so is he what do you think hes going to dig out his police issue and shoot you between the eyes when you walk in the door this isnt a joke its so easy for you isnt it heres the heat she thought pumping everything was always just right in your world solid balanced and steady you have no idea what mine was before he came into it and what it would be now if he hadnt this is not the way i intend to pay him back no you pay him back by insulting him by refusing to acknowledge your relationship with me as if it was something to be ashamed of you think i dont know what your life was like you think my world was so rarefied blackhawk im the daughter of a cop theres nothing youve seen i havent through his eyes and now my own she drilled a finger in his chest dont you talk up to me and dont you talk down wherever however each of us started were on level ground now and you better remember it he grabbed her hand stop poking at me id like to flatten you same goes he walked away waiting until he was sure he had some level of control again her mention of shame had gotten through he could be angry with himself for falling in love with her but he wouldnt be ashamed of it ill make you a deal you get rid of the tail he gestured to the shadow car that had pulled in a minute behind them and well take a couple of hours at your parents give me a second she walked to the dark sedan leaned in and had a short conversation with the driver she had her hands in her pockets as she strode back over to jonah i cut them loose for the rest of the afternoon its the best i can do she circled her shoulders apologies always tensed her up look im sorry i played it this way i should have done it straight and we could have argued about it back at your place you didnt play it straight because you knew i wouldnt be here to argue with okay youre right she threw up her hands in defeat sorry again my familys important to me im involved with you it just follows that i want you to feel comfortable with them comfort might be asking a little too much but im not ashamed of my relationship with you i dont want you to think i am fair enough jonah it would mean a lot to me if youd give it a try this afternoon its easier to argue with you when youre being obnoxious now see thats what my brother bryant always says youll get along fine hoping to soften things she hooked her arm with his theres one thing though she began as they walked back to the car what thing this deal at the house today its a little more than i might have indicated sort of a kind of reunion its just that therell be more people thats all she said quickly aunts and uncles and cousins from back east and my fathers old partner and her family its really better for you this way she insisted when he balled a fist and tapped it against her chin its more a horde than a group so nobodyll even notice you hey why dont you let me drive the rest of the way why dont i knock you unconscious and you can ride in the trunk the rest of the way never mind it was just a thought she strolled around the car reached for the door handle but he beat her to it it made her laugh and turn and take his face in her hands youre a real case blackhawk she gave him a noisy kiss then climbed in when he joined her she leaned over rubbed her knuckles over his cheek theyre just people really nice people i dont doubt it jonah an hour if youre uncomfortable being there after an hour just tell me ill make an excuse and well go no questions deal if im uncomfortable in an hour ill go you stay with your family thats the way it should be so thats the deal all right she settled back secured her belt why dont i give you a quick rundown so you know the players theres aunt natalie and her husbandryan piasecki she runs some of the interests of fletcher industries but her real baby is ladys choice underwear lingerie dont be a

nailing butts to the wall he loves it and keenans a firefighter we visited my aunt natalie right after she hooked up with uncle ry and keen he fell for the big red track that was it for him left at the next light that wraps it up i have a headache no you dont right at the corner left two blocks down hed already gotten a solid impression of the neighborhood stable rich and exclusive with its big beautiful houses on big beautiful grounds it gave him an itch between the shoulder blades hed never be able to explain he was comfortable in the city where the streets reminded him hed overcome something and the faces that crowded him were anonymous but here with the majestic trees the sloped lawns green and lush with approaching summer the explosion of flowers and rambling old homes he wasnt just a stranger he was an intruder that one there on the left the cedar and river rock with the zigzagging decks i guess everyones here already looks like a parking lot the double driveway was packed the house itself was a huge and unique study of rooflines jutting decks wide expanses of glass all accented by trees and flowering bushes with a meandering slate path ribboning up the gentle hill ive reassessed the deal jonah told her im adding exotic sexual favors i think this deserves them fine ill take em she reached for the door but his arm shot out pinned her back against the seat she only laughed and rolled her eyes okay okay well discuss exotic sexual favors later unless youre demanding a down payment on them here and now yeah thatll put a cap on it he jerked open his door but before he could walk around the car there was a war whoop and a pretty young girl with a pixie cap of dark hair raced down the hill she grabbed ally in a bear hug the minute she was out of the car there you are everyones here sam already pushed mick into the pool and bing chased your neighbors catup a tree keenan got him down and my moms inside putting something on the scratches hi she beamed a hundredwatt smile at jonah im addy guthrie you must be jonah aunt cilia said you were coming with ally you own a nightclub what kind of music do you have she does shut up twice a year for five minutes we time it ally wrapped an arm around her cousins neck and squeezed sam is in the piasecki branch mick is addys brother and bing is our family dog who has no manners whatsoever so he fits in very well dont worry about remembering any of that or you really will have a headache she reached out to take his hand but addy beat her to it can i come to your club were not going home until wednesday thursday if nagging works i mean whats one more day gosh youre really tall arent you he looks great too she added peering around him to her cousin nice job allison shut up addy somebodys always saying that to me charmed despite himself jonah smiled at her do you listen absolutely not the noise level rosescreams shouts a couple of gangly teenagers of indeterminate sex raced by armed with enormous water guns he saw a woman with a sunny sweep of hair in deep conversation with a striking redhead a group of mensome stripped to the waistbattled it out brutally on a blacktopped basketball court another group of young people dripping wet raided a table loaded with food pools around the other side of the house ally explained its glassed in so we can use it all year one of the men on court pivoted drove through the line of defense and dunked the ball then he caught sight of ally and deserted the field she met him halfway shouting with laughter when he plucked her off her feet put me down moron youre sweaty so would you be if you were leading your team to a second consecutive victory but he dropped her on her feet wiped his hand on his jeans then held it out to jonah im bryant allys far superior brother glad you could make it want a beer yes actually bryant eyed jonah measuring size and build you play any round ball occasionally great were going to need fresh meat shirts and skins ally get the man a beer while i finish trouncing these pansies come on inside in a show of sympathy ally rubbed a hand up and down jonahs arm get your bearings its too confusing to try to meet everyone at once she drew him up onto a deck where yet another table was spread with food and an enormous metal trough was filled with ice and cold drinks she plucked out two beers and went in through the atrium doors the kitchen was spacious broken up into family areas with counters and a banquette in one corner a darkhaired man was trying to tug away from a darkhaired woman ill live aunt deb mom get her off me dont be a baby with her head stuck in the refrigerator cilia swore were going to run out of ice i knew it didnt i tell him wed run out of ice hold still keenan deborah covered the scratches with a gauze pad taped it neatly there now you can have a lollipop im surrounded by smart alecks hey speaking of which heres ally aunt deb ally hurried over to hug her aunt then reached over and grazed her knuckles over keenans cheek hi hero this is jonah blackhawk jonah my aunt deborah my brother keenan youve met my mother yes nice to see you again mrs fletcher a small army chose that moment to pour in through the door full of shouted complaints and chased by an unbelievably large and ugly dog ally was immediately absorbed into them and before he could defend himself so was jonah jonah intended to leave at the end of the hour a deal was a deal his plan was to make some polite conversation keep as far out of the way as humanly possible then fade back into his car and back into the city where he knew the rules and somehow he was stripped out of his shirt and going elbow to gut in a vicious game of basketball with allys uncles cousins brothers in the heat of competition he lost track of intentions but he damn well knew it was ally herself who stomped on his instep and cost him game point she was fast and sneaky he conceded that as he ripped the ball away from an opponent and gave her one deadly glare but she hadnt grown up on the streets where a single basket could mean a buck for a burger against a painfully empty stomach that made him faster and sneakier i like him natalie ignored her sons bloodcurdling scream of revenge and tucked an arm through altheas he was a hardass but boyd always liked him ouch he plays dirty what other way is there whoa ryans

then laughed at altheas arch look in basketball get your mind out of the gutter she swung an arm over her old friends shoulder lets go get some wine and pump cilia for info on this new and very interesting situation you read my mind i know nothing i say nothing cilia claimed as she poured another bag of ice into the trough go away its the first guy shes brought to one of the family deals natalie pointed out cilia merely straightened and mimed zipping her own lips give it up deborah advised ive been interrogating her for a half hour and i got zero you lawyers are too soft althea moved forward grabbing cilia by the collar now a good cop knows how to get to the truth spill it oroarke do your worst copper i aint no stool pigeon besides i dont know anything yet but i will she murmured as she saw ally dragging jonah toward the deck clear out give me five minutes its nothing jonah insisted its blood rules of the house if it bleeds it gets mopped up ah another victim cilia rubbed her hands together as her friends and relations conveniently scattered bring him on his face ran into something your fist jonah said with some bitterness guarding the goal doesnt include left jabs around here it does lets see wisely cilia kept her expression sober as she studied jonahs bleeding lip not so bad ally go help your father but i go help your father cilia repeated and snagging jonahs hand dragged him up to the deck and into the kitchen now lets see where did i put my instruments of torture mrs fletcher cilia sit down and button it up whining is severely punished around here she gathered up a damp cloth ice and antiseptic punched you did she yes she did takes after her father sit she ordered again and jabbed a finger into his bare stomach until he obeyed i appreciate your restraint in not hitting her back i dont hit women he winced when she dabbed at the cut good to know shes a handful are you up to that i beg your pardon is it just sex or are you up for the whole package he wasnt sure which shocked him more the question or the sudden sting of antiseptic he swore ripely then clenched his teeth sorry ive heard the word before was that your answer mrs fletcher cilia she leaned in close then smiled into his eyes good eyes she thought steady clear ive embarrassed you i didnt expect to almost done here hold this ice on it a minute she slid onto the bench across from him crossed her arms on the table by her calculations she had two minutes tops before someone burst in the door and interrupted boyd didnt mink you would come today i did allison is relentless when shes set her mind on something tell me about it i dont know your mind jonah but i know something about you and i know what i see so i want to tell you something i didnt intend to stay this long hush she said mildly a lifetime ago nearly your lifetime ago i met this cop this irritating fascinating hardheaded cop i didnt want to be interested i certainly didnt want to be involved my mother was a cop and she died in the line of duty ive never gotten over it not really she had to take a breath to steady herself because it was perfectly true the last thing i wanted the last thing i figured was good for me was to find myself tangled up with a cop i know how they think what they are what they risk god i didnt want that in my life and here i am a lifetime later the wife of one the mother of one she glanced out the window caught sight of her husband then her daughter strange isnt it the way things turn out it isnt easy but i wouldnt give up a moment of it not one moment she patted the hand hed laid on the table then rose im glad you came today why because it gave me a chance to see you and ally together it gave me a chance to look at you close an opportunity you havent given me more than twice in what is it jonah seventeen years and i like what i see leaving him speechless she turned to the fridge and pulled out a platter of burger patties would you mind taking these to boyd if we dont feed the kids every couple of hours it gets ugly all right he took the platter struggled with himself while she just smiled at him out of the eyes ally had inherited shes a lot like you too she inherited all of my and boyds most annoying qualities funny how that works she rose on her toes gently touched her lips to the wound at the corner of his mouth that comes with the treatment thanks he shifted the tray searched for something to say no one in his life had ever kissed him where it hurt i have to get back to the city thank you for everything youre welcome youre welcome anytime jonah she smiled to herself as he went out your turn at the plate boyd she murmured make it count chapter its all in the wrist boyd claimed flipping a burger i thought you said it was all in the timing ally stood thumbs tucked into her pockets while her brother bryant looked on his elbow comfortably hooked on her shoulder timing is of course essential there are many many subtle aspects to the art of the barbecue but when do we eat bryant demanded two minutes if youre going for a burger another ten if youre holding out for steak he peered through the billowing smoke as jonah cut across the yard with a platter looks like we have more supplies on the way how about a burger then steak youre tenth in line i believe for burger requests son take a number boyd flipped another sent it sizzling then furrowed his brow as he caught sight of his wife on the side deck dancing in place she waved her arms pointed at jonah pointed at boyd circled her fingers he got the drift and though he winced inwardly gave a subtle shrug of acknowledgment okay okay ill talk to him damn it cilia only smiled then wagged her finger back and forth and i wont hurt him sheesh just set down the fresh rations jonah boyd jerked a thumb toward the high table beside the pit hows the lip ill live jonah sent ally a steely stare especially since despite unsportsmanlike conduct by the opposing guard i made the basket and won lucky shot well have a rematch after we eat she loses bryant commented she demands a rematch she wins she rubs it in your face for days and your point would be ally fluttered her lashes at him mom would never let me hit her because she was a girl bryant gave allys ear one hard tug ive always found that grossly unfair big deal you just beat up on keenan yeah instantly bryants face brightened those were the days im planning on punching on him later for old times sake can i watch like i used to naturally please your mother and i like to maintain the illusion we raised three wellbalanced competent adults dont shatter our dreams jonah you havent seen my workshop have you at his daughters answering snort boyd winged an eyebrow at her no comments bryant this is a moment is it a monumental moment i am passing the sacred tongs and spatula to you wait a minute wait a minute ally elbowed her brother aside why cant i do it ah boyd held a hand to his heart how many times have i heard you say those very words in our long and exciting life together amused and fascinated by the family dynamics jonah watched mutiny settle over allys face well why cant i allison my treasure there are some things a man must pass to his son son boyd laid a hand on bryants shoulder im trusting you with the fletcher reputation dont let me down dad bryant wiped an imaginary tear from his eye im overwhelmed honored i swear to uphold the family name no matter what the cost take these boyd held out the barbecue tools today you are a man that bites ally muttered as boyd swung an arm around jonahs shoulder youre just a girl bryant leered and rubbed the tools together live with it shell make him pay for that boyd murmured so how are things well enough how the hell was jonah supposed to make a quiet escape when someone or other was always dragging him somewhere i appreciate the hospitality today im going to have to get back to the club a business like that doesnt give you a lot of free time especially in the early years still he steered jonah toward a wooden structure in the far corner of the yard know anything about power tools they make a great deal of noise boyd gave a hoot of laughter and opened the door of the workshop what do you think the garagesize room was full of tables machines shelves tools stacks of wood there appeared to be a number of projects in progress but jonah couldnt tell what they were or what they were intended to be impressive he decided diplomatically what do you do here i make a great deal of noise other than that i havent figured it out i helped keenan build a birdhouse about ten years ago came out pretty good cilia started buying me tools boy toys she calls them he ran his hand over the guard of a skill saw then i needed a place to keep them before i knew it i had a fully equipped workshop i think it was all a ploy to get me out of her hair pretty clever that she is they stood for a moment hands in pockets soberly studying the tools okay lets get this over with so we can both relax and get something to eat whats going on with you and my daughter jonah couldnt say it was unexpected but it still made his stomach clench were seeing each other with a nod boyd walked over to a small square refrigerator and took out two beers he twisted off the tops held one out to jonah and jonah tipped back the beer then gave boyd a level look what do you want me to say the truth though i realize what youd like to say is that its none of my business of course its your business shes your daughter there we have no argument deciding to get comfortable boyd boosted himself up on a worktable theres a matter of intent jonah im asking what you intend in regard to my daughter i dont have any intentions i should never have touched her i know mat really intrigued boyd cocked his head mind explaining that what do you want from me damn it giving into frustration jonah dragged a hand through his hair the first time you asked me that in almost that same tone you were thirteen your lip was bleeding then too jonah steadied himself i remember ive never known you to forget anything which means youll remember what i said to you then but ill say it again what do you want from you jonah ive got what i want a decent life run in a way i can respect and enjoy and i know why i have it i know what i owe you fletch everything everything ive got everything i am started with you you opened doors for me you took me on when you had no reason to whoa genuinely shocked boyd held up a hand hold on you changed my life you gave me a life i know where id be if it wasnt for you i had no right to take advantage of that youre sure putting a lot on me here boyd said quietly what i did jonah was see a street kid with potential and i hassled him emotion swirled into jonahs eyes you made me oh jonah no i didnt you made yourself though god knows im proud to have played a part in it boyd slid off the table wandered the shop whatever hed expected from this talk it hadnt been to have his emotions stirred to feel very much like a father being given a precious gift by a son if you feel theres a debt then pay it off now by being straight with me he turned back are you involved with ally because shes mine in spite of it jonah corrected i stopped thinking about her being yours if i hadnt i wouldnt be involved with her it was the answer he wanted so boyd nodded the boys suffering he thought and couldnt find it in himself to be overly sorry about it define involved for gods sake fletch jonah took a long gulp of beer i dont mean that area boyd spoke quickly took a deep drink himself lets just leave that particular area behind a firmly locked door so we dont have to punch each other fine good i meant what are your feelings for her i care about her boyd waited a beat nodded again okay jonah swore boyd had asked him to play straight and he was circling im in love with her damn it he closed his eyes imagined flinging the bottle against the wall shattering glass it didnt help im sorry jonah opened his eyes again got a slippery grip on control but thats as straight as it gets yeah id say so you know what im built on you cant think im good enough for her of course youre not boyd said simply and noticed those clear green eyes didnt so much as flicker shes my little girl jonah no ones good enough for her but knowing what youre built on id say youre pretty close i wonder why that surprises you the one area i dont recall you ever being low in is esteem im over my head here jonah murmured its been a long time since ive been over my head in anything women do that to you the right woman you never really surface again shes beautiful isnt she yes she blinds me shes also smart and shes strong and she knows how to deal with whats dished out absently jonah rubbed his thumb over his sore lip no argument then my advice to you is to play it straight with her too she wont let you get away with less not for long she isnt looking for anything else from me you keep thinking that son at ease again boyd crossed to jonah laid a hand on his shoulder theres just one thing he said as they started toward the door if you hurt her ill take you out theyll never find your body well i feel better now good so how do you like your steak ally saw them come out of the workshop and relaxed for the first time since the moment shed watched them go in her father had his arm swung companionably around jonahs shoulder it looked as if theyd done no more than share a friendly beer and grunt over the power tools if her father had done any poking or prying into her relationship with jonah at least he hadnt drilled any embarrassing holes she liked seeing them together liked very much witnessing the very real bond of affection and mutual respect her family was paramount in her life and though she would have given her heart where her heart yearned it would never have settled with full happiness on a man her family couldnt love she bobbled the bowl of potato salad would have dropped it if cilia hadnt made the grab butter fingers cilia said and set the bowl on the deck table mom hmm were going to run out of ice again im in love with jonah i know baby whos not blocked in i need somebody to get some ice how can you know ally grabbed her mothers wrist before cilia could go to the deck rail and shout for an ice run i just figured it out this second because i know you and i see the way you are with him gently she smoothed a hand over allys hair scared or happy both good cilia turned sighed once then kissed ally on each cheek thats perfect she slipped an arm around allys waist turned to the rail i like him me too i really like who he is cilia tipped her head toward her daughters its nice isnt it having the family together like this its wonderful jonah and i had a fight about coming here today looks like you won yeah were going to have another fight when i tell him were getting married youre your fathers daughter my moneys on you place your bets ally suggested and walked down the steps crossed the lawn it was a calculated move she didnt mind being calculating not when she had a point to make she strolled up to her father and jonah cupped jonahs face in her hands and pressed her lips hard to his he hissed reminding her about his sore mouth but she just laughed shook back her hair suck it in tough guy she suggested and kissed him again his hands came to her waist fused there drawing her up on her toes that intimate inch dad she eased back down mom needs more ice shes just saying that to make me look bad boyd scanned the yard homed in on his target keenan go get your mother more ice so as her father chased down her brother ally linked her hands at the back of jonahs neck what were you talking about with my father man stuff what are you doing he demanded as she brushed her lips over his again if you have to ask i must not be doing it right im outnumbered here allison are you trying to coax your family into stomping me into dust dont worry were very big on kissing in my family i noticed still he drew her back youve got this quietly proper streak its really cute are you having a good time except for a couple of minor incidents he said deliberately tapping his finger on the corner of his mouth you have a nice family theyre great you forget sometimes how steadying how comforting it is to have them how much you depend on them for a hundred little things my cousins will remember coming out here when they were kids or all of us piling into that gorgeous gothic fortress of uncle gages or trooping up to the mountains to what wait give me a minute she had his hand and squeezed it as she shut her eyes and let the pieces of the puzzle tumble together youre drawn back she murmured youre always drawn back to memories and places where you were happy with the people who mean the most thats why people are always going back to visit their hometown or driving by the house where they grew up she paused and opened her eyes as a new thought hit her where did he grow up she tapped a fist against jonahs chest where did he and his sister grow up where did they live together where was he happy he has to go somewhere has to find a place to hide to plan hes gone home she spun around and raced for the house she was already dialing the kitchen phone when jonah caught up with her what are you doing my job stupid stupid not to think of it before carmichael its fletcher i need you to do a check for me i need an addressmatthew lyles old address addresses maybe going back to when he was a kid theres ah she paused forced it into focus he was born in iowa and they moved around some i cant remember when he came to denver the parents are dead yeah you can reach me at this number she recited it or my cell phone thanks you think hes gone back home he needs to feel close to his sister to feel safe to feel powerful allison paced the kitchen as she tried to remember details of the file the psych profile tags him as dependent on her even as he sees himself as her protector shes his only real consistency the only constant in his life parents divorced kids got bounced around mother remarried bounced around some more stepfather was damn she pressed her fingers to her temple as if to push out the memory exmarine very gung ho and apparently very tough on the pudgy nerd and his devoted sister part of the whole authority complex comes from this instability of family life ineffective father the passive mother the stern stepfather rocky foundations she said as she paced lyle was bright high iq but he was emotionally and socially inept except with his sister his biggest trouble with the law was right after she got married he got sloppy careless he was angry she checked her watch urging carmichael to hurry she stood by him and it appears whatever rift there might have been between them was healed she leaped on the phone when it rang fletcher yeah what have you got she snatched up a pencil began to scribble on the pad by the phone no nothing out of state he needs to stay close hold on she covered the mouthpiece with her hand do me a favor blackhawk would you tell my father i need to talk to him for a minute it took more than a minute she moved into her fathers office booted up his computer with him beside her and carmichael on the phone they worked through the files picked through matthew lyles history see ten years ago he was listing a po box as his address he kept that listing for six years even though he had a house on the lake bought that house nine years ago the same year his sister married fricks but he held onto the po box and his sister lists the same po box as her address through the same period but where did they live im going to go in and pin fricks down on this one then she pursed her lips considered carmichael you up for another run see what you can find me on property in the denver metro area listed under the names madeline lyle or madeline matthews run matthew and lyle madeline too good move boyd approved good thinking he likes to own things ally noted possessions are very important to him if he stuck in the same spot for six years more or less hed want his own placeor one for his sister she straightened in the chair did you just say bingo carmichael i think i love you yeah yeah all right ive got it ill let you know really thanks she hung up jumped out of the chair lyle madeline owns a condo in the center of downtown good work detective contact your lieutenant and assemble your team and ally boyd added i want in commissioner im sure we can make room for you it ran like clockwork within two hours the building was surrounded the stairways and exits blocked using hand signals a dozen cops wearing kevlar vests ranged the hallway outside of matthew lyles twolevel condo ally had the floor plan in her head every inch of the blueprint shed studied she gave the nod and the two officers beside her hit the door with the battering ram she went in first went in low a stream of men rushed by her and up the stairs to her right others fanned out to the rooms at her left it took less than ten minutes to determine the condo was empty hes been staying here ally gestured to the dishes in the sink she dipped a finger into the dirt of an ornamental lemon tree potted by the kitchen window damp hes tending house hell be back in a bedroom upstairs they found three handguns an assault rifle and a case of ammunition be prepared ally murmured i see extra clips for a nine millimeter but i dont see the nine millimeter so hes armed detective fletcher one of her team backed out of the closet holding a long bladed knife with gloved fingers looks like our murder weapon bag it she picked up a blackandsilver matchbook from the dresser blackhawks she shifted her eyes to her father thats his target the only question is when night had fallen when ally confronted jonah in his office the man was mule stubborn she thought and more he was just plain wrong you close down for twentyfour hours fortyeight tops no i can close you down no you cant and if you wrangle it itll take you longer than the fortyeight hours which makes the entire process moot she dropped into a chair it was important to stay calm she reminded herself vital to stay in control she hissed out a breath then a stream of violent and inventive oaths i dont believe your last suggestion is possible regardless of my strength and flexibility she bolted forward listen to me no you listen to me his voice was quiet cool inflexible i could do what youre asking whats to stop him from waiting me out i close down he goes under i open he surfaces we could play that game indefinitely i prefer running my own game on my own turf im not going to say you dont have a point because you do but well nail him within two days i promise you all you have to do is shut the place down take a little vacation my parents have a great place in the mountains would you be coming with me of course not i have to stay here and close this thing you stay i stay youre a civilian exactly and until this is a police state i have a right to run my business and come and go as i please she wanted to tear at her hair but knew that would just amuse him its my job to keep you alive to run your business he got to his feet is that what you think are you my shield ally is that why youve been wearing your gun until were up here behind locked doors is that why you keep it within reach even when we are here he came around the desk even as she cursed herself for the slip i dont like the implications of that she met him toe to toe youre a target so are you this is a waste of time he spun her around before she could stalk to the elevator you will not stand in front of me he said it slowly distinctly with that rare glint of ready temper in his eyes understand that dont tell me how to do my job dont tell me how to live my life she threw her head back released a muffled scream all right okay forget it we do it the hard way heres the deal twentyfourhour guards outside cops in soft clothes in the bar and club areas at all times you take on undercover officers as kitchen and wait help i dont like that deal tough take it or leave it leave it and i pull strings and have you slapped into protective custody so fast even a slick customer like you wont be able to slide through the knots i can do it blackhawk and i will my father will help me do it because he cares about you please she grabbed him by the lapels do it for me fortyeight hours he agreed and in the meantime i put out word on the street im looking for him dont thats the deal its fair all right thats the deal now what would you like to bet that i can go downstairs right now and pick out every cop youve already planted she puffed out her cheeks then showed her teeth in a smile no bet i dont suppose i can convince you to stay up here tonight he traced a fingertip down the center of her body i will if you will thats what i figured sometimes compromise however annoying was the only out hold that thought until closing that i have no problem with he walked over to call for the elevator tonight or tomorrow night yeah its just as likely more really that theyll take him at the condo but if he slips through the net or senses anything itll be here and itll be soon wills got good eyes hell know what to look for i dont want you or any of your people taking chances if hes spotted you tell me she glanced over caught him studying her what nothing but he traced his fingers over her cheek when youve closed this down can you take any time what do you mean time a few days away somewhere away i might be talked into that do you have anywhere in mind no pick it well arent you openminded and daring ill start thinking she took a step out of the elevator already shifting her focus but he took her arm ally yeah there was too much to say entirely too much to feel and it wasnt the time not the time to play it straight or any other way later well get into it later chapter traditionally business at blackhawks was light on sunday nights there was no live music as a lure and the first day of the work week loomed heavily ally decided a great many people in denver were taking advantage of the gorgeous weather and mild evening and most who strolled in out of the night lingered an hour or more over their drinks or bowls of guacamole and chips she watched the entrance checked the exits studied faces and counted heads throughout the evening she slipped into the lounge at regular intervals to check in with the stakeout at lyles condo an hour before closing and still he hadnt been spotted itchy she roamed the floor checking faces watching doors the crowd was thinning out and she imagined thered be no more than a scatter of customers left by last call where was he she asked herself where the hell was he hed run out of places to hide detective jonah danced his fingers over her shoulder i thought youd be interested to know one of my sources reports a man fitting lyles description has been asking questions about me when she gripped his arm and pulled him toward the alcove where tonight actually at my other place fast break she swore whipped out her phone we didnt put anyone there they never hit there its not his style id say that holds true he laid a hand over hers before she could dial the phone the bartender there just got in touch apparently lylei assume it was lyle though he was wearing glasses and sporting a bearddropped into fast break a few hours ago loitered at the bar started asking if i ever came in hold on ally tapped his hand away and put her call through balou cut a pair of uniforms loose from the condo tell them to see the bartender at fast break the address is she looked at jonah repeated the address he gave her lyle was in there tonight hes reported to be wearing a beard and glasses make sure that gets out she disconnected looked back at jonah as i was saying he continued my man didnt think anything of it initially then it started to bother him he says lyle was jumpy hung around about a half hour then said to tell me hed see me around his centers crumbling hes psyching himself up to move she wanted jonah out of the way look why dont you go up give your man another call let him know a couple of cops are on their way do i look like id fall for that lame a con he strolled away from her to check on a table of customers who were preparing to leave the shouts came from the kitchen followed by an explosive crash of dishes ally had her gun out bolting for the door when it burst open hed ditched the glasses and the beard was a thin and scraggly dusting over his chin but she saw shed been right hed psyched himself up his eyes were wide and wild and he had the barrel of the nine millimeter pressed to the soft underside of beths jaw dont move dont anybody move he shouted over the screams the rush of running feet as customers scattered stay calm everybody stay calm she sidestepped kept her gun trained on him her eyes trained on him forced herself to block out beths terrified face lyle take it easy you want to let her go ill kill her ill blow her head off you do that i kill you think you need to think where does that get you put your gun down drop it kick it over here or shes dead im not going to do that and neither are any of the other cops in here you know how many weapons you have aimed at you right now lyle look around do a count its over save yourself ill kill her his gaze jittered around the room bounced off guns then ill kill you thatll be enough someone was sobbing out of the comer of her eye she could see the bar area where civilians were being rushed outside to safety you want to live dont you madeline would want you to live dont you say her name dont you say my sisters name he shoved the gun harder against beths throat and made her cry out no place to run ally thought his sister had had no place to run and still shed turned and fired she loved you ally edged closer keeping his focus on her if she could get him to lower the gun a few inches get him to shift it toward her away from beth she died for you she was all i had i got nothing to lose now i want the cop who killed her and i want blackhawk now right now or she dies out of the corner of her eye ally saw jonah move forward look at me she shouted the words im the one who killed your sister he screamed one long howl as he jerked the gun away from beth swung it toward ally there was a burst of gunfire a blur of movement wails of terror with fear locked in her throat ally rushed forward to where jonah lay tangled with lyle blood coated them both damn you damn are you crazy with urgent hands she began to pat him down looking for wounds hed thrown himself at the gun in front of the gun he was breathing she held onto that he was breathing and she would make sure he kept on breathing jonah oh god im all right stop poking at me all right you jumped into crossfire you nearly got yourself killed you too he looked past her to where the starry floor was cracked an inch from where shed stood im wearing a vest and that takes care of your hard head too he sat back as a cop turned lyle over hes gone jonah spared lyles face one glance then looked into allys eyes id like to calm my customers down youre not calming anyone down ally rose with him youve got blood all over you is all of it his mostly what do you mean mostly im going to deal with my customers and my people he held her at arms length before she could snatch at him again do your job and let me do mine he turned away to take beth from the female officer who was holding her come on beth come on with me everythings all right now ally pressed her fingers to her eyes then looked down at what was left of matthew lyle yeah everythings dandy slipped in the back hickman told her while they sat in the nearly empty club the civilians were gone the body had been removed and the crime scene unit was packing up she wondered idly what time it was and how soon she could fall on her face and tune the world out he stopped being smart she said he stopped thinking you got that right hickman agreed got himself one of those white kitchen uniforms slapped on a wig and glasses before the cop who spotted him could call in or move all hell broke loose he didnt think we were smart enough to close him in i saw his face when he spotted all the cops pure shock my guess he figured on breaking in here taking jonah down me if i was around then hes got hostages hed demand we turn over the cop who killed his sister he really figured wed do it and hed get out arrogant speaking of which it was pretty cocky telling him you were the one he wanted i dont know why he didnt spot me in the first place you look different hickman scanned a look up then down very unfletcherlike give me a break hickman i look how i look ill tell you how it was he came in here for jonah when he looked at me all he saw was copno face no form just another cop he didnt put me together with the one whod worked here maybe he got to his feet i guess well never know he glanced over at the starburst crack in the floor too bad about thatclassy floor bet itll cost an arm and two legs to fix it maybe hell leave it like that conversation piece draw a crowd yeah the idea tickled hickman wedve taken him out right away you know but he wouldve gotten that shot off anyway at that range the vest wouldve stopped the bullet probably but one way or the other if the shot hadnt been deflected youd have been seriously hurt absently she rubbed a hand between her breasts imagined the breathless pain you ever taken one in the vest nope but deloy did had himself a softballsize bruise hickman held up his hands made a circle knocked him clean off his feet too and tossed him back like a rag doll ended up with a concussion where his head hit the pavement that has to hurt ill take it over a bullet any day of the week im going home he got to his feet see you tomorrow yeah nice work back at you oh your guys in the kitchen getting patched up what do you mean patched up caught a little friendly fire just a nick hes shot shot why didnt anyone tell me hickman didnt bother to answer she was already gone ally slammed into the kitchen her eyes dark and furious when she saw jonah at one of the worktables stripped to the waist calmly drinking a brandy while will rolled gauze over his upper arm hold it just hold it let me see that she slapped will away unwound the gauze and poked at the long shallow cut until jonah pushed her face up with the heel of his hand on her chin ouch he said put that drink down youre going to the hospital he kept his eyes on hers lifted the brandy sipped no no my butt what is this some idiot male macho deal youve been shot not really grazed is more the accepted term now if you dont mind wills got a kinder touch with this than you id like him to finish so he can go home it could get infected i could get hit by a truck but i dont intend for either to happen its okay ally really playing peacemaker will patted her shoulder before picking up the gauze again i cleaned it real good we got some worse in the old days didnt we jonah sure did looks like im another scar up on you now well isnt that nice ally grabbed the brandy glugged i thought you hated brandy i do why dont you get a glass of wine will suggested im nearly done here im fine im okay ally blew out a breath now she thought after everything her hands wanted to shake damn it blackhawk i was probably the one who shot you probably ive decided to weigh in the circumstances and not hold it against you thats real big of you now listen to me frannie went home with beth he added wanting to distract her shes okay shaky yet but okay she wanted to thank you but you were busy there we go will stepped back your arms in a lot better shape than your shirt id say thats a loss he held up the bloodstained linen and made allys stomach turn over want me to go up and get you a fresh one before i go no thanks jonah lifted his arm flexed nice job havent lost your touch all in a days work will picked up his discarded jacket you sure stand up ally couldve been an awful mess out there tonight but you sure stand up all in a days work ill lock up night ally sat at the table waited until she heard silence okay smart guy what the hell were you thinking you interfered with a police operation oh i dont know maybe i was thinking that lunatic was going to kill you it bothered me he held out the brandy snifter how about a refill since you drank mine fine sit here and swill brandy and look stoic she shoved back grabbed the glass then gave in and wrapped her arms around his neck dont ever scare me like that again i wont if you wont no just stay right there a minute he turned his face into her hair breathed deep im going to see you stepping in front of that gun for a long time thats hard i know i know it is ill deal with that ally because thats the way it is he drew her back his eyes intense on hers there are some things you need to figure out if you can deal with if

saw the scar in the floor from a bullet meant for her he dragged her around yanked her against him so hard so fast she swore her ribs knocked together his mouth was on hers fused there with a heat borne of desperation better much better here jonah now we both need to make it right again i need you to love me like our lives depended on it he was on the floor with her without any thought but to prove to himself that she was whole and safe and alive beneath him the cool hard surface of the floor might have been a feather bed or clouds or the jagged unforgiving peaks of a mountain nothing mattered but that she was wrapped around him that her breath was fast and hot against his skin that her heart beat like wild wings against his all the fear the tension the ugliness poured out of her when he touched her her hands tangled with his fighting to strip away boundaries until they were free to drive together when he filled hertemper passion desperationit was like coming home his breath was in rags his system spent and still he rocked against her just hold me a minute more she pressed her face against his shoulder just hold me but she felt the warm wetness on her fingers and pulled away damn it youre bleeding again let me fix it its fine its all right itll only take a minute ally leave it be the snap of his voice had her eyes narrowing dont think you can step back from me now dont think youll get away with it this time just get dressed he pushed back his hair and began to follow his own orders fine she snatched at clothes dragged them on you want to go another round well go another round you stupid son of a bitch he heard the tremor in her voice cursed her cursed himself dont cry thats playing dirty im not crying you think id cry over you he could feel his heart start to shatter as he brushed a tear off her cheek with his thumb dont she sniffled flicked her hands over her face to dry it and sneered sucker fury whipped into his eyes and scalded her she couldnt have been more delighted she got to her feet before he did but it was close youre in love with me she punched her fist against his chest and you wont admit it that doesnt make you tough it makes you hardheaded you werent listening to me before you werent listening to me either so were even listen now he grabbed her face with both hands you have connections why you insulting she wondered why the top of her head didnt fly off how dare you talk about my familys money at a time like this i dont mean money he jerked her up to her toes then dropped her back on the flat of her feet again now whos stupid moneys nothing i dont give a damn about your portfolio i have my own im talking about emotional connections foundations roots for gods sake you have your own there too frannie will beth my father she waved a hand settling down again but i get you youre saying basically that someone like me who comes from the kind of place i come from should hook herself up with a man who say comes from a good upstanding family probably upper middle class he should have a good education and hold a straight job a profession like say a lawyer or a doctor is that the theme here more or less interesting yes thats interesting she said with a considering nod i can see the logic in that hey you know who fits that bill to a tee dennis overton remember him stalker tire slasher general pain in the ass shed turned it around and boxed him into his own corner all he could do was steam dont cop to excuses blackhawk if you havent got the guts to tell me how you feel about me and what you want for us she flipped her hair back tucked in her shirt my work is done here see you around pal he got to the door before she did he was good at that but this time he slapped a hand on it held it closed while she glared at him you dont walk until were finished i said i was finished she jerked on the door im not shut up and listen you tell me to shut up one more time and he shut her up one hard exasperated kiss ive never loved another woman never even came close so cut me a damn break here her heart did a lovely bounding leap but she nodded stepped back okay spill it you hit me between the eyes the first minute you walked in the room i still cant see straight well she backed up slid onto a stool im liking this so far keep going you see that that right there he stabbed a finger at her anyone else would want to deck you but not you you love that about me apparently he crossed to her laid his hands on the bar on either side of her i love you so thats it oh i dont think so make me a deal you want a deal here it is you ditch the apartment and move in officially upstairs full gym and sauna privileges half the knots in his stomach loosened when he laughed yeah so far i can live with it what else are you offering me nobodys ever going to love you like i do i guarantee it and nobodys ever going to put up with you but i will same goes but thats not enough those wonderful eyes narrowed on her face what do you want she rested her back against the bar marriage now those narrowed eyes darkened do you mean that i say what i mean now i could ask you but i have to figure that a guy who makes a habit of opening doors for women and buying christmas presents for little children leave that part alone okay but she sat up brushed her knuckles over his cheek well just say i figure youve got enough of a traditional guy streak to want to propose on your own so ill let you she linked her hands at the back of his neck im waiting im just thinking its the middle of the night were in a bar and my arms bleeding sos your mouth yeah he swiped at it with the back of his hand i guess that makes it close to perfect for you and me works for me jonah you work for me he pulled the clip out of her hair tossed it aside first tell me you love me use my name i love you jonah then marry me and lets see where it takes us thats a deal epilogue with a howl of outrage ally bolted up from the sofa off side off side what are those refs blind did you see that instead of kicking in the tv which occurred to her she settled for leaning down and pounding on jonahs shoulder youre just mad because your teams losing and youre going to owe me i dont know what youre talking about she sniffed pushing back her hair my team is not going to lose despite corrupt and myopic officials but it looked very dim for her side she planted her hands on her hips besides must i remind you there is no bet because you dont have a license for gambling he skimmed his eyes down her long black robe youre not wearing your badge metaphorically blackhawk she leaned over to kiss him im always wearing my badge then she narrowed her eyes you swear you didnt hear who won this game you have no information absolutely not but she didnt like the way he smiled at her theyd missed the regular monday night broadcast and were watching the hotly contested football game on videotape i dont know about you youre slippery we made a deal he skimmed his hand up the sleeve of her robe trailing his fingers over flesh i never go back on a deal he reached for the remote paused the screen since youre up he held up his empty glass how about a refill i got it last time you were up last time too if youd sit down and stay down you wouldnt get tagged conceding his point she took the glass dont start the game until i get back wouldnt think of it she headed back to the kitchen there were times she missed the apartment on top of the club but even a couple of diehard urbanites needed a little elbow room she thought and the house suited them so did marriage she thought with a contented sigh as she poured jonahs habitual bottled water over ice thered been a lot of changes in the eighteen months since they well closed the deal she supposed good changes the kind lives were built on they were building strong and they were building solid sipping his water she walked back to the great room and frowned when she found it empty then with a shake of her head she set the glass down she knew just where to find him she wound her way quietly through the house and stopped at the door to the bedroom the winter moonlight streamed through the windows glowing over him and the infant he held in his arms love burst through her a nova of feeling then settled again to a steady warmth you woke her up she was awake you woke her up ally repeated crossing to him because you cant keep your hands off her why should i he pressed his lips to his daughters head shes mine no question of that ally traced a finger over the babys soft black hair shes going to have your eyes the idea of it was a staggering thrill he looked down at that perfect little face with those dark and mysterious eyes of the newborn he could see his whole life in those eyes sarahs eyes you cant tell at two weeks the books say it takes longer shes going to have your eyes ally repeated she draped an arm around his waist and together they studied their miracle is she hungry no shes just a night person and his like the woman beside him was his two years before they hadnt existed for him now they were the world he turned his head leaning down as ally lifted her mouth as the kiss sweetened the baby stirred in his arms he shifted tucking sarahs head on his shoulder with a natural grace that never failed to make ally smile hed taken to fatherhood as if hed only been waiting for the moment then again she thought thinking of her own father hed had a wonderful teacher she angled her head studied the two of them i guess she wants to watch the game now jonah rubbed his cheek over his daughters hair she mentioned it shell just fall asleep so will you with a laugh ally took the blanket from the bassinet give her up she said holding out her arms no ally rolled her eyes okay you get her till halftime then its my turn deal with the baby on his shoulder and his hand linked with the womans he loved he went out to enjoy the night the end
