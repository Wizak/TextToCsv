articles recovered from the mss of de quincey will the editor believes be found of substantive value in some cases they throw fresh light on his opinions and ways of thinking in other cases they deal with topics which are not touched at all in his collected works and certainly when read alongside the writings with which the public is already familiar will give altogether a new idea of his range both of interests and activities the brevia especially will probably be regarded as throwing more light on his character and individuality exhibiting more of the inner life in fact than any number of letters or reminiscences from the pens of others would be found to do it is as though the ordinary reader were asked to sit down at ease with the author when he is in his most social and communicative mood when he has donned his dressinggown and slippers and is inclined to unbosom himself and that freely on matters which usually and in general society he would have been inclined to shun or at all events to pass over lightly here we have him at one moment presenting the results of speculations the loftiest that can engage the mind of man at another making note of whimsical or surprising points in the man or woman he has met with or in the books he has read at another amusing himself with the most recent anecdote or bonmot or reflecting on the latest accident or murder or goodnaturedly noting odd lapses in style in magazine or newspaper it must not be supposed that the author himself was inclined to lay such weight on these stray notes as might be presumed from the form in which they are here presented that might give the impression of a most methodic worker and thinker who had before him a carefullyindexed commonplace book into which he posted at the proper place his rough notes and suggestions that was not de quinceys way if he was not one of the wealthy men who care not how they give he was one who made the most careless record even of what was likely to be valuable at all events to himself his habit was to make notes just as they occurred to him and on the sheet that he chanced to have at the moment before him it might be the copy for an article indeed and in a little square patch at the corner separated from the main text by an insulating line of ink drawn round the foreign matter through this not seldom when finished he would lightly draw his pen meaning probably to return to it when his ms came back to him from the printer which accounts it may be in some measure for his reluctance to get rid of or to destroy copy already printed from sometimes we have found on a sheet a dozen or so of lines of a wellknown article and the rest filled up with notes some written one way of the paper some another and now and then entangled in the most surprising fashion in these cases where the notes of course were meant for his own eye he wrote in a small spidery handwriting with many contractions a kind of shorthand of his own and very different indeed from his ordinary clean clear neat penmanship in many cases these notes demanded no little care and closeness in deciphering the more that the mss had been tumbled about and were often deeply stained by glasses other than inkstands having been placed upon them within that circle none dared walk but he said tom hood in his genially humorous way and many of these thoughts were thus partially or wholly encircled pages of articles that had already been printed were intermixed with others that had not and the first piece of work that i entered on was roughly to separate the printed from the unprinted first having carefully copied out from the former any of the spiderylooking notes interjected there to which i have already referred the next process was to arrange the many separate pages and seeming fragments into heaps by subjects and finally to examine these carefully and with a view to connections to place them together in not a few cases where the theme was attractive and the prospect promising utter failure to complete the article or sketch was the result the opening or ending passages or a page in the middle having been unfortunately destroyed or lost so numerous were these notes so varied their subjects that one got quite a new idea of the extreme electrical quality of his mind as he himself called it and i shall have greatly failed in my endeavour in the case of these volumes if i have not succeeded in imparting something of the same impression to the reader here we have proof that vast schemes such as the great history of england of which mr james hogg senr humorously told us in his recollections memoir ch ed pp were not merely subjects of conversation and jest but that he had actually proceeded to build up masses of notes and figures with a view to these and various slips and pages remain to show that he had actually commenced to write the history of england the short article included in the present volume on the power of the house of commons as custodian of the purse is marked for my history of england other portions are marked as intended for my book on the infinite and others still for my book on the relations of christianity to man one can infer indeed that several of the articles wellknown to us notably christianity as an organ of political movement for one were originally conceived as portions of a great work on christianity in relation to human development it is thus necessary to be very explicit in stating that though these notes are as faithfully reproduced as has been possible to me the classification and arrangement of them under which they assume the aspect of something of one connected essay on the main subject i alone am responsible for though i do not believe so definite and clear were his ideas on certain subjects and in certain relations that he himself would have regarded them as losing anything by such arrangement but rather gaining very much if they were to be given at all to the public several of the articles in this volume suggest that he also contemplated a great work on paganism and christianity in which he would have demonstrated that paganism had exhausted all the germs of progress that lay within it and that all beyond the points reached by paganism is due to christianity and alone to christianity which in opening up a clear view of the infinite through purely experimental mediums in mans heart touched to new life science philosophy art invention and every kind of culture respecting the recovered suspiria all that it is needful to say will be found in an introduction special to that head and it does not seem to me that i need to add here anything more in every other respect the articles must speak for themselves de quinceys posthumous works i suspiria de profundis introduction with complete list of the suspiria the finale to the first part of the suspiria as we find from a note of the authors own was to include the dark interpreter the spectre of the brocken and savannahlamar the references to the dark interpreter in the latter would thus become intelligible as the reader is not there in any full sense informed who the dark interpreter was and the piece recovered from his mss and now printed may thus be regarded as having a special value for de quincey students and indeed for readers generally in blackwoods magazine he did indeed interpolate a sentence or two and these were reproduced in the american edition of the works fieldss but they are so slight and general compared with the complete suspiria now presented that they do not in any way detract from its originality and value the masteridea of the suspiria is the power which lies in suffering in agony unuttered and unutterable to develop the intellect and the spirit of man to open these to the ineffable conceptions of the infinite and to some discernment otherwise impossible of the beneficent might that lies in pain and sorrow de quincey seeks his symbols sometimes in natural phenomena oftener in the creation of mighty abstractions and the moral of all must be set forth in the burden of the daughter of lebanon that god may give by seeming to refuse prosepoems as they have been called they are deeply philosophical presenting under the guise of phantasy the profoundest laws of the working of the human spirit in its most terrible disciplines and asserting for the darkest phenomena of human life some compensating elements as awakeners of hope and fear and awe the sense of a great pariah world is ever present with him a world of outcasts and of innocents bearing the burden of vicarious woes and thus it is that his title is justified suspiria de profundis sighs from the depths we find de quincey writing in his prefatory notice to the enlarged edition of the confessions in november all along i had relied upon a crowning grace which i had reserved for the final page of this volume in a succession of some twenty or twentyfive dreams and noonday visions which had arisen under the latter stage of opium influence these have disappeared some under circumstances which allow me a reasonable prospect of recovering them some unaccountably and some dishonourably five or six i believe were burned in a sudden conflagration which arose from the spark of a candle falling unobserved amongst a very large pile of papers in a bedroom where i was alone and reading falling not on but amongst and within the papers the fire would soon have been ahead of conflict and by communicating with the slight woodwork and draperies of a bed it would have immediately enveloped the laths of the ceiling overhead and thus the house far from fireengines would have been burned down in halfanhour my attention was first drawn by a sudden light upon my book and the whole difference between a total destruction of the premises and a trivial loss from books charred of five guineas was due to a large spanish cloak this thrown over and then drawn down tightly by the aid of one sole person somewhat agitated but retaining her presence of mind effectually extinguished the fire amongst the papers burned partially but not so burned as to be absolutely irretrievable was the daughter of lebanon and this i have printed and have intentionally placed it at the end as appropriately closing a record in which the case of poor ann the outcast formed not only the most memorable and the most suggestively pathetic incident but also that which more than any other coloured or more truly i should say shaped moulded and remoulded composed and decomposed the great body of opium dreams after this loss of the greater portion of the suspiria copy de quincey seems to have become indifferent in some degree to their continuity and relation to each other he drew the affliction of childhood and dream echoes which stood early in the order of the suspiria into the autobiographic sketches and also the spectre of the brocken which was meant to come somewhat later in the series as originally planned and as we have seen he appended the daughter of lebanon to the opium confessions without any reference save in the preface to its really having formed part of a separate collection of dreams from a list found among his mss we are able to give the arrangement of the whole as it would have appeared had no accident occurred and all the papers been at hand those

this woman that beckoneth and warneth me from the place where she is and in whose eyes is woeful remembrance i guess who she is big cross cagot and cressida lethe and anapaula oh sweep away angel with angelic scorn the dogs that come with curious eyes to gaze thus of the thirtytwo suspiria intended by the author we have only nine that received his final corrections and even with those now recovered we have only about one half of the whole presuming that those which are lost or remained unwritten would have averaged about the same length as those we have to those who have studied the suspiria as published how suggestive many of these titles will be count the leaves in vallombrosa what phantasies would that have conjured up the lost the apparently wasted of the leaves from the tree of human life and the possibilities of use and redemption de quincey would there doubtless have given us under a form more or less fanciful or symbolical his reading of the problem why nature out of fifty seeds so often brings but one to bear the case of the cagots the pariahs of the pyrenees as we know from references elsewhere excited his curiosity as did all of the pariah class and much engaged his attention and in the cagot and cressida suspiria we should probably have had under symbols of mighty abstractions the vision of the pariah world and the world of health and outward fortune which scorns and excludes the other and partly at all events actively dooms it to a living death in england of today as in india of the past and in jewry of old where the leper was thrust outside the wall to wail unclean unclean the dark interpreter oh eternity with outstretched wings that broodest over the secret truths in whose roots lie the mysteries of man his whence his whither have i searched thee and struck a right key on thy dreadful organ suffering is a mightier agency in the hands of nature as a demiurgus creating the intellect than most people are aware of the truth i heard often in sleep from the lips of the dark interpreter who is he he is a shadow reader but a shadow with whom you must suffer me to make you acquainted you need not be afraid of him for when i explain his nature and origin you will see that he is essentially inoffensive or if sometimes he menaces with his countenance that is but seldom and then as his features in those moods shift as rapidly as clouds in a gale of wind you may always look for the terrific aspects to vanish as fast as they have gathered as to his origin what it is i know exactly but cannot without a little circuit of preparation make you understand perhaps you are aware of that power in the eye of many children by which in darkness they project a vast theatre of phantasmagorical figures moving forwards or backwards between their bedcurtains and the chamber walls in some children this power is semivoluntary they can control or perhaps suspend the shows but in others it is altogether automatic i myself at the date of my last confessions had seen in this way more processions generally solemn mournful belonging to eternity but also at times glad triumphal pomps that seemed to enter the gates of time than all the religions of paganism fierce or gay ever witnessed now there is in the dark places of the human spirit in grief in fear in vindictive wrath a power of selfprojection not unlike to this thirty years ago it may be a man called symons committed several murders in a sudden epilepsy of planetstruck fury according to my recollection this case happened at hoddesdon which is in middlesex revenge is sweet was his hellish motto on that occasion and that motto itself records the abysses which a human will can open revenge is not sweet unless by the mighty charm of a charity that seeketh not her own it has become benignant and what he had to revenge was womans scorn he had been a plain farmservant and in fact he was executed as such men often are on a proper point of professional respect to their calling in a smockfrock or blouse to render so ugly a clash of syllables his young mistress was every way and by much his superior as well in prospects as in education but the man by nature arrogant and little acquainted with the world presumptuously raised his eyes to one of his young mistresses great was the scorn with which she repulsed his audacity and her sisters participated in her disdain upon this affront he brooded night and day and after the term of his service was over and he in effect forgotten by the family one day he suddenly descended amongst the women of the family like an avatar of vengeance right and left he threw out his murderous knife without distinction of person leaving the room and the passage floating in blood the final result of this carnage was not so terrific as it threatened to be some i think recovered but also one who did not recover was unhappily a stranger to the whole cause of his fury now this murderer always maintained in conversation with the prison chaplain that as he rushed on in his hellish career he perceived distinctly a dark figure on his right hand keeping pace with himself upon that the superstitious of course supposed that some fiend had revealed himself and associated his superfluous presence with the dark atrocity symons was not a philosopher but my opinion is that he was too much so to tolerate that hypothesis since if there was one man in all europe that needed no tempter to evil on that evening it was precisely mr symons as nobody knew better than mr symons himself i had not the benefit of his acquaintance or i would have explained it to him the fact is in point of awe a fiend would be a poor trivial bagatelle compared to the shadowy projections umbras and penumbras which the unsearchable depths of mans nature is capable under adequate excitement of throwing off and even into stationary forms i shall have occasion to notice this point again there are creative agencies in every part of human nature of which the thousandth part could never be revealed in one life you have heard reader in vision which describes our ladies of sorrow particularly in the dark admonition of madonna to her wicked sister that hateth and tempteth what root of dark uses may lie in moral convulsions not the uses hypocritically vaunted by theatrical devotion which affronts the majesty of god that ever and in all things loves truth prefers sincerity that is erring to piety that cants rebellion which is the sin of witchcraft is more pardonable in his sight than speechifying resignation listening with complacency to its own selfconquests show always as much neighbourhood as thou canst to grief that abases itself which will cost thee but little effort if thine own grief hath been great but god who sees thy efforts in secret will slowly strengthen those efforts and make that to be a real deed bearing tranquillity for thyself which at first was but a feeble wish breathing homage to him in afterlife from twenty to twentyfour on looking back to those struggles of my childhood i used to wonder exceedingly that a child could be exposed to struggles on such a scale but two views unfolded upon me as my experience widened which took away that wonder the first was the vast scale upon which the sufferings of children are found everywhere expanded in the realities of life the generation of infants which you see is but part of those who belong to it were born in it and make the world over not one half of it the missing half more than an equal number to those of any age that are now living have perished by every kind of torments three thousand children per annum that is three hundred thousand per century that is omitting sundays about ten every day pass to heaven through flames in this very island of great britain and of those who survive to reach maturity what multitudes have fought with fierce pangs of hunger cold and nakedness when i came to know all this then reverting my eye to my struggle i said oftentimes it was nothing secondly in watching the infancy of my own children i made another discovery it is well known to mothers to nurses and also to philosophers that the tears and lamentations of infants during the year or so when they have no other language of complaint run through a gamut that is as inexhaustible as the cremona of paganini an ear but moderately learned in that language cannot be deceived as to the rate and modulus of the suffering which it indicates a fretful or peevish cry cannot by any efforts make itself impassioned the cry of impatience of hunger of irritation of reproach of alarm are all different different as a chorus of beethoven from a chorus of mozart but if ever you saw an infant suffering for an hour as sometimes the healthiest does under some attack of the stomach which has the tigergrasp of the oriental cholera then you will hear moans that address to their mothers an anguish of supplication for aid such as might storm the heart of moloch once hearing it you will not forget it now it was a constant remark of mine after any storm of that nature occurring suppose once in two months that always on the following day when a long long sleep had chased away the darkness and the memory of the darkness from the little creatures brain a sensible expansion had taken place in the intellectual faculties of attention observation and animation it renewed the case of our great modern poet who on listening to the raving of the midnight storm and the crashing which it was making in the mighty woods reminded himself that all this hell of trouble tells also of bright calms that shall succeed pain driven to agony or grief driven to frenzy is essential to the ventilation of profound natures a sea which is deeper than any that count massigli measured cannot be searched and torn up from its sleeping depths without a levanter or a monsoon a nature which is profound in excess but also introverted and abstracted in excess so as to be in peril of wasting itself in interminable reverie cannot be awakened sometimes without afflictions that go to the very foundations heaving stirring yet finally harmonizing and it is in such cases that the dark interpreter does his work revealing the worlds of pain and agony and woe possible to man possible even to the innocent spirit of a child the solitude of childhood as nothing which is impassioned escapes the eye of poetry neither has this escaped it that there is or may be through solitude sublime attractions of the grave but even poetry has not perceived that these attractions may arise for a child not indeed a passion for the grave as the grave from that a child revolts but a passion for the grave as the portal through which it may recover some heavenly countenance mother or sister that has vanished through solitude this passion may be exalted into a frenzy like a nympholepsy at first when in childhood we find ourselves torn away from the lips that we could hang on for ever we throw out our arms in vain struggles to snatch at them and pull them back again but when we have felt for a time how hopeless is that effort and that they cannot come to us we desist from that struggle and next we whisper to our hearts might not we go to them such in principle and origin was the famous dulce domum of the english schoolboy such is the heimweh homesickness of the german and swiss soldier in foreign service such is the passion of the calenture doubtless reader you have seen it described the poor sailor is in tropical latitudes deep breathless calms have prevailed for weeks fever and delirium are upon him suddenly from his restless hammock he starts up he will fret no longer in darkness he ascends upon deck how motionless are the deeps how vast how sweet are these shining zaarrahs of water he gazes and slowly under the blazing scenery of his brain the scenery of his eye unsettles the waters are swallowed up the seas have disappeared green fields appear a silent dell and a pastoral cottage two faces appear are at the door sweet female faces and behold they beckon him come to us they seem to say the picture rises to his wearied brain like a sanctus from the choir of a cathedral and in the twinkling of an eye stung to madness by the cravings of his heart the man is overboard he is gone he is lost for this world but if he missed the arms of the lovely women wife and sister whom he sought assuredly he has settled into arms that are mightier and not less indulgent i young as i was had one feeling not learned from books and that could not have been learned from books the deepest of all that connect themselves with natural scenery it is the feeling which in the hartleap well of wordsworth in his danish boy and other exquisite poems is brought out viz the breathless mysterious panlike silence that haunts the noonday if there were winds abroad then i was roused myself into sympathetic tumults but if this dead silence haunted the air then the peace which was in nature echoed another peace which lay in graves and i fell into a sick languishing for things which a voice from heaven seemed to say cannot be granted there is a german superstition which eight or ten years after i read of the erlking and his daughter the daughter had power to tempt infants away into the invisible world but it is as the reader understands by collusion with some infirmity of sick desire for such worlds in the infant itself who is that rides through the forest so fast it is a knight who carries his infant upon his saddlebow the erlkings daughter rides by his side and in words audible only when she means them to be heard she says if thou wilt dear baby with me go away we will see a fine show we will play a fine play that sounds lovely to my ears oh yes that collusion with dim sleeping infancy is lovely to me but i was too advanced in intellect to have been tempted by such temptations still there was a perilous attraction for me in worlds that slept and rested and if the erlkings daughter had revealed herself to my perceptions there was one show that she might have promised which would have wiled me away with her into the dimmest depths of the mightiest and remotest forests who is this woman that beckoneth and warneth me from the place where she is and in whose eyes is woeful remembrance i guess who she is in my dreams were often prefigurements of my future as i could not but read the signs what man has not some time in dewy morn or sequestered eve or in the still nightwatches when deep sleep falleth on other men but visiteth not his weary eyelids what man i say has not some time hushed his spirit and questioned with himself whether some things seen or obscurely felt were not anticipated as by mystic foretaste in some far halcyon time postnatal or antenatal he knew not only assuredly he knew that for him past and present and future merged in one awful moment of lightning revelation oh spirit that dwelleth in man how subtle are thy revelations how deep how delirious the raptures thou canst inspire how poignant the stings with which thou canst pierce the heart how sweet the honey with which thou assuagest the wound how dark the despairs and accusings that lie behind thy curtains and leap upon us like lightning from the cloud with the sense as of some heavenly blazoning and oftentimes carry us beyond ourselves it is a sweet morning in june and the fragrance of the roses is wafted towards me as i move for i am walking in a lawny meadow still wet with dew and a wavering mist lies over the distance suddenly it seems to lift and out of the dewy dimness emerges a cottage embowered with roses and clustering clematis and the hills in which it is set like a gem are treeclad and rise billowy behind it and to the right and to the left are glistening expanses of water over the cottage there hangs a halo as if clouds had but parted there from the door of that cottage emerges a figure the countenance full of the trepidation of some dread woe feared or remembered with waving arm and tearful uplifted face the figure first beckons me onward and then when i have advanced some yards frowning warns me away as i still continue to advance despite the warning darkness falls figure cottage hills trees and halo fade and disappear and all that remains to me is the look on the face of her that beckoned and warned me away i read that glance as by the inspiration of a moment we had been together together we had entered some troubled gulf struggled together suffered together was it as lovers torn asunder by calamity was it as combatants forced by bitter necessity into bitter feud when we only in all the world yearned for peace together oh what a searching glance was that which she cast on me as if she being now in the spiritual world abstracted from flesh remembered things that i could not remember oh how i shuddered as the sweet sunny eyes in the sweet sunny morning of june the month that was my angelical half spring yet with summer dress that to me was very angelical seemed reproachfully to challenge in me recollections of things passed thousands of years ago old indeed yet that were made new again for us because now first it was that we met again oh heavens it came over me as doth the raven over the infected house as from a bed of violets sweeps the saintly odour of corruption what a glimpse was thus revealed glory in despair as of that gorgeous vegetation that hid the sterilities of the grave in the tropics of that summer long ago of that heavenly beauty which slept side by side within my sisters coffin in the month of june of those saintly swells that rose from an infinite distance i know not whether to or from my sister could this be a memorial of that nature are the nearer and more distant stages of life thus dimly connected and the connection hidden but suddenly revealed for a moment this lady for years appeared to me in dreams in that considering the electric character of my dreams and that they were far less like a lake reflecting the heavens than like the pencil of some mighty artist da vinci or michael angelo that cannot copy in simplicity but comments in freedom while reflecting in fidelity there was nothing to surprise but a change in this appearance was remarkable oftentimes after eight years had passed she appeared in summer dawn at a window it was a window that opened on a balcony this feature only gave a distinction a refinement to the aspect of the cottage else all was simplicity spirit of peace dovelike dawn that slept upon the cottage ye were not broken by any participation in my grief and despair for ever the vision of that cottage was renewed did i roam in the depths of sweet pastoral solitudes in the west with the tinkling of sheepbells in my ears a rounded hillock seen vaguely would shape itself into a cottage and at the door my monitory regretful hebe would appear did i wander by the seashore one gentlyswelling wave in the vast heaving plain of waters would suddenly transform itself into a cottage and i by some involuntary inward impulse would in fancy advance toward it ah reader you will think this which i am going to say too near too holy for recital but not so the deeper a woe touches me in heart so much the more am i urged to recite it the world disappears i see only the grand reliques of a world memorials of a love that has departed has been the record of a sorrow that is and has its greyness converted into verdure monuments of a wrath that has been reconciled of a wrong that has been atoned for convulsions of a storm that has gone by what i am going to say is the most like a superstitious thing that i ever shall say and i have reason to think that every man who is not a villain once in his life must be superstitious it is a tribute which he pays to human frailty which tribute if he will not pay which frailty if he will not share then also he shall not have any of its strength the face of this monitory hebe haunted me for some years in a way that i must faintly attempt to explain it is little to say that it was the sweetest face with the most peculiar expression of sweetness that i had ever seen that was much but that was earthly there was something more terrific believe me than this yet that was not the word terror looks to the future and this perhaps did but not primarily chiefly it looked at some unknown past and was for that reason awful yes awful that was the word thus on any of those heavenly sunny mornings that now are buried in an endless grave did i transported by no human means enter that cottage and descend to that breakfastroom my earliest salute was to her that ever as the look of pictures do with her eyes pursued me round the room and oftentimes with a subtle checking of grief as if great sorrow had been or would be hers and it was too in the sweet maytime oh yes she was but as if she had been as if it were her original chosen to have been the aurora of a heavenly clime and then suddenly she was as one of whom for some thousand years paradise had received no report then again as if she entered the gates of paradise not less innocent and again as if she could not enter and some blame but i knew not what blame was mine and now she looked as though broken with a woe that no man could read as she sought to travel back to her early joy yet no longer a joy that is sublime in innocency but a joy from which sprung abysses of memories polluted into anguish till her tears seemed to be suffused with drops of blood all around was peace and the deep silence of untroubled solitude only in the lovely lady was a sign of horror that had slept under deep ages of frost in her heart and now rose as with the rushing of wings to her face could it be supposed that one life so pitiful a thing was what moved her care oh no it was or it seemed as if this poor wreck of a life happened to be that one which determined the fate of some thousand others nothing less nothing so abject as one poor fifty years nothing less than a century of centuries could have stirred the horror that rose to her lovely lips as once more she waved me away from the cottage oh reader five years after i saw that sweet face in reality saw it in the flesh saw that pomp of womanhood saw that cottage saw a thousand times that lovely domicile that heard the cooing of the solitary dove in the solitary morning saw the grace of childhood and the shadows of graves that lay like creatures asleep in the sunshine saw also the horror somehow realized as a shadowy reflection from myself which warned me off from that cottage and which still rings through the dreams of fiveandtwenty years the general sentiment or sense of preexistence of which this suspiria may be regarded as one significant and affecting illustration had this record in the outset of the reminiscences of wordsworth oh sense of mysterious preexistence by which through years in which as yet a stranger to those valleys of westmoreland i viewed myself as a phantom self a second identity projected from my own consciousness and already living amongst them how was it and by what prophetic instinct that already i said to myself oftentimes when chasing daydreams along the pictures of these wild mountainous labyrinths which as yet i had not traversed here in some distant year i shall be shaken with love and there with stormiest grief and regret whence was it that sudden revelations came upon me like the drawings up of a curtain and closing again as rapidly of scenes that made the future heaven of my life and how was it that in thought i was and yet in reality was not a denizen already in of lakes and forest lawns which i never saw till and that by a prophetic instinct of heart i rehearsed and lived over as it were in vision those chapters of my life which have carried with them the weightiest burden of joy and sorrow and by the margin of those very lakes and hills with which i prefigured this connection and in short that for me by a transcendent privilege during the novitiate of my life most truly i might say in today already walked tomorrow the princess who overlooked one seed in a pomegranate there is a story told in the arabian nights of a princess who by overlooking one seed of a pomegranate precipitated the event which she had laboured to make impossible she lies in wait for the event which she foresees the pomegranate swells opens splits the seeds which she knows to be roots of evil rapidly she swallows but one only one before it could be arrested rolls away into a river it is lost it is irrecoverable she has triumphed but she must perish already she feels the flames mounting up which are to consume her and she calls for water hastily not to deliver herself for that is impossible but nobly forgetting her own misery that she may prevent that destruction of her brother mortal which had been the original object for hazarding her own yet why go to arabian fictions even in our daily life is exhibited in proportions far more gigantic that tendency to swell and amplify itself into mountains of darkness which exists oftentimes in germs that are imperceptible an error in human choice an infirmity in the human will though it were at first less than a mote though it should swerve from the right line by an interval less than any thread that ever spider twisted from her womb sometimes begins to swell to grow to widen its distance rapidly travels off into boundless spaces remote from the true centre spaces incalculable and irretraceable until hope seems extinguished and return impossible such was the course of my own opium career such is the history of human errors every day such was the original sin of the greek theories on deity which could not have been healed but by putting off their own nature and kindling into a new principle absolutely undiscoverable as i contend for the grecian intellect oftentimes an echo goes as it were to sleep the series of reverberations has died away suddenly a second series awakens this subsides then a third wakens up so of actions done in youth after great tumults all is quieted you dream that they are over in a moment in the twinkling of an eye on some fatal morning in middlelife the faroff consequences come back upon you and you say to yourself oh heaven if i had fifty lives this crime would reappear as pelion upon ossa so was it with my affection left to natural peace i might have conquered it verschmerzeon to charm it down by the mere suffering of grief to hush it by endurance that was the natural policy that was the natural process but behold a new form of sorrow arises and the two multiply together and the worm which was beginning to fall asleep is roused again to pestilential fierceness notes for suspiria mystery unfathomable of death mystery unapproachable of god destined it was from the foundations of the world that each mystery should make war upon the other once that the lesser mystery should swallow up for a moment a limbus of the greater and that woe is past once that the greater mystery should swallow up for ever the whole vortex of the lesser and that glory is yet to come after which man that is the son of god shall lift up his eyes for ever saying behold these were two mysteries and one is not and there is but one mystery that survives for ever if an eternity death supposed is as vast as a star yet the most miserable of earthly blocks not four feet square will eclipse masque hide it from centre to circumference and so it really is incredible as it might seem apart from experience the dreadful reality of death is utterly withdrawn from us because itself dwindles to an apparent mote and the perishing nonreality thickens into a darkness as massy as a rock great changes summon to great meditations daily we see the most joyous of events take a colouring of solemnity from the mere relation in which they stand to an uncertain future the birth of a child heir to the greatest expectations and welcomed clamorously by the sympathy of myriads speaks to the more reflecting in an undertone of monitory sadness were it only as a tribute to the frailty of human expectations and a marriageday of all human events the most lawfully festal yet needs something of effort to chase away the boding sadness which settles unavoidably upon any new career the promise is vague but new hopes have created new dangers and responsibilities contracted perhaps with rapture are charged with menace for every one of us male or female there is a year of crisis a year of solemn and conscious transition a year in which the lighthearted sense of the irresponsible ceases to gild the heavenly dawn a year there is settled by no law or usage for me perhaps the eighteenth for you the seventeenth for another the nineteenth within the gates of which underneath the gloomy archway of which sits a phantom of yourself turn a screw tighten a linchpin which is not to disease but perhaps to exalt the mighty machinery of the brain and the infinities appear before which the tranquillity of man unsettles the gracious forms of life depart and the ghostly enters so profoundly is this true that oftentimes i have said of my own tremendous experience in this region destined too certainly i fear finally to swallow up intellect and the life of life in the heart unless god of his mercy fetches me away by some sudden death that death considered as an entrance to this ghostly world is but a posterngate by comparison with the heavenaspiring vestibule through which this world of the infinite introduces the ghostly world time if it does not diminish grief alters its character at first we stretch out our hands in very blindness of heart as if trying to draw back again those whom we have lost but after a season when the impotence of such efforts has become too sensibly felt finding that they will not come back to us a strange fascination arises which yearns after some mode of going to them there is a gulf fixed which childhood rarely can pass but we link our wishes with whatsoever would gently waft us over we stretch out our hands and say sister lend us thy help and plead for us with god that we may pass over without much agony the joy of an infant or joygeneration without significance to an unprofound and common mind how strange to see the excess of pathos in that yet men of any or at least of much sensibility see in this a transpicuous masque for another form viz the eternal ground of sorrow in all human hearts this by the way in an essay on william wordsworth should be noticed as the charm of his poetry and the note differential in fact at least i know not of any former poet who has so systematically sought his sadness in the very luxury of joy thus in the two april mornings what a mortal freshness of dewy radiance what an attraction of early summer what a vision of roses in june yet it is all transmuted to a purpose of sadness ah reader scorn not that which whether you refuse it or not as the reality of realities is assuredly the reality of dreams linking us to a far vaster cycle in which the love and the languishing the ruin and the horror of this world are but moments but elements in an eternal circle the cycle stretches from an east that is forgotten to a west that is but conjectured the mere fact of your own individual calamity is a life the tragedy is a nature the hope is but as a dim augury written on a flower if the things that have fretted us had not some art for retiring into secret oblivion what a hell would life become now understand how in some nervous derangements this horror really takes place some things that had sunk into utter forgetfulness others that had faded into visionary power all rise as gray phantoms from the dust the field of our earthly combats that should by rights have settled into peace is all alive with hosts of resurrections cavalries that sweep in gusty charges columns that thunder from afar arms gleaming through clouds of sulphur god takes care for the religion of little children wheresoever his christianity exists wheresoever there is a national church established to which a child sees all his protectors resort wheresoever he beholds amongst earthly creatures whom most he honours prostrate in devotion before these illimitable heavens which fill to overflowing the total capacities of his young adoring heart wheresoever at intervals he beholds the sleep of death falling upon the men or women whom he has seen a depth stretching as far below his power to fathom as those persons ascend beyond his powers to pursue god speaks to their hearts by dreams and their tumultuous grandeurs even by solitude does god speak to little children when made vocal by the services of christianity as also he does by darkness wheresoever it is peopled with visions of his almighty power for a pagan child for a greek child solitude was nothing for a christian child it is made the power of god and the hieroglyphic of his most distant truth the solitude in life is deep for the millions who have none to love them and deep for those who suffer by secret and incommunicable woe and have none to pity them thus be you assured that though infancy talks least of that which slumbers deepest it yet rests in its own transcendent solitude but infancy you say talks surely most of that which is uppermost in its heart yes doubtless of that which is uppermost but not at all of that which slumbers below the foundations of its heart and then follows a suggestion to put in a note i except one case the case of any child who is marked for death by organic disease and knows it in such cases the creature is changed that which would have been unchildlike ceases to offend for a new character is forming footnotes see the story of the young soldier who told his officer on having been struck by him that he would make him repent it close of autobiographic sketch infant literature three thousand children are annually burnt to death in the nations of england and scotland chiefly through the carelessness of parents i shudder to add another and darker cause which is a deep disgrace to the present age count massigli an austrian officer in the imperial service about sixty years ago fathomed and attempted to fathom many parts of the mediterranean and the atlantic if i remember rightly he found the bottom within less than an english mile the story and the verses are or used to be well known a schoolboy forbidden to return home at the holidays is suspected to have written the lyrical latin verses upon the rapture of returning home and to have breathed out his life in the anguish of thus reviving the images which for him were never to be realized the reader must not fancy any flaw in the latin title it is elliptic revisere being understood or some similar word i allude to the signatures of nature ii the loveliest sight for womans eyes the loveliest sight that a womans eye opens upon in this world is her firstborn child and the holiest sight upon which the eyes of god settle in almighty sanction and perfect blessing is the love which soon kindles between the mother and her infant mute and speechless on the one side with no language but tears and kisses and looks beautiful is the philosophy which arises out of that reflection or passion connected with the transition that has produced it first comes the whole mighty drama of love purified ever more and more how often from grosser feelings yet of necessity through its very elements oscillating between the finite and the infinite the haughtiness of womanly pride so dignified yet not always free from the near contagion of error the romance so ennobling yet not always entirely reasonable the tender dawn of opening sentiments pointing to an idea in all this which it neither can reach nor could long sustain think of the great storm of agitation and fear and hope through which in her earliest days of womanhood every woman must naturally pass fulfilling a law of her creator yet a law which rests upon her mixed constitution animal though indefinitely ascending to what is nonanimal as a daughter of man frail and imperfect yet also as a daughter of god standing erect with eyes to the heavens next when the great vernal passover of sexual tenderness and romance has fulfilled its purpose we see rising as a phoenix from this great mystery of ennobled instincts another mystery much more profound more affecting more divine not so much a rapture as a blissful repose of a sabbath which swallows up the more perishing story of the first forcing the vast heart of female nature through stages of ascent forcing it to pursue the transmigrations of the psyche from the aurelic condition so glowing in its colour into the winged creature which mixes with the mystery of the dawn and ascends to the altar of the infinite heavens rising by a ladder of light from that sympathy which god surveys with approbation and even more so as he beholds it selfpurifying under his christianity to that sympathy which needs no purification but is the holiest of things on this earth and that in which god most reveals himself through the nature of humanity well is it for the glorification of human nature that through these the vast majority of women must for ever pass well also that by placing its sublime germs near to female youth god thus turns away by anticipation the divinest of disciplines from the rapacious absorption of the grave time is found how often for those who are early summoned into rendering back their glorious privilege who yet have tasted in its firstfruits the paradise of maternal love and pertaining also to this part of the subject i will tell you a result of my own observations of no light importance to women it is this nineteen times out of twenty i have remarked that the true paradise of a female life in all ranks not too elevated for constant intercourse with the children is by no means the years of courtship nor the earliest period of marriage but that sequestered chamber of her experience in which a mother is left alone through the day with servants perhaps in a distant part of the house and god be thanked chiefly where there are no servants at all she is attended by one sole companion her little firstborn angel as yet clinging to her robe imperfectly able to walk still more imperfect in its prattling and innocent thoughts clinging to her haunting her wherever she goes as her shadow catching from her eye the total inspiration of its little palpitating heart and sending to hers a thrill of secret pleasure so often as its little fingers fasten on her own left alone from morning to night with this one companion or even with three still wearing the graces of infancy buds of various stages upon the selfsame tree a woman if she has the great blessing of approaching such a luxury of paradise is moving too often not aware that she is moving through the divinest section of her life as evening sets in the husband through all walks of life from the highest professional down to that of common labour returns home to vary her modes of conversation by such thoughts and interests as are more consonant with his more extensive capacities of intellect but by that time her child or her children will be reposing on the little couch and in the morning duly as the sun ascends in power she sees before her a long long day of perfect pleasure in this society which evening will bring to her but which is interwoven with every fibre of her sensibilities this condition of noiseless quiet love is that above all which god blesses and smiles upon footnotes how purified and if it should be answered through and under christianity the fool in his heart would scoff and say what woman thinks of religion in her youthful courtship no but it is not what she thinks of but what thinks of her not what she contemplates in consciousness but what contemplates her and reaches her by a necessity of social ideal action romance is the product of christianity but so is sentiment iii why the pagans could not invest their gods with any iota of grandeur it is not for so idle a purpose as that of showing the pagan backsliding that is too evident but for a far subtler purpose and one which no man has touched viz the incapacity of creating grandeur for the pagans even with carte blanche in their favour that i write this paper nothing is more incomprehensible than the following fact nothing than this when mastered and understood is more thoroughly instructive the fact that having a wide a limitless field open before them free to give and to take away at their own pleasure the pagans could not invest their gods with any iota of grandeur diana when you translate her into the moon then indeed partakes in all the natural grandeur of a planet associated with a dreamy light with forests forest lawns etc or the wild accidents of a huntress but the moon and the huntress are surely not the creations of pagans nor indebted to them for anything but the murderous depluming which pagan mythology has operated upon all that is in earth or in the waters that are under the earth now why could not the ancients raise one little scintillating glory in behalf of their monstrous deities so far are they from thus raising jupiter that he is sometimes made the ground of nature not observe for any positive reason that they had for any relation that jupiter had to creation but simply for the negative reason that they had nobody else never does jupiter seem more disgusting than when as just now in a translation of the batrachia i read that jupiter had given to frogs an amphibious nature making the awful ancient firstborn secrets of chaos to be his and thus forcing into contrast and remembrance his odious personality why why why could not the romans etc make a grandeur for their gods not being able to make them grand they daubed them with finery all that people imagine in the jupiter olympus of phidias they themselves confer but an apostle is beyond their reach when be it well observed the cruel and dark religions are far more successful than those of greece and rome for osiris etc by the might of the devil of darkness are truly terrific cybele stands as a middle term halfway between these dark forms and the greek or roman pluto is the very model of a puny attempt at darkness utterly failing he looks big he paints himself histrionically he soots his face he has a masterful dog nothing half so fearful as a wolfdog or bloodhound and he raises his own manes poor stridulous struldbrugs vainly did the ancient pagans fight against this fatal weakness they may confer upon their gods glittering titles of ambrosial immortal but the human mind is careless of positive assertion and of clamorous iteration in however angry a tone when silently it observes stealing out of facts already conceded some fatal consequence at war with all these empty pretensions mortal even in the virtual conceptions of the pagans if the pagan gods were really immortal if essentially they repelled the touch of mortality and not through the adulatory homage of their worshipers causing their true aspects to unsettle or altogether to disappear in clouds of incense then how came whole dynasties of gods to pass away and no man could tell whither if really they defied the grave then how was it that age and the infirmities of age passed upon them like the shadow of eclipse upon the golden faces of the planets if apollo were a beardless young man his father was not such he was in the vigour of maturity maturity is a flattering term for expressing it but it means past youth and his grandfather was superannuated but even this grandfather who had been once what apollo was now could not pretend to more than a transitory station in the long succession of gods other dynasties known even to man there had been before his and elder dynasties before that of whom only rumours and suspicions survived even this taint however this direct access of mortality was less shocking to my mind in afteryears than the abominable fact of its reflex or indirect access in the shape of grief for others who had died i need not multiply instances they are without end the reader has but to throw his memory back upon the anguish of jupiter in the iliad for the approaching death of his son sarpedon and his vain struggles to deliver himself from this ghastly net or upon thetis fighting against the vision of her matchless pelides caught in the same vortex or upon the muse in euripides hovering in the air and wailing over her young rhesus her brave her beautiful one of whom she trusted that he had been destined to confound the grecian host what a god and liable to the pollution of grief a goddess and standing every hour within the peril of that dismal shadow here in one moment mark the recoil the intolerable recoil upon the pagan mind of that sting which vainly they pretended to have conquered on behalf of their pantheon did the reader fancy that i was fatiguing myself with any task so superfluous as that of proving the gods of the heathen to be no gods in that case he has not understood me my object is to show that the ancients that even the greeks could not support the idea of immortality the idea crumbled to pieces under their touch in realizing that idea unconsciously they suffered elements to slip in which defeated its very essence in the result and not by accident other elements they could not have found doubtless an insolent grecian philosopher would say surely i knew that immortality meant the being liberated from mortality yes but this is no more than the negative idea and the demand is to give the affirmative idea or perhaps i shall better explain my meaning by substituting other terms with my own illustration of their value i say then that the greek idea of immortality involves only the nominal idea not the real idea now the nominal idea or which is the same thing the nominal definition is that which simply sketches the outline of an object in the shape of a problem whereas the real definition fills up that outline and solves that problem the nominal definition states the conditions under which an object would be realized for the mind the real definition executes those conditions the nominal definition that i may express it most briefly and pointedly puts a question the real definition answers that question thus to give our illustration the insoluble problem of squaring the circle presents us with a good nominal idea there is no vagueness at all in the idea of such a square it is that square which when a given circle is laid before you would present the same superficial contents in such exquisite truth of repetition that the eye of god could detect no shadow of more or of less nothing can be plainer than the demand than the question but as to the answer as to the real conditions under which this demand can be realized all the wit of man has not been able to do more than approach it or again the idea of a perfect commonwealth clear enough as a nominal idea is in its infancy as a real idea or perhaps a still more lively illustration to some readers may be the idea of perpetual motion nominally that is as an idea sketched problemwise what is plainer you are required to assign some principle of motion such that it shall revolve through the parts of a mechanism selfsustained suppose those parts to be called by the names of our english alphabet and to stand in the order of our alphabet then a is through b c d etc to pass down with its total power upon z which reciprocally is to come round undiminished upon a b c etc for ever never was a nominal definition of what you want more simple and luminous but coming to the real definition and finding that every letter in succession must still give something less than is received that o for instance cannot give to p all which it received from n then no matter for the triviality of the loss in each separate case always it is gathering and accumulating your hands drop down in despair you feel that a principle of death pervades the machinery retard it you may but come it will at last and a proof remains behind as your only result that whilst the nominal definition may sometimes run before the real definition for ages and yet finally be overtaken by it in other cases the one flies hopelessly before the pursuit of the other defies it and never will be overtaken to the end of time that fate that necessity besieged the grecian idea of immortality rise from forgotten dust my plato stagyrite stand up from the grave anaxagoras with thy bright cloudless intellect that searched the skies heraclitus with thy gloomy mysterious intellect that fathomed the deeps come forward and execute for me this demand how shall that immortality which you give which you must give as a trophy of honour to your pantheon sustain itself against the blights from those humanities which also by an equal necessity starting from your basis give you must to that pantheon how will you prevent the sad reflux of that tide which finally engulfs all things under any attempt to execute the nominal idea of a deity you cannot do it weave your divinities in that grecian loom of yours and no skill in the workmanship nor care that wisdom can devise will ever cure the fatal flaws in the texture for the mortal taint lies not so much in your work as in the original errors of your loom iv on pagan sacrifices ask any wellinformed man at random what he supposes to have been done with the sacrifices he will answer that really he never thought about it but that naturally he supposes the flesh was burnt upon the altars not at all reader a sacrifice to the gods meant universally a banquet to man he who gave a splendid public dinner announced in other words that he designed to celebrate a sacrificial rite this was of course he on the other hand who announced a sacrificial pomp did in other words proclaim by sound of trumpet that he gave a dinner this was of necessity hence when agamemnon offers a hecatomb to jupiter his brother menelaus walks in to dinner greek hachltost without invitation as a brother we are told by homer that no invitation was required he had the privilege of what in german is beautifully called ein kind des hauses a child of the house this dispensation from the necessity of a formal invitation homer explains but as to explanation how he knew that there was a dinner that he passes over as superfluous a vast herd of oxen could not be sacrificed without open and public display of the preparation and that a human banquet must accompany a divine sacrifice this was so much a selfevident truth that homer does not trouble himself to make so needless an explanation hence therefore a case of legislation in st pauls christian administration which i will venture to say few readers understand take the feast of ephesus here as in all cities of asia minor and greece the jews lived in great numbers the universal hospitality over all these regions was exhibited in dinners greek dehipna now it happened not sometimes but always that he who gave a dinner had on the same day made a sacrifice at the great temple nay the dinner was always part of the sacrifice and thus the following dilemma arose scruples of eating part of sacrifices were absolutely unintelligible except as insults to ephesus to deny the existence of diana had no meaning in the ears of an ephesian all that he did understand was that if you happened to be a hater of ephesus you must hate the guardian deity of ephesus and the sole inference he could collect from your refusing to eat what had been hallowed to diana was that you hated ephesus the dilemma therefore was this either grant a toleration of this practice or else farewell to all amicable intercourse for the jews with the citizens in fact it was to proclaim open war if this concession were refused a scruple of conscience might have been allowed for but a scruple of this nature could find no allowance in any pagan city whatever moreover it had really no foundation the truth is far otherwise than that pagan deities were dreams far from it they were as real as any other beings the accommodation therefore which st paul most wisely granted was to eat socially without regard to any ceremony through which the food might have passed so long as the judaizing christian was no party to the religious ceremonies he was free of all participation in idolatry since if the mere open operation of a pagan process could transform into the character of an accomplice one who with no assenting heart ate of the food in that case christ himself might by possibility have shared in an idolatrous banquet and we christians at this day in the east indies might for months together become unconscious accomplices in the foul idolatries of the buddhist and brahminical superstitions but so essentially were the convivial banquets of the pagans interwoven with their religious rites so essentially was a great dinner a great offering to the gods and vice vers a great offering to the gods a great dinner that the very ministers and chief agents in religion were at first the same cocus or greek mageirost was the very same person as the pope or presiding arbiter in succession to a pope sunt eadem says casaubon cocus et pope and of this a most striking example is yet extant in athenus from the correspondence which for many centuries was extant between alexander the great when embarked upon his great expeditions and his royal mother olympias who remained in macedon was one from which we have an extract even at this day where he as we learn from the letter quoted had been urging his mother to purchase for him a good cook and what was made the test supreme of his skill why this that he should be greek thysihn hempeirost an artist able to dress a sacrificial banquet what he meant is this i do not want an ordinary cook who might be equal to the preparation of a plain or what is the same thing secular dinner but a person qualified or competent to take charge of a hecatomb dinner his mothers reply addresses itself to that one point only greek peligua ton mageiron labe hapd thst mtrost which is in effect a cook is it that you want why then you cannot do better than take mine the man is a reliable table of sacrifices he knows the whole ritual of those great official and sacred dinners given by the late king your father he is acquainted with the whole cuisine of the more mysterious religions the orgiacs probably from the neighbouring thrace and all the great ceremonies and observances practised at olympia and even what you may eat on the great st leger day so dont lose sight of the arrangement but take the man as a present from me your affectionate mother and be sure to send off an express for him at your earliest convenience professor robertson smith in his latest work has well pointed out that even with the hebrews the sacrifices were eaten in common till the seventh century b c when the sinofferings in a time of great national distress came to be slain before jehovah and none but the priests ate of the flesh a phase of sacrificial specialization which marks the beginning of the exclusive sacerdotalism of the jews ed v on the mythus that which the tradition of the people is to the truth of facts that is a mythus to the reasonable origin of things transcribers note three dots in a vertical line above a tiny circle these objects to an eye at transcribers note low tiny circle might all melt into one another as stars are confluent which modern astronomy has prismatically split says rennell as a reason for a mahometan origin of a canal through cairo such is the tradition of the people but we see amongst ourselves how great works are ascribed to the devil or to the romans by antiquarians in rennell we see the effects of synthesis he throws back his observations like a woman threading a series of needles or a shuttle running through a series of rings through a succession of egyptian canals p showing the real action of the case that a tendency existed to this and by the way here comes another strong illustration of the popular adulterations they in our country confound the romans a vulgar expression for the roman catholics with the ancient national people of rome here one element of a mythus b has melted into the mythus x and in fardistant times might be very perplexing to antiquarians when the popular tradition was too old for them to see the point of juncture where the alien stream had fallen in then again not only ignorance but love combines to adulterate the tradition every man wishes to give his own country an interest in anything great what an effort has been made to suck sir t r back into scotland thus it is too difficult without a motive to hold apart vast distances or intervals that lie in a field which has all gathered into a blue haze stars divided by millions of miles collapse into each other so mythi and then comes the perplexity the entanglement then come also from lacun arising in these interwelded stories temptations to falsehood by the way even the recent tale of astyages seems to have been pieced the difficulty was to find a motive for cyrus reputed a good man to make war on his grandfather kill him he might by accident but the dream required that he should dethrone his grandfather accordingly the dreadful story is devised but why should cyrus adopt the injuries of a nobleman who if all were true had only saved himself by accident impossible as it would seem to transmute socrates into a mythus considering the broad daylight which then rested upon athenian history and the inextricable way in which socrates is entangled in that history although we have all seen many a scriptural personage so transmuted under far less colourable pretenses or advantages still it is evident that the medival schoolmen did practically treat socrates as something of that sort as a mythical symbolic or representative man socrates is the eternal burthen of their quillets quodlibets problems syllogisms for them he is the ulysses of the odyssey that muchsuffering man or to speak more adequately for them he is the john doe and the richard roe of english law whose feuds have tormented the earth and incensed the heavens through a cycle of uncounted centuries and must have given a bad character of our planet on its english side to such an extent was this pushed that many of the scholastic writers became wearied of enunciating or writing his name and anticipating the occasional fashion of my lud and your ludship at our english bar or of hocus pocus as an abbreviation of pure weariness for hoc est corpus they called him not socrates but sortes now whence let me ask was this custom derived as to doe and roe who or what first set them by the ears together is now probably past all discovery but as to sortes that he was a mere contraction for socrates is proved in the same way that mob is shown to have been a brief way of writing mobile vulgus viz that by bishop stillingfleet in particular the two forms mob and mobile vulgus are used interchangeably and indifferently through several pages consecutively just as canter and canterbury gallop of which the one was at first the mere shorthand expression of the other were at one period interchanged and for the same reason the abbreviated form wore the air of plebeian slang at its first introduction but its convenience favoured it soon it became reconciled to the ear then it ceased to be slang and finally the original form ceasing to have any apparent advantage of propriety or elegance dropped into total disuse sortes it is a clear case inherited from socrates his distressing post of targetgeneral for the arrows of disputatious christendom but how came socrates by that distinction i cannot have a doubt that it was strength of tradition that imputed such a use of the socratic name and character to plato the reader must remember that although socrates was no mythus and least of all could be such to his own leading disciple that was no reason why he should not be treated as a mythus in wales some nine or ten years ago rebecca as the mysterious and masqued redresser of public wrongs was rapidly passing into a mythical expression for that universal character of rhadamanthian avenger or vindicator so of captain rock in ireland so of elias amongst the jews when elias shall come as the sublime mysterious and in some degree pathetic expression for a great teacher lurking amongst the dreadful mists vi davids numbering of the people the politics of the situation you read in the hebrew scriptures of a man who had thirty sons all of whom rode on white asses the riding on white asses is a circumstance that expresses their high rank or distinction that all were princes in syria as in greece and almost everywhere white was the regal symbolic colour and any mode of equitation from the far inferior wealth of ancient times implied wealth mules or asses besides that they were so far superior a race in syria no less than in persia to furnish a favourite designation for a warlike hero could much more conveniently be used on the wretched roads as yet found everywhere until the romans began to treat roadmaking as a regular business of military pioneering in this case therefore there were thirty sons of one man and all provided with princely establishments consequently to have thirty sons at all was somewhat surprising and possible only in a land of polygamy but to keep none back in obscurity as was done in cases where the funds of the family would not allow of giving to each his separate establishment argued a condition of unusual opulence that it was surprising is very true but as therefore involving any argument against its truth the writer would justly deny by pleading for that very reason because it was surprising did i tell the story in a train of years naturally there must happen many wonderful things both as to events and persons were these crowded together in time or locally these indeed we should incredulously reject but when we understand the vast remoteness from each other in time or in place we freely admit the tendency lies the other way the wonder would be if there were not many coincidences that each for itself separately might be looked upon as strange and as the surgeon had set himself to collect certain cases for the very reason that they were so unaccountably fatal with a purpose therefore of including all that did not terminate fatally so we should remember that generally historians although less so if a jewish historian because he had a far nobler chain of wonders to record do not feel themselves open to the objection of romancing if they report something out of the ordinary track since exactly that sort of matter is their object and it cannot but be found in a considerable proportion when their course travels over a vast range of successive generations it would be a marvellous thing indeed if every one of five hundred men whom an author had chosen to record biographically should have for his baptismal name francis but if you found that this was the very reason for his admitting the man into his series that however strange a reason it had in fact governed him in selecting his subjects you would no longer see anything to startle your belief but let me give an interesting case partly illustrating this principle once i was present on an occasion where of two young men one very young and very clever was suggesting infidel scruples and the other so much older as to be entering on a professional career with considerable distinction was on the very point of drinkingin all that his companion urged as so much weighty objection that could not be answered the younger man in fact a boy had just used a passage from the bible in which one of the circumstances was that the jewish army consisted of men now said he knowing as we all do the enormity of such a force as a peace establishment even for mighty empires like england how perfectly like a fairytale or an arabian nights entertainment does it sound to hear of such monstrous armaments in a little country like juda equal perhaps to the twelve counties of wales this was addressed to myself and i could see by the whole expression of the young physician that his condition was exactly this his studies had been purely professional he made himself a king because having happened to hurt his leg he wore white fasci about his thigh he knew little or nothing of scriptural records he had not read at all upon this subject quite as little had he thought and unfortunately his conversation had lain amongst clever chemists and naturalists who had a prejudgment in the case that all the ability and free power of mind ran into the channel of scepticism that only people situated as most women are should acquiesce in the faith or politics of their fathers or predecessors or could believe much of the scriptures except those who were slow to examine for themselves but that multitudes pretended to believe upon some interested motive this was precisely the situation of the young physician himself he listened with manifest interest checked himself when going to speak he knew the danger of being reputed an infidel and he had no temper for martyrdom as his whole gesture and manner by its tendency showed what was passing in his mind yes x is right manifestly right and every rational view from our modern standard of good sense and reflective political economy tends to the same conclusion by the reflex light of political economy we know even at this hour much as to the condition of ancient lands like palestine athens etc quite unrevealed to the wisest men amongst them but for me who am entering on a critical walk of social life i shall need every aid from advantageous impression in favour of my religious belief so i cannot in prudence speak for i shall speak too warmly and i forbear what i replied and in that instance usefully replied for it sufficed to check one who was gravitating downwards to infidelity and likely to settle there for ever if he once reached that point was in substance this firstly that the plea with regard to the numbers as most extraordinary was so far from affecting the credibility of the statement disadvantageously that on that ground agreeably to the logic i have so scantily expounded this very feature in the case was what partly engaged the notice of the scriptural writer it was a great army for so little a nation and therefore would the writer say therefore in print i record it secondly that we must not however be misled by the narrow limits the welsh limits to suppose a welsh population for that whilst the twelve counties of wales do not now yield above halfamillion of people palestine had pretty certainly a number fluctuating between four and six millions thirdly that the great consideration of this was the stage in the expansion of society at which the hebrew nation then stood and the sublime interest sublime enough to them though far from comprehending the solemn freight of hopes confided to themselves which they consciously defended it was an age in which no pay was given to the soldier now when the soldier constitutes a separate profession with the regular pay he undertakes the regular danger and hardships there is no motive for giving the pay and the rations but precisely that he does so undertake but when no pay at all is allowed out of any common fund it will never be endured by the justice of the whole society or by an individual member that he the individual as one insulated stakeholder having no greater interest embarked than others should undertake the danger or the labour of warfare for the whole and two inferences arise upon having armies so immense first that they were a militia or more properly not even that but a landwehr that is a posse comitatus the whole martial strength of the people one in four drawn out and slightly trained to meet a danger which in those times was always a passing cloud regular and successive campaigns were unknown the enemy whoever he might be could as little support a regular army as the people of palestine consequently all these enemies would have to disperse hastily to their reaping and mowing just as we may observe the jews do under joshua it required therefore no long absence from home it was but a march but a waiting for opportunity watching for a favourable day sunshine or cloud the rising or subsiding of a river the wind in the enemys face or an ambush skilfully posted all was then ready the signal was given a great battle ensued and by sunset of one anxious day all was over in one way or another upon this position of circumstances there was neither any fair dispensation from personal service except where citizens scruples interfered nor any motive for wishing it on the contrary by a very few days service a stigma not for the individual only but for his house and kin would be evaded for ages of having treacherously forsaken the commonwealth in agony and the preference for a fighting station would be too eager instead of too backward it would become often requisite to do what it is evident the jews in reality did to make successive sifting and winnowing from the service troops at every stage throwing out upon severer principles of examination those who seemed least able to face a trying crisis whilst honourable posts of no great dependency would be assigned to those rejected as modes of soothing their offended pride this in the case of a great danger but in the case of an ordinary danger there is no doubt that many vicarious arrangements would exist by way of evading so injurious a movement as that of the whole fighting population either the ordinary watch and ward in that section which happened to be locally threatened as for instance by invasion on one side from edom or moab on another side from the canaanites or philistines would undertake the case as one which had fallen to them by allotment of providence or that section whose service happened to be due for the month without local regards would face the exigency but in any great national danger under that stage of society which the jews had reached between moses and david that stage when fighting is no separate professional duty that stage when such things are announced by there being no military pay not the army which is so large as men but the army which is so small requires to be explained secondly the other inference from the phenomenon of no military pay and therefore no separate fighting profession is this that foreign war war of aggression war for booty war for martial glory is quite unknown now all rules of political economy applied to the maintenance of armies must of course contemplate a regular trade of war pursued with those objects and not a domestic war for beating off an attack upon hearths and altars such a war only be it observed could be lawfully entertained by the jewish people mahomet when he stole all his great ideas from the mosaic and christian revelations found it inevitable to add one principle unknown to either this was a religious motive for perpetual war of aggression and such a principle he discovered in the imaginary duty of summary proselytism no instruction was required it was sufficient for the convert that with or without sincerity under terror of a sword at his throat he spoke the words aloud which disowned all other faith than in allah and mahomet his prophet it was sufficient for the soldier that he heard of a nation denying or ignoring mahomet to justify any atrocity of invasive warfare but the jews had no such commission a proselyte needed more evidences of assent than simply to bawl out a short formula of words and he who refused to become a proselyte was no object of persecution some nations have forced their languages upon others as badges of servitude but the romans were so far from treating their language in this way that they compelled barbarous nations on their frontier to pay for a license to use the latin tongue and with much more reason did the jews instead of wishing to obtrude their sublime religion upon foreigners expect that all who valued it should manifest their value by coming to jerusalem by seeking instruction from the doctors of the law and by worshipping in the outer court of the temple such was the prodigious state of separation from a mahometan principle of fanatical proselytism in which the jews were placed from the very first one small district only was to be cleared of its ancient idolatrous and probably desperately demoralized tribes even this purification it was not intended should be instant and upon the following reason partly unveiled by god and partly left to an integration viz that in the case of so sudden a desolation the wild beasts and noxious serpents would have encroached too much on the human population so much is expressed and probably the sequel foreseen was that the jews would have lapsed into a wild hunting race and have outworn that ceremonial propensity which fitted them for a civil life which formed them into a hive in which the great work of god in shiloh his probationary temple or his glorious temple and service at jerusalem operated as the mysterious instinct of a queen bee to compress and organize the whole society into a cohesion like this of life here perhaps lay the reason for not allowing of any sudden summary extirpation even for the idolatrous tribes whilst upon a second principle it was never meant that this extirpation should be complete snares and temptations were not to be too thickly sown in that case the restless jew would be too severely tried but neither were they to be utterly withdrawn in that case his faith would undergo no probation even upon this small domestic scale therefore it appears that aggressive warfare was limited both for interest and for time first it was not to be too complete second even for this incompleteness it was not to be concentrated within a short time it was both to be narrow and to be gradual by very necessity therefore of its original appointment this part of the national economy this small system of aggressive warfare could not provide a reason for a military profession but all other wars of aggression wars operating upon foreign objects had no allowance no motive no colourable plea for the attacks upon edom midian moab were mere acts of retaliation and strictly speaking not aggressive at all but parts of defensive warfare consequently there remained no permanent case of war under divine allowance that could ever justify the establishment of a military caste for the civil wars of the jews either grew out of some one intolerable crime taken up adopted and wickedly defended by a whole tribe as in the case of that horrible atrocity committed by a few benjamites and then adopted by the whole tribe in which case a bloody exterminating war under gods sanction succeeded and rapidly drew to a close or else grew out of the ruinous schism between the ten tribes and the two seated in or about jerusalem and as this schism had no countenance from god still less could the wars which followed it so that what belligerent state remains that could have been contemplated or provided for in the original mosaic theory of their constitution clearly none at all except the one sole case of a foreign invasion but as this if in any national strength struck at the very existence of the people and at their holy citadel in shiloh or in jerusalem it called out the whole military strength to the last man of the hebrew people consequently in any case when the armies could tend at all to great numerical amount they must tend to an excessive amount and so far from being a difficult problem to solve in the men the true difficulty would lie the other way to account for its being so much reduced it seems to me highly probable that the offence of david in numbering the people which ultimately was the occasion of fixing the site for the temple of jerusalem pointed to this remarkable military position of the jewish people a position forbidding all fixed military institutions and which yet david was probably contemplating in that very census simply to number the people could not have been a crime nor could it be any desideratum for david because we are too often told of the muster rolls for the whole nation and for each particular tribe to feel any room for doubt that the reports on this point were constantly corrected brought under review of the governing elders councils judges princes or king according to the historical circumstances so that the need and the criminality of such a census would vanish at the same moment but this was not the census ordered by david he wanted a more specific return probably of the particular wealth and nature of the employment pursued by each individual family so that upon this return he might ground a permanent military organization for the people and such an organization would have thoroughly revolutionized the character of the population as well as drawn them into foreign wars and alliances it is painful to think that many amiable and really candid minds in search of truth are laid hold of by some plausible argument as in this case the young physician by a topic of political economy when a local examination of the argument would altogether change its bearing this argument popularly enforced seemed to imply the impossibility of supporting a large force when there were no public funds but such as ran towards the support of the levites and the majestic service of the altar but the confusion arises from the double sense of the word army as a machine ordinarily disposable for all foreign objects indifferently and one which in juda exclusively could be applied only to such a service as must in its own nature be sudden brief and always tending to a decisive catastrophe and that this was the true form of the crime not only circumstances lead me to suspect but especially the remarkable demur of joab who in his respectful remonstrance said in effect that when the whole strength of the nation was known in sum meaning from the ordinary state returns what need was there to search more inquisitively into the special details where all were ready to fight cheerfully why seek for separate minuti as to each particular class those general returns had regard only to the ordinary causa belli a hostile invasion and then all nations alike rude or refined have gone upon the same general outline of computation that subtracting the females from the males this in a gross general way would always bisect the total return of the population and then to make a second bisection of the male half would subtract one quarter from the entire people as too young or too old or otherwise as too infirm for warlike labours leaving precisely one quarter of the nation every fourth head as available for war this process for davids case would have yielded perhaps about fighting men throughout palestine but this unwieldy pospolite was far from meeting davids secret anxieties he had remarked the fickle and insurrectionary state of the people even against himself how easy had it been found to organize a sudden rebellion and to conceal it so prosperously that he and his whole court saved themselves from capture only by a few hours start of the enemy and through the enemys want of cavalry this danger meantime having vanished it might be possible that for david personally no other great conspiracy should disturb his seat upon the throne none of davids sons approached to absalom in popularity and yet the subsequent attempt of adonijah showed that the revolutionary temper was still awake in that quarter but what david feared in a furtherlooking spirit was the tenure by which his immediate descendants would maintain their title the danger was this over and above the want of any principle for regulating the succession and this want operating in a state of things far less determined than amongst monogamous nations one son pleading his priority of birth another perhaps his mothers higher rank a third pleading his very juniority inasmuch as this brought him within the description of porphyrogeniture or royal birth which is often felt as transcendent as primogeniture even the people apart from the several pretenders to the throne would create separate interests as grounds for insurrection or for intestine feuds there seems good reason to think that already the ten tribes israel as opposed to judah looked upon the more favoured and royal tribe of judah with their supplementary section of benjamin as unduly favoured in the national economy secretly there is little doubt that they murmured even against god for ranking this powerful tribe as the prerogative tribe the jealousy had evidently risen to a great height it was suppressed by the vigilant and strong government of solomon but at the outset of his sons reign it exploded at once and the scriptural account of the case shows that it proceeded upon old grievances the boyish rashness of rehoboam might exasperate the leaders and precipitate the issue but very clearly all had been prepared for a revolt and i would remark that by the young men of rehoboam are undoubtedly meant the soldiers the bodyguards whom the jewish kings now retained as an element of royal pomp this is the invariable use of the term in the east even in josephus the term for the military by profession is generally the young men whilst the elders mean the councilors of state david saw enough of the popular spirit to be satisfied that there was no political reliance on the permanence of the dynasty and even at home there was an internal source of weakness the tribe of benjamin were mortified and incensed at the deposition of sauls family and the bloody proscription of that family adopted by david one only a grandson of saul he had spared out of love to his friend jonathan this was mephibosheth but he was incapacitated for the throne by lameness and how deep the resentment was amongst the benjamites is evident from the insulting advantage taken of his despondency in the day of distress by shimei for shimei had no motive for the act of coming to the roadside and cursing the king beyond his attachment to the house of saul humanly speaking davids prospect of propagating his own dynasty was but small on the other hand god had promised him his support and hence it was that his crime arose viz upon his infidelity in seeking to secure the throne by a mere human arrangement in the first place secondly by such an arrangement as must disorganize the existing theocratic system of the jewish people upon this crime followed his chastisement in a sudden pestilence and it is remarkable in how significant a manner god manifested the nature of the trespass and the particular course through which he had meant originally and did still mean to counteract the worst issue of davids apprehensions it happened that the angel of the pestilence halted at the threshingfloor of araunah and precisely that spot did god by dreams to david indicate as the site of the glorious temple thus it seemed as though in so many words god had declared now that all is over your crime and its punishment understand that your fears were vain i will continue the throne in your house longer than your anxieties can personally pursue its descent and with regard to the terrors from israel although this event of a great schism is inevitable and essential to my councils yet i will not allow it to operate for the extinction of your house and that very temple in that very place where my angel was commissioned to pause shall be one great means and one great pledge to you of my decree in favour of your posterity for this house as a common sanctuary to all jewish blood shall create a perpetual interest in behalf of judah amongst the other tribes even when making war upon jerusalem witness if it were but that one case where captives of judah were restored without ransom were clothed completely were fed by the very men who had just massacred their fighting relatives footnotes even in rome where the purple whatever colour that might have been is usually imagined to be the symbol of regal state and afterwards their improved arts of dyeing and improved materials became so splendid that it was made so white had always been the colour of a monarchy a white linen band was the simple badge of oriental royalty merivales history of rome ii p ed this was the case even with the homeric greeks mr gladstone makes a point of this see juventus mundi p the privates of the army are called by the names of laos the people demos the community and plethus the multitude but no notice is taken throughout the poem of the exploits of any soldier below the rank of an officer still all attend the assemblies on the whole the greek host is not so much an army as a community in arms even the common people not only in cities but in camps assembled to hear the deliberations of the chiefs ed vii the jews as a separate people the argument for the separation and distinct current of the jews flowing as they pretend of the river rhone through the lake of geneva never mixing its waters with those which surround it has been by some infidel writers defeated and evaded by one word and here as everywhere else an unwise teacher will seek to hide the answer yet how infinitely better to state it fully and then show that the evasion has no form at all but on the contrary powerfully argues the inconsistency and incapacity of those who urge it for instance i remember boulanger a french infidel whose work was duly translated by a scotchman answers it thus what is there miraculous in all this he demands listen to me and i will show you in two minutes that it rests upon mere show and pure delusion how is it why is it that the jews have remained a separate people simply from their usages in the first place but secondly still more from the fact that these usages which with other peoples exist also in some representative shape with them modify themselves shift alter adapt themselves to the climate or to the humour or accidents of life amongst those amidst whom chance has thrown them whereas amongst the jews every custom the most trivial is also part of their legislation and their legislation is also their religion boulanger by the way is far from expressing that objection so clearly as i have here done but this is his drift and purpose so far as he knew how to express it take any other people isaurians athenians romans corinthians doubtless all these and many others have transmitted their blood down to our ages and are now living amongst us by representation but why do we not perceive this why do the athenians seem to have perished utterly simply for this reason they were a plastic yielding unobstinate race an athenian lived in a port of italy married an italian woman thence threw out lines of descent to milan thence to paris and because his attic usages were all local epichorial and tied to a particular mythology which has given way or to a superstition which is defunct or to a patriotic remembrance which has vanished with the land and the sympathy that supported it hence and upon other similar arguments the athenian has long since melted into the mass with which he was intermixed he was a unit attached to a vast overpowering number from another source and into that number he has long since been absorbed he was a drop in a vast ocean and long ago he has been confounded with the waters that did not differ except numerically from his own but the jews are an obstinate bigoted people and they have maintained their separation not by any overruling or coercing miracle but in a way perfectly obvious and palpable to themselves obvious by its operation obvious in its remedy they would not resign their customs upon these ordinances positive and negative commanding and forbidding many peculiar rites consecrating and desecrating many common esculent articles these jews have laid the stress and emphasis of religion they would not resign them they did not expect others to adopt them not in any case fortiori not from a degraded people and hence not by any mysterious operation of providential control arose their separation their resolute refusal to blend with other races this is the infidels attempt to rebut to defeat utterly to confound the argumentative force of this most astonishing amongst all historical pictures that the planet presents the following is the answer it is forgotten that along with the jews there is another people concerned as illustrations of the same prophetic fatality of that same inevitable eye that same perspective of vision which belonged to those whose eyes god had opened the arabs as children of a common ancestor ought not to be forgotten in this sentence upon their brother nation they through ishmael the jews through isaac and more immediately through israel the son of isaac were two diverging branches of one original stem and to both was pronounced a corresponding doom a sentence which argued in both a principle of duration and selfpropagation that is memorable in any race the children of ishmael are the arabs of the desert their destiny as a roving robber nation and liable to all mens hands as they indifferently levied spoil on all was early pronounced and here again we see at once how it will be evaded it is the desert it is the climate it is the solemnity of that unchanging basis which will secure the unchanging life of its children but it is remarkable enough that gibbon and other infidels kicking violently against this standing miracle because if not so in itself yet according to bishop butlers just explanation concerning miraculous per derivationem as recording a miraculous power of vision have by oscillation clung to the fixture of basis and rejected it for now gibbon denies that the arabs have held this constant tenor of life they have changed it he asserts in large and notorious cases well then if they have then at once falls to the ground this alleged overruling coercion a priori of the climate and the desert climate and desert do not necessarily coerce them if in large and notorious cases they have failed to do so so feels gibbon and by an instinct of timidity back he flies to the previous evasion to the natural controlling power of climate and soil admitting the scriptural fact but seeking for it an unscriptural ground as before he had flown in overprecipitate anxiety to the denial of the scriptural fact but in that denial involving a withdrawal of the unscriptural ground the sceptics in that instance show their secret sense of a preference from the distracted eagerness with which they fly backwards and forwardwise between two reciprocally hostile evasions the answer i reserve and meantime i remark secondly that supposing this answer to have any force still it meets only one moiety of the scriptural fatality viz the dispersion of the jews the fact that let them be gathered in what numbers they might let them even be concentrated by millions therefore in the literal sense not dispersed yet in the political sense universally understood they would be dispersed because never in no instance rising to be a people sui juris a nation a distinct community known to the public law of europe as having the rights of peace and war but always a mere accident and vagrant excess amongst nations not having the bare rights of citizenship so far from being a nation not being an acknowledged member of any nation this exquisite dispersion not ethnographic only but political is that half of the scriptural malediction which the boulanger answer attempts to meet but the other half that they should be a byword an astonishment etc is entirely blinked had the work even prospered it would still have to recommence the armenians are dispersed through all eastern lands so are the arabs even the descendants of ali are found severed from their natal soil but they are not therefore dispersed they have endured no general indignities thirdly it does not meet the fact of the jewish existence in any shape whether as a distinct or an amalgamated people there is no doubt that many races of men as of brute animals have been utterly extinguished in cases such as those of the emim or rethinim a race distinguished by peculiar size so as to be monstrous in comparison with other men this extinction could more readily be realized or in the case of a nation marked as herodotus records by a slighter texture of scale the extinction might be ascertained by the physiologist but no doubt it has often occurred precisely as a family is extinguished or as certain trees for example the true golden pippin are observed to die off not by local influences only but by a decay attacking the very principle of their existence of many ancient races it is probable enough that no blood directly traced from them could at this day be searched by the eye of god families arise amongst the royal lineage of europe that suddenly like a lamp fitfully glowing up just the moment before it expires throw off as by some final effort a numerous generation of princes and princesses then suddenly all contract as rapidly into a single child which perishing the family is absolutely extinct and so must many nations have perished and so must the jews have been preeminently exposed to perish from the peculiar fierce and almost immortal persecutions which they have undergone and the horrid frenzies of excited mobs in cruel cities of which they have stood the brunt viii what is truth the jesting pilate said a false gloss it is true that pilate could not be expected fully to comprehend an idea which was yet new to man christs words were beyond his depth but still his natural light would guide him thus far that although he had never heard of any truth which rose to that distinction still if any one class of truth should in future come to eclipse all other classes of truth immeasurably as regarded its practical results as regarded some dark dependency of human interests in that case it would certainly merit the distinctive name of the truth the case in which such a distinction would become reasonable and available was one utterly unrealized to his experience not even within the light of his conjectures as to its special conditions but still as a general possibility it was conceivable to his understanding though not comprehensible yet apprehensible and in going on to the next great question to the inevitable question what is the truth pilate had no thought of jesting jesting was the last thing of which his impassioned mood in that great hour was capable roman magistrates of supreme rank were little disposed to jesting on the judgmentseat amongst a refractory and dangerous people and of pilate in particular every word every effort every act demonstrate that he was agitated with new instincts and misgivings of some shadowy revelation opening upon man that his heart was convulsed with desponding anxiety in the first place to save the man who appeared the depositary of this revelation but who if after all only a sublime lunatic was at the very least innocent of all offence it must have struck all close observers of early christianity how large a proportion of the new converts lay amongst roman officers or to speak more adequately amongst romans of high rank both men and women and for that there was high reason in the advance of civilization and in the corresponding decay of idolatrous religions there was fast arising a new growth of cravings amongst men mythological and desperately immoral religions that spoke only to the blind sense of power had been giving way through the three previous centuries to a fearful extent they had receded from the higher natures of both greece and rome as the sea has locally receded from many shores of the earth such natures were left miserably bare the sense of dependency by any tie upon the invisible world or at least upon the supernatural world had decayed and unless this painful void were filled up by some supplementary bond in the same direction a condition of practical atheism must take place such as could not but starve and impoverish in human nature those yearnings after the infinite which are the pledges of all internal grandeur but this dependency could not be replaced by one of the same vicious nature into any new dependency a new element must be introduced the sense of insufficiency would be renewed in triple strength if merely the old relations of weakness to power of art to greater art of intellect to higher intellect of less to more within the same exact limits as to kind of excellence should be rehearsed under new names or improved theogonies hitherto no relation of man to divine or demoniac powers had included the least particle or fraction or hint of any moral element nor was such an element possible in that dependency for profound reasons ix what scaliger says about the epistle to jude before any canon was settled many works had become current in christian circles whose origin was dubious the traditions about them varied locally some it is alleged that would really have been entitled to a canonical place had been lost by accident to some which still survived this place had been refused upon grounds that might not have satisfied us of this day if we had the books and the grounds of rejection before us and finally others it is urged have obtained this sacred distinction with no right to it in particular the second epistle of st peter the second of st jude the epistle of st james and the three of st john are denounced as supposititious in the scaligerana but the writer before us is wrong in laying any stress on the opinions there expressed they bear the marks of conversational haste and of scaligeran audacity what is the objection made for instance to in quibus sunt mira qu non videntur esse apostolica that is itself more strange as a criticism than anything in the epistles can be for its doctrine the only thing tending to a reason for the summary treatment is that the eastern church does not acknowledge them for canonical but opinions quoted from ana are seldom of any authority indeed i have myself too frequently seen the unfaithfulness of such reports the reporter as he cannot decently be taking notes at the time of speaking endeavours afterwards to recall the most interesting passages by memory he forgets the context what introduced what followed to explain or modify the opinions he supplies a conjectural context of his own and the result is a romance but if the reporter were even accurate so much allowance must be made for the license of conversation its ardour its hurry and its frequent playfulness that when all these deductions are made really not a fraction remains that one can honestly carry to account besides the elder scaliger was drunk pretty often and joe seems rather fresh at times upon consideration it may be as well to repeat what it is that scaliger is reported to have said the epistle of jude is not his as neither is that of james nor the second of peter in all which are strange things that seem seem mark that far enough from being apostolical the three epistles of john are not from john the apostle the second of peter and jude belong to a later age the eastern church does not own them neither are they of evangelical authority they are unlearned and offer no marks of gospel majesty as regards their internal value believe them i may say that i do but it is because they are in no ways hostile to us now observe the grounds of objection are purely sthetical except in the single argument from the authority of the eastern church what does he mean by unlearned or wanting majesty or containing strange things were ever such vague puerilities collected into one short paragraph this is pure impertinence and phil deserves to be privately reprimanded for quoting such windy chaff without noting and protesting it as colloquial but what i wish the reader to mark the greek tho hepimhythion is that suppose the two scaligers amongst the christian fathers engaged in fixing the canon greater learning you cannot have neither was there to a dead certainty one tenth part as much amongst the canonsettlers yet all this marvellous learning fumes away in boyish impertinence it confounds itself and every christian says oh take away this superfluous weight of erudition that being so rare a thing cannot be wanted in the broad highways of religion what we do want is humility docility reverence for god and love for man these are sown broadcast amongst human hearts now these apply themselves to the sense of scripture not to its grammatical niceties but if so even that case shows indirectly how little could depend upon the mere verbal attire of the bible when the chief masters of verbal science were so ready to go astray riding on the billows so imperfectly moored in the ideas of scripture lies its eternal anchorage not in its perishable words which are shifting for ever like quicksands as the bible passes by translation successively into every spoken language of the earth what then what then retorts the angry reader after all this why then perhaps there may be a screw loose in the bible true there may and what is more some very great scholars take upon them to assert that there is yet still what then the two possible errors open to the fathers of our canon to the men upon whom rested the weighty task of saying to all mankind what should be bible and what should be not bible of making and limiting that mighty world are that they may have done that which they ought not to have done and secondly left undone that which they ought to have done they may have admitted writers whom they ought to have excluded and they may have excluded writers whom they ought to have admitted this is the extent of their possible offences and they are supposed by some critics to have committed both but suppose that they have still i say what then what is the nature of the wrong done to us by the worst mistake ascribed to them let us consider it is supposed by some scholars that we have in the new testament as it now stands a work written by apollos viz the epistle to the romans yet if so the error amounts only to a misnomer on the other hand there are epistles on which has been charged the same error in relation to the name of the author and the more important error of thoughts unbecoming to a christian in authority for instance the epistle of st james this charge was chiefly urged by a very intemperate man and in a very intemperate style i notice it as being a case which phil has noticed but phil merits a gentle rap on his knuckles for the inconsideration with which he has cited a charge made and reported with so much levity he quotes it from the scaligerana now what right upon such a subject has any man to quote such an authority the reasons against listening with much attention to the scaligerana are these first the scaligers both father and son were the two most impudent men that ever walked the planet i should be loath to say so illnatured a thing as that their impudence was equal to their learning because that forces every man to say ah then what impudent fellows they must have been it is kinder and juster to say that their learning was at least equal to their impudence for that will force every man to exclaim ah if so what prodigies of learning they must have been yes they were absolute monsters of learning learned monsters but as much learning often makes men mad still more frequently it makes them furious for assault and battery to use the american phrase they grow wolfy about the shoulders from a periodical itchiness for fighting other men being shy of attacking the scaligers it was no fault of theirs you know but a necessity to attack other men unless you expected them to have no fighting at all it was always a reason with them for trying a fall with a writer if they doubted much whether they had any excuse for hanging a quarrel on secondly all ana whatever are bad authorities supposing the thing really said we are to remember the huge privilege of conversation how immeasurable is that you yourself reader i presume when talking will say more in an hour than you will stand to in a month im sure i do when the reins are put into my hands i stick at nothing headlong i drive like a lunatic until the very room in which we are talking with all that it inherits seems to spin round with absolute vertigo at the extravagances i utter thirdly but again was the thing really said for as another censure upon the whole library of ana i can assert that if the license of conversation is enormous to that people who inhale that gas of colloquial fermentation seldom mean much above one part in sixty of what they say on the other hand the license of reporters is far greater to forget the circumstances under which a thing was said is to alter the thing to have lost the context the particular remark in which your own originated the mitigations of a harsh sentiment from playfulness of manner in short to drop the setting of the thoughts is oftentimes to falsify the tendency and value of those thoughts note by the editor the phil here referred to is the philoleutheros anglicanus of the essay on protestantism as shortened by de quincey and with whom de quincey in that essay deals very effectively and wittily on occasion x murder as a fine art some notes for a new paper a new paper on murder as a fine art might open thus that on the model of those gentlemen radicals who had voted a monument to palmer etc it was proposed to erect statues to such murderers as should by their nextofkin or other person interested in their glory make out a claim either of superior atrocity or in equal atrocity of superior neatness continuity of execution perfect preparation or felicitous originality smoothness or curiosa felicitas elaborate felicity the men who murdered the cat as we read in the newgate calendar were good but williams better who murdered the baby and perhaps but the hellish felicity of the last act makes us demur fielding was superior for you never hear of a fire swallowing up a fire or a rain stopping a deluge for this would be a reign of kilkenny cats but what fire deluge or kilkenny cats could not do fielding proposed viz to murder the murderers to become himself the nemesis fielding was the murderer of murderers in a double sense rhetorical and literal but that was after all a small matter compared with the fine art of the man calling himself outis on which for a moment we must dwell outis so at all events he was called but doubtless he indulged in many aliases at nottingham joined vehemently and sincerely as it seemed in pursuit of a wretch taxed with having murdered twelve years previously a wife and two children at halifax which wretch when all the depositions were before the magistrate turned out to be the aforesaid mr outis that suggests a wide field of speculation and reference note the power of murderers as fineart professors to make a new start to turn the corner to retreat upon the road they have come as though it were new to them and to make diversions that disarm suspicion this they owe to fortunate obscurity which attests anew the wonderful compensations of life for celebrity and power combine to produce drawbacks a foreigner who lands in calcutta at an hour which nobody can name and endeavours to effect a sneaking entrance at the posterngate of the governorgenerals palace may be a decent man but this we know that he has cut the towingrope which bound his own boat to the great ark of his country it may be that in leaving paris or naples he was simply cutting the connection with creditors who showed signs of attachment not good for his health but it may also be that he ran away by the blaze of a burning inn which he had fired in order to hide three throats which he had cut and nine purses which he had stolen there is no guarantee for such a mans character have we then no such vauriens at home no not in the classes standing favourably for promotion the privilege of safe criminality not liable to exposure is limited to classes crowded together like leaves in vallombrosa for them to run away into some mighty city manchester or glasgow is to commence life anew they turn over a new leaf with a

twelve separate parishes that scamp is at this moment circulating and gyrating in society like a respectable tetotum though we know not his exact name who if he were pleased to reveal himself in seventeen parts of this kingdom where to use the police language he has been wanted for some years would be hanged seventeen times running besides putting seventeen government rewards into the pockets of seventeen policemen oh reader you little know the unutterable romances perpetrated for ever in our most populous empire under cloud of night and distance and utter poverty mark that of utter poverty wealth is power but it is a jest in comparison of poverty splendour is power but it is a joke to obscurity to be poor to be obscure to be a bakers apprentice or a tailors journeyman throws a power about a man clothes him with attributes of ubiquity really with those privileges of concealment which in the ring of gyges were but fabulous is it a king is it a sultan that such a man rivals oh friend he rivals a spiritual power two men are on record perhaps many more might have been on that record who wrote so many books and perpetrated so many pamphlets that at fifty they had forgotten much of their own literary villainies and at sixty they commenced with murderous ferocity a series of answers to arguments which it was proved upon them afterwards that they themselves had emitted at thirty thus coming round with volleys of small shot on their own heads as the whispering gallery at st pauls begins to retaliate any secrets you have committed to its keeping in echoing thunders after a time or as sir john mandeville under arctic skies heard in may all those curses thawing and exploding like minuteguns which had been frozen up in november even like those selfreplying authors even like those selfreverberators in st pauls even like those arctic practitioners in cursing who drew bills and post obits in malediction which were to be honoured after the death of winter many men are living at this moment in merry england who have figured in so many characters illustrated so many villages run away from so many towns and performed the central part in so many careers that were the character the village the town the career brought back with all its circumstances to their memories positively they would fail to recognise their own presence or incarnation in their own acts and bodies we have all read the story told by addison of a sultan who was persuaded by a dervish to dip his head into a basin of enchanted water and thereupon found himself upon some other globe a son in a poor mans family married after certain years the woman of his heart had a family of seven children whom he painfully brought up went afterwards through many persecutions walked pensively by the seashore meditating some escape from his miseries bathed in the sea as a relief from the noonday heat and on lifting up his head from the waves found himself lifting up his head from the basin into which that cursed dervish had persuaded him to dip and when he would have cudgelled the holy man for that long life of misery which had through his means been inflicted upon himself behold the holy man proved by affidavit that in this world at any rate where only he could be punishable the life had lasted but thirtythree seconds even so do the dark careers of many amongst our obscure and migratory villains from years shrink up to momentary specks or by their very multitude altogether evanesce burke and hare it is well known had lost all count of their several murders they no more remembered or could attempt to remember their separate victims than a respectable old banker of seventythree can remember all the bills with their indorsements made payable for halfacentury at his bank or than footes turnpikekeeper who had kept all the tollbar tickets to kensington for fortyeight years pretended to recollect the features of all the men who had delivered them at his gate for a time perhaps burke who was a man of fine sensibility had a representative vision of spasms and struggles and convulsions terminating in a tenpound note indorsed by dr hare on the other hand was a man of principle a man that you could depend upon order a corpse for friday and on friday you had it but he had no feeling whatever yet see the unity of result for him and burke for both alike all troublesome recollections gathered into one blue haze of heavenly abstractions orders executed with fidelity cheques on the bankers to be crossed and passed and cashed are no more remembered that is the acme of perfection in our art one great class of criminals i am aware of in past times as having specially tormented myself the class who have left secrets riddles behind them what business has any man to bequeath a conundrum to all posterity unless he leaves in some separate channel the solution this must have been done in malice and for the purpose of annoying us lest we should have too much proper enjoyment of life when he should have gone for nobody knows whether the scoundrel could have solved it himself too like in that respect to some charades which in my boyish days but then i had the excuse of youth which they had not i not unfrequently propounded to young ladies take this as a specimen my first raises a little hope my second very little indeed and my whole is a vast roar of despair no young lady could ever solve it neither could i we all had to give it up a charade that only needs an answer which perhaps some distant generation may supply is but a half and half tentative approach to this very much of this nature was the genius or daimon dont say demon of socrates how many thousands of learned writers and printers have gone to sleep over too profound attempts to solve that which socrates ought to have been able to solve at sight i am myself of opinion that it was a drambottle which someone raised a ghost to explain then the entelecheia of aristotle did you ever read about that excellent reader most people fancy it to have meant some unutterable crotchet in metaphysics some horrible idea lest the police should be after it without a name that is until the stagyrite repaired the injustice of his conduct by giving it a pretty long one my opinion now as you are anxious to know it is that it was a lady a sweetheart of aristotles for what was to hinder aristotle having a sweetheart i dare say thomas aquinas dry and arid as he was raised his unprincipled eyes to some neapolitan beauty began a sonnet to some ladys eyebrow though he might forget to finish it and my belief is that this lady ambitious as semele wished to be introduced as an eternal jewel into the great vault of her lovers immortal philosophy which was to travel much farther and agitate far longer than his royal pupils conquests upon that aristotle keeping her hand said my love ill think of it and then it occurred to him that in the very heavens many lovely ladies andromeda cassiopeia ariadne etc had been placed as constellations in that map which many chronologists suppose to have been prepared for the use of the ship argo a whole generation before the trojan war berenice though he could not be aware of that had interest even to procure a place in that map for her ringlets and of course for herself she might have considering which aristotle said hang me if i dont put her among the ten categories on after thoughts he put her higher for an entelecheia is as much above a category as our padishah victoria is above a turkish sultan but now stag said the lady privileged as a sweetheart she called him stag though everybody else was obliged to call him stagyrite how will they know its meant for me stag upon which i am sorry to say the philosopher fell to cursing and swearing bestowing blessings on his own optics and on posteritys meaning yours and mine saying let them find it out well now you see i have found it out but that is more than i hope for my cryptocriminals and therefore i take this my only way of giving them celebration and malediction in one breath footnotes notwithstanding what he had written in the essay on the essenes no doubt de quincey if he had completed this paper could not have escaped characteristic and perhaps grimly humorous references of his own to the sicarii of whom josephus has a good deal to tell in his jewish war for it seems to us his thoughts were bearing directly that way josephus says of the sicarii in these days there arose another sort of robbers in jerusalem who were named sicarii who slew men in the daytime and in the middle of the city more especially at the festivals there they mixed with the multitude and having concealed little daggers under their garments with these they stabbed those that were their enemies and when any fell down dead the murderers joined the bystanders in expressing their indignation so that from their plausibilities they could by no means be discovered the first man that was slain by them was jonathan the highpriest after which many were slain every day ed posterngate see the legend of sir eustace the crusader and the good sir hubert who sounded the horn which he alone could sound as told by wordsworth xi anecdotes juvenal all anecdotes as i have often remarked in print are lies it is painful to use harsh words and knowing by my own feelings how much the reader is shocked by this rude word lies i should really be much gratified if it were possible to supplant it by some gentler or more courteous word such as falsehoods or even fibs which dilutes the atrocity of untruth into something of an amiable weakness wrong but still venial and natural and so far therefore reasonable anything for peace but really in this instance i cannot indulge the reader the instincts of morality will not allow of it and still less the passion which made juvenal a poet viz the passion of enormous and bloody indignation from the beginning of this century with wrath continually growing i have laid it down as a rule and if the last year of it viz a d should overhear my voice amongst the babblings that will then be troubling the atmosphere in that case it will hear me still reaffirming with an indignation still gathering strength and therefore approaching ever nearer and nearer to a juvenalian power of versification so that perhaps i shall then speak in rhymed couplets that all anecdotes pretending to be smart but to a dead certainty if they pretend to be epigrammatic are and must be lies there is in fact no security for the truth of an anecdote no guarantee whatever except its intense stupidity if a man is searched at a policeoffice on the ground that he was caught trying the windowshutters of silversmiths then if it should happen that in his pockets is found absolutely nothing at all except one solitary pavingstone in that case charity which believeth all things in fact is credulous to an anile degree will be disposed to lock up the pavingstone and restore it to the man on his liberation as if it were really his own though philosophy mutters indignantly being all but certain that the fellow stole it and really i have been too candid a great deal in admitting that a man may appropriate an anecdote and establish his claim to it by pleading its awful stupidity that might be the case and i believe it was when anecdotes were many and writers were few but things are changed now fifty years ago if a man were seen running away with the pace of a lunatic and you should sing out stop that fellow he is running off with the shinbone of my greatgrandmother all the people in the street would have cried out in reply oh nonsense what should he want with your greatgrandmothers shinbone and that would have seemed reasonable but now to see how things are altered any man of sense would reply what should he want with my greatgrandmothers shinbone why hell grind it and then hell mix it with guano this is what he and the like of him have actually done by shiploads of people far more entitled to consideration than any one of my four greatgrandmothers for i had four with eight shinbones amongst them it is well known that the field of waterloo was made to render up all its bones british or french to certain bonemills in agricultural districts borodino and leipzig the two bloodiest of modern battlefields are supposed between them what by the harvest of battle what by the harvest of neighbouring hospitals to be seized or possessed of four hundred thousand shinbones and other interesting specimens to match negotiations have been proceeding at various times between the leading bonemills in england and the jews in dresden or in moscow hitherto these negotiations have broken down because the jews stood out for per shent calculated upon the costs of exhumation but of late they show a disposition to do business at per shent the contract will therefore move forwards again it will go ahead and the dust of the faithful armies together with the dust of their enemies will very soon be found not in the stopper of a bunghole as prince hamlet conceived too prematurely but in an unprecedented crop of swedish turnips bones change their value it seems thus clearly and anecdotes change their value and in that proportion honesty as regards one or the other changes the value of its chances but what has all this to do with old nick stop let me consider that title was placed at the head of this article and i admit that it was placed there by myself else whilst i was wandering from my text and vainly endeavouring to recollect what it was that i had meant by this text a random thought came over me immoral but natural that i would charge the heading of old nick upon the compositor asserting that he had placed it there in obstinate defiance of all the orders to the contrary and supplications to the contrary that i had addressed to him for a month by which means i should throw upon him the responsibility of accounting for so portentous an ensign editors note it is evident that de quincey meditated a much longer essay on anecdotes as false in which niccolo machiavelli would have come in for notice hence the playful references in the close footnotes the passion which made juvenal a poet the scholar needs no explanation but the reader whose scholarship is yet amongst his futurities which i conceive to be the civilest way of describing an ignoramus must understand that juvenal the roman satirist who was in fact a predestined poet in virtue of his ebullient heart that boiled over once or twice a day in anger that could not be expressed upon witnessing the enormities of domestic life in rome was willing to forego all pretensions to natural power and inspiration for the sake of obtaining such influence as would enable him to reprove roman vices with effect xii anna louisa specimen translation from voss in hexameters with letter to professor w christopher north dr north

prescribed for the whole french army gratis but now to business for your information doctor it cannot be necessary but on account of very many readers it will be so to say that vosss luise has long taken its place in the literature of germany as a classical work in fact as a gem or cabinet chef doeuvre nay almost as their unique specimen in any national sense of the lighter and less pretending muse less pretending i mean as to the pomp or gravity of the subject but on that very account more pretending as respects the minuter graces of its execution in the comparative estimate of germans the luise holds a station corresponding to that of our rape of the lock or of gressets vertvert corresponding that is in its degree of relative value as to its kind of value some notion may be formed of it even in that respect also from the rape of the lock but with this difference that the scenes and situations and descriptions are there derived from the daily life and habits of a fashionable belle and the fine gentlemen who surround her whereas in the luise they are derived exclusively from the homelier and more patriarchal economy of a rural clergymans household and in this respect the luise comes nearest by much in comparison of any other work that i know of to our own vicar of wakefield like that delightful portrait of rural life in a particular aspect or idyll as it might be called the luise aims at throwing open for our amusement the interior of a village parsonage scotice manse like that in its earlier half for the latter half of the vicar is a sad collapse from the truth and nature of the original conception into the marvellous of a commonplace novel the luise exhibits the several members of a rustic clergymans family according to their differences of sex age and standing in their natural undisguised features all unconsciously marked by characteristic foibles all engaged in the exercise of their daily habits neither finer nor coarser than circumstances naturally allow and all indulging in such natural hopes or fictions of romance as grow out of their situation in life the luise in short and the vicar of wakefield are both alike a succession of circumstantial delineations selected from mere rustic life but rustic life in its most pure and intellectual form for as to the noble countess in the luise or the squire and his uncle sir william in the vicar of wakefield they do not interfere sufficiently to disturb the essential level of the movement as regards the incidents or to colour the manners and the scenery agreeing however in this general purpose the two works differ in two considerable features one that the vicar of wakefield describes the rural clergyman of england luise the rural clergyman of north germany the other that the english idyll is written in prose the german in verse both of which differences and the separate peculiarities growing out of them will it may perhaps be thought require a few words of critical discussion there has always existed a question as to the true principles of translation when applied not to the mere literature of knowledge because there it is impossible that two opinions can arise by how much closer the version by so much the better but to the literature of power and to such works above all to poems as might fairly be considered works of art in the highest sense to what extent the principle of compensation might reasonably be carried the license that is of departing from the strict literal forms of the original writer whether as to expressions images or even as to the secondary thoughts for the sake of reproducing them in some shape less repellent to a modern ear and therefore virtually sustaining the harmony of the composition by preventing the attention from settling in a disproportionate degree upon what might have a startling effect to a taste trained under modern discipline this question has always been pending as a question open to revision before the modern courts of criticism as surely to you dr north one of the chief swells on that bench i need not say but for the sake of accurate thinking it is worth while observing that formerly this question was moved almost exclusively with a view to the latin and greek classics and that circumstance gave a great and a very just bias to the whole dispute for the difference with regard to any capital author of ancient days as compared with modern authors is this that here we have a twofold interest an interest with work and a separate interest in the writer take the prometheus desmotes of schylus and suppose that a translator should offer us an english prometheus which he acknowledged to be very free but at the same time contended that his variations from the greek were so many downright improvements so that if he had not given us the genuine prometheus he had given us something better in such a case we should all reply but we do not want something better our object is not the best possible drama that could be produced on the fable of prometheus what we want is the very prometheus that was written by schylus the very drama that was represented at athens the athenian audience itself and what pleased its taste is already one subject of interest schylus on his own account is another these are collateral and alien subjects of interest quite independent of our interest in the drama and for the sake of these we wish to see the real original prometheus not according to any mans notion of improvement but such as came from a sublime grecian poet such as satisfied a grecian audience more than two thousand years ago we wish in fact for the real schylus unhouseld unaneald with all his imperfections on his head such was the way and the just way of arguing the point when the application was limited to a great authentic classic of the antique nor was the case at all different where ariosto or any other illustrious italian classic was concerned but a new sort of casuistry in this question has arisen in our own times and by accident chiefly in connection with german literature but it may well be dr north that you will be more diverted by a careful scrutiny of my metres after voss in illustration than by any further dissertation on my part on a subject that you know so well believe me always yours admiringly x y z the parsons dinner in the month of leafy june beneath

xiii some thoughts on biography we have heard from a man who witnessed the failure of miss baillies de montford notwithstanding the scenic advantages of a vast london theatre fine dresses fine music at intervals and above all the superb acting of john kemble supported on that occasion by his incomparable sister that this unexpected disappointment began with the gallery who could not comprehend or enter into a hatred so fiendish growing out of causes so slight as any by possibility supposable in the trivial rezenvelt to feel teased by such a man to dislike him occasionally to present him with your compliments in the shape of a duodecimo kick well and good nothing but right and the plot manifestly tended to a comic issue but murder a macbeth murder not the injury so much as the man himself was incommensurate was too slight by a thousand degrees for so appalling a catastrophe it reacts upon de montford making him ignoble that could be moved so profoundly by an agency so contemptible something of the same disproportion there is though in a different way between any quarrel that may have divided us from a man in his lifetime and the savage revenge of pursuing the quarrel after his death through a malicious biography yet if you hated him through no quarrel but simply as we all hate many men that died a thousand years ago for something vicious or which you think vicious in his modes of thinking why must you of all men be the one to undertake an edition of his works with a life of the author leave that to some neutral writer who neither loves nor hates and whilst crowds of men need better biographical records whom it is easy to love and not difficult to honour do not you degrade your own heart or disgust your readers by selecting for your exemplification not a model to be imitated but a wild beast to be baited or a criminal to be tortured we privately hate mr thomas hobbes of malmsbury we know much evil of him and we could expose many of his tricks effectually we also hate dean swift and upon what we think substantial arguments some of our own contemporaries we hate particularly cobbett for instance and other bad fellows in fustian and corduroys but for that very reason we will not write their lives or if we should do so only because they might happen to stand as individuals in a series and after warning the reader of our own bias for it is too odious a spectacle to imprison a fellowcreature in a book like a stag in a cart and turn him out to be hunted through all his doubles for a days amusement it too much resembles that case of undoubted occurrence both in france and germany where respectable individuals simply as amateurs and not at all with any view to the salary or fees of operating have come forward as candidates for the post of public executioner what is every mans duty is no mans duty by preference and unless where a writer is thrust upon such a duty by an official necessity as if he contracts for a biographia britannica in that case he is bound by his contract to go through with the whole series rogues and all it is too painful to see a human being courting and wooing the task of doing execution upon his brother in his grave nay even in the case where this executioners task arises spontaneously out of some duty previously undertaken without a thought of its severer functions we are still shocked by any exterminating vengeance too rancorously pursued every reader must have been disgusted by the unrelenting persecution with which gifford a deformed man with the spiteful nature sometimes too developed in the deformed had undertaken for our fathers in the row an edition of massinger probably he had not thought at the time of the criminals who would come before him for judgment but afterwards it did not embitter the job that these perquisites of office accrued lucro ponatur that such offenders as coxeter mr monck mason and others were to be justified by course of law could he not have stated their errors and displaced their rubbish without further personalities however he does not but makes the air resound with his knout until the reader wishes coxeter in his throat and monck mason like the cursed old fellow in sinbad mounted with patent spurs upon his back we shall be interrupted however and that we certainly foresee by the objection that we are fighting with shadows that neither the loge in one extreme nor the libel in the other extreme finds a place in our literature does it not yes reader each of these biographical forms exists in favour among us and of one it is very doubtful indeed whether it ought not to exist the loge is found abundantly diffused through our monumental epitaphs in the first place and there every man will countersign wordsworths judgment see the excursion and also wordsworths prose essay on epitaphs that it is a blessing for human nature to find one place in this world sacred to charitable thoughts one place at least offering a sanctuary from evil speaking so far there is no doubt but the main literary form in which the english loge presents itself is the funeral sermon and in this also not less than in the churchyard epitaph kind feeling ought to preside and for the same reasons the sanctity of the place where it is delivered or originally published and the solemnity of the occasion which has prompted it since if you cannot find matter in the departed persons character fertile in praise even whilst standing by the newmade grave what folly has tempted you into writing an epitaph or a funeral sermon the good ought certainly to predominate in both and in the epitaph nothing but the good because were it only for a reason suggested by wordsworth viz the elaborate and everlasting character of a record chiselled out painfully in each separate letter it would be scandalous to confer so durable an existence in stone or marble upon trivial human infirmities such as do not enter into the last solemn reckoning with the world beyond the grave whilst on the other hand all graver offences are hushed into dread repose and where they happen to be too atrocious or too memorable are at once a sufficient argument for never having undertaken any such memorial these considerations privilege the epitaph as sacred to charity and tabooed against the revelations of candour the epitaph cannot open its scanty records to any breathing or insinuation of infirmity but the funeral sermon though sharing in the same general temper of indulgence towards the errors of the deceased person might advantageously be laid open to a far more liberal discussion of those personal or intellectual weaknesses which may have thwarted the influence of character otherwise eminently christian the oraison funbre of the french proposes to itself by its original model which must be sought in the epideictic or panegyrical oratory of the greeks a purpose purely and exclusively eulogistic the problem supposed is to abstract from everything not meritorious to expand and develop the total splendour of the individual out of that one centre that main beneficial relation to his own age from which this splendour radiated the incidents of the life the successions of the biographical detail are but slightly traced no farther in fact than is requisite to the intelligibility of the praises whereas in the english funeral sermon there is no principle of absolute exclusion operating against the minutest circumstantiations of fact which can tend to any useful purpose of illustrating the character and what is too much for the scale of a sermon literally preached before a congregation or modelled to counterfeit such a mode of address may easily find its place in the explanatory notes this is no romance or ideal sketch of what might be it is and it has been there are persons of memorable interest in past times of whom all that we know is embodied in a funeral sermon for instance jeremy taylor in that way or by his epistles dedicatory has brought out the characteristic features in some of his own patrons whom else we should have known only as nominis umbras but a more impressive illustration is found in the case of john henderson that man of whom expectations so great were formed and of whom dr johnson and burke after meeting and conversing with him pronounced in the scriptural words of the ethiopian queen applied to the jewish king solomon that the half had not been told them for this mans memory almost the sole original record exists in aguttars funeral sermon for though other records exist and one from the pen of a personal friend mr joseph cottle of bristol yet the main substance of the biography is derived from the fundus of this one sermon and it is of some importance to cases of fugitive or unobtrusive merit that this more quiet and sequestered current of biography should be kept open for the local motives to an honorary biographical notice in the shape of a funeral sermon will often exist when neither the materials are sufficient nor a writer happens to be disposable for a labour so serious as a regular biography here then on the one side are our english loges and we may add that amongst the methodists the baptists and other religious sectaries but especially among the missionaries of all nations and churches this class of loges is continually increasing not unfrequently men of fervent natures and of sublime aspirations are thus rescued from oblivion whilst the great power of such bodies as the methodists their growing wealth and consequent responsibility to public opinion are pledges that they will soon command all the advantages of colleges and academic refinement so that if in the manner of these funeral loges there has sometimes been missed that elegance which should have corresponded to the weight of the matter henceforwards we may look to see this disadvantage giving way before institutions more thoroughly matured but if these are our loges on the other hand where are our libels this is likely to be a topic of offence for many readers will start at hearing the upright samuel johnson and the goodhumoured garrulous plutarch denounced as traffickers in libel but a truth is a truth and the temper is so essentially different in which men lend themselves to the propagation of defamatory anecdotes the impulses are so various to an offence which is not always consciously perceived by those who are parties to it that we cannot be too cautious of suffering our hatred of libel to involve every casual libeller or of suffering our general respect for the person of the libeller to exonerate him from the charge of libelling many libels are written in this little world of ours unconsciously and under many motives perhaps we said that before but no matter sometimes a gloomy fellow with a murderous cast of countenance sits down doggedly to the task of blackening one whom he hates worse than toad or asp for instance procopius performs that labour of hate for the emperor justinian pouring oil into his wounds but then as coleridge expresses it in a neat sarcasm oil of vitriol nature must have meant the man for a spanish inquisitor sent into the world before st dominic had provided a trade for him or any vent for his malice so rancorous in his malignity so horrid and unrelenting the torture to which he subjects his sovereign and the beautiful theodora in this case from the withering scowl which accompanies the libels we may be assured that they are such in the most aggravated form not malicious only but false it is commonly said indeed in our courts that truth it is which aggravates the libel and so it is as regards the feelings or the interests of the man libelled for is it not insufferable that if a poor man under common human infirmity shall have committed some crime and have paid its penalty but afterwards reforming or outgrowing his own follies seeks to gain an honest livelihood for his children in a place which the knowledge of his past transgression has not reached then all at once he is to be ruined by some creature purely malignant who discovers and publishes the secret tale in such a case most undoubtedly it is the truth of the libel which constitutes its sting since if it were not true or could be made questionable it would do the poor man no mischief but on the other hand it is the falsehood of the libel which forms its aggravation as regards the publisher and certain we are had we no other voucher than the instinct of our hatred to procopius that his disloyal tales about his great lord and lady are odiously overcharged if not uniformly false gibbon however chooses to gratify his taste for the luxury of scandal by believing at once in the perfect malice of the slanderer and the perfect truth of his slanders here then in this procopius is an instance of the gloomy libeller whose very gloom makes affidavit of his foul spirit from the first there is also another form less odious of the hostile libeller it occurs frequently in cases where the writer is not chargeable with secret malice but is in a monstrous passion a showerbath might be of service in that case whereas in the procopius case nothing but a copious or a procopius application of the knout can answer we for instance have or had for perhaps it has been stolen a biography of that same parker afterwards bishop of oxford with whom andrew marvell and others who called milton friend had such roughandtumble feuds about and at whose expense it was that marvell made the whole nation merry in his rehearsal transprosed this parker had a knack at making himself odious he had a curiosa felicitas in attracting hatreds and wherever he lodged for a fortnight he trailed after him a vast parabolic or hyperbolic tail of enmity and curses all smoke and fire and tarnish which bore the same ratio to his small body of merit that a comets tail measuring billions of miles does to the little cometary mass the rage against him was embittered by politics and indeed sometimes by knavish tricks the first not being always confounded nor the last frustrated so that parker on the whole was a man whom it might be held a duty to hate and therefore of course to knout as often as you could persuade him to expose a fair extent of surface for the action of the lash many men purchased a knout for his sake and took their chance for getting a shy at him as parker might happen to favour their intentions but one furious gentleman who is resolved to take his full change out of parker and therefore to lose no time commences operations in the very first words of his biography parker says he the author of was the spawn of samuel parker his rage will not wait for an opportunity he throws off a torrent of fiery sparks in advance and gives full notice to parker that he will run his train right into him if he can come up with his rear this man is not malicious but truculent like the elder scaliger of whom it was observed that having been an officer of cavalry up to his fortieth year when he took to learning greek he always fancied himself on horseback charging and cutting throats in the way of professional duty as often as he found himself summoned to pursue and cut up some literary delinquent fire and fury bubble and squeak is the prevailing character of his critical composition come and let me give thee to the fowls of the air is the cry with which the martial critic salutes the affrighted author yet meantime it is impossible that he can entertain any personal malice for he does not know the features of the individual enemy whom he is pursuing but thus far he agrees with the procopian order of biographers that both are governed in whatever evil they may utter by a spirit of animosity one by a belligerent spirit which would humble its enemy as an enemy in a fair pitched battle the other by a subtle spirit of malice which would exterminate its enemy not in that character merely but as an individual by poison or by strangling libels however may be accredited and published where there is no particle of enmity or of sudden irritation such were the libels of plutarch and dr johnson they are libels prompted by no hostile feelings at all but adopted by mere blind spirit of credulity in this world of ours so far as we are acquainted with its doings there are precisely four series four aggregate bodies of lives and no more which you can call celebrated which have had and are likely to have an extensive influence each after its own kind which be they to arrange them in point of time first stand plutarchs lives of eminent greeks and romans next the long succession of the french memoirs beginning with philippe de commines in the time of louis xi or our edward iv and ending let us say with the slight record of himself but not without interest of louis xviii thirdly the acta sanctorum of the bollandists fourthly dr johnsons lives of the poets the third is a biographical record of the romish saints following the order of the martyrology as it is digested through the roman calendar of the year and as our own biographia britannica has only moved forwards in seventy years to the letter h or thereabouts which may be owing to the dissenting blight of dr kippis pari passu the acta sanctorum will be found not much farther advanced than the month of may a pleasant month certainly but as the spectator often insinuates perilous to saintship laying this work out of consideration as being chiefly employed in eulogy such as could not be extravagant when applied to the glorious army of martyrs although here also we doubt not are many libels against men concerning whom it matters little whether they were libelled or not all the rest of the great biographical works are absolutely saturated with libels plutarch may be thought to balance his extravagant slanders by his impossible eulogies he sees nothing wonderful in actions that were far beyond the level of any motives existing under pagan moralities and on the other hand he traduces great men like csar whose natures were beyond his scale of measurement by tracing their policy to petty purposes entirely plutarchian but he was a greekling in a degenerate age of grecians as to the french memoirs which are often so exceedingly amusing they purchase their liveliness by one eternal sacrifice of plain truth their repartees felicitous propos and pointed anecdotes are but one rolling fire of falsehoods and generally it may be laid down as a rule that all collectors of happy retorts and striking anecdotes are careless of truth louis xiv does seem to have had a natural gift of making brilliant compliments and happy impromptus and yet the very best of his reputed mots were spurious some may be traced to cicero hierocles diogenes and some to his modern predecessors that witty remark ascribed to him about the disposition of fortune as being a lady to withdraw her favours from old men like himself and the marchal boufflers was really uttered nearly two centuries before by the emperor charles v who probably stole it from some spanish collection of jests and so of fifty in every hundred beside and the french are not only apt beyond other nations to abuse the license of stealing from our predecessor quod licuit semperque licebit but also in a degree peculiar to themselves they have a false denaturalized taste in the humorous and as to the limits of the extravagant we have formerly illustrated this point and especially we noticed it as a case impossible to any nation but the french to have tolerated the pretended absences of la fontaine as for instance his affecting to converse with his own son as an entire stranger and asking the lady who had presented him what might be the name of that amiable young man the incredulus odi faces one in every page of a french memoir veracity is an unknown virtue and wherever that is the taste look for libels by wholesale too often even the unnatural and the monstrous is courted rather than miss the object of arresting and startling now dr johnsons calumnies or romances were not of that order he had a healthy spirit of reverence for truth but he was credulous to excess and he was plagued by an infirmity not uncommon amongst literary men who have no families of young people growing up around their hearth the hankering after gossip he was curious about the domestic habits of his celebrated countrymen inquisitive in a morbid degree about their pecuniary affairs what have you got in that pocket which bulges out so prominently what did your father do with that hundred guineas which he received on monday from jacob jonson and as his swallow was enormous as the doctor would believe more fables in an hour than an ablebodied liar would invent in a week naturally there was no limit to the slanders with which his lives of the poets are overrun of the four great biographical works which we have mentioned we hold dr johnsons to be by far the best in point of composition even plutarch though pardonably overrated in consequence of the great subjects which he treats which again are great by benefit of distance and the vast abstracting process executed by time upon the petty and the familiar is loose and rambling in the principles of his nexus and there lies the great effort for a biographer there is the strain and that is the task viz to weld the disconnected facts into one substance and by interfusing natural reflections to create for the motions of his narrative a higher impulse than one merely chronologic in this respect the best of dr johnsons lives are undoubtedly the very best which exist they are the most highly finished amongst all masterpieces of the biographic art and as respects the doctor personally they are beyond comparison his best work it is a great thing in any one art or function even though it were not a great one to have excelled all the literature of all languages and if the reader fancies that there lurks anywhere a collection of lives or even one life though it were the agricola of tacitus which as a work of refined art and execution can be thought equal to the best of dr johnsons we should be grateful to him if he would assign it in a letter to mr blackwood and though the night be raw well see it too the first we ever saw we say nothing of the calmuck tartars they hold see bergmanns streifereien that their dschangariade is the finest of all epic poems past or coming and therefore the calmuck lives of the poets will naturally be inimitable but confining our view to the unhappy literatures of europe ancient or modern this is what we think of dr johnsons efforts as a biographer consequently we cannot be taxed with any insensibility to his merit and as to the critical part of his lives if no thoughtful reader can be expected to abide by his haughty decisions yet on the other hand every man reads his opinions with pleasure from the intellectual activity and the separate justice of the thoughts which they display but as to his libellous propensity that rests upon independent principles for all his ability and all his logic could not elevate his mind above the region of gossip take his life of savage this was the original nestegg upon which as a basis and perhaps as the occasional suggestion of such an enterprise all the rest allow us a pompous word supervened it was admirably written because written con amore and also because written con odio and under either impulse is it possible to imagine grosser delusions johnson persuaded himself that savage was a fine gentleman a rle not difficult to support in that age when ceremony and a gorgeous costume were amongst the auxiliary distinctions of a gentleman and also that he was a man of genius the first claim was necessarily taken upon trust by the doctors readers the other might have been examined but after a few painful efforts to read the wanderer and other insipid trifles succeeding generations have resolved to take that upon trust also for in very truth savages writings are of that order which do not let themselves be read why then had publishers bought them publishers in those days were mere tradesmen without access to liberal society even richardson though a man of great genius in his publishers character was an obsequious nay servile admirer of the fine gentleman who wore a sword embroidered clothes and mechlin ruffles about his wrists above all things he glorified and adored a lovelace with a fine person who sang gaily to show his carelessness of low people never came abroad except in a sedanchair and liberally distributed his curses to the right and the left in all respectable mens shops this temper with her usual sagacity lady m wortley montagu could detect in richardson and for this she despised him but this it was and some little vision of possible patronage from lord tyrconnel which had obtained any prices at all for savage from such knowing publishers as were then arising but generally savage had relied upon subscriptions which were still common and in his case as a man supposed unfortunate were given purely as charity with what astonishment does a literary foreigner of any judgment find a savage placed amongst the classics of england and from the scale of his life reasonably he must infer that he is ranked amongst the leaders whilst the extent in which his works are multiplied would throw him back upon the truth that he is utterly unknown to his countrymen these however were the delusions of good nature but what are we to think of dr johnsons abetting that monstrous libel against lady macclesfield she unhappily as a woman banished without hope from all good society by her early misconduct as a wife but let it not be forgotten a neglected wife had nobody to speak a word on her behalf all evil was believed of one who had violated her marriage vows but had the affair occurred in our days the public journals would have righted her they would have shown the folly of believing a vain conceited man like savage and his nurse with no vouchers whatever upon a point where they had the deepest interest at stake whilst on the opposite side supposing their story true spoke for them the strongest of all natural instincts the pleading of the maternal heart combated by no selfinterest whatever surely if lady macclesfield had not been supported by indignation against an imposture merely for her own ease and comfort she would have pensioned savage or have procured him some place under government not difficult in those days for a person with her connections however sunk as respected female society to have obtained for an only son in the sternness of her resistance to all attempts upon her purse we read her sense of the fraud and on the other hand was the conduct of savage that of a son he had no legal claims upon her consequently no pretence for molesting her in her dwellinghouse and would a real son a great lubberly fellow well able to work as a porter or a footman however wounded at her obstinate rejection have been likely in pursuit of no legal rights to have alarmed her by threatening letters and intrusions for no purpose but one confessedly of pecuniary extortion from the very mode of pursuing his claim it is plain that savage felt it to be a false one it seems also to be forgotten by most readers that at this day real sons not denied to be such are continually banished nay ejected forcibly by policemen from the paternal roof in requital of just such profligate conduct as savage displayed so that grant his improbable story still he was a disorderly reprobate who in these days would have been consigned to the treadmill but the whole was a hoax savage however is but a single case in relation to which dr johnson stood in a special position that diseased his judgment but look at popes life at swifts at youngs at all the lives of men contemporary with himself they are overrun with defamatory stories or traits of that order which would most have stung them had they returned to life but it was an accident most beneficial to dr johnson that nearly all these men left no near relatives behind to call him to account the public were amused as they always are by exhibitions of infirmity or folly in one whom otherwise they were compelled to admire that was a sort of revenge for them to set off against a painful perpetuity of homage thus far the libels served only as jests and fortunately for dr johnson there arose no afterreckoning one period in fact of thirty years had intervened between the last of these men and the publication of the lives it was amongst the latest works of dr johnson thus and because most of them left no descendants he escaped had the ordinary proportion of these men been married the result would have been different and whatever might have been thought of any individual case amongst the complaints most undoubtedly from the great number to which the doctor had exposed himself amongst which many were not of a nature to be evaded by any vouchers whatsoever a fatal effect would have settled on the doctors moral reputation he would have been passed down to posterity as a dealer in wholesale scandal who cared nothing for the wounded feelings of relatives it is a trifle after that to add that he would frequently have been cudgelled this public judgment upon dr johnson and these cudgellings would have been too severe a chastisement for the offences which after all argued no heavier delinquency than a levity in examining his chance authorities and a constitutional credulity dr johnsons easiness of faith for the supernatural the grossness of his superstition in relation to such miserable impostures as the cock lane ghost and its scratchings on the wall flowed from the same source and his conversation furnishes many proofs that he had no principle of resistance in his mind no reasonable scepticism when any disparaging anecdote was told about his nearest friends who but he would have believed the monstrous tale that garrick so used to addressing large audiences extempore so quick and lively in his apprehensions had absolutely been dismissed from a court of justice as an idiot as a man incapable of giving the court information even upon a question of his own profession as to his credulity with respect to the somewhat harmless forgeries of psalmanazer and with respect to the villainous imposture of lander we imagine that other causes cooperated to those errors beyond mere facility of assenting in the latter case we fear that jealousy of milton as a scholar a feeling from which he never cleansed himself had been the chief cause of his so readily delivering himself a dupe to allegations not specious backed by forgeries that were anything but ingenious dr johnson had a narrow escape on that occasion had dr douglas fastened upon him as the collusive abettor of lander as the man whose sanction had ever won even a momentary credit for the obscure libeller and as the one beyond all others of the age whose critical occupation ought most to have secured him against such a delusion the character of johnson would have suffered seriously luckily dr douglas spared him and johnson seeing the infamy of the hoax and the precipice near which he stood hastened to separate himself from lander and to offer such reparation as he could by dictating that unhappy letter of recantation lander must have consented to this step from hopes of patronage and perhaps the obscure place of slavedriver in the west indies in which he died after recanting his recantation might be the unsatisfactory bait of his needy ambition but assuredly lander could have made out a better case for himself than that which under his name the doctor addressed to the bishop it was a dark spot in dr johnsons life a scotsman said he must be a strange one who would not tell a falsehood in a case where scotland was concerned and we fear that any fable of defamation must have been gross indeed which dr johnson would not have countenanced against milton his life of milton as it now stands contains some of the grossest calumnies against that mighty poet which have ever been hazarded and some of the deepest misrepresentations are coloured to the unsuspecting reader by an affectation of merriment but in his heart of hearts dr johnson detested milton gray even though as being little of a meddler with politics he furnished no handle to the doctor for wrath so unrelenting was a subject of deep jealousy from his reputed scholarship never did the spite of the doctor more emblazon itself than in his review of grays lyrical compositions the very affectation of prefacing his review by calling the two chief odes the wonderful wonder of wonders betrays a female spite and never did the arrogance of dr johnsons nature flame out so conspicuously as in some of the phrases used on this occasion perhaps it is an instance of selfinflation absolutely unique where he says my kindness for a man of letters this it seems caused him to feel pain at seeing gray descending to what he the doctor as a onesided opinion of his own held to be a fantastic foppery the question we point at is not this supposed foppery was it such or not miltons having cherished that foppery was a sufficient argument for detesting it what we fix the readers eye upon is the unparalleled arrogance of applying to gray this extreme language of condescending patronage he really had a kindness for the little man and was not ashamed as some people would be to own it so that it shocked him more than else it would have done to see the man disgracing himself in this way however it is probable that all the misstatements of dr johnson the invidious impressions and the ludicrous or injurious anecdotes fastened ad libitum upon men previously open to particular attacks never will be exposed and for this amongst other reasons that sometimes the facts of the case are irrecoverable though falsehood may be apparent and still more because few men will be disposed to degrade themselves by assuming a secondary and ministerial office in hanging upon the errors of any man pope was a great favourite with dr johnson both as an unreflecting tory who travelled the whole road to jacobitism thus far resembling the doctor himself secondly as one who complimented himself whilst yet a young man and even whilst wearing a masque complimented him under circumstances which make compliments doubly useful and make them trebly sincere if any man therefore he would have treated indulgently pope yet his life it is which has mainly fixed upon pope that false impression which predominates at this day that doubtless intellectually he was a very brilliant little man but morally a spiteful peevish waspish narrowhearted cynic whereas no imputation can be more unfounded pope unless in cases when he had been maddened by lampoons was a most benignant creature and with the slightest acknowledgment of his own merit there never lived a literary man who was so generously eager to associate others in his own honours those even who had no adequate pretensions if you reader should like ourselves have had occasion to investigate popes life under an intention of recording it more accurately or more comprehensively than has yet been done you will feel the truth of what we are saying and especially we would recommend to every man who wishes to think justly of pope in this respect that he should compare his conduct towards literary competitors with that of addison dr johnson having partially examined the lives of both must have been so far qualified to do justice between them but justice he has not done and to him chiefly we repeat that at this day are owing the false impressions of popes selfish ungenial or misanthropic nature and the humiliating associations connected with popes petty manoeuvring in trivial domestic affairs chiefly through dr johnsons means will never be obliterated let us turn however from dr johnson whom with our general respect for his upright nature it is painful to follow through circumstances where either jealousy as sometimes or credulity and the love of gossip as very often has misled him into gratifying the taste of the envious at a great sacrifice of dignity to the main upholders of our literature these men ought not to have been shown up for a comic or malicious effect a nation who value their literature as we have reason to value ours ought to show their sense of this value by forgetting the degrading infirmities not the venial and human infirmities of those to whose admirable endowments they owe its excellence turning away therefore from those modes of biography which have hitherto pursued any vicious extreme let us now briefly explain our own ideal of a happier sounder and more ennobling biographical art having the same general objects as heretofore but with a more express view to the benefit of the reader looking even at those memoirs which like hayleys of cowper have been checked by pathetic circumstances from fixing any slur or irreverential scandal upon their subject we still see a great fault in the mass of biographic records and what is it it is that even where no disposition is manifested to copy either the loge or the libellous pasquinade too generally the author appears ex officio as the constant patronus or legal advocate for the person recorded and so he ought if we understand that sort of advocacy which in english courts the judge was formerly presumed to exercise on behalf of the defendant in criminal trials before that remarkable change by which a prisoner was invested with the privilege of employing separate counsel the judge was his counsel the judge took care that no wrong was done to him that no false impression was left with the jury that the witnesses against him should not be suffered to run on without a sufficient rigour of crossexamination but certainly the judge thought it no part of his duty to make the worse appear the better reason to throw dust into the eyes of the jury or to labour any point of equivocation for the sake of giving the prisoner an extra chance of escaping and if it is really right that the prisoner when obviously guilty should be aided in evading his probable conviction then certainly in past times he had less than justice for most undoubtedly no judge would have attempted what we all saw an advocate attempting about a year ago that when every person in court was satisfied of the prisoners guilt from the proof suddenly brought to light of his having clandestinely left the plate of his murdered victim in a particular partys safe keeping at that moment the advocate though secretly prostrated by this overwhelming discovery struggled vainly to fix upon the honourable witness a foul stigma of selfcontradiction and perjury for the single purpose of turning loose a savage murderer upon society if this were not more than justice then assuredly in all times past the prisoner had far less now precisely the difference between the advocacy of the judge and the advocacy of a special counsel retained by the prisoner expresses the difference which we contemplate between the biographer as he has hitherto protected his hero and that biographer whom we would substitute is he not to show a partiality for his subject doubtless but hitherto in those lives which have been farthest from loges the author has thought it his duty to uphold the general system polity or principles upon which his subject has acted thus middleton and all other biographers of cicero whilst never meditating any panegyrical account of that statesman and oftentimes regretting his vanity for instance have quite as little thought it allowable to condemn the main political views theories and consequently actions of cicero but why not why should a biographer be fettered in his choice of subjects by any imaginary duty of adopting the views held by him whose life he records to make war upon the man to quarrel with him in every page that is quite as little in accordance with our notions and we have already explained above our sense of its hatefulness for then the question recurs for ever what necessity forced you upon a subject whose conduct you thoroughly disapprove but let him show the tenderness which is due to a great man even when he errs let him expose the total aberrations of the man and make this exposure salutary to the pathetic wisdom of his readers not alimentary to their selfconceit by keeping constantly before their eyes the excellence and splendour of the mans powers in contrast with his continued failures let him show such patronage to the hero of his memoir as the english judge showed to the poor prisoner at his bar taking care that he should suffer no shadow of injustice from the witnesses that the prisoners own selfdefence should in no part be defeated of its effect by want of proper words or want of proper skill in pressing the forcible points on the attention of the jury but otherwise leaving him to his own real merits in the facts of his case and allowing him no relief from the pressure of the hostile evidence but such as he could find either in counterevidence or in the intrinsic weight of his own general character on the scheme of biography there would be few persons in any department of life who would be accompanied to the close by a bowing and obsequious reporter there would be far less of uniform approbation presumable in memoirs but on the other hand there would be exhibited pretty generally a tender spirit of dealing with human infirmities a large application of human errors to the benefit of succeeding generations and lastly there would be an opening made for the free examination of many lives which are now in a manner closed against criticism whilst to each separate life there would be an access and an invitation laid bare for minds hitherto feeling themselves excluded from approaching the subject by imperfect sympathy with the principles and doctrines which those lives were supposed to illustrate but our reformed view of biography would be better explained by a sketch applied to ciceros life or to miltons in either case we might easily show consistently with the exposure of enormous errors that each was the wisest man of his own day and with regard to cicero in particular out of his own letters to atticus we might show that every capital opinion which he held on the politics of rome in his own day was false groundless contradictory yet for all that we would engage to leave the reader in a state of far deeper admiration for the man than the hollow and hypocritical middleton ever felt himself or could therefore have communicated to his readers editors note the reference on p is to the famous case of courvoisier in and this fixes as the date of the essay courvoisier was a valet who murdered and robbed his master putting the plate into the care of an old woman and making it appear a burglary he was defended by a barrister named philips who received from the prisoner a confession of his guilt and afterwards in court took heaven to witness that he believed him innocent though the woman by accident almost had been found and given evidence philips was disbarred footnotes in mrs hannah mores drawingroom at barley wood amongst the few pictures which adorned it hung a kitkat portrait of john henderson this and our private knowledge that mrs h m had personally known and admired henderson led us to converse with that lady about him what we gleaned from her in addition to the notices of aguttar and of some amongst johnsons biographers may yet see the light xiv great forgers chatterton and walpole and junius i have ever been disposed to regard as the most venial of deceptions such impositions as chatterton had practised on the public credulity whom did he deceive nobody but those who well deserved to be deceived viz shallow antiquaries who pretended to a sort of knowledge which they had not so much as tasted and it always struck me as a judicial infatuation in horace walpole that he who had so brutally pronounced the death of this marvellous boy to be a matter of little consequence since otherwise he would have come to be hanged for forgery should himself not as a boy under eighteen and i think under seventeen at the first issuing of the rowley fraud slaving for a few guineas that he might procure the simplest food for himself and then buy presents for the dear mother and sister whom he had left in bristol but as an elderly man with a clear six thousand per annum commit a far more deliberate and audacious forgery than that imputed if even accurately imputed to chatterton i know of no published document or none published under chattertons sanction in which he formally declared the rowley poems to have been the compositions of a priest living in the days of henry iv viz in or about the year undoubtedly he suffered people to understand that he had found mss of that period in the tower of st mary redcliff at bristol which he really had done and whether he simply tolerated them in running off with the idea that these particular poems written on discoloured parchments by way of colouring the hoax were amongst the st mary treasures or positively said so in either view considering the circumstances of the case no man of kind feelings will much condemn him but horace walpole roundly and audaciously affirmed in the first sentence of his preface to the poor romance of otranto that it had been translated from the italian of onuphrio muralto and that the ms was still preserved in the library of an english catholic family circumstantiating his needless falsehood by other most superfluous details needless i say because a book with the walpole name on the titlepage was as sure of selling as one with chattertons obscure name was at that time sure of not selling possibly horace walpole did not care about selling but wished to measure his own intrinsic power as a novelist for which purpose it was a better course to preserve his incognito but this he might have preserved without telling a circumstantial falsehood whereas chatterton knew that his only chance of emerging from the obscure station of a gravediggers son and carrying into comfort the dear female relatives that had halfstarved themselves for him i speak of things which have since come to my knowledge thirtyfive years after chatterton and his woes had been buried in a paupers coffin lay in bribing public attention by some extrinsic attraction macpherson had recently engaged the public gaze by his ossian an abortion fathered upon the fourth century after christ what so natural as to attempt other abortions ideas and refinements of the eighteenth century referring themselves to the fifteenth had this harmless hoax succeeded he would have delivered those from poverty who delivered him from ignorance he would have raised those from the dust who raised him to an aerial height yes to a height from which but it was after his death like ate or eris come to cause another trojan war he threw down an apple of discord amongst the leading scholars of england and seemed to say there dean of exeter there laureate there tyrwhitt my man me you have murdered amongst you now fight to death for the boy that living you would not have hired as a shoeblack my blood be upon you rise up martyred blood rise to heaven for a testimony against these men and this generation or else burrow in the earth and from that spring up like the stones thrown by deucalion and pyrrha into harvests of feud into armies of selfexterminating foes poor child immortal child slight were thy trespasses on this earth heavy was thy punishment and it is to be hoped nay it is certain that this disproportion did not escape the eye which in the algebra of human actions estimates both sides of the equation lord byron was of opinion that people abused horace walpole for several sinister reasons of which the first is represented to be that he was a gentleman now i on the contrary am of opinion that he was not always a gentleman as particularly seen in his correspondence with chatterton on the other hand it is but just to recollect that in retaining chattertons mss otherwise an unfeeling act yet chiefly imputable to indolence the worst aggravation of the case under the poor boys construction viz that if walpole had not known his low rank he would not have dared to treat him in that way though a very natural feeling was really an unfounded one horace walpole i call him so because he was not then lord orford certainly had not been aware that chatterton was other than a gentleman by birth and station the natural dignity of the boy which had not condescended to any degrading applications misled this practised man of the world but recurring to lord byrons insinuations as to a systematic design of running lord orford down i beg to say that i am no party to any such design it is not likely that a furious conservative like myself who have the misfortune also to be the most bigoted of tories would be so i disclaim all participation in any clamour against lord orford which may have arisen on democratic feeling feeling the profoundest pity for the marvellous boy of bristol and even love if it be possible to feel love for one who was in his unhonoured grave before i was born i resent the conduct of lord orford in this one instance as universally the english public has resented it but generally as a writer i admire lord orford in a very high degree as a letterwriter and as a brilliant sketcher of social aspects and situations he is far superior to any french author who could possibly be named as a competitor and as a writer of personal or anecdotic history let the reader turn to voltaires sicle de louis quatorze in order to appreciate his extraordinary merit next will occur to the reader the forgery of junius who did that oh villains that have ever doubted since junius identified oh scamps oh pitiful scamps you reader perhaps belong to this wretched corps but if so understand that you belong to it under false information i have heard myriads talk upon this subject one man said to me my dear friend i sympathize with your fury you are right righter a man cannot be rightest of all men you are i was right righter rightest that had happened to few men but again this flattering man went on yes my excellent friend right you are and evidently sir philip francis was the man his backer proved it the day after his book appeared if any man had offered me exactly two thousand to one in guineas that sir philip was not the man by jupiter i would have declined the bet so divine so exquisite so grecian in its perfection was the demonstration the apodeixis or what do you call it in greek that this brilliant sir philip who by the way wore his order of the bath as universally as ever he taxed sir william draper with doing had been the author of junius but here lay the perplexity of the matter at the least fiveandtwenty excellent men proved by posthumous friends that they every mothers son of them had also perpetrated junius then they were liars i answered oh no my right friend he interrupted not liars at all amiable men some of whom confessed on their deathbeds three to my certain knowledge that alas they had erred against the law of charity but how said the clergyman why by that infernal magazine of sneers and all uncharitableness the letters of junius let me understand you said the clergyman you wrote junius alas i did replied a two years after another clergyman said to another penitent and so you wrote junius too true my dear sir alas i did replied b one year later a third penitent was going off and upon the clergyman saying bless me is it possible did you write junius he replied ah worshipful sir you touch a painful chord in my remembrances i now wish i had not alas reverend sir i did now you see went on my friend so many men at the new drop as you may say having with tears and groans taxed themselves with junius as the climax of their offences one begins to think that perhaps all men wrote junius well so far there was reason but when my friend contended also that the proofs arrayed in pamphlets proved the whole alphabet to have written junius i could not stand his absurdities deathbed confessions i admitted were strong but as to these wretched pamphlets some time or other i will muster them all for a fieldday i will brigade them as if the general of the district were coming to review them and then if i do not mow them down to the last man by opening a treacherous battery of grapeshot may all my household die under a fiercer junius the true reasons why any man fancies that junius is an open question must be these three first that they have never read the proofs arrayed against sir philip francis this is the general case secondly that according to sanchos proverb they want better bread than is made of wheat they are not content with proofs or absolute demonstrations they require you like the witch of endor to raise sir philip from the grave that they may crossexamine him thirdly and this is the fault of the able writer who unmasked sir philip there happened to be the strongest argument that ever picked a bramahlock against the unknown writer of junius apply this and if it fits the wards oh gemini my dear friend but you are right righter rightest you have caught junius in a rabbitsnare footnotes six thousand per annum viz on the authority of his own confession to pinkerton editors note de quincey is guilty of a slight lapse of memory in reference to the castle of otranto and onuphrio muralto it was not in the first sentence of the preface but on the titlepage that walpole so plainly attributed the work to another the original titlepage which of course was dropped out when it became known to all the world that walpole was the author read thus the castle of otranto a story translated by william marshall gent from the original italian of onuphrio muralto canon of the church of st nicholas at otranto london printed for thomas lownds in fleet street xv daniel oconnell with a single view to the intellectual pretensions of mr oconnell let us turn to his latest general epistle dated from conciliation hall on the last day of october this is no random or to use a pedantic term perfunctory document not a document is this to which indulgence is due by its subject not less than by its address it stands forth audaciously as a deliberate as a solemn as a national state paper for its subject is the future political condition of ireland under the assumption of repeal for its address is to the people of ireland so placing himself a writer has it not within his choice to play the fool it is not within his competence to tumble or come aloft or play antics as a mountebank his theme binds him to decency his audience to gravity speaking though it be but by the windiest of fictions to a nation is not a man pledged to respectful language speaking though it is but by a chimera as wild as repeal to a question of national welfare a man is pledged to sincerity had he seven devils of mockery and banter within him for that hour he must silence them all the foul fiend must be rebuked though it were mahu and bohu who should prompt him to buffoonery when standing at the bar of nations this is the law this the condition under which mr oconnell was speaking when he issued that recent address given such a case similar circumstances presupposed he could not evade the obligations which they impose from such obligations there is no dispensation to be bought no not at rome from the obligations observe and those obligations we repeat are sincerity in the first place and respectful or deferential language in the second such were the duties now let us look to the performance and that we may judge of that with more advantage for searching and appraising the qualities of this document permit us to suggest three separate questions the first being this what was the occasion of the address secondly what was its ostensible object thirdly what are the arguments by which as its means the paper travels towards that object first as to the occasion of the address we have said that the date viz the st of october is falsified it was not dated on the st of october but on or about the seventh day of november even that falsehood though at first sight trivial is enough for suspicion if x a known liar utters a lie at starting it is not for him to plead in mitigation the apparent uselessness of the lie it is for us to presume out of the fact a use where the fact exists a leader in the french revolution protested often against bloodshed and other atrocities not as being too bad but on the contrary as being too good too precious to be wasted upon ordinary occasions and on the same principle we may be sure that any habitual liar who has long found the benefit of falsehoods at his utmost need will have formed too profound a reverence for this powerful resource in a moment of perplexity ever to throw away a falsehood or to squander upon a caprice of the moment that lie which being seasonably employed might have saved him from confusion the artist in lying is not the man to lie gratuitously from the first therefore satisfied ourselves that there was a lurking motive the key to this falsification of date we paused to search it out in that we found little difficulty for what was the professed object of this address it was to meet and to overthrow two notions here represented as great popular errors but why at this time wherefore all this heat at the present moment grant that the propositions denounced as erroneous were so in very deed why should criminals standing under the shadow of public vengeance ready to descend so childishly misuse the interval mercifully allowed for their own defence in reading lectures upon abstract political speculations confessedly bearing no relation to any militant interest now in question quite as impertinent it would be when called upon for the answer upon guilty or not guilty to read a section from the council of trent or a rescript from cardinal bellarmine yet the more extravagant was the logic of this proceeding the more urgent became the presumption of a covert motive and that motive we soon saw to be this let the reader weigh it and the good sense of the man who at such a moment could suffer such a motive to prevail thus it is when clontarf was intercepted and implicitly though not formally all similar meetings were by that one act for ever prohibited the first days of terror were naturally occupied with the panic of the conspirators and in providing for their personal terrors but when the dust of this great uproar began to settle and objects again became distinguishable in natural daylight the first consequence which struck the affrighted men of the conspiracy was the chilling effect of the government policy upon the oconnell rent not the weekly rent applied nobody knows how but the annual rent applied to mr oconnells private benefit this was in jeopardy and on the following argument originally this rent had been levied as a compensation to mr oconnell in his character of irish barrister not for services rendered or to be rendered but for current services continually being rendered in parliament from session to session for expenses incident to that kind of duty and also as an indemnification for the consequent loss of fees at the irish bar yet now in having ceased to attend his duty in parliament mr oconnell could no longer claim in that senatorial character such a pretension would be too gross for the understanding even of a connaught peasant and in that there was a great loss for the allegation of a parliamentary warfare under the vague idea of pushing forward good bills for ireland or retarding bad ones had been a pleasant and easy labour to the parish priests it was not necessary to horsewhip their flocks too severely if all was not clear to my childrens understanding at least my children had no mutinous demur in a positive shape ready for service recusants there were and sturdy ones but they could put no face on their guilt and their sin was not contagious unhappily from this indefinite condition of merit mr oconnell himself had translated his claim to a very distinct one founded upon a clear known absolute attempt to coerce the government into passive collusion with prospective treason this attempt said the peasantry will the government stand or will it not why then replied the government on the th of october we will not the aristocracy of ireland may not have done their duty as regards the repeal it is too certain that they have not because they have done nothing at all but it is also certain that their very uttermost would have been unavailing for one principal object concerned other great objects however might have been attained foreign nations might have been disabused of their silly delusions on the irish relations to england although the irish peasantry could not the monstrous impression also upon many english and scotch parties that a general unity of sentiment prevailed in ireland as to the desirableness of an independent parliament this this we say loudly would have been dissipated had every irish county met by its gentry disavowing and abominating all sentiments tending towards a purpose so guilty as political disunion yet in palliation of this most grievous failure we in the spirit of perfect candour will remind our readers of the depressing effect too often attending one flagrant wound in any system of power or means let a man lose by a sudden blow by fire by shipwreck or by commercial failure a sum of twenty thousand pounds that being fourfifths of his entire property how often it is found that mere dejection of mind will incapacitate him from looking cheerfully after the remaining fifth and this though it is now become far more essential to his welfare and secondly upon a motion tending upwards and not downwards he would have regarded five thousand pounds as a precious treasure worthy of his efforts whether for protection or for improvement something analogous to this weighs down the hearty exertions of the irish gentry met at the very threshold affronted at starting by this insufferable tyranny of priestly interference humiliated and stung to the heart by the consciousness that those natural influences which everywhere else settle indefeasibly upon property are in ireland intercepted filched violently robbed and pocketed by a body of professional nuisances sprung almost universally from paupers thus disinherited of their primary rights thus pillaged thus shorn like samson of those natural ornaments in which resided their natural strength feeling themselves like that same samson in the language of milton turned out to the scorn of their countrymen as tame wethers ridiculously fleeced and mutilated they droop they languish as to all public spirit and whilst by temperament by natural endowment by continual intercourse with the noble aristocracy of britain from whom also they are chiefly descended they should be amongst the leading chivalries of europe in very fact they are for political or social purposes the most powerless gentry in existence acting in a corporate capacity they can do nothing the malignant planet of this lowborn priesthood comes between them and the peasantry eclipsing oftentimes the sunshine of their comprehensive beneficence and always destroying their power to discountenance evildoers here is the sad excuse but for all that we must affirm that if the irish landed gentry do not yet come forward to retrieve the ground which they have forfeited by inertia history will record them as passive colluders with the dublin repealers the evil is so operatively deep looking backward or forward that we have purposely brought it forward in a second aspect viz as contrasted with the london press for the one as we have been showing there is a strong plea in palliation for the other there is none let us be frank this is what we affirm that it was it is it will be hereafter within the powers of the london press to have extinguished the repeal or any similar agitation they could have done this and this they have not done but let us also not be misunderstood do we say this in a spirit of disrespect are we amongst the parties who when characterizing the american press infamously say let us however look homewards to our own press and be silent for very shame are we the people to join the vicious correspondent of an evening paper whom but a week ago we saw denouncing the editor of the examiner newspaper as a public nuisance and recommending him as a fit subject of some degrading punishment for no better reason than that he had exercised his undoubted right of exposing delinquencies or follies in a garrulous lord far be such vilenesses from us we honour the press of this country we know its constitution and we know the mere impossibility were it only from the great capital required that any but men of honour and sensibilities and conspicuous talent and men brilliantly accomplished in point of education should become writers or editors of a leading journal or indeed of any daily journal here and there may float in gurgite vasto some atrocious paper lending itself upon system to the villainies of private slander but such a paper is sure to be an inconsiderable one in the mere sense of property and therefore by a logical consequence in our frame of society every way inconsiderable rising without effort sinking without notice in fact the whole staff and establishment of newspapers have risen in social consideration within our own generation and at this moment not merely proprietors and editors but reporters and other ministerial agents to these vast engines of civility have all ascended in their superior orders to the highest levels of authentic responsibility we make these acknowledgments in the mere spirit of equity and because we disdain to be confounded with those rash persons who talk glibly of a licentious press through their own licentious ignorance than ignorance nothing is so licentious for rash saying or for obstinate denying the british press is not licentious neither in london nor in edinburgh is it ever licentious and there is much need that it should be otherwise having at this time so unlimited a power over the public mind but the very uprightness of the leading journalists and all the other elements of their power do but constitute the evil do but aggravate the mischief where they happen to go astray yes in every case where these journalists miss the narrow path of thoughtful prudence they do miss it occasionally they must miss it and we contend that they have missed it at present what they have done that they ought not to have done currency buoyancy they ought not to have impressed upon sedition upon conspiracy upon treason currency buoyancy they have impressed upon sedition upon conspiracy upon treason as to mr oconnell himself it is useless and it argues some thick darkness of mind to remonstrate or generally to address any arguments from whatsoever quarter which either appeal to a sense of truth which secondly manifest inconsistencies or thirdly which argue therein a tendency ruinous to himself let us think burke asserted of himself and to our belief truly that having at different periods set his face in different directions now to the east now to the west now pointing to purposes of relaxation or liberality now again to purposes of coercive and popular restraint he had notwithstanding been uniform if measured upon a higher scale transcending objects coinciding neither instantly with the first nor except by accident with the last but indifferently aided by aristocratic forces or by democratic shifting weights which sometimes called for accessories of gravity sometimes for subtraction mighty fluctuating wheels which sometimes needed flywheels to moderate or harmonize sometimes needed concurrent wheels to urge or aggravate their impetus these were the powers which he had found himself summoned to calculate to check to support the vast algebraic equation of government for this he had strengthened substantially by apparent contrarieties of policy and in a system of watchwork so exquisite as to vary its fine balances eternally eternally he had consulted by redressing the errors emergent by varying the poise in order that he might not vary the equipoise by correcting inequalities or by forestalling extremes that was a man of heroic build and of him it might be said at his death truly this man was a son of anak now of mr oconnell a man might affirm something similar that as with regard to edmund burke it is altogether useless to detect contradictions in form seeing that he knows of this that he justifies this glories in this vehemently demands praise for this contradiction as all discord is harmony not understood planned in the letter and overruled in the spirit so may oconnell say gentlemen grubs reptiles vermin trouble not yourselves to find out contradictions or discords in my conduct vex not your slender faculties by arraying hosts of promises that defeat promises or principles that destroy principles you shall not need to labour i will make you a present of three huge canisters laden and running over with the flattest denials in one breath of that which i affirmed in another but like edmund burke i register my conduct by another table and by its final result on the dial which you see the hands point thus and thus but upon a higher and transcendent dial these fingers do but precipitate or retard one gigantic hand pointing always and monotonously to the unity of a perfect selfishness the everlasting tacking in my course gives me often the air of retrograding and losing but in fact these retrogressions are momentary these losings of my object are no more than seeming are still but the same stealthy creeping up under cover of frequent compliances with the breeze that happens to thwart me towards the one eternal pole of my own selfinterest that is the polestar which only never sets and i flatter myself that amidst vast apparent wanderings or multiplied divergences there will be detected by the eye of the philosopher a consistency in family objects which is absolute a divine unity of selfishness this we do not question but to will is not to do and mr oconnell with a true loyalty to his one object of private aims has not maintained the consistency of his policy all men know that he has adventured within the limits of conspiracy that could not be for his benefit he has touched even the dark penumbra of treason that could not but risk the sum of his other strivings but he who has failed for himself in a strife so absolute for that only must be distrusted by his countrymen footnotes to horsewhip etc let it not be said that this is any slander of ours would that we could pronounce it a slander but those who like ourselves have visited ireland extensively know that the parish priest uses a horsewhip in many circumstances as his professional insigne look at lord waterfords case in the very month of november is there a county in all england that would have tamely witnessed his expulsion from amongst them by fire and by sword and by poison note by the editor this article on oconnell written in the end of is printed not on account of any political reference it might be presumed to have but only because of its historical and literary interest apart from the light it may throw on de quinceys leanings as in certain respects distinctly in the direction of patriotic toryism of the most rampant type it may be of value as suggesting how essentially in not a few points the irish question today remains precisely as it was in the time of oconnell and how the tories of today are apt to view it from precisely the same plane as those of it might also be cited as another proof not only of de quinceys very keen interest in all the leading questions of the time but as an illustration of the john bull warmth and heat which he the dreamer the recluse the lover of abstract problems could bring into such discussions here at all events his views were definite enough and stated with a bold precision of english plainness that would have pleased the most pronouncedly tory or unionist newspaper editors of that day xvi france past and france present to speak in the simplicity of truth caring not for party or partisan is not the france of this day the france which has issued from that great furnace of the revolution a better happier more hopeful france than the france of allowing for any evil present or reversionary in the political aspects of france that may yet give cause for anxiety can a wise man deny that from the france of under louis philippe of orleans ascends to heaven a report of far happier days from the sons and daughters of poverty than from the france of louis xvi personally that sixteenth louis was a good king sorrowing for the abuses in the land and willing at least after affliction had sharpened his reflecting conscience had that choice been allowed him to have redeemed them by any personal sacrifice but that was not possible centuries of misrule are not ransomed by an individual ruin and had it been possible that the dark genius of his family the same who once tolled funeral knells in the ears of the first bourbon and called him out as a martyr hurrying to meet his own sacrifice could we suppose this gloomy representative of his family destinies to have met him in some solitary apartment of the tuileries or versailles some twilight gallery of ancestral portraits he could have met him with the purpose of raising the curtain from before the long series of his household woes from him the king would have learned that no personal ransom could be accepted for misgovernment so ancient leviathan is not so tamed arrears so vast imply a corresponding accountability corresponding by its amount corresponding by its personal subjects crown and people all had erred all must suffer blood must flow tears must be shed through a generation rivers of lustration must be thrown through that augean accumulation of guilt and exactly there it is supposed lay the error of burke the compass of the penalty the arch which it traversed must bear some proportion to that of the evil which had produced it when i referred to the dark genius of the family who once tolled funeral knells in the ears of the first bourbon i meant of course the first who sat upon the throne of france viz henri quatre the allusion is to the last hours of henrys life to the remarkable prophecies which foreran his death to their remarkable fulfilment and what is more remarkable than all beside to his selfsurrender in the spirit of an unresisting victim to a bloody fate which he regarded as inexorably doomed this king was not the good prince whom the french hold out to us not even the accomplished the chivalrous the elevated prince to whom history points for one of her models french and ultrafrench must have been the ideal of the good or the noble to which he could have approximated in the estimate of the most thoughtless he had that sort of military courage which was and is more common than weeds in all else he was a lowminded man vulgar in his thoughts most unprincely in his habits he was even worse than that wicked brutal sensually cruel and his wicked minister sully than whom a more servile mind never existed illustrates in one passage his own character and his masters by the apology which he offers for henrys having notoriously left many illegitimate children to perish of hunger together with their tooconfiding mothers what that in the pressure of business he really forgot them famine mocked at last the deadliest offence his own innocent children up and down france because they were illegitimate their tooconfiding mothers because they were weak and friendless by having for his sake forfeited the favour of god and man this amiable king had left to perish of hunger they did perish mother and infant a cry ascended against the king even in sensual france such atrocities could not utterly sink to the ground but what says the apologetic minister astonished that anybody could think of abridging a kings license in such particulars he brushes away the whole charge as so much ungentlemanly impertinence disdaining any further plea than the pressure of business which so naturally accounted for the royal inattention or forgetfulness in these little affairs observe that this pressure of business never was such that the king could not find time for pursuing these intrigues and multiplying these reversions of woe what enormities a king at all times of navarre and for half his life of france suffers his children to die of hunger consigns their mothers to the same fate but aggravated by remorse and by the spectacle of their perishing infants these clamours could not penetrate to the louvre but they penetrated to a higher court and were written in books from which there is no erasure allowed so much for the vaunted generosity of henry iv as to another feature of the chivalrous character elegance of manners let the reader consult the report of an english ambassador a man of honour and a gentleman sir george carew it was published about the middle of the last century by the indefatigable birch to whom our historic literature is so much indebted and it proves sufficiently that this idol of frenchmen allowed himself in habits so coarse as to disgust the most creeping of his own courtiers such that even the blackguards of a manly nation would revolt from them as foul and selfdishonouring deep and permanent is the mischief wrought in a nation by false models and corresponding is the impression immortal the benefit from good ones the english people have been the better for their alfred that pathetic ideal of a good king through a space of now nearly a thousand years the french are the worse to this hour in consequence of francis i and henry iv and note this that even the spurious merit of the two french models can be sustained only by disguises by suppressions by elaborate varnishings whereas the english prince is offered to our admiration with a scriptural simplicity and a scriptural fidelity not as some gay legend of romance some telemachus of fnelon but as one who had erred suffered and had been purified as a shepherd that had gone astray and saw that through his transgressions the flock also had been scattered xvii romes recruits and englands recruits two facts on which a sound estimate of the roman corntrade depends are these first the very important one that it was not rome in the sense of the italian peninsula which relied upon foreign corn but in the narrowest sense rome the city as respected what we now call lombardy florence genoa etc rome did not disturb the ancient agriculture the other fact offers perhaps a still more important consideration rome was latterly a most populous city we are disposed to agree with lipsius that it was four times as populous as most moderns esteem most certainly it bore a higher ratio to the total italy than any other capital even london has since borne to the territory over which it presided consequently it will be argued that in such a ratio must the foreign importations of rome even in the limited sense of rome the city have operated more destructively upon the domestic agriculture grant that not italy but rome was the main importer of foreign grain still if rome to all italy were as one to four in population which there is good reason to believe it was then even upon that distinction it will be insisted that the roman importation crushed onefourth of the native agriculture now this we deny some part of the african and egyptian grain was but a substitution for the sardinian and so far made no difference to italy in ploughs but only in denarii but the main consideration of all is that the italian grain was not withdrawn from the vast population of rome this is not the logic of the case no on the contrary the vast population of rome arose and supervened as a consequence upon the opening of the foreign alexandrian corn trade it was not rome that quirted the home agriculture rome in the full sense never would have existed without foreign supplies if therefore rome by means of foreign grain rose from four hundred thousand heads to four millions then it follows that except as to the original demand for the four hundred thousand not one plough was disused in italy that ever had been used whilst even with regard to the original demand of the four hundred thousand by so much of the egyptian grain as had been a mere substitution for sardinian no effect whatever could have followed to italian agriculture here therefore we see the many limitations which arise to the modern doctrine upon the destructive agricultural consequences of the roman corn trade rome may have prevented the italian agriculture from expanding but she could not have caused it to decline now let us see how far this roman corn trade affected the roman recruiting service it is alleged that agriculture declined under the foreign corn trade and that for this reason ploughmen declined but if we have shown cause for doubting whether agriculture declined or only did not increase then we are at liberty to infer that ploughmen did not decline but only did not increase even of the real and not imaginary ploughmen at any time possessed by italy too many in the south were slaves and therefore ineligible for the legionary service except in desperate intestine struggles like the social war or the servile rome could not lose for her recruiting service any ploughmen but those whom she had really possessed nor out of those whom really she possessed any that were slaves nor out of those whom not being slaves she might have used for soldiers could it be said that she was liable to any absolute loss except as to those whom ordinarily she did use as soldiers and preferred to use in circumstances of free choice these points premised we go on to say that no craze current amongst learned men has more deeply disturbed the truth of history than the notion that marsi and peligni or other bigboned italian rustics ever by choice constituted the general or even the favourite recruiting fund of the roman republic in thousands of books we have seen it asserted or assumed that the romans triumphed so extensively chiefly because their armies were composed of roman or kindred blood this is false not the material but the military system of the romans was the true key to their astonishing successes in the time of hannibal a roman consul relied chiefly it is true upon italian recruits because he could seldom look for men of other blood and it is possible enough that the same man fabius or marcellus if he had been sent abroad as a proconsul might find his choice even then in what formerly had been his necessity in some respects it is probable that the italian rustic of true italian blood was at that period the best raw material easily procured for the legionary soldier but circumstances altered as the range of war expanded to the east it became far too costly to recruit in italy nor if it had been less costly could italy have supplied the waste above all with the advantages of the roman military system no particular physical material was required for making good soldiers for these reasons it was that after the levant was permanently occupied by the romans where any legion had been originally stationed there it continued to be stationed and there it was recruited and unless in some rare emergency of a critical war arising at a distance there it was so continually recruited that in the lapse of a generation it contained hardly any roman or italian blood in its composition like the attic ship which had been repaired with cedar until it retained no fragment of its original oak thus the legion stationed at antioch became entirely syrian that stationed at alexandria grecian jewish and in a separate sense alexandrine csar it is notorious raised one entire legion of gauls distinguished by the cognizance upon the helmet of the lark whence commonly called the legion of the alauda but he recruited all his legions in gaul in spain the armies of assanius and petreius who surrendered to csar under a convention consisted chiefly of spaniards not hispanienses or romans born in spain but hispani spaniards by blood at pharsalia a large part of csars army were gauls and of pompeys it is well known that many even amongst the legions contained no europeans at all but as csar seasonably reminded his army consisted of vagabonds from every part of the east from all this we argue that spqr did not depend latterly upon native recruiting and in fact they did not need to do so their system and discipline would have made good soldiers out of mophandles if like lucians magical mophandles they could only have learned to march and to fill buckets with water at the word of command we see too the secret power and also the secret political wisdom of christianity in another instance those public largesses of grain which in old rome commenced upon principles of ambition and of factious encouragement to partisans in the new rome of constantinople were propagated for ages under the novel motive of christian charity to paupers this practice has been condemned by the whole chorus of historians who fancy that from this cause the domestic agriculture languished and that a bounty was given upon pauperism but these are reveries of literary men that particular section of rural industry which languished in italy did so by a reaction from rent in the severe modern sense the grain imported from sardinia from africa the province and from egypt was grown upon soils less costly because with equal cost more productive the effect upon italy from bringing back any considerable portion of this provincial corngrowth to her domestic districts would have been suddenly to develop rent upon a large series of evils and to load the provincial grain as well as the homegrown the cheap provincial as well as the dear homegrown with the whole difference of these new costs neither is the policy of the case at all analogous to our own at the moment in three circumstances it differs essentially first provinces are not foreigners colonies are not enemies an exotic corntrade could not for rome do the two great injuries which assuredly it would do for england it could not transfer the machinery of opulence to a hostile and rival state it could not invest a jealous competitor with power suddenly to cut off supplies that had grown into a necessity and thus to create in one month a famine or an insurrection egypt had neither the power nor any prospect of the power to act as an independent state towards rome the transfer to egypt of the roman agriculture supposing it to have been greater than it really was could have operated but like a transfer from norfolk to yorkshire secondly as respected italy the foreign grain did not enter the same markets as the native either one or the other would have lost its advantage and the natural bounty which it enjoyed from circumstances by doing so consequently the evils of an artificial scale where grain raised under one set of circumstances fixes or modifies the price for grain raised under a different set of circumstances were unknown in the italian markets but these evils by a special machinery viz the machinery of good and bad seasons are aggravated for a modern state intensely whenever she depends too much upon alien stores and specifically they are aggravated by the fact that both grains enter the same market so that the one by too high a price is encouraged unreasonably the other by the same price too low for opposite circumstances is depressed ruinously as regards coming years whence in the end two sets of disturbances one set frequently from the present seasons and a second set from the way in which these are made to act upon the future markets thirdly the roman corntrade did not of necessity affect her military service injuriously and for this reason that rural economy did not of necessity languish because agriculture languished locally some other culture as of vineyards oliveta orchards pastures replaced the declining culture of grain if ploughmen were fewer other labourers were more it is forgotten besides that the decline of italian agriculture never more than local was exceedingly gradual for two hundred and fifty years before the christian era italy never had depended exclusively upon herself sardinia and sicily at her own doors were her granaries consequently the change never had been that abrupt change which modern writers imagine but let us indulge in the luxury of confirming what we have said by the light of contrast suppose the circumstances changed suppose them reversed and then all those evil consequence sought to take effect which in the case of rome we have denied now it happened that they were reversed not indeed for rome who had been herself ruined as metropolis of the west before the effects of a foreign corndependence could unfold themselves but for her daughter and rival in the east early in the seventh century near to the very crisis of the hegira which dates from the christian year constantinople eastern rome suddenly became acquainted with the panic of famine in one hour perhaps this change fell upon the imperial city and but for the imperial granaries not the panic of famine but famine itself would have surprised the imperial city for the suddenness of the calamity would have allowed no means of searching out or raising up a relief to it at that time the greatest man who ever occupied the chair of the eastern csars viz heraclius was at the head of affairs but the perplexity was such that no man could face it on the one hand constantine the founder of this junior rome had settled upon the houses of the city a claim for a weekly dimensum of grain upon this they relied so that doubly the government stood pledged first for the importation of corn that should be sufficient secondly for its distribution upon terms as near to those of constantine as possible but on the other hand persia the one great stationary enemy of the empire had in the year suddenly overrun egypt grain became deficient on the banks of the nile had it even been plentiful to so detested an enemy it would have been denied and thus without a months warning the supply which had not failed since the inauguration of the city in ceased in one week the people of this mighty city were pressed by the heaviest of afflictions the emperor under false expectations was tempted into making engagements which he could not keep the government at a period which otherwise and for many years to come was one of awful crisis became partially insolvent the shepherd was dishonoured the flocks were ruined and had that persian armament which about ten years later laid siege to constantinople then stood at her gates the cross would have been trampled on by the fireworshipping idolater and the barbarous avar would have desolated the walls of the glorified csar who first saw christ marching in the van of roman armies such an iliad of woes would have expanded itself seriatim and by a long procession from the one original mischief of depending for daily bread upon those who might suddenly become enemies or tools of enemies england read in the distress of that great csar who may with propriety be called the earliest as he was the most prosperous of crusaders read in the internal struggle of his heart too conscious that dishonour had settled upon his purple read in the degradations which he traversed as some fiery furnace yet not unsinged the inevitable curses which await nations who sacrifice for a momentary convenience of bread sacrifice for a loaf the charter of their supremacy this is literally to fulfil the scriptural case of selling a birthright for a mess of pottage for england we may say of this case transeat in exemplum great britain on the contrary is limited in her recruitinggrounds by modern political relations as respects europe she has formed an excellent foreign corps long ago in the mediterranean a hessian corps in america an admirable hanoverian legion during the late war but circumstances too often prevent her relying as the romans did on the perfection of her military system so far as to dispense with native materials except indeed in the east where the roman principle is carried out to the widest extent needing only onetenth of british by way of model and inspiration under circumstances of peculiar trial in african stations also in the west indies and on the american continent as in honduras england proceeds though insufficiently upon this fine roman principle making her theory her discipline and the network of her rules do the work of her own too costly hands she like rome finds the benefit of her fine system chiefly in the dispensation which it facilitates from working with any exhaustible fund of means excellent must be that workmanship which can afford to be careless about its materials yet still where naturally and essentially it must be said that materiem superabat opus because one section of our martial service moves by nautical soldiers and with respect to the other half because it is necessary to meet european troops by men of british blood we cannot for european purposes look to any other districts than our own native officin of population the life guards st regiment and the blues nd recruit chiefly or did so thirty years ago in yorkshire this is a manufacturing county though in a mode of manufacturing which escapes many evils of the factory system and generally we are little disposed pedantically to disparage towns as funds of a good soldiery men of mighty bone and thews sons of anak to our own certain knowledge arise in kendal wakefield bradford and leeds huge men by thousands amongst the spinners and weavers of glasgow paisley etc well able to fight their way through battalions of clodhoppers whose talk is of oxen but unless in times subject to special distress it is not so easy to tempt away the weaver from his loom as the delver from his spade we believe the reason to be that the monotony of a rustic life is more oppressive to those who have limited resources than the corresponding monotony of a town life for this reason and for many others it is certain and perhaps unless we get to fighting with steammen it will continue to be certain through centuries that for the main staple of her armies and her navies england must depend upon the quality of her bold peasantry and noble yeomanry for we must remember that of those hugelimbed men who are found in the six northern counties of england and in the scottish lowlands of those elegantlyformed men who are found in devonshire cornwall etc of those hardy men a feature in human physics still more important who are found in every district if many are now resident in towns most of them originated in rustic life and from rustic life it is that the reservoir of towns is permanently fed rome was england never will be independent of her rural population rome never had a yeomanry rome never had a race of country gentlemen england has both upon a scale so truly noble that it will be the simplest expression of that nobility to say pointing to our villages behold the cradle of our army as inversely to say pointing to that army behold the manhood of our villages as regards rome from the bisection of the roman territory into two several corn districts depending upon a separate agriculture it results that her wealth could not be defeated and transferred secondly it results from the total subjection of egypt that no embargo could be laid on the harvests of the nile and no famine could be organized against rome thirdly it results that the roman military system was thus not liable to be affected by any dependency upon foreign grain on the argument that this dependency had always been proceeding gradually in italy so as virtually to reimburse itself by vicarious culture whereas in england the transition from independency to dependency being accomplished if at all in one day by act of parliament would be ruinously abrupt and also on the argument b that rome if slowly losing any recruiting districts at home found compensatory districts all round the mediterranean whilst england could find no such compensatory districts we deny that the circumstances of the roman corn trade have ever been stated truly and we expect the thanks of our readers for drawing their attention to this outline of the points which essentially differenced it from the modern corn trade of england england must but rome could not reap from a foreign corn dependency firstly ruinous disturbance to the natural expansions of her wealth secondly famine by intervals for her vast population thirdly impoverishment to her recruiting service these are the dreadful evils some uniform some contingent which england would inherit of her native agriculture but which rome escaped under that partial transfer never really accomplished meantime let the reader remember that it is rome and not england rome historically not england politically which forms the object of our exposure england is but the means of the illustration in our own days wars in their ebbs and flows are but another name for the resources of the national exchequer or expressions of its artificial facilities for turning those resources to account the great artifice of anticipation applied to national income an artifice sure to follow where civilization has expanded and which would have arisen to rome had her civilization been either a completely developed or b expanded originally from a true radix has introduced a new era into national history the man who having had property invests in the funds and divides between his grandchildren and the five subsequent generations what will yield them subsistence is the author of an expansive improvement which has been enjoyed by all in turn and with more fixed assurance in the last case than in the first he is a public benefactor in more ways than appears on the surface he takes the most efficient guarantees against needless wars captain jenkinss ears might have been redeemed at a less price but still the war taught a lesson which if avoidable at that instant was certainly blamable but it had its use in enforcing on other nations the conviction that england washed out insult with retribution and for every drop of blood wantonly spilt demanded an ocean in return perhaps you will say this was no great improvement on the old no not in appearance it may be but that was because war had to open a field which mere diplomacy unsupported by the sword could not open and secured what we may well call a moral result in the eye of the whole world which diplomacy could not secure in our guilty europe but was that you ask a condition to be contemplated with complete satisfaction no nor is it right that it should but the dawn of a new era is approaching for which that may have done its installment of preparation not that war will cease for many generations but that it will continually move more in greater subjection to national laws and christian opinion nevermore will it be excited by mere court intrigue or even by ministerial necessities no more will a quarrel between two ladies about a pair of gloves or a fit of illtemper in a prince toward his minister call forth the dread scourge by way of letting off personal irritation or redressing the balance of parties funding therefore was a great step in advance and even already we have only to look into the exchequer in order to read the possibilities the ebbs and flows of war beforehand this consideration of money it is true even as the sinews of war was not so great in ancient history and the reason is evident kings did not then go to war by money but for money they did not look into the exchequer for the means of a campaign but they looked into a campaign for the means of an exchequer yet even in these nations more of their history of their doings and sufferings lay in their economy than anywhere else the great oriental phantoms such as the pharaohs and the sargons did it is true bring nations to war without much more care for the commissariat department than is given in the battles of the kites and daws yet even there the political economy made itself felt obscurely and indirectly it may be but really and effectively acting by laws that varied their force rather to the eye than to the understanding and presented indeed a final restraining force to these kings also for examine these wars fabulous as they are look into the when the whence the how into the duration of the campaigns into their objects and into the quality of the troops into the circumstances under which they were trained and fought and this will abundantly appear certainly the commissariat which we do by foresight they did by brute efforts of power but the leading economical laws which are now clear to us and which with full perception of their inevitable operation we take into account made themselves felt in the last result if only then blindly realized and in the fact that these laws are now clearly apprehended lies the prevailing reason that modern wars must on the side alike of the commissariat and of social effects in various directions be widely different from war in ancient times footnotes one pretended proof of a decline is found in the supposed substitution of slave labour for free italian labour this began it is urged on the opening of the nile corn trade unfortunately that is a mere romance ovid describing rural appearances in italy when as yet the trade was hardly in its infancy speaks of the rustic labourer as working in fetters juvenal in an age when the trade had been vastly expanded notices the same phenomenon almost in the same terms the best raw material some people hold that the romans and italians were a cowardly nation we doubt this on the whole physically however they were inferior to their neighbours it is certain that the transalpine gauls were a conspicuously taller race csar says gallis pr magnitudine corporum quorum brevitas nostra contemptui est bell gall fin and the germans in a still higher degree were both larger men and every way more powerful the kites says juvenal had never feasted on carcases so huge as those of the cimbri and teutones but this physical superiority though great for special purposes was not such absolutely for the more general uses of the legionary soldier for marching for castrametation and the daily labours of the spade or mattock a lighter build was better as to single combats it was one effect from the roman as from every good discipline that it diminished the openings for such showy but perilous modes of contest any considerable portion of this provincial corn growth ie of the provincial culture which was pursued on account of rome meaning not the government of rome but in a rigorous sense on account of rome the city for here lies a great oversight of historians and economists because rome with a view to her own privileged population ie the urban population of rome the metropolis in order that she might support her public distributions of grain almost of necessity depended on foreign supplies we are not to suppose that the great mass of italian towns and municipia did so maritime towns having the benefit of ports or of convenient access undoubtedly were participators in the roman advantage but inland towns would in those days have forfeited the whole difference between foreign and domestic grain by the enormous cost of inland carriage of canals there was but one the rivers were not generally navigable and ports as well as river shipping were wanting heraclius the same prosodial fault affects this name as that of alexandria in each name the latin i represents a greek ei and in that situation viz as a penultimate syllable should receive the emphasis in pronunciation as well as the sound of a long i that sound which is heard in longinus so again academia not academia the greek accentuation may be doubted but not the roman we have already said that heraclius who and whose family filled the throne of eastern csar for exactly one hundred years consequently interesting in this way if in no other that he as the reader will see by considering the limits in point of time must have met and exhausted the first rage of the mahometan avalanche merits according to our estimate the title of first and noblest amongst the oriental csars there are records or traditions of his earliest acts that we could wish otherwise which of us would not offend even at this day if called upon to act under one scale of sympathies and to be judged under another in his own day too painfully we say it heraclius could not have followed what we venture to believe the suggestions of his heart in relation to his predecessor because a policy had been established which made it dangerous to be merciful and a state of public feeling which made it effeminate to pardon first make it safe to permit a mans life before you pronounce it ignoble to authorize his death strip mercy of ruin to its author before you affirm upon a judicial punishment of death as then it was cruelty in the adviser or ignobility in the approver escaping from these painful scenes at the threshold of his public life we find heraclius preparing for a war the most difficult that in any age any hero has confronted we call him the earliest of crusaders because he first and literally fought for the recovery of the cross we call him the most prosperous of crusaders because he first he last succeeded in all that he sought bringing back to syria ultimately to constantinople that sublime symbol of victorious christianity which had been disgracefully lost at jerusalem yet why when comparing him not with crusaders but with csars do we pronounce him the noblest reader which is it that is felt by a thoughtful man supposing him called upon to select one act by preference before all others to be the grandest act of our own wellesley is it not the sagacious preparation of the lines at torres vedras the selfmastery which lured the french on to their ruin the longsuffering policy which reined up his troops till that ruin was accomplished i bide my time was the dreadful watchword of wellington through that great drama in which let us tell the french critics on tragedy they will find the most absolute unity of plot for the forming of the lines as the fatal noose the wiling back the enemy the pursuit when the work of disorganization was perfect all were parts of one and the same drama if he as another scipio saw another zama in this instance he was not our scipio or marcellus but our fabius maximus unus homo nobis cunctando restituit rem ann now such was the emperor heraclius he also had his avenging zama but during a memorable interval of eleven years he held back fiercely reined up his wrath brooded smiled often balefully watched in his lair and then when the hour had struck let slip his armies and his thunderbolts as no csar had ever done except that one who founded the name of csar a brutal outrage on a captain jenkins ie cutting off his ears was the cause of a war with spain in the reign of george ii ed xviii national manners and false judgment of them anecdotes illustrative of manners above all of national manners will be found on examination in a far larger proportion than might be supposed rank falsehoods malice is the secret foundation of all anecdotes in that class the ordinary course of such falsehoods is that first of all some stranger and alien to those feelings which have prompted a particular usage incapable therefore of entering fully into its spirit or meaning tries to exhibit its absurdity more forcibly by pushing it into an extreme or trying case coming himself from some gross form of kleinstdtigkeit where no restraints of decorum exist and where everybody speaks to everybody he has been utterly confounded by the english ceremony of introduction when enforced as the sine qu non condition of personal intercourse if england is right then how clownishly wrong must have been his own previous circles if england is not ridiculously fastidious then how bestially grovelling must be the spirit of social intercourse in his own land but no man reconciles himself to this view of things in a moment he kicks even against his own secret convictions he blushes with shame and anger at the thought of his own family perhaps brought suddenly into collision with polished englishmen he thrills with wrath at the recollection of having himself trespassed upon this code of restriction at a time when he was yet unwarned of its existence in this temper he is little qualified to review such a regulation with reason and good sense he seeks to make it appear ridiculous he presses it into violent cases for which it was never intended he supposes a case where some fellowcreature is drowning how would an englishman act how could he act even under such circumstances as these we know we who are blinded by no spite that as a bar to personal communication or to any interchange of good offices under appeals so forcible as these this law of formal presentation between the parties never did and never will operate the whole motive to such a law gives way at once xix increased possibilities of sympathy in the present age some years ago i had occasion to remark that a new era was coming on by hasty strides for national politics a new organ was maturing itself for public effects sympathy how great a power is that conscious sympathy how immeasurable now for the total development of this power time is the most critical of elements thirty years ago when the edinburgh mail took ninetysix hours in its transit from london how slow was the reaction of the scottish capital upon the english eight days for the diaulos of the journey and two suppose for getting up a public meeting composed a cycle of ten before an act received its commentary before a speech received its refutation or an appeal its damnatory answer what was the consequence the sound was disconnected from its echo the kick was severed from the recalcitration the take you this was unlinked from the and take you that vengeance was defeated and sympathy dissolved into the air but now mark the difference a meeting on monday in liverpool is by possibility reported in the london standard of monday evening on tuesday the splendid merchant suppose his name were thomas sands who had just sent a vibration through all the pulses of liverpool of manchester of warrington sees this great rolling fire which hardly yet has reached his own outlying neighbourhoods taken up afar off redoubled multiplied peal after peal through the vast artilleries of london back comes rolling upon him the smoke and the thunder the defiance to the slanderer and the warning to the offender groans that have been extorted from wounded honour aspirations rising from the fervent heart truth that had been hidden wisdom that challenged cooperation and thus it is that all the nation thus all that mighty heart through nine hundred miles of space from sutherlandshire by london to the myrtle climate of cornwall has become and is ever more becoming one infinite harp swept by the same breeze of sentiment reverberating the same sympathies here there and in all places at one time time therefore that ancient enemy of man and his frail purposes how potent an ally has it become in combination with great mechanic changes many an imperfect hemisphere of thought action desire that could not heretofore unite with its corresponding hemisphere because separated by ten or fourteen days of suspense now moves electrically to its integration hurries to its complement realizes its orbicular perfection spherical completion through that simple series of improvements which to man have given the wings and talaria of gods for the heralds have dimly suggested a future rivalship with the velocities of light and even now have inaugurated a race between the child of mortality and the north wind footnotes the diaulos of the journey we recommend to the amateur in words this greek phrase which expresses by one word an egress linked with its corresponding regress which indicates at once the voyage outwards and the voyage inwards as the briefest of expressions for what is technically called course of post ie the reciprocation of post its systole and diastole wordsworth xx the principle of evil we are not to suppose the rebel or more properly corrupted angels the rebellion being in the result not in the intention which is as little conceivable in an exalted spirit as that man should prepare to make war on gravitation were essentially evil whether a principle of evil essential evil anywhere exists can only be guessed so gloomy an idea is shut up from man yet if so possibly the angels and man were nearing it continually possibly after a certain approach to that maelstrom recall might be hopeless possibly many anchors had been thrown out to pick up had all dragged and last of all came to the jewish trial of course under the pagan absence of sin a fall was impossible a return was impossible in the sense that you cannot return to a place which you have never left have i ever noticed this we are not to suppose that the angels were really in a state of rebellion so far from that it was evidently amongst the purposes of god that what are called false gods and are so in the ultimate sense of resting on tainted principles and tending to ruin perhaps irretrievable though it would be the same thing practically if no restoration were possible but through vast ons of unhappy incarnations but otherwise were as real as anything can be into whose nature a germ of evil has entered should effect a secondary ministration of the last importance to mans welfare doubt there can be little that without any religion any sense of dependency or gratitude or reverence as to superior natures man would rapidly have deteriorated and that would have tended to such destruction of all nobler principles patriotism strong in the old world as with us humanity ties of parentage or neighbourhood as would soon have thinned the world so that the jewish process thus going on must have failed for want of correspondencies to the scheme possibly endless oscillations which however coincident with plagues would extirpate the human race we may see in manufacturing neighbourhoods so long as no dependency exists on masters where wages show that not work but workmen are scarce how unamiable insolent fierce are the people the poor cottagers on a great estate may sometimes offend you by too obsequious a spirit towards all gentry that was a transition state in england during the first half of the eighteenth century when few manufacturers and merchants had risen to such a generous model but this leaves room for many domestic virtues that would suffer greatly in the other state yet this is but a faint image of the total independency oaths were sacred only through the temporal judgments supposed to overtake those who insulted the gods by summoning them to witness a false contract but this would have been only part of the evil so long as men acknowledged higher natures they were doubtful about futurity this doubt had little strength on the side of hope but much on the side of fear the blessings of any future state were cheerless and insipid mockeries so achilles how he bemoans his state but the torments were real by far more however they through this coarse agency of syllogistic dread would act to show man the degradation of his nature when all light of a higher existence had disappeared that which did not exist for natures supposed capable originally of immortality how should it exist for him and that man must have observed with little attention what takes place in this world if he needs to be told that nothing tends to make his own species cheap and hateful in his eyes so certainly as moral degradation driven to a point of no hope so in squalid dungeons in captivities of slaves nay in absolute pauperism all hate each other fiercely even with us how sad is the thought that just as a man needs pity as he is stript of all things when most the sympathy of men should settle on him then most is he contemplated with a hardhearted contempt the jews when injured by our own oppressive princes were despised and hated had they raised an empire licked their oppressors well they would have been compassionately loved so lunatics heretofore so galleyslaves toulon marseilles etc this brutal principle of degradation soon developed in man the gods therefore performed a great agency for man and it is clear that god did not discourage common rites or rights for his altar or theirs nay he sent israel to egypt as one reason to learn ceremonies amongst a people who sequestered them in evil the jews always clove to their religion next the difficulty of people miracles though less for false gods and least of all for the meanest was alike for both astarte does not kill sayth on the spot but by a judgment gods no more their god spake an instant law even the prophets are properly no prophets but only the mode of speech by god as clear as he can speak men mistake gods hate by their own so neither could he reveal himself a vast age would be required for seeing god but for the thought of man as evil or of any other form of evil as reconcilable with their idea of a perfect god a happy idea may like the categories proceed upon a necessity for a perfect inversion of the methodus conspiciendi let us retrace but in such a form as to be apprehensible by all readers analytic and synthetic propositions at once throw light upon the notion of a category once it had been a mere abstraction of no possible use except as a convenient cell for referring as in a nest of boxes which may perhaps as much degrade the idea as a relative of my own degraded the image of the crescent moon by saying in his abhorrence of sentimentality that it reminded him of the segment from his own thumbnail when clean cut by an instrument called a nailcutter this was the aristotelian notion but kant could not content himself with this idea his own theory as to time and space the refutation of humes notion of cause and his own great discovery of synthetic and analytic propositions all prepared the way for a totally new view but now what is the origin of this necessity applied to the category as founded in the synthesis how does a synthesis make itself or anything else necessary explain me that this was written perhaps a fortnight ago now monday may day fixed for dan goods execution i do explain it by what this moment i seem to have discovered the necessity of cause of substance etc lies in the intervening synthesis this you must pass through in the course tending to and finally reaching the idea for the analytical presupposes this synthesis not only must the energies of destruction be equal to those of creation but in fact perhaps by the trespassing a little of the first upon the last is the true advance sustained for it must be an advance as well as a balance but you say this will but in other words mean that forces devoted and properly so to production or creation are absorbed by destruction true but the opposing phenomena will be going on in a large ratio and each must react on the other the productive must meet and correspond to the destructive the destructive must revise and stimulate the continued production xxi on miracles what else is the laying of such a stress on miracles but the case of a wicked and adulterous generation asking a sign but what are these miracles for to prove a legislation from god but first this could not be proved even if miracleworking were the test of divine mission by doing miracles until we knew whether the power were genuine ie not like the magicians of pharaoh or the witch of endor from below secondly you are a poor pitiful creature that think the power to do miracles or power of any kind that can exhibit itself in an act the note of a godlike commission better is one ray of truth not seen previously by man of moral truth eg forgiveness of enemies than all the powers which could create the world oh yes says the objector but christ was holy as a man this we know first then we judge by his power that he must have been from god but if it were doubtful whether his power were from god then until this doubt is otherwise is independently removed you cannot decide if he was holy by a test of holiness absolutely irrelevant with other holiness apparent holiness a simulation might be combined you can never tell that a man is holy and for the plain reason that god only can read the heart let him come down from the cross and we etc yes they fancied so but see what would really have followed they would have been stunned and confounded for the moment but not at all converted in heart their hatred to christ was not built on their unbelief but their unbelief in christ was built on their hatred and this hatred would not have been mitigated by another however astounding miracle this i wrote monday morning june in reference to my saying on the general question of miracles why these dubious miracles such as curing blindness that may have been cured by a process since the unity given to the act of healing is probably more probably than otherwise but the figurative unity of the tendency to mythus or else it is that unity misapprehended and mistranslated by the reporters such again as the miracles of the loaves so liable to be utterly gossip so incapable of being watched or examined amongst a crowd of people besides were these people mad the very fact which is said to have drawn christs pity viz their situation in the desert surely could not have escaped their own attention on going thither think of people rushing to a sort of destruction for if less than that the mere inconvenience was not worthy of divine attention now said i why not give us if miracles are required one that nobody could doubt removing a mountain eg yes but here the other party begin to see the evil of miracles oh this would have coerced people into believing rest you safe as to that it would have been no believing in any proper sense it would at the utmost and supposing no vital demur to popular miracle have led people into that belief which christ himself describes and regrets as calling him lord lord the pretended belief would have left them just where they were as to any real belief in christ previously however or over and above all this there would be the demur let the miracle have been what it might of by what power by whose agency or help for if christ does a miracle probably he may do it by alliance with some z standing behind out of sight or if by his own skill how or whence derived or of what nature this obstinately recurrent question remains there is not the meanest court in christendom or islam that would not say if called on to adjudicate the rights of an estate on such evidence as the mere facts of the gospel o good god how can we do this which of us knows who this matthew was whether he ever lived or if so whether he ever wrote a line of all this or if he did how situated as to motives as to means of information as to judgment and discrimination who knows anything of the contrivances or the various personal interests in which the whole narrative originated or when all is dark and dusty nothing in such a case can be proved but what shines by its own light nay god himself could not attest a miracle but listen to this but by the internal revelation or visiting of the spirit to evade which to dispense with which a miracle is ever resorted to besides the objection to miracles that they are not capable of attestation humes objection is not that they are false but that they are incommunicable two different duties arise for the man who witnesses a miracle and for him who receives traditionally the duty of the first is to confide in his own experience which may besides have been repeated of the second to confide in his understanding which says less marvel that the reporter should have erred than that nature should have been violated how dearly do these people betray their own hypocrisy about the divinity of christianity and at the same time the meanness of their own natures who think the messiah or gods messenger must first prove his own commission by an act of power whereas a new revelation of moral forces could not be invented by all generations and an act of power much more probably argues an alliance with the devil i should gloomily suspect a man who came forward as a magician suppose the gospels written thirty years after the events and by ignorant superstitious men who have adopted the fables that old women had surrounded christ with how does this supposition vitiate the report of christs parables but on the other hand they could no more have invented the parables than a man alleging a diamondmine could invent a diamond as attestation the parables prove themselves xxii let him come down from the cross now this is exceedingly well worth consideration i know not at all whether what i am going to say has been said already life would not suffice in every field or section of a field to search every nook and section of a nook for the possibilities of chance utterance given to any stray opinion but this i know without any doubt at all that it cannot have been said effectually cannot have been so said as to publish and disperse itself else it is impossible that the crazy logic current upon these topics should have lived or that many separate arguments should ever for very shame have been uttered said or not said let us presume it unsaid and let me state the true answer as if de novo even if by accident somewhere the darkness shelters this same answer as uttered long ago now therefore i will suppose that he had come down from the cross no case can so powerfully illustrate the filthy falsehood and pollution of that idea which men generally entertain which the sole creditable books universally build upon what would have followed this would have followed that inverting the order of every true emanation from god instead of growing and expanding for ever like a symbol it would have attained its maximum at the first the effect for the halfhour would have been prodigious and from that moment when it began to flag it would degrade rapidly until in three days a far fiercer hatred against christ would have been moulded for observe into what state of mind would this marvel have been received into any goodwill towards christ which previously had been defeated by the belief that he was an impostor in the sense that he pretended to a power of miracles which in fact he had not by no means the sense in which christ had been an impostor for them was in assuming a commission a spiritual embassy with appropriate functions promises prospects to which he had no title how had that notion not viz of miraculous impostorship but of spiritual impostorship been able to maintain itself why what should have reasonably destroyed the notion this viz the sublimity of his moral system but does the reader imagine that this sublimity is of a nature to be seen intellectually that is insulated and in vacuo for the intellect no more than by geometry or by a sorites any man constitutionally imperfect could come to understand the nature of the sexual appetite or a man born deaf could make representable to himself the living truth of music a man born blind could make representable the living truth of colours all men are not equally deaf in heart far from it the differences are infinite and some men never could comprehend the beauty of spiritual truth but no man could comprehend it without preparation that preparation was found in his training of judaism which to those whose hearts were hearts of flesh not stony and charmed against hearing had already anticipated the first outlines of christian ideas sin purity holiness unimaginable these had already been inoculated into the jewish mind and amongst the race inoculated christ found enough for a central nucleus to his future church but the natural tendency under the fevermist of strife and passion evoked by the present position in the world operating upon robust fullblooded life unshaken by grief or tenderness of nature or constitutional sadness is to fail altogether of seeing the features which so powerfully mark christianity those features instead of coming out into strong relief resemble what we see in mountainous regions where the mist covers the loftiest peaks we have heard of a man saying give me such titles of honour so many myriads of pounds and then i will consider your proposal that i should turn christian now survey pause for one moment to survey the immeasurable effrontery of this speech first it replies to a proposal having what object our happiness or his why of course his how are we interested except on a sublime principle of benevolence in his faith being right secondly it is a reply presuming money the most fleshly of objects to modify or any way control religion ie a spiritual concern this in itself is already monstrous and pretty much the same as it would be to order a charge of bayonets against gravitation or against an avalanche or against an earthquake or against a deluge but suppose it were not so what incomprehensible reasoning justifies the notion that not we are to be paid but that he is to be paid for a change not concerning or affecting our happiness but his xxiii is the human race on the down grade as to individual nations it is matter of notoriety that they are often improgressive as a whole it may be true that the human race is under a necessity of slowly advancing and it may be a necessity also that the current of the moving waters should finally absorb into its motion that part of the waters which left to itself would stagnate all this may be true and yet it will not follow that the human race must be moving constantly upon an ascending line as thus b a nor even upon such a line with continual pauses or rests interposed as thus illustration where there is no going back though a constant interruption to the going forward but a third hypothesis is possible there may be continual loss of ground yet so that continually the loss is more than compensated and the total result for any considerable period of observation may be that progress is maintained illustration at o by comparison with the previous elevation at a there is a repeated falling back but still upon the whole and pursuing the inquiry through a sufficiently large segment of time the constant report is ascent upon this explanation it is perfectly consistent with a general belief in the going forward of man that this particular age in which we live might be stationary or might even have gone back it cannot therefore be upon any priori principle that i maintain the superiority of this age it is and must be upon special examination applied to the phenomena of this special age the last century in its first thirty years offered the spectacle of a deathlike collapse in the national energies all great interests suffered together the intellectual power of the country spite of the brilliant display in a lower element made by one or two men of genius languished as a whole the religious feeling was torpid and in a degree which insured the strong reaction of some irritating galvanism or quickening impulse such as that which was in fact supplied by methodism it is not with that age that i wish to compare the present i compare it with the age which terminated thirty years ago roused invigorated searched as that age was through all its sensibilities by the electric shock of the french revolution it is by comparison with an age so keenly alive penetrated by ideas stirring and uprooting that i would compare it and even then the balance of gain in wellcalculated resource fixed yet stimulating ideals i hold to be in our favour and this in opposition to much argument in an adverse spirit from many and influential quarters indeed it is a remark which more than once i have been led to make in print that if a foreigner were to inquire for the moral philosophy the ethics and even for the metaphysics of our english literature the answer would be look for them in the great body of our divinity not merely the more scholastic works on theology but the occasional sermons of our english divines contain a body of richer philosophical speculation than is elsewhere to be found and to say the truth far more instructive than anything in our lockes berkeleys or other express and professional philosophers having said this by way of showing that i do not overlook their just pretensions let me have leave to notice a foible in these writers which is not merely somewhat ludicrous but even seriously injurious to truth one and all through a long series of two hundred and fifty years think themselves called upon to tax their countrymen each severally in his own age with a separate peculiar and unexampled guilt of infidelity and irreligion each worthy man in his turn sees in his own age overt signs of these offences not to be matched in any other fiveandtwenty periods of ten years each may be taken concerning each of which some excellent writer may be cited to prove that it had reached a maximum of atrocity such as should not easily have been susceptible of aggravation but which invariably the relays through all the subsequent periods affirm their own contemporaries to have attained every decennium is regularly worse than that which precedes it until the mind is perfectly confounded by the pelion upon ossa which must overwhelm the last term of the twentyfive it is the mere necessity of a logical sorites that such a horrible race of villains as the men of the twentyfifth decennium ought not to be suffered to breathe now the whole error arises out of an imbecile selfsurrender to the first impressions from the process of abstraction as applied to remote objects survey a town under the benefit of a ten miles distance combined with a dreamy sunshine and it will appear a city of celestial palaces enter it and you will find the same filth the same ruins the same disproportions as anywhere else so of past ages seen through the haze of an abstraction which removes all circumstantial features of deformity call up any one of those ages if it were possible into the realities of life and these worthy praisers of the past would be surprised to find every feature repeated which they had fancied peculiar to their own times meanwhile this erroneous doctrine of sermons has a double ill consequence first the whole chain of twentyfive writers when brought together consecutively reflect a colouring of absurdity upon each other separately they might be endurable but all at once predicating each of his own period exclusively what runs with a rolling fire through twentyfive such periods in succession cannot but recall to the reader that senseless doctrine of a physical decay in man as if man were once stronger broader taller etc upon which hypothesis of a gradual descent why should it have stopped at any special point how could the human race have failed long ago to reach the point of zero but secondly such a doctrine is most injurious and insulting to christianity if after eighteen hundred years of development it could be seriously true of christianity that it had left any age or generation of men worse in conduct or in feeling or in belief than all their predecessors what reasonable expectation could we have that in eighteen hundred years more the case would be better such thoughtless opinions make christianity to be a failure xxiv brevia short essays in connection with each other paganism and christianity the ideas of duty and holiness the pagan god could have perfect peace with his votary and yet could have no tendency to draw that votary to himself not so with the god of christianity who cannot give his peace without drawing like a vortex to himself who cannot draw into his own vortex without finding his peace fulfilled an age when lustre too intense i am much mistaken if mr wordsworth is not deeply wrong here wrong he is beyond a doubt as to the fact for there could have been no virtual intensity of lustre unless merely as a tinsel toy when it was contradicted by everything in the manners habits and situations of the pagan gods they who were content to play in the coarsest manner the part of gay young bloods sowing their wild oats and with a recklessness of consequences to their female partners never by possibility rivalled by men i believe and affirm that lustre the most dazzling and blinding would not have any ennobling effect except as received into a matrix of previous unearthly and holy type as to bacchus being eternally young the ancients had no idea or power to frame the idea of eternity their eternity was a limitary thing and this i say not empirically but priori on the ground that without the idea of holiness and unfleshliness eternity cannot rise buoyant from the ground cannot sustain itself but waive this and what becomes of the other things if he were characteristically distinguished as young then by a mere rebound of the logic the others were not so honoured else where is the special privilege of bacchus and she shall sing there as in the days of her youth hosea ii the case of pathos a person coming back to places recalling the days of youth after a long woe is quite unknown to the ancients nay the maternal affection itself though used inevitably is never consciously reviewed as an object of beauty duties arise everywhere but do not mistake not under their sublime form as duties i claim the honour to have first exposed a fallacy too common duties never did never will arise save under christianity since without it the sense of a morality lightened by religious motive aspiring to holiness not only of act but of motive had not before it even arisen it is the pressure of society its mere needs and palpable claims which first calls forth duties but not as duties rather as the casting of parts in a scenical arrangement a duty under the low conception to which at first it conforms is a rle no more it is strictly what we mean when we talk of a part the sense of conscience strictly is not touched under any preceding system of religion it is the daughter of christianity how little did wordsworth seize the fact in his ode stern daughter of the voice of god is not enough the voice of god is the conscience and neither has been developed except by christianity the conscience of a pagan was a conscience pointing to detection it pointed only to the needs of society and caused fear shame anxiety only on the principles of sympathy that is from the impossibility of releasing himself from a dependence on the reciprocal feelings the rebound the dependence on the resentments of others morals even ordinary morals could have little practical weight with the ancients witness the roman juries and roman trials had there been any sense of justice predominant could cicero have hoped to prevail by such defences as that of milo and fiftysix others where the argument is merely fanciful such a heingespinst as might be applauded with very good bravo in any mock trial like that silly one devised by dean swift the slowness and obtuseness of the romans to pathos appears priori in their amphitheatre and its tendency to put out the theatre secondly posteriori in the fact that their theatre was put out and also posteriori in the coarseness of their sensibilities to real distresses unless costumed and made sensible as well as intelligible the grossness of this demand which proceeded even so far as pinching to elicit a cry is beyond easy credit to men of their time the narrow range of the greek intellect always revolving through seven or eight centuries about a few memorable examples from the life of themistocles to zeno or demosthenes the grecian glories of every kind seem sociable and affable courting sympathy the jewish seem malignantly greek autarkeis but just as paganism respected only rights of action possession etc christianity respects a far higher scale of claims viz as to the wounds to feelings to deep injury though not grounded in anything measurable or expoundable by external results man you have said that which you were too proud and obstinate to unsay which has lacerated some heart for thirty years that had perhaps secretly and faithfully served you and yours christianity lays hold on that as a point of conscience if not of honour to make amends if in no other way by remorse as to the tears of oedipus in the crises i am compelled to believe that sophocles erred as regarded nature for in cases so transcendent as this greek nature and english nature could not differ in the great agony on mount oeta hercules points the pity of his son hyllus to the extremity of torment besieging him on the humiliating evidence of the tears which they extorted from him pity me says he that weep with sobs like a girl a thing that no one could have charged upon the man pointing to himself but ever without a groan i followed out to the end my calamities now on the contrary on the words of the oracle that beckoned away with impatient sounds oedipus from his dear sublime antigone oedipus is made to weep but this is impossible always the tears arose and will arise on the relaxation of the torment and in the rear of silent anguish on its sudden suspense amidst a continued headlong movement and also in looking back tears unless checked might easily arise but never during the torment on the rack there are no tears shed and those who suffered on the scaffold never yet shed tears unless it may have been at some oblique glance at things collateral to their suffering as suppose a sudden glimpse of a childs face which they had loved in life is not every greek ain of civilization an inheritance from a previous state not so high thus eg the romans with so little of christian restraint would have perished by reaction of their own vices but for certain prejudices and follies about trade manufacture etc and but for oil on their persons to prevent contagion now this oil had been i think a secret bequeathed from some older and higher civilization long since passed away we have it not but neither have we so much needed it soon however we shall restore the secret by science more perfect was christianity meant to narrow or to widen the road to future happiness if i were translated to some other planet i should say no for it raised a far higher standard ergo made the realization of this far more difficult yes for it introduced a new machinery for realizing this standard first christs atonement second grace but according to some bigots as jeremy taylor and sir thomas browne as cited by coleridge christianity first opened any road at all yet surely they forget that if simply to come too early was the fatal bar to their claims in the case abraham the father of the faithful could not benefit yesterday thursday october i think or the day before i first perceived that the first great proof of christianity is the proof of judaism and the proof of that lies in the jehovah what merely natural man capable of devising a god for himself such as the jewish of all eradications of this doctrine of human progress the most difficult is that connected with the outward shows in air in colouring in form in grouping of the great elements composing the furniture of the heavens and the earth it is most difficult even when confining ones attention to the modern case and neglecting the comparison with the ancient at all to assign the analysis of those steps by which to us christians but never before the sea and the sky and the clouds and the many intermodifications of these a b c d and again the many interactions of the whole the sun s the moon m the noon n s the breathless silent noon the gay afternoon the solemn glory of sunset the dovelike glimpse of paradise in the tender light of early dawn by which these obtain a power utterly unknown undreamed of unintelligible to a pagan if we had spoken to plato to cicero of the deep pathos in a sunset would he would either have gone along with us the foolish reader thinks why perhaps not not altogether as to the quantity the degree of emotion doubtless it is undeniable that we moderns have far more sensibility to the phenomena and visual glories of this world which we inhabit and it is possible that reflecting on the singularity of this characteristic badge worn by modern civilization he may go so far as to suspect that christianity has had something to do with it but on seeking to complete the chain which connects them he finds himself quite unable to recover the principal link now it will prove after all even for myself who have exposed and revealed these new ligatures by which christianity connects man with awful interests in the world a most insurmountable task to assign the total nidus in which this new power resides or the total phenomenology through which that passes to and fro generally it seems to stand thus god reveals himself to us more or less dimly in vast numbers of processes for example in those of vegetation animal growth crystallization etc these impress us not primarily but secondarily on reflection after considering the enormity of changes worked annually and working even at the moment we speak then again other arrangements throw us more powerfully upon the moral qualities of god eg we see the fence the shell the covering varied in ten million ways by which in buds and blossoms he insures the ultimate protection of the fruit what protection analogous to this has he established for animals or taking up the question in the ideal case for man the supreme of his creatures we perceive that he has relied upon love upon love strengthened to the adamantine force of insanity or delirium by the mere aspect of utter utter helplessness in the human infant it is not by power by means visibly developed that this result is secured but by means spiritual and transcendental in the highest degree the baseness and incorrigible ignobility of the oriental mind is seen in the radical inability to appreciate justice when brought into collision with the royal privileges of rulers that represent the nation not only for example do turks etc think it an essential function of royalty to cut off heads but they think it essential to the consummation of this function that the sacrifice should rest upon caprice known and avowed to suppose it wicked as a mere process of executing the laws would rob it of all its grandeur it would stand for nothing nay even if the power were conceded and the sovereign should abstain from using it of his own free will and choice this would not satisfy the wretched turk blood lawless blood a horrid moloch surmounting a grim company of torturers and executioners and on the other side revelling in a thousand unconsenting women this hideous image of brutal power and unvarnished lust is clearly indispensable to the turk as incarnating the representative grandeur of his nation with this ideal ever present to the asiatic and mohammedan mind no wonder that even their religion needs the aid of the sword and bloodshed to secure conversion in the spectator is mentioned as an eastern apologue that a vizier who like chaucers canace had learned the language of birds used it with political effect to his sovereign the sultan had demanded to know what a certain reverend owl was speechifying about to another owl distantly related to him the vizier listened and reported that the liberal old owl was

shocked at saying such things of clodia ibid p ibid p moral and practical morality that paleys principle does not apply to the higher morality of christianity is evident from this when i seek to bring before myself some ordinary form of wickedness that all men offend by i think perhaps of their ingratitude the man born to a year thinks nothing of it compares himself only with those above his own standard and sees rather a ground of discontent in his as not being than any ground of deep thankfulness now this being so odious a form of immorality should by paley terminate in excessive evil on the contrary it is the principle the very dissatisfaction which god uses for keeping the world moving how villainous the form these ings all faith in the great majority is and ought to be implicit that is your faith is not unrolled not separately applied to each individual doctrine but is applied to some individual man and on him you rely what he says you say what he believes you believe now he believes all these doctrines and you implicitly through him but what i chiefly say as the object of this note is that the bulk of men must believe by an implicit faith ergo decry it not you delude yourself christian theorist with the idea of offences that else would unfit you for heaven being washed out by repentance but hearken a moment figure the case of those innumerable people that having no temptation small or great to commit murder would have committed it cheerfully for halfacrown that having no opening or possibility for committing adultery would have committed it in case they had now of these people having no possibility of repentance for how repent of what they have not done and yet ripe to excess for the guilt what will you say shall they perish because they might have been guilty shall they not perish because the potential guilt was not by pure accident accomplished in esse here is a mistake to be guarded against if you ask why such a man though by nature gross or even swiftlike in his love of dirty ideas yet because a gentleman and moving in corresponding society does not indulge in such brutalities the answer is that he abstains through the modifications of the sympathies a low man in low society would not be doubtful of its reception but he by the anticipations of sympathy a form that should be introduced as technically as kants anticipations of perception feels it would be ill or gloomily received well now i when saying that a man is altered by sympathy so as to think that through means of this power which otherwise he would not think shall be interpreted of such a case as that above but wait there is a distinction the man does not think differently he only acts as if he thought differently the case i contemplate is far otherwise it is where a man feels a lively contempt or admiration in consequence of seeing or hearing such feelings powerfully expressed by a multitude or at least by others which else he would not have felt vulgar people would sit for hours in the presence of people the most refined totally unaware of their superiority for the same reason that most people if assenting to the praise of the lords prayer would do so hypercritically because its real and chief beauties are negative not only is it false that my understanding is no measure or rule for another man but of necessity it is so and every step i take towards truth for myself is a step made on behalf of every other man we doubt if the world in the sense of a synthesis of action the procession and carrying out of ends and purposes could consist with the greek antiworld in a religious sense men who divide all into pious people and next to devils see in such a state of evil the natural tendency as in all other monstrous evils which this must be if an evil at all to correction and redress but now assume a man sober honourable cheerful healthy active occupied all day long in toilsome duties or what he believes duties for ends not selfish this man has never had a thought of death hell etc and looking abroad on those who dwell in such contemplations he regards them sincerely not unkindly or with contempt partially he respects them but he looks on them as under a monstrous delusion in a fever in a panic as in a case of broken equilibrium now he is right and moreover secondly two other feelings or suspicions come on of hypocrisy of the violation of inner shame in publishing the most awful private feelings the tendency of a good fortune inherited i know not that any man has reason to wish a sufficient patrimonial estate for his son much to have something so as to start with an advantage but the natural consequence of having a full fortune is to become idle and vapid for on asking what a young man has that he can employ himself upon the answer would be oh why those pursuits which presuppose solitude at once you feel this to be hollow nonsense not one man in ten thousand has powers to turn solitude into a blessing they care not eg for geometry and the cause is chiefly that they have been ill taught in geometry and the effect is that geometry must and will languish if treated as a mere amateur pursuit so of any other secondly yet of englishmen i must say that beyond all nations a man so situated does not in fact become idle he it is and his class that discharge the public business of each county or district thirdly and in the view were there no other one sees at once the use of foxhunting let it be as boisterous as you please is it not better to be boisterous than gossipridden eavesdropping seeking aliment for the spirits in the petty scandal of the neighbourhood he the times declares that the poorest artisan has a greater stake than they the landed interest in the prosperity of the country and is consequently more likely to give sound advice his exposition of the intimate connection existing between the welfare of the poor workman and the welfare of the country is both just and admirable but he manifestly underrates the corresponding relations of the landowners and wholly omits to show even if the artisans state were the greatest how his opinions are likely to be most valuable to suppose that a man is necessarily the best judge in whatever concerns him most is a sad nonsequitur for if selfinterest ensured wisdom no one would ever go wrong in anything every man would be his own minister and every invalid would be his own best physician the wounded limbs of the community are the best judges of the pain they suffer but it is the wise heads of the community that best can apply a remedy that best can cure the wound without causing it to break out in another quarter poverty is blind but the upper classes education has enlightened and habit made foreseeing we live in times great from the events and little from the character of the actors every month summons us to the spectacle of some new perfidy in the leaders of parties and the most conspicuous public servants and the profligacy which we charge upon the statesmen of the seventeenth century has revolved in full measure upon our own days justifications of novels the two following justifications of novels occur to me firstly that if some dreadful crisis awaited a ship of passengers at the line where equally the danger was mysterious and multiform the safety mysterious and multiform how monstrous if a man should say to a lady what are you reading oh im reading about our dreadful crisis now so near and he should answer oh nonsense read something to improve your mind read about alexander the great about spurius ahala about caius gracchus or if you please tiberius but just such nonsense it is when people ridicule reading romances in which the great event of the fiction is the real great event of a female life there are others you say she loses a child yes thats a great event but that arises out of this vast equinoctial event secondly as all things are predisposed to the natures which must be surrounded by them so we may see that the element of social evolution of character manners caprices etc has been adapted to the vast mass of human minds it is a mean element you say the revelations of albert smith dickens etc are essentially mean vulgar plebeian not only in an aristocratic sense but also in a philosophical sense true but the minds that are to live and move in it are also mean essentially mean nothing grand in them yes doubtless in the veriest grub as to capacity but the capacity is undeveloped ergo as to the intrigue or fable and as to the conduct or evolution of this fable novels must be the chief natural resource of woman moral certainty as that a child of two years or under is not party to a plot now this would allow a shade of doubt a child so old might cry out or give notice this monstrous representation that the great war with france had for its object to prevent napoleon from sitting on the throne of france which recently in contempt of all truth and commonsense i have so repeatedly seen advanced throws a man profoundly on the question of what was the object of that war surely in so far as we are concerned the matter was settled at amiens in the very first year of the century december napoleon had been suffered by the unsteady public opinion of france abhorring a master and yet sensible that for the chief conscious necessity of france viz a developer of her latent martial powers she must look for a master or else have her powers squandered to mount the consular throne he lived he could live only by victorious war most perilous was the prospect for england in the path which not napoleon but france was now preparing to tread and which was the path of napoleon no otherwise than that he was the tool of france was that servitor who must gratify her grand infirmity or else be rapidly extinguished himself unhappily for herself england was the main counterchampion the course of honour left to england was too fatally the course of resistance resistance to what to napoleon personally not at all but to napoleon as pledged by his destiny to the prosecution of a french conquering policy that personally england had no hostility to napoleon is settled by the fact that she had at amiens cheerfully conceded the superior power under what title would have been the most childish of demurs that by act she never conceded the title of emperor was the mere natural diplomatic result of never having once been at peace with napoleon under that title else it was a point of entire indifference granting the consulship she had granted all that could be asked and what she opposed was the determined war course of napoleon and the schemes of ultrapolish partition to which napoleon had privately tempted her under circumstances of no such sense as existed and still exist for russia this policy as soon as exposed and not before bitter insults to herself england resisted and therefore it is that at this day we live but as to napoleon as apart from the policy of napoleon no childishness can be wilder at some unlucky moment when the crown commanded unusual resources the de quinceys met with the fate ascribed perhaps fabulously to some small heavenly bodies asteroids or what i do not precisely know on some dark day by mistake perhaps they exploded and scattered their ruins all over the central provinces of england where chiefly had lain their territorial influence especially in the counties of leicester lincoln and rutland were found fragments of the vast landed estates held by these potentates when earls of winchester the hatred of truth at first dawning that instinct which makes you revolt from the pure beams which search the foul depths and abysses of error is well illustrated by the action of the atmospheric currents when blowing through an open window upon smoke what do you see sometimes the impression is strong upon your ocular belief that the window is driving the smoke in you can hardly be convinced of the contrary scarcely when five or seven minutes has absolutely rarefied the smoke so much that a booklettering previously invisible has become even legible and at last when the fact the result the experience has corrected the contradictory theory of the eye you begin to suspect without any aid from science that there were two currents one of which comes round in a curve illustration and effects the exit for the other which the window had driven in just as in the straits of gibraltar there is manifestly an upper current setting one way which you therefore conjecture to argue a lower current setting the other and thus redressing the equilibrium here the smoke corresponds to bits of chip or any loose suspended body in the gibraltar current what answers to the current of water is the air and if the equilibrium is kept up the reentrant current balances your retiring current and the latter carries out the smoke entangled in itself by the objection say of a child there ought to be a reentrant column of smoke which there is not for the air drives the smoke of the fire up the chimney and of its own contribution the air has no smoke to give or the augean stable may image it doubtless when the first disturbance took place in the abominable mess those acting would be apt to question for a moment whether it had not been more advisable to leave it alone moralists say nobody will attack you or hate you or blame you for your virtues what falsehood not as virtues it may be in their eyes but virtues nevertheless connect with kant the error of supposing tas parentum etc to be the doctrine of sin not for what you have done but for what you are not because in life you did forsake a wife and children did endure to eat and drink and lie softly yourself whilst those who should have been as your heartdrops were starving not because you did that so much is forgiven you but because you were capable of that therefore you are incapable of heaven immodesty the greatest mistake occurs to me now wednesday april th a girl who should have been unhappily conscious of voluptuous hours her you would call modest in case of her passing with downcast looks but why then is she not so that girl is immodest who reconciles to herself such things and yet assumes the look of innocence about women a man brings his own idle preconceptions and fancies that he has learned them from his experience far more to be feared than any depth of serious love however absorbing and apparently foolish is that vicious condition in which trifling takes the place of all serious love when women are viewed only as dolls and addressed with an odious leer of affected knowingness as my dear wink etc now to this tends the false condition of women when called the ladies on the other hand what an awful elevation arises when each views in the other a creature capable of the same noble duties she no less than he a creature of lofty aspirations she by the same right a daughter of god as he a son of god she bearing her eyes erect to the heavens no less than he low degree we see often that this takes place very strongly and decidedly with regard to men notoriously pleasant men and remarkably goodnatured which shows at once in what road the thing travels and if such a nature should be combined with what butler thinks virtue it might be doubtful to which of the two the tribute of kind attentions were paid but now seeing the true case we know how to interpret this hypothetical case of butlers accordingly visit the sins of the fathers etc this people pretend to think monstrous yet what else in effect happens and must happen to jews inheriting by filial obedience and natural sympathy all that antichristian hostility which prevailed in the age succeeding to that of christ what evil of suffering of penalties now or in reserve may be attached to this spirit of hostility follows the children through all generations case of timoleon whose killing of his brother might afterwards be read into x y z or into x a b according to his conduct either into murder or patriotism is a good illustration of synthesis to illustrate ciceros argument in pro clio as to the frequency of men wild and dissipated in youth becoming eminent citizens one might adduce this case from the word themistocles in the index to the grci rhetorici but i see or i fancy cause to notice this passage for the

harnessed to the car of human life on words and style there are a number of words which unlocked from their absurd imprisonment would become extensively useful we should say for instance condign honours condign treatment treatment appropriate to the merits thus at once realizing two rational purposes viz giving a useful function to a word which at present has none and also providing an intelligible expression for an idea which otherwise is left without means of uttering itself except through a ponderous circumlocution precisely in the same circumstances of idle and absurd sequestration stands the term polemic at present according to the popular usage this word has some fantastic inalienable connection with controversial theology there cannot be a more childish chimera no doubt there is a polemic side or aspect of theology but so there is of all knowledge so there is of every science the radical and characteristic idea concerned in this term polemic is found in our own parliamentary distinction of the good speaker as contrasted with the good debater the good speaker is he who unfolds the whole of a question in its affirmative aspects who presents these aspects in their just proportions and according to their orderly and symmetrical deductions from each other but the good debater is he who faces the negative aspects of the question who meets sudden objections has an answer for any momentary summons of doubt or difficulty dissipates seeming inconsistencies and reconciles the geometrical smoothness of priori abstractions with the coarse angularities of practical experience the great work of ricardo is of necessity and almost in every page polemic whilst very often the particular objections or difficulties to which it replies are not indicated at all being spread through entire systems and assumed as precognita that are familiar to the learned student writing to scholastic persons i should be ashamed to explain but hoping that i write to many also of the nonscholastic and even of the unlearned i rejoice to explain the proper sense of the word implicit as the word condign so capable of an extended sense is yet constantly restricted to one miserable association viz that with the word punishment for we never say as we might say condign rewards so also the word implicit is in english always associated with the word faith people say that papists have an implicit faith in their priests what they mean is this if a piece of arras or a carpet is folded up then it is implicit according to the original latin word if it is unfolded and displayed then it is explicit therefore when a poor illiterate man suppose a bogtrotter of mayo or galway says to his priest as in effect always he does say sir i cannot comprehend all this doctrine bless you i have not the thousandth part of the learning for it so it is impossible that i should directly believe it but your reverence believes it the thing is wrapt up implicit in you and i believe it on that account here the priest believes explicitly he believes implicitly modern is it not shameful that to this hour even literary men of credit and repute cannot for the life of them interpret this line from as you like it full of wise saws and modern instances a man as well read as mr theodore hook and many a hundred beside have seriously understood it to mean full of old proverbs the traditionary wisdom of nations and of illustrative examples drawn from modern experience nonsense the meaning is full of old maxims and proverbs and of trivial attempts at argument that

sets out with a proverb as for instance this that the mother of mischief is no bigger than a midges wing that proverb forms his major proposition in his minor proposition he goes on to argue that the trespass charged upon the particular prisoner before him was very little bigger than a midges wing and then in his conclusion triumphantly he infers ergo the prisoner at the bar is the mother of mischief but says the constable please your worship the prisoner is a man a hulking clodhopper some six or seven feet high with a strong black beard well that makes no odds rejoins his worship then hes the father of mischief clerk make out his mittimus the word instance from the scholastic instantia never meant example in shakespeares age the word modern never once in shakespeare means what it means to us in these days even the monkish latin word modernus fluctuated in meaning and did not always imply recens neotericus but in shakespeare never what does it mean in shakespeare once and for ever it means trivial inconsiderable dr johnson had too much feeling not to perceive that the word modern had this value in shakespeares acceptation practically he felt that it availed for that sense but theoretically he could not make out the why it means that said the doctor but feebly and querulously like one sick of the pip he added yet i dont know why dont you now we do the fact is dr johnson was in a fit of the dismals at that time he had recently committed a debauch of tea having exceeded his usual allowance by seventyfive cups so that naturally he had a curmurring in the stomach else he could not have failed to see what we are now going to explain with a wet finger everybody is aware that to be material is the very opposite of being trivial what is material in a chain of evidence or in an argument can never be trifling now therefore if you can find a word that will flatly contradict this word material then you have a capital term for expressing what is trivial well you find in the word immaterial all that you are seeking it is quite immaterial will suit mr toutss purpose just as well as it is really of no consequence of no consequence in the world to say in a law court that the objection is immaterial is otherwise to say that it is trivial here then is the first step to contradict the idea of material is effectually to express the idea of trivial let us now see if we can find any other contradiction to the idea of material for one antithesis to that idea will express as well as any other antithesis the counterpole of the trivial now clearly the substance of a thing the material out of which it is made is oftentimes of great importance by comparison with its shape fashion or mode it is of value in your eyes to know whether your family plate is in substance of gold or of silver but whether such a vessel is round or square ornamented with a wreath of acanthus or ivy supported by tigers or by fawns may be a trivial consideration or even worse for the fashion of your plate after it has once become obsolete may count against you for so much loss as something that will cost a good deal of money to alter here then is another contradiction to the material and therefore another expression for the trivial matter as against vacancy or the privation of matter yields the antithesis of material or immaterial substantial and unsubstantial matter as against form yields the antithesis of substance and shape or otherwise of material and modal what is matter and what is the mere modification of matter its variation by means of ornament or shape the word modern is therefore in shakespeare uniformly to be pronounced with the long o as in the words modal modish and never with the short o of moderate modest or our present word modern and the law under which shakespeare uses the word is this whatsoever is so trivial as to fall into the relation of a mere shape or fleeting mode to a permanent substance that with shakespeare is modish or according to his form modern thus a weak trivial argument or instantia the scholastic term for an argument not latent merely or merely having the office of sustaining a truth but urged as an objection having the polemic office of contradicting an opponent is in shakespeares idiom when viewed as against a substantial argument a modern argument again when cleopatra defending herself against the perfidy of her steward wishes to impress upon octavius that any articles which she may have kept back from the inventory of her personal chattels are but trifles she expresses this by saying that they are but such as we greet modern friends withal ie such as we bestow at welcoming or at parting upon the slightest acquaintances the whole stress of the logic lies upon the epithet modern for simply as friends had they been substantial friends they might have levied any amount from the royal ladys bounty kingdoms would have been slight gifts in her eyes and that would soon have been objected to by her conqueror but her argument is that the people to whom such gifts would be commensurate are mere modish friends persons known to us on terms of bare civility people with whom we exchange salutations in the street or occasional calls what now we call acquaintances for whom in shakespeares time there was no distinguishing expression another case we remember at this moment in alls well that ends well it occurs in act ii at the very opening of scene iii the particular edition the only one we can command at the moment is an obscure one published by scott webster and geary charterhouse square and we mention it thus circumstantially because the passage is falsely punctuated and we have little doubt that in all other editions whether with or without the false punctuation the syntax is generally misapprehended in reality the false punctuation has itself grown out of the false apprehension of the syntax and not vice vers thus the words stand literatim et punctuatim they say miracles are past and we have our philosophical persons to make modern and familiar things supernatural and causeless the comma ought to have been placed after familiar the sense being this and we have amongst us sceptical and irreligious people to represent as trivial and of daily occurrence things which in reality are supernatural and causeless that is not lying amongst the succession of physical causes and effects but sent as miracles by the immediate agency of god according to the true sense things supernatural and causeless must be understood as the subject of which modern and familiar is the predicate mr grindon fancies that frog is derived from the syllable greek trach k of greek batrachos this will cause some people to smile and recall menages pleasantry about alfana the man of orlando it is true that frog at first sight seems to have no letter in common except the snarling letter litera canina but this is not so the a and the o the s and the k are perhaps essentially the same and even in the case where positively and literally not a single letter is identical it is odd but undeniable that the two words may be nearly allied as mother and child one instance is notorious but it is worth citing for a purpose of instructive inference journal as a french word or if you please as an english word whence came that unquestionably and demonstrably from the latin word dies in which however visibly there is not one letter the same as any one of the seven that are in journal yet mark the rapidity of the transition dies a day has for its derivative adjective daily the word diurnus now the old roman pronunciation of diu was exactly the same as gio both being pronounced as our english jorn here in a moment we see the whole giorno a day was not derived directly from dies but secondarily through diurnus then followed giornal for a diary or register of a day and from that to french as also of course the english journal but the moral is that when to the eye no letter is the same may it not be so to the ear already the di of dies anticipates and enfolds the giorno mr grindon justly remarks upon the tendency in many instances of the german ss to reappear in english forms as t thus heiss hot fuss foot etc these are mr grindons own examples and a striking confirmation occurs in the old english hight used for he was called and again for the participle called and again in the met romanus for i was called lorde he saide i highth segramour now the german is heissen to be called and this is a tendency hidden in many long ages as for instance in greek every person must remember the transition of greek tt and greek ss as in greek thatt greek thass on pronunciation and spelling if we are to surrender the old vernacular sound of the e in certain situations to a ridiculous criticism of the eye and in defiance of the protests rising up clamorously from every quarter of old english scholarship let us at least know to what we surrender what letter is to usurp the vacant seat what letter retorts the purist why an e to be sure an e and do you call that an e do you pronounce ten as if it were written tun or men as if written mun the der in derby supposing it tolerable at all to alter its present legitimate sound ought then to be pronounced as the der in the irish name derry not as dur and the ber in berkeley not as bur but as the ber in beryl but the whole conceit has its origin in pure ignorance of english archology and in the windiest of all vanities viz the attempt to harmonize the spelling and the pronunciation of languages naturally it fills one with contempt for these derby purists to find that their own object the very purpose they are blindly and unconsciously aiming at has been so little studied or steadily contemplated by them in anything approaching to its whole extent why upon the principle which they silently and virtually set up though carrying it out so contradictorily driving out an a on the plea that it is not an e only to end by substituting and without being aware the still remoter letter u the consequence must be that the whole language would go to wreck nine names out of every ten would need tinkering london for instance no more receives the normal sound of the o in either of its syllables than does the e in derby the normal sound of the o is that heard in song romp homage drop nevertheless the sound given to the o in london cromwell etc which strictly is the short sound of u in lubber butter etc is a secondary sound of o in particular combinations though not emphatically its proper sound the very same defence applies to the e in berkeley etc it is the legitimate sound of the english e in that particular combination viz when preceding an r though not its normal sound but think of the wild havoc that would be made of other more complex anomalies if these purists looked an inch in advance glocester or gloucester worcester cirencester pontefract etc what elaborate and monstrous pronunciations would they affix to these names the whole land would cease to recognise itself and that the purists should never have contemplated these veritable results this it is which seals and rivets ones contempt for them now if such harmony were at all desirable whereas on the contrary we should thus be carrying ruin into the traditions and obliteration into the ethnological links of languages industriously in fact throwing up insuperable obstacles in the path of historical researches it would be far better instead of adjusting the pronunciation to the imaginary value of the spelling inversely to adjust the spelling to the known and established pronunciation as a certain class of lunatics amongst ourselves viz the phonetic gang have for some time been doing systematically here therefore i hope is one fixed point here there is anchorage the usage is the rule at any rate and the law of analogy takes effect only where that cannot be decisively ascertained the latin word felix the romans appear to me to have had no term for happy which argues that they had not the idea felix is tainted with the idea of success and is thus palpably referred to life as a competition which for romans every distinguished life was in fact apart from his city the roman was nothing too poor to have a villa or any mode of retirement it is clear that the very idea of roman life supposes for the vast majority a necessity of thick crowded intercourse without the possibility of solitude i for my peculiar constitution of mind to whom solitude has in all periods of life been more of a necessity almost than air view with special horror the life of a roman or athenian all the morning he had to attend a factious hustings or a court assemblies deliberative or judicial here only he was somebody and yet however somebody through others combining with one leader and many underlings like himself he also became a power but in himself and for himself after all he was consciously nothing when cicero speaks of his nunquam minus solus quam cum solus he is announcing what he feels to be and knows will be accepted as a very extraordinary fact for even in rure it is evident that friends made it a duty of friendship to seek out and relieve their rusticating friends on the distinction between rhetorica utens and rhetorica docens it was a perplexity familiar to the experience of the schoolmen that oftentimes one does not know whether to understand by the term logic the act and process of reasoning involved and latent in any series of connected propositions or this same act and process formally abstracting itself as an art and system of reasoning for instance if you should happen to say dr isaac watts the english nonconformist was a good man and a clever man but alas for his logic what can his best friend say for it the most charitable opinion must pronounce it at the best so so in such a case what is it that you would be understood to speak of would it be the general quality of the doctors reasoning the style and character of his philosophical method or would it be the particular little book known as the doctor his logic price s bound in calf and which you might be very shy of touching with a pair of tongs for fear of dimming their steel polish so long as your wifes eye was upon your motions the same ambiguity affects many other cases for instance if you heard a man say the rhetoric of cicero is not fitted to challenge much interest you might naturally understand it of the particular style and rhetorical colouring which was taxed with being florid nay rhodian nay even asiatic that characterizes that great orators compositions or again the context might so restrain the word as to force it into meaning the particular system or theory of rhetoric addressed to herennius a system which being traditionally ascribed to cicero is usually printed amongst his works here and in scores of similar cases lies often a trap for the understanding but the schoolmen evaded this trap by distinguishing between rhetorica utens and rhetorica docens between the rhetoric that laid down or delivered didactically the elements of oratorical persuasion as an art to be learned and rhetoric on the other hand as a creative energy that wielded these elements by the mouth of pericles in the year b c or by the mouth of demosthenes b c between rhetoric the scholastic art and rhetoric the heavenborn power between the rhetoric of aristotle that illuminated the solitary student and the rhetoric of demosthenes that ran along in rolling thunders to the footstool of artaxerxes throne oh these dear spindleshanked schoolmen they were people respected reader not to be sneezed at what signifies having spindleshanks synonyms a representative and a delegate according to burke are identical but there is the same difference as between a person who on his own results of judgment manages the interests of x and a person merely reporting the voice of x probably there never was a case which so sharply illustrated the liability of goodish practical understanding to miss to fail in seeing an object lying right before the eyes and that is more wonderful in cases where the object is not one of multitude but exists almost in a state of insulation at the coroners inquest on a young woman who died from tightlacing acting it was said in combination with a very full meal of animal food to throw

for friday january a passage occurs taken from le nord or journal du nord or some paper whose accurate title i do not know understood to be russian in its leanings which makes a most absurd and ignorant use of this word the allies are represented as addressing an argument to russia amounting i think to this viz that in order to test her sincerity would it not be well for russia at once to cede such insulated points of territory as were valuable to russia or suspicious to the allies simply as furnishing means for invasion of turkey and this argument is called a syllogism laid in wait

newspaper for saturday may no occurs the very worst case of exaggerated and incredible mixed silliness and vulgarity connected with the use of assist for help at the dinnertable that i have met with it occurs in the review of a book entitled the illustrated london cookery book by frederick bishop mr bishop it seems had enjoyed the office of cuisinier at the palace and among some of our first nobility he has by the way an introductory philosophy of cookery two cases occur of this matchless absurdity an ideal carver is described he after carving is as cool and collected as ever and assists the portions he has carved with as much grace as he displayed in carving the fowl further on when contrasting not the carvers but the things to be carved coming to neck of veal he says of the carver should the vertebr have not been jointed by the butcher you would find yourself in the position of the ungraceful carver being compelled to exercise a degree of strength which should never be suffered to appear very possibly too assisting gravy in a manner not contemplated by the person unfortunate enough to receive it genteel is the vulgarest and most plebeian of all known words accordingly and strange it is that the educated users of this word should not perceive that fact aristocratic people people in the most undoubted lite of society as to rank or connections utterly ignore the word they are aware of its existence in english dictionaries they know that it slumbers in those vast repositories they even apprehend your meaning in a vague way when you employ it as an epithet for assigning the pretensions of an individual or a family generally it is understood to imply that the party so described is in a position to make morning calls to leave cards to be presentable for anything to the contrary apparent in manners style of conversation etc but these and other suggestions still leave a vast area unmapped of blank charts in which the soundings are still doubtful the word genteel is so eminently vulgar apparently for this reason that it presents a nonvulgar distinction under a gross and vulgar conception of that distinction the true and central notion on which the word revolves is elevating but by a false abstraction of its elements it is degraded and yet in parts of this island where the progress of refinement is torpid and the field of vision is both narrow and unchanging in all that regards the nuances of manners i have remarked that the word genteel maintains its old advantageous acceptation and as a proof of this eminent and even revolutionary thinkers born and bred in such provincial twilight use the word as if untainted and hardly aware that it is flyblown among ourselves it is certain that a peculiar style of gossip of babble and of miniature intriguing invests the atmosphere of little townishness such as often entangles the more thoughtful and dignified of the residents in troublesome efforts at passive resistance or active counteraction in dealing with this matter mr wordsworth instanced northampton and nottingham but a broader difference could hardly be than between these towns and just as genteel remains the vulgarest of all words so the words simple and simplicity amongst all known words offer the most complex and least simple of ideas having made this deprecation on behalf of my own criminality in using such a word as genteel i go on to say that whilst northampton was and is i believe of all towns the most genteel nottingham for more than two centuries has been the most insurrectionary and in a scarlet excess democratic nottingham in fact has always resembled the alexandria of ancient days whilst northampton could not be other than aristocratic as the centre of a county more thickly gemmed by the ancestral seats of our nobility than any beside in the island norwich again though a seat of manufacturing industry has always been modified considerably by a literary body of residents mein alter herr von stein pflegte dann wohl

that which causes and communicates terror not that which receives terror was undoubtedly in shakespeares age but especially amongst poets the preponderant sense accordingly i am of opinion that even in neutral cases such as are open indifferently to either sense viz that which affrights or that which is itself affrighted the bias in shakespeares interpretation of the feeling lay towards the former movement for instance in one of his sonnets oh fearful meditation where alas the true construction i believe to be not this oh though deriving terror from the circumstances surrounding thee suffering terror from the entourage of considerations pursuing thee but this oh thought impressing and creating terror etc a fearful agent in shakespeares use is not one that shrinks in alarm from the act but an agent that causes others to shrink not panicstruck but panicstriking miss edgeworth let me remark commits trespasses on language that are really past excusing in one place she says that a man had a contemptible opinion of some other mans understanding such a blunder is not of that class which usage sanctions and an accuracy not much short of pedantry would be argued in noticing it is

style is the disentangling of thoughts or ideas reciprocally involved in each other theological and religious religion under any of its aspects revealing or consoling religion in connection with any of its affinities ethics or metaphysics when selfevoked by a person of earnest nature not imposed from without by the necessities of monastic life not caught as a contagion from the example of friends that surround you argues some vast volcanic agency moving at subterraneous depths below the ordinary working mind of daily life and entitled by its own intrinsic grandeur to ennoble the curiosity else a petty passion which may put questions as to its origin in any case of religion arising as a spontaneous birth in the midst of alien forces it is inevitable to ask for its why and its whence religion considered as a sentiment of devotion as a yearning after some dedication to an immeasurable principle of that noblest temple among all temples the upright heart and pure or religion again as the apprehension of some mighty synthesis amongst truths dimly perceived heretofore amidst separating clouds but now brought into strict indissoluble connection proclaims a revolution so great that it is otherwise not to be accounted for than as the breaking out of a germ of the supernatural in man as a seed from a hitherto barren soil sin is that secret word that dark aporrton of the human race undiscoverable except by express revelation which having once been laid in the great things of god as a germinal principle has since blossomed into a vast growth of sublime ideas known only to those nations who have lived under the moulding of scriptural truth and comprehending all functions of the infinite operatively familiar to man yes i affirm that there is no form through which the infinite reveals itself in a sense comprehensible by man and adequate to man that there is no sublime agency which compresses the human mind from infancy so as to mingle with the moments of its growth positively none but has been in its whole origin in every part and exclusively developed out of that tremendous mystery which lurks under the name of sin yes i affirm that even in its dreams every christian child is invested by an atmosphere of sublimity unknown to the greatest of pagan philosophers that golden rays reach it by two functions of the infinite and that these in common with those emanations of the infinite that do not settle upon the mind until mature years are all projections derivations or counterpositions from the obscure idea of sin could not have existed under any previous condition and for a pagan mind would not have been intelligible sin it is not only that the infinite arises as part of the entire system resting on sin but specifically from sin apart from its counterforces or reactions viz from sin as a thing and the only thing originally shadowy and in a terrific sense mysterious stench i believe that under burkes commentary this idea would become a high test of the doctrine of the infinite he pronounces it sublime or sublime in cases of intensity now first of all the intense state of everything or anything is but a mode of power that idea or element or moment of greatness under a varied form here then is nothing proper or separately peculiar to stench it is not stench as stench but stench as a mode or form of sensation capable therefore of intensification it is but a case under what we may suppose a general kantian rule that every sensation runs through all gradations from the lowest or most obscure and nascent to the highest secondly however pass over to the contemplation of stench as stench then i affirm that as simply expounding the decay and altering or spoiling tendency or state of all things simply as a register of imperfection and of one which does not as ruins to the eye ever put on a pleasing transitional aspect it is merely disagreeable but also at the same time mean for the imperfection is merely transitional and fleeting not absolute first midst and last it is or can be grand when it reverts or comes round upon its mediating point or point of reaction the arrangement of my infinite must be thus after having expounded the idea of holiness which i must show to be now potent proceed to show that the pagan gods did not realize and did not meet this idea that then came the exposure of the pagan gods and the conscious presence of a new force among mankind which opened up the idea of the infinite through the awakening perception of holiness i believe that in every mode of existence which probably is always by an incarnation the system of flesh is made to yield the organs that express the alliance of man with the infinite thus the idea of mystery greek aporrta finds its organ of expression in the sensualities of the human race again the crime whatever it were and the eternal pollution is expressed in these same organs also the prolongation of the race so as to find another system is secured by the same organs generally that is for a million against a unit the awful mystery by which the fearful powers of death and sorrow and pain and sin are locked into parts of a whole so as in fact to be repetitions reaffirmations of each other under a different phase this is nothing does not exist death sinks to a mere collective term a category a word of convenience for purposes of arrangement you depress your hands and behold the system disappears you raise them it reappears this is nothing a cipher a shadow clap your hands like an arabian girl and all comes back unstop your ears and a roar as of st lawrence enters stop your ears and it is muffled to and fro it is and it is not is not and is ah mighty heaven that such a mockery should cover the whole vision of life it is and it is not and on to the day of your death you will still have to learn what is the truth the eternal now through the dreadful loom is the overflowing future poured back into the capacious reservoir of the past all the active element lies in that infinitesimal now the future is not except by relation the past is not at all and the present but a sign of a nexus between the two gods words require periods so his counsels he cannot precipitate them any more than a man in a state of happiness can commit suicide doubtless it is undeniable that a man may arm his hand with a sword and that his flesh will be found penetrable to the sword happy or not but this apparent physical power has no existence no value for a creature having a double nature the moral nature not only indisposes him to use his power but really creates a far greater antagonist power this god too great to be contemplated steadily by the loftiest of human eyes too approachable and condescending to be shunned by the meanest in affliction realizing thus in another form that reconcilement of extremes which st paul observed far from all created beings yet also very near a conviction that they needed a saviour was growing amongst men how in what sense saviour from what you cant be saved from nothing there must be a danger an evil threatening before even in fancy you can think of a deliverer now what evil was there existing to a pagan sin monstrous no such idea ever dawned upon the pagan intellect death yes but that was inalienable from his nature pain and disease yes but these were perhaps inalienable also mitigated they might be but it must be by human science and the progress of knowledge grief yes but this was inalienable from life mitigated it might be but by superior philosophy from what then was a saviour to save if nothing to save from how any saviour but here arises as the awful of awfuls to me the deep deep exposure of the insufficient knowledge and sense of what is peculiar to christianity to imagine some sense of impurity etc leading to a wish for a saviour in a pagan is to defraud christianity of all its grandeur if paganism could develop the want it is not at all clear that paganism did not develop the remedy heavens how deplorable a blindness but did not a pagan lady feel the insufficiency of earthly things for happiness no because any feeling tending in that direction would be to her as to all around her simply a diseased feeling whether from dyspepsia or hypochondria and one whether diseased or not worthless for practical purposes it would have to be a christian lady if something far beyond something infinite were not connected with it depending on it but if this were by you ascribed to the pagan lady then that is in other words to make her a christian lady already exhibition of a roman dialogue on sin what says the ignorant and unreflecting modern christian do you mean to tell me that a roman however buried in worldly objects would not be startled at hearing of a saviour now hearken roman saviour what do you mean saviour for what in good faith my friend you labour under some misconception i am used to rely on myself for all the saving that i need and generally speaking if you except the sea and those cursed northeast winds i know of no particular danger christian oh my friend you totally mistake the matter i mean saving from sin roman saving from a fault that is well what sort of a fault or how should a man that you say is no longer on earth save me from any fault is it a book to warn me of faults that he has left christian why yes not that he wrote himself but he talked and his followers have recorded his views but still you are quite in the dark not faults but the fountain of all faults that is what he will save you from roman but how i can understand that by illuminating my judgment in general he might succeed in making me more prudent christian judgment prudent these words show how wide by a whole hemisphere you are of the truth it is your will that he applies his correction to roman will why ive none but peaceable and lawful designs i assure you oh i begin to see you think me a partner with those pirates that we just spoke to christian not at all my friend i speak not of designs or intentions what i mean is the source of all desires what i would call your wills your whole moral nature roman bridling ahem i hope roman nature is quite as little in need of improvement as any other there are the cretans they held up their heads accordingly they had their fire institutions and that true institution against bribery and luxury and all such stuff they fancied themselves impregnable why bless you even marcus tullius that was a prosing kind of man and rather peevish about such things could not keep in the truth why cato my boy says he you talk and to hear you bribery and luxury would not leave one a stick to fight for why now these same cretans lord we took the conceit out of them in twentyfive minutes no more time i assure you did it cost three of our cohorts to settle the whole lot of them christian my friend you are more and more in the dark what i mean is not present in your senses but a disease roman oh a disease thats another thing but where christian why it affects the brain and the heart roman well now one at a time take the brain we have a disease and we treat it with white hellebore there may be a better way but answer me this if you are generally affected what right have you to bring as you are supposing a diseased brain to a sound one we romans are all sound sound as a bell then christian goes on to the history of the fall but the whole would be selfbaffled and construed away from want of sin as the antithesis of holiness why st paul and the athenians did not come to an understanding so again if you think that st paul had a chance with the athenians if he had it would tax his divine benevolence to see that he forbore to pursue it this attempt shows that he was under a misconception he fancied a possibility of preaching a pure religion what followed he was he must have been defeated that is practically else why did he not persist but his confutation was the factual confutation of experience it was no go that he found too surely but why i am sure that he never found out enough that he felt that under a strong instinct he misgave a deep deep gulf between him and them so that neither could he make a way to their sense nor they except conjecturally to his for just review the case what was the greek euangelion the good tidings which he announced to man what burthen of hope what revelation of a mystery of hope arising out of a deeper mystery of despair he announced a deliverer deliverer from what answer that from what why from evil you say evil of what kind why you retort did not the pagans admit that man was lying under evil not at all nothing of the kind but you are sure you have heard of such things very likely and now you are forced back upon your arguments you remember specially that evil as to its origin was a favourite speculation of theirs evil in its most comprehensive designation whence is it how came it now mark even to that extent viz the extent indicated by this problem the ancients had no conception of evil corresponding to no nor dimly approaching to a correspondence with ours they had no ineffable standard of purity how then any function of impurity they had no ineffable doctrine of pain or suffering answering to a far more realized state of perception and therefore unimaginably more exquisite how then could they raise a question on the nature or fountains of such pains they executed no synthesis and could execute none upon the calamities of life they never said in ordinary talk that this was a world of sorrow either apostrophizing a newborn child or a world of disappointment bemoaning a mature victim neither as in the anguish of meditative reflection nor in the prudence of extenuating apology the grand sanctus which arises from human sensibility perish empires and the crowns of kings etc first arose in connection with christianity life was a good life man was a prosperous being hope for men was his natural air despondency the element of his own selfcreated folly neither could it be otherwise for besides that it would be too immeasurable a draught of woe to say in one breath that this only was the crux or affirmation of mans fate and yet that this also was wretched per se not accidentally made wretched by imprudence but essentially and irrevocably so by necessity of its nature besides all this which has a lurking dependency upon mans calculations of what is safe he sees that this mode of thinking would leave him nothing yet even that extreme consequence would not check some honest or sincere or desperate minds from uttering their convictions that life really was this desperate game much to lose and nothing in the best case to win so far there would have been a dangerous gravitation at all times to the sad conclusion of paganism but meanwhile this dangerous gravitation was too dangerous and providence has deeply counteracted it by principles laid down in human nature i affirm that where the ideas of man where the possible infinities are not developed then also the exorbitant on the other field is strongly pulled up no ideals of evil can take place except under ideals of happiness that passeth all understanding no synthesis can ever be executed that is no annumeration of a b c into a common total viewed as elements tending to a common unity unless previously this unity has been preconceived because the elements are not elements viz original constituents of a representative whole a series tending to a summation unless that which is constituted that whole is previously given in idea since a and b and c could not be viewed as tending to a unity having no existence except through them unless previously that unity had existed for the regulation and eduction of its component elements and this unity in the case of misery never could have been given unless far higher functions than any which could endure paganism or which paganism could endure until the sad element of a diseased will is introduced until the affecting notion is developed of a fountain in man himself welling up the misery for ever no idea of misery could arise suffering is limited and transitory what pain is permanent in man even the deepest laceration of the human heart that which is inflicted by the loss of those who were the pulses of our hearts is soothed if never wholly healed by time one agency of time would avail for this effect were there no other the features of the individual whom we mourn grow dimmer and dimmer as time advances and pari passu the features of places and collateral objects and associated persons from whom reverberated these afflicting reminiscences of the lost object i return deliverer from what from suffering or misery but that was not acknowledged nor could have been we could see no misery as a hypothesis except in these two modes first as a radication in man by means of something else some third thing secondly as a synthesis as a gathering under a principle which must act prior to the gathering in order to provoke it the synthesis must be rendered possible and challenged by the priori unity which otherwise constitutes that unity as a metaphysical possibility evil was recognised through its unfathomable nature but this was because such a nature already presupposed a gods nature realizing his own ends stepped in with effect for the highest form the normal or transcendent form of virtue to a pagan was in the character of citizen indeed the one sole or affirmative form of virtue lay in this sole function viz of public of patriotic virtue since here only it was possible to introduce an additional good to the world all other virtue as of justice between individual and individual did but redress a previous error sometimes of the man himself sometimes of social arrangement sometimes of accident it was a plus which balanced and compensated a preexisting minus an action in regressu which came back with prevailing power upon an action in progressu but to be a patriot was to fulfil a call of the supererogatory heart a great nisus of sympathy with the one sole infinite the sole practical infinite that man prechristian ever could generate for his contemplation now therefore it followed that the idea of virtue here only found its realization virtue in fact was not derivatively or consequentially connected with patriotism it was immanent not transitively associated by any links whatever but immanently intertwisted indwelling in the idea therefore it happened that a man however heartsick of this tumid bladdery delusion although to him it was a balloon by science punctured lacerated collapsing trailed through ditch and mud under the rough handling and the fearful realities of life yet he durst not avow his private feelings that would have been even worse than with us it would have been to proclaim virtue and vice mere bubbles and chimeras he who really thinks so even we reasonably suspect of practical indifference unless when we believe him to speak as a misanthrope the question suppose to commence as to the divine mission of christ and the feeble understanding is sure to think this will be proved best by proving the subject of this doubt to have been a miracleworking power and of all miracles to have mastered not merely escaped or evaded death will be in his opinion the greatest so that if christ could be proved to have absolutely conquered death ie to have submitted to death but only to recoil from his power and overthrow it to have died and subsequently to have risen again will fortiori prove him to have been sent of god not so all and every basis of credibility must be laid in the moral nature where the thing to be believed is important ie moral and i therefore open with this remark absolutely zermalmende to the common intellect that from a holy faith you may infer a power of resurrection but not from a power of resurrection fifty times repeated can we infer a holy faith what in the last result is the thing to be proved why a holy revelation not of knowledge but of things practical of agenda not scienda it is essential that this holy should also be new original revelatum because else the divinest things which are connata and have been common to all men point to no certain author they belong to the dark foundations of our being and cannot challenge a trust faith or expectation as suspended upon any particular individual man whatever here then arises the greek prtontokinon thick darkness sits on every mans mind as to christs revelation he fancies that it amounts to this do what is good do your duty be good and with this vague notion of the doctrine natural is it that he should think it as old as the hills the first step to a saner view is to understand if a man has sense enough to reach so high that the subtlest discoveries ever made by man all put together do not make one wave of that atlantic as to novelty and originality which lies in the moral scheme of christianity i do not mean in the total scheme of christianity redemption etc no but in the ethics all ethics that ever greece refined or rome illustrated was and could be only the same universal system of social ethics ethics proper and exclusive to man and man inter se with no glimpse of any upward relationship now christianity looks upward for the first time this in the first place secondly out of that upward look christianity looks secondarily down again and reacts even upon the social ethics in the most tremendous way for my book on the relations of christianity to man s t c cites jeremy taylor etc for horrible passages on the gloomy state of the chances for virtuous pagans s t c in a more liberal generation is shocked and of course in his readers as in himself secretly he professes more liberal ideas aye but how is he entitled to these ideas for on further consideration it is not cicero only or epictetus only that would suffer under this law of christianity viewed in its reagency but also abraham david isaiah ezekiel hezekiah because how could they benefit by a redeemer not yet revealed nay by a redeemer not even existing for it is not the second person in the trinity not he separately and abstractedly that is the redeemer but that second person incarnated st paul apparently wished to smuggle this tremendous question into a fraudulent solution by mixing up abraham with others prechristian and christian into the long array of those whose faith had saved them but faith in whom general faith in god is not the thing it is faith in jesus christ and we are solemnly told in many shapes that no other name was given on earth through which men could be delivered indeed if not how is the messiah of such exclusive and paramount importance to man the messiah was as yet viz in abrahams time a prophecy a dim prophetic outline of one who should be revealed but if abraham and many others could do without him if this was a dispensable idea how was it in any case first or last indispensable besides recur to the theory of christianity most undeniably it was this that neither of the two elements interested in man could save him not god he might have power but his purity revolted power or doubtfully so but no will not man for he having the will had no power god was too holy manhood too unholy mans gifts applicable but insufficient gods sufficient but inapplicable then came the compromise how if man could be engrafted upon god thus only and by such a synthesis could the ineffable qualities of god be so coordinated with those of man suppose even that a verbal inspiration could have been secured secured observe against gradual changes in language and against the reactionary corruption of concurrent versions which it would be impossible to guarantee as also enjoying such an inspiration since in that case what barrier would divide mine or anybodys wilfully false translations from that pretending to authority i repeat what none is conceivable since what could you have beyond the assurance of the translator even which could only guarantee his intentions here is a cause of misinterpretation amounting to ruin viz after being read for centuries as if practically meant for our guidance such and such a chapter eg jael and sisera long proscribed by the noble as a record of abominable perfidy has at length been justified on the ground that it was never meant for anything else thus we might get rid of david etc were it not that for his flexible obedience to the clerus he has been pronounced the man after gods own heart is it not dreadful that at the very vestibule of any attempt to execute the pretended law of god and its sentences to hell we are interrupted by one case in every three as exceptional of the deaths one in three are of children under five add to these surely very many up to twelve or thirteen and many up to eighteen or twenty then you have a law which suspends itself for one case in every two note in the argument drawn from perishableness of language not only which i have noted is any language ergo the original chaldan greek etc perishable even for those who use it but also the vast openings to error which all languages open to translators form a separate source of error in translators viz the old one on my list that for them the guidance of inspiration has ceased else if not you must set up an inspiration separately to translators since if you say no not at all why which then the uncertainty of a foreign language even in a day contemporary with the original writer and therefore over and above what arises from lapse of time and gradual alterations on human progress oftentimes it strikes us all that this is so insensible as to elude observation the very nicest five years add nothing we fancy now invert your glass in englishmen are fighting for great abstract principles in ie years before or years they are fighting for persons for rival candidates in they could not have conceived more than an esquimaux can entertain a question about the constitution of lyric poetry or the differential principles of english and greek tragedy the barest approximation to questions that in are grounds of furious quarrel of bloody quarrel of extermination now then looking forward you would see from year to year little if any growth but inverting your glass looking back from the station of to you see a progress that if subdivided amongst all the years would give to each x as its quota ie infinity in fact it is like the progression from nothing to something it is creation all the body of the christian world would fly out in a rage if you should say that christianity required of you many things that were easy but one thing that was not yet this is undoubtedly true it requires you to believe and even in the case where you know what it is to believe and so far are free from perplexity you have it not in your own power to ensure though you can influence greatly your own power to believe but also great doubt for many and for all that are not somewhat metaphysical attends the knowledge of what is believing as to my mothers fancy that sir w jones had found in the east proofs of christianity having gone out an infidel to do her justice never once after she had adopted a theory of christianity did she inquire or feel anxious about its proof but to review the folly of this idea that christianity there where it reigned and was meant to reign should be insufficient in its proofs but that in a far distant land lurking in some hole or corner there should be proofs of its truth just precisely where these proofs were not wanted and again that these should be reserved for one scholar rambling into a solitary path where in a moral sense nobody could follow him for it is nobody this or that oriental scholar and we are sure that his proof was not of that order to shine by its own light else it would have resounded through england that for many hundreds of years christianity should have been received generation after generation should have lived under its vital action upon no sufficient argument and suddenly such an argument should turn up as a reward to a man in a country not christian for being more incredulous than his neighbours how impossible that fraudulent argument which affects to view the hardships of an adventurous life and its perils as capable of one sole impression that of repulsion and secondly as the sole circumstances about such adventures injures from the moment when it is perceived not the writer only no matter for him worthless liar how much he sinks in the opinion of his readers but the apostles now see the injury of falsehood suddenly it snaps and with a great reaction causes a jar to the whole system which in ordinary minds it is never likely to recover the reason it is not oftener perceived is that people read such books in a somnolent inactive state of mind onetenth coming to a subject on which they have already made up their minds and open to no fresh impressions the other ninetenths caring not one straw about the matter as reading it in an age of irreflectiveness and purely through an act of obedience to their superiors else not only does this hypocritical attempt to varnish give way all at once and suddenly with an occasion ever after of doubt and causing a reflection to any selfsufficient man suddenly coming to perceive that he has been cheated and with some justification for jealousy thenceforwards to the maker up of a case but also it robs the apostles of the human grace they really possessed for if we suppose them armed against all temptations snares seductions by a supernatural system of endowments this is but the case of an angel nay not of an angel for it is probable that when an angel incarnated himself or one of the pagan deities who was obliged first to incarnate himself before he could act amongst men or so much as be seen by men he was bound by all the defects of man ie he could choose only an ideal so far ideal as to elude the worst effects from vice intemperance etc the angel who wrestled with jacob probably did his best he was a stout fellow but so was the patriarch the very condition of incarnation and this because the mere external form already includes limitations as of a fish not to fly of a man not to fly etc probably includes as a necessity not as a choice the adoption of all evils connected with the nature assumed even the son of god once incarnated was not exempted from any evil of flesh he grew passed through the peculiar infirmities of every stage up to mature life would have grown old infirm weak had he lived longer was liable to death the worst of all human evils and was not we may be sure exempted from any one fleshly desire with regard to sex or enemies or companions but because that divine principle which also is in man yes in every man the foulest and basest this light which the darkness comprehended not and which in some is early extinguished but in all fights fitfully with the winds and storms of this human atmosphere in him was raised to a lustre unspeakable by his pure and holy will if the apostles were more celestially armed in any other sense than as we are all armed from above by calling forth our better natures if in any other sense than as sorrow arms us by purifying our natures as sorrowful reflection as meditation and earnest endeavours to resist our angry instincts which on the contrary how often do men obey under the vile pretence of being put by conscience on a painful duty then i say what were the apostles to us why should we admire them how can we make them models of imitation it is like that case of anarcharsis the scythian it does certainly incense a christian to think that stupid mahommedans should impute to us such childish idolatries as that of god having a son and heir just as though we were barbarous enough to believe that god was liable to old age that the time was coming however distant when somebody would say to him come sir or come my lord really you are not what you were its time you gave yourself some ease greek euphmi time indeed that you resigned the powers to which you are unequal and let a younger man take the reins none but a filthy barbarian could carry forward his thoughts so little as not to see that this son in due time would find himself in the same predicament now mark how christian lands would enforce this doctrine of unity by horrid coercions they hang drown burn crucify those who deny it so that be assured you are planting your cornerstone on the most windy of delusions you yourselves do not ascribe any merit to mahommed separate from that of revealing the unity of god consequently if that is a shaken craze arising from mere inability on his part a little a very little information would have cut up by the very roots the whole peculiarity of islam for if a wise man could have assembled these conceited arabians and told them great thieves you fancy yourselves to have shot far ahead of the christians as to the point of unity and if you had i would grant that you had made a prodigious advance but you are deceiving quarrellers it is all a word mere smoke that blinds you the christian seems to affirm three gods and even to aggravate this wickedness by calling one of them a son thus seeming to accept that monstrous notion that god is liable to old age and decrepitude so as to provide wisely against his own dotage but all this is an error these three apparent gods are but one and in the most absolute sense one the most shockingly searching influential and permanent blunder that ever has affected the mind of man has been the fancy that a religion includes a creed as to its greek aporrhta and a morality in short that it was doctrinal by necessity enactory and which has been the practical part of the blunder therefore exclusive because with our notion of a religion as essentially doctrinal the very first axiom about it is that being true itself it makes all others false whereas the capital distinction of the pagan was that given supposing to be assumed religions all must be true simultaneously all equally when a religion includes any distinct propositions offered to the understanding that is i think resting upon a principle or tendency to a consequence by way of differencing from facts which also are for the understanding but then barely to contemplate not with a power of reacting on the understanding for every principle introduces into the mind that which may become a modification a restraint whereas a fact restrains nothing in the way of thought unless it includes a principle it would rise continually in its exclusive power according to the number of those propositions at first it might exclude all but ten eight seven and so on finally as integrated it would exclude all if you ask on what principle a pagan believed his religion the question to him was almost amusing and laughable i will illustrate the case a man meets you who inquires in a hurried suppose even in an agitated way whether you met a tall man blind of one eye dressed in such a coloured dress etc now does it ever occur to you that the inquirer is lying lying wherefore should he lie or again if you say that your house stands under a hill that three out of four chimneys smoke and that you must indeed try some of the inventions for remedying this annoyance would any man in his senses think of speculating on the possibility that all this should be a romance or to come nearer in the kind of fact if a man represented his family fortune as having been bequeathed by a maiden aunt in the last generation would any man say otherwise than that doubtless the man knew his own benefactors and relatives best on this same principle when christ was mentioned as the divinity adored by a certain part of the jews who were by way of distinction called christians why should a roman object what motive could he have for denying the existence or the divine existence of christ even the idea of dissent or schism some jews worshipping some protesting would not much puzzle him something like it had occurred in pagan lands neptune and athene had contended for attica and under the slight inquiry which he would ever make or listen to when made by others he might wonder at the rancour displayed by the protesting party but he would take it for granted that a divinity of some local section had been unduly pushed into preeminence over a more strictly epichorial divinity he would go off with this notion that whereas the elder jews insisted on paying vows etc to a god called jehovah a section sought to transfer that allegiance to a divinity called christ if he were further pressed on the subject he would fancy that very possibly as had been thought found or imagined in the case of syrian deities or egyptian etc that perhaps christ might correspond to apollo as astarte to diana neptune of latium to the poseidn of greece but if not that would cause no scruple at all thus far it was by possibility a mere affair of verbal difference but suppose it ascertained that in no point of the symbols surrounding the worship of christ or the conception of his person he could be identified with any previouslyknown pagan god that would only introduce him into the matricula of gods as a positive novelty nor would it have startled a roman to hear that in india or any country large enough there should be a separate pantheon of many thousand deities plus some other pantheon of divinities corresponding to their own for syria but still more in one section of syrian palestine this would surprise him quoad the degree not quoad the principle the jew had a separate or peculiar god why not no nation could exist without gods the very separate existence of a people trivial as it might be in power and wealth argued a tutelary god but of course proportioned to the destinies at least and in part to the present size of the country thus far no difficulties at all but the morality aye but that would never be accounted a part of religion as well confound a science with religion aye but the greek aporrhta these would be viewed as the rites of adonis or of ceres you could not warn him from his preconception that these concerned only jews where therefore lodged the offence why here as personalities for such merely were all religions the god must be measured by his nation so some romans proposed to introduce christ into the roman pantheon but what first exploded as a civil offence was the demand of supremacy and the inconceivable principle set up of incompatibility this was mere folly a much more solemn significant and prophetic meaning than the common one may be secured to the famous passage in st matthew and thou shalt call his name jesus this injunction wears the most impressive character belonging to heavenly adjuration when it is thus confided to the care and custody of a special angel and in the very hour of inauguration and amongst the very birththroes of christianity for in two separate modes the attention is secretly pointed and solicited to the grand serpentine artifice which met and confronted the almost insurmountable difficulty besetting christianity on its very threshold first by the record of the early therapeutic miracles since in that way only viz by a science of healing which the philosopher equally with the populace recognised as resting upon inspiration from god could the magistrate and civil authority have been steadily propitiated secondly by the very verbal suggestion couched in the name jesus or healer at the most critical of moments an angel reveals himself for the purpose of saying thou shalt call his name jesus and why jesus because says the angel he shall heal or cleanse his people from sin as from a bodily disease thus in one and the same moment is suggested prospectively to the early christian who is looking forward in search of some adequate protection against the civil magistrate and theoretically and retrospectively is suggested to the christian of our own philosophizing days that admirable resource of what by a shorthand expression i will call hakimism the hakim the jesus the healer comes from god mobs must not be tolerated but neither must the deep therapeutic inspirations of god be made of none effect or narrowed in their applications and thus in one moment was the panic from disease armed against the panic from insurgent mobs the privileged hakim was marshalled against the privileged magistrate and the deep superstition which saw and not unreasonably a demon raging in a lawless mob saw also a demon not less blind or cruel in the pestilence that walked in darkness and as one magnet creates other magnets so also the hakim once privileged could secretly privilege others and the physical hakim could by no test or shibboleth be prevented from silently introducing the spiritual hakim and thus whilst thrones and councils were tumultuating in panic behold suddenly the christian soldier was revealed amongst them as an armed man crasez linfme i also say and who is he it would be mere insanity to suppose that it could be any teacher of moral truths even i who so much despise socrates could not reasonably call him linfme but who then is linfme it is he who finding in those great ideas which i have noticed as revelations from god and which throw open to the startled heart the heaven of heavens in the purity the holiness the peace which passeth all understanding finding no argument of divinity then afterwards does find it in the little tricks of legerdemain in conjuring in prstigia but here though perhaps roused a little to see the baseness of relying on these miracles and also in the rear a far worse argument against them he still feels uncomfortable at such words applied to things which christ did christ could not make nor wished to make that great which was inherently mean that relevant which was originally irrelevant if he did things in themselves mean it was because he suited himself to mean minds incapable of higher views wretches such as exist amongst us of modern days by millions on whom all his divine words were thrown away wretches deaf and blind and besotted to whom it was said in vain he that looketh upon a woman and what follows creating by a rod of divinity in mans heart a far superior ideal of the moral who heard with indifference his bless those who persecute you yes listened unmoved to his suffer little children to come unto me who heard with anger his in heaven there is neither marrying nor giving in marriage who abhorred his great doctrine that the counsels of god were not read in the events of things who slighted as trivial that prayer which a wise man might study with profit for a thousand years beasts wretches that turned away deaf and blind even as their sons turn away from these arguments of a truth far transcending all that yet had come amongst men but whilst trampling with their brutal hoofs upon such flowers of paradise turned in stupid wonderment to some mere legerdemain or jugglery the truth but what tongue can express what scale can measure the awful change in mans relations to the unseen world where there had been a blank not filled by anything not by any smoke or dusky tarnish of suspicion not filled by so much as any shadowy outline or vague phantom of possibility there was now seen rising like teneriffe or atlas say rather by symbolizing the greatest of human interests by the greatest of human visual objects like the snowy peaks of the himalaya peaks that by mens feelings are referred to the heavens rather than to the earth to the beings whose dwelling is no thick flesh rather than to men who have in no age succeeded in scaling them and who in their steps to those mighty thrones have heard nothing but dread crashes of sound again to fade or vanish the colossal form never the mighty idea of the truth where there had been nothing a blank a chasm there stood in solemn proportions a new object for man called the truth why was it called the truth how could such an idea arise many persons will be weak enough to fancy that as greek hopots was sometimes an artifice of rhetoric for expressing the exclusive supremacy of homer and as by a pure affectation and movement of dissimulation a man was called by the title of the orator his own favourite greek or roman thus affecting for the moment to know of no other for all such emphatic and exclusive uses of the imply a momentary annihilation of the competitors as though in comparison of the ideal exemplification these minor and approximating forms had no existence or at least not quoad hunc locum as the mountain in sicily would rightly indicate etna on the same artificial principle they may imagine rhetoricians to have denominated or if not to have had it in their power to denominate some one department of truth which they wished to favour as the truth but this conventional denomination would not avail and for two reasons first that rival modes of truth physics against mathematics rhetoric against music would contest the title and no such denomination would have a basis of any but a sort of courtesy or vicarious harmonious reality from the very first secondly that standing in no relation whatever to god every mode form division or subdivision of truth merely intellectual would gain nothing at all by such ostentatious arts algebra has been distinguished by glorious names so has the fancied knowledge of transmutation applied to the metals so doubtless has many a visionary speculation of magic so again has the ridiculous schwermerey of the rabbis in particular ages but those are as transient and even for the moment as partial titles as the titles of invincible or seraphic applied to scholastic divines out of this idea the truth grew next suppose x another martyrdom the difference between all human doctrines and this is as between a marble statue and a quick thing the statue may be better and it may be of better material it may be of ivory of marble and amongst marbles known to the ancient sculptors of several different kinds the most prized of silver gilt of hollow gold of massy gold and in all degrees of skill but still one condition applies to all whatever the material whoever the artist the statue is inanimate the breath of life is not within its nostrils motion spontaneity action and antagonist action the subtle watchwork of the brain the mighty laboratory of the heart vision sensibility selfpropagated warmth pleasure hope memory thought liberty not one of these divine gifts does it possess it is cold icy senseless dull inert matter let phidias have formed the statue it is no better let the purest gold be its material it is no worthier than the meanest model in clay to the valuation of the philosopher and here as in so many cases the great philosopher meets with the labouring man both meet with the little innocent child all have the same undervaluation of the statue and if any man values it preposterously it will be neither a great philosopher nor a labouring man with horny fists nor a little innocent and natural child it will be some crazy simpleton who dignifies himself as a man of taste as elegans formarum spectator as one having a judicious eye for the distinctions of form but now suddenly let one of the meanest of these statues begin to stir and shiver with the mystery of life let it be announced that something quick is in the form let the creeping of life the suffusion of sensibility the awful sense of responsibility and accountability ripen themselves what a shock what a panic what an interest how profound would diffuse itself in every channel such is the ethics of god as contrasted with the ethics of greek philosophers the only great thing ever done by greece or by greek philosophers was the ethics yet after all these were but integrations of the natural ethics implanted in each mans heart integrations they were but rearrangements redevelopments from some common source it is remarkable that the scriptures valuing clearness and fencing against misunderstandings above all things never suspend there is no greek epoch in the scriptural style of the early books and therefore when i first came to a text if when i was thunderstruck and i found that this belongs to the more cultivated age of hebrew literature and the swine because it divideth the hoof yet cheweth not the cud it is unclean unto you deut xiv now the obvious meaning is prim facie that the ground of its uncleanness was its dividing the hoof whereas so far from this to divide the hoof is a ground of cleanness it is a fact a sine qu non that is a negative condition of cleanness but not therefore taken singly the affirmative or efficient cause of cleanness it must in addition to this chew the cud it must ruminate which again was but a sine qu non that is a negative condition indispensable indeed whose absence could not be tolerated in any case but whose presence did not therefore and as a matter of course avail anything for the reverse case occurred in the camel hare and rabbit they do chew the cud the absence of which habit caused the swine to be rejected but then they divide not the hoof accordingly they were equally rejected as food with the swine we see the great jewish lawgiver looking forward to cases which actually occurred nearly five hundred years after as demanding a king and again looking still farther to cases eight hundred and a thousand years after their disobedience and rebellion to god now many will think that it must have been an easy thing for any people when swerving from their law and especially in that one great fundamental article of idolatry as the jews so continually did and so naturally when the case is examined to always have an easy retreat the plagues and curses denounced would begin to unfold themselves and then what more easy than to relinquish the idolatrous rites or customs resuming with their old rituals to god their old privileges but this was doubly impossible first because men utterly misconceive the matter when they suppose that with direct consecutive succession the judgment would succeed the trespass large tracts of time would intervene else such direct clockwork as sin and punishment repentance and relief would dishonour god not less than they would trivialize the people god they would offend by defeating all his purposes the people they would render vile by ripening into mechanic dissimulation the wrath of god slept often for a long season he saw as one who saw not and by the time that his large councils had overtaken them and his judgments were fast coming up with the offenders they had so hardened themselves in error that a whole growth of false desires had sprung up and of false beliefs blind maxims bad habits bad connections and proverbs which found out a reconciliation of that irreconcilable truth with the foulest pollutions the victims of temptation had become slow even to suspect their own condition and if some more enlightened did so the road of existence was no longer easy error had woven chains about them they were enmeshed and it is but a faint emblem of their situation to say that as well may a man commence a habit of intoxication for the purpose of having five years pleasure and then halting in his career as the jews may contaminate themselves tentatively with idolatrous connections under the delusion that it would always be time enough for untreading their steps when these connections had begun to produce evil for they could not recover the station from which they swerved they that had now realized the casus foederis the case in which they had covenanted themselves to desist from idolatry were no longer the men who had made that covenant they had changed profoundly and imperceptibly so that the very vision of truth was overcast with carnal doubts the truth itself had retired to a vast distance and shone but feebly for them and the very will was palsied in its motions of recovery in such a state suppose it confirmed and now threatening towards a total alienation from the truth once delivered what could avail to save them nothing but affliction in the heaviest form vain it was now to hope for a cheaper restoration since the very first lightening of their judicial punishment would seem to them a reason for relapsing by seeming to argue that there had been two principles it was but a false alarm they would say after all affliction therefore was past all substitution or remedy yet even this case this prostration to the ground had been met for a thousand years by gods servants if i have shown that quickening spirit which diffusing itself through all thoughts schemata possible principles motives of sensibility and forms of taste has differenced the prechristian man from the postchristian if i have detected that secret word which god subtly introduced into this world kept in a state of incubation for two millennia then with the flames and visible agency of a volcanic explosion forced into infinite disruption caused to kindle into a general fire that word by which sadness is spread over the face of things but also infinite grandeur then may i rightly lay this as one chapter of my emendation of human knowledge the same thing precisely takes place in literature as in spiritual things when a man is entangled and suffocated in business all relating to that which shrinks up to a point and observe i do not mean that being conceived as a tent above his head it contracts but that viewed as a body at a distance it shrinks up to a point and really vanishes as a real thing when this happens having no subjective existence at all but purely and intensely objective he misconceives it just in the same way as a poor ignorant man misconceives learning or knowledge fancying eg like heylius senior that he ought to know the road out of the wood in which they were then entangled it is probable that adam meant only the unity of man as to his nature which also is meant by making all men of one blood similarly boeckh greek en genei which does not mean that gods and men are the same but that of each the separate race has unity in itself so the first man adam will mean the earliest race of men perhaps spread through thousands of years it is a violent case of prejudice this ordinary appeal of bossuet quont gagn les philosophes avec leurs discours pompeux p now how should that case have been tried thoroughly before the printing of books yet it may be said the gospel was so tried true but without having the power of fully gratifying itself through the whole range of its capability that was for a later time hence a new proof of its reality an analogy i have somewhere read that a wicked set of jews probably when rebuked for wickedness replied what are we not the peculiar people of god strange then if we may not have a privilege more than others to do wrong the wretches fancied that to be the people of god the chosen people implied a license to do wrong and had a man told them no it was just the other way they were to be better than others absolutely they would have trembled with wrath precisely the same idea i am sure lurks in many minds as to repentance it is odious to think of this making god the abettor and encourager of evil but i am sure it is so viz that because god has said he will have mercy on the penitent they fancy that as the chief consequence from that doctrine they may commit sins without anxiety though others not under the christian privilege would be called to account for the same sin penitent or not penitent but they such is their thought are encouraged to sin by the assurance that repentance will always be open to them and this they may pursue at leisure now if a man should say but my friends this means real penitence they would reply oh but we mean real penitence well if you do you must know that that is not always possible not possible then make them understand that they will roar with wrath and protest against it as no privilege at all the literal interpretation of the mosaic cosmogony is the very expression of a barbarian mind and people relying so far on magic as to make all natural process of generation or production impossible relying so far on natural processes as to make the fiat of supreme power evidently inapplicable it is exactly the minerva of the pagans draggled in her skirts idolatry it is not only a mere blind crotchet of isaiahs jeremiahs to ridicule idols utterly wide of any real imperfection but also it misses all that really might be bad the true evil is not to kindle the idea of apollo by an image or likeness but to worship apollo ie a god to be in some sense false belonging to a system connected with evil that may be bad but there can be no separate evil in reanimating the idea of this apollo by a picture i have observed many times but never could understand in any rational sense the habit of finding a confirmation of the bible in mere archologic facts occasionally brought to light and tallying with the biblical records as in the pharaonic and egyptian usages and lately in the case of nimrod a great collateral confirmation of ezekiel has been fancied but how supposing ezekiel to have recited accurately the dimensions of nineveh how should that make him a true prophet or supposing him a false one what motive should that furnish for mismeasuring nineveh the gospels appear to have been written long after the events and when controversies or variations had arisen about them they have apparently been modified and shaped to meet those disputes the sun stands still i am persuaded that this means no such incredible miracle as is ordinarily imagined the interpretation arises from misconceiving an oriental expression and a forcible as well as natural one of all people the jews could least mistake the nature of the sun and moon as though by possibility they could stand in a relation to a particular valley that the sun could have stood still in gibeon and the moon in ajalon since they viewed sun and moon as two great lights adequated and corresponding to day and night that alone shows that they did not mean any objective solstice of the hour for else why in ajalon naturally it would be a phenomenon chiefly made known to the central sanctity of that god whose miraculous interposition had caused so unknown an arrest of ordinary nature jerusalem was not then known it was jebus a city of jebusites and the fact which subsequently created its sanctity did not occur till more than four centuries afterwards viz on the threshingfloor of araunah but shiloh existed and horeb and sinai and the graves of the patriarchs and all those places would have expounded the reference of the miracle would have traced it to the very source of its origin so as to show not then only not to the contemporaries only but which would be much more important to after generations who might suspect some mistake in their ancestors as explaining their meaning or in themselves as understanding it what it really means i am persuaded is merely to express that the day was of all historical days the most important what do people never reflect on the greek to positive of their reading if they did they would remember that the very idea of a great cardinal event as of the foundation of the olympiads was as an arrest a pausing of time causing you to hang and linger on that time and the grandeur of this jewish waterloo in which god established possessions for his people and executed an earthly day of judgment on the ancient polluters through perhaps a thousand years of the sacred land already sacred as the abode and buryingplace of his first servants under a covenant was expressed by saying that the day lingered arrested itself by a burthen of glorious revolution so mighty as this great day of overthrow for remember this would not god have changed pharaohs heart so intractable by such a miracle had it been at all open to his eternal laws whereas if you say aye but on that account why grant even so much distinction to the day as your ancestor does answer it was the finalcause day the english church pretends to give away the bible without note or comment or which in fact is the meaning any impulse or bias to the readers mind the monstrous conceit of the protestant churches viz the right of private judgment which is in effect like the right to talk nonsense or the right to criticise sir john herschels books without mathematics is thus slavishly honoured yet all is deception already in the translation at many hundred points she has laid a restraining bias on the reader already by the division of verses already by the running abstracts over the prophets she has done this can the power adequated to a generation of minds or to a succession of many generations find its comprehension in an individual can the might which overflows the heaven of heavens be confined within a local residence like that which twice reared itself by its foundations and three times by its battlements above the threshingfloor of araunah of that mystery of that local circumscription in what sense it was effected in what sense not effected we know nothing but this by mere human meditation this profound difficulty we may humanly understand and measure viz the all but impossibility of reaching the man who stands removed to an extent of fifteen centuries but here comes in the unspiritual mind which thinks only of facts yet mark me so far rome by an augury of wicked gods stretched to a period of years yet how open to doubt in one sense not i am sure in any sense understood by man but i doubt not in the ominous sense intended changed in all things essential she was yet a mighty sceptered potentate for the world until her dependency on attilas goodwill and forbearance after christ added to b c complete the period but period for what for whom for a great idea that could not be lost the conception could not perish if the execution perished but next think of the temptation to mythus and finally of gods plan unrealized his conceptions unanswered we should remember that by the confusion introduced into the economy of internal divine operations there is a twofold difficulty placed between the prayer and the attainment of the prayer st the deflection slight though it may seem to the man from the state of perfect simplicity and of natural desire ndly the deflection of the object desired from the parallelism with the purposes now became necessary to god in order to remedy abnormous shifting of the centre by man and again in the question of the language of scripture i see the same illustration sir william jones in a fit of luxurious pleasuregiving like gibbons foolish fit as to the archbishop of carthagena praises the language of scripture as unattainable i say no this is hypocrisy it is no dishonour if we say of god that in the sense meant by sir william jones it is not possible for him to speak better than powerful writers can speak they have the same language as their instrument and as impossible would it be for apollonius or sir william jones to perform a simple process of addition better than an ordinary keeper of a shop in the schemata because in the original ideas god says indeed what man cannot for these are peculiar to god but who before myself has shown what they were as to mere language however and its management we have the same identically and when a language labours under an infirmity as all do not god himself could surmount it he is compromised coerced by the elements of language but what of that it is an element of mans creating and just as in descending on man by his answers god is defeated or distorted many times by the foul atmosphere in which man has thrown himself so in descending upon the mind unless by dreams or some language that he may have kept pure god is thwarted and controlled by the imperfections of human language and apart from the ideas i myself could imitate the scriptural language i know its secret its principle of movement which lies chiefly in high abstractions far better than is done in most parts of the apocrypha the power lies in the spirit the animating principle and verily such a power seems to exist and the fact derived from the holiness the restraints even upon the almightys power through his own holiness goodness and wisdom are so vast that instead of the unlimited power which hypocritical glorifiers ascribe to him by way of liphonour in reaching man exabundantibus in so transcendent a way that mere excess of means would have perplexed a human choice on the contrary i am persuaded that besides the gulf of years so as to hold on so as to hold hard and to effect the translation of his will unaltered uncorrupted through the violent assaults of idolatries all round and the perverse headstrong weakness of a naturally unbelieving people down to the time of christ from the time of moses there was the labour hardly to be effected and why i have always been astonished at men treating such a case as a simple original problem as to god but far otherwise it was a problem secondary to a change effected by man his rays his sun still descended as ever but when they came near to the foul atmosphere of man no ray could pierce unstained unrefracted or even untwisted it was distorted so as to make it hardly within the limits of human capacity observe the difficulty was in the human power to receive to sustain to comprehend not in the divine power to radiate to receive what was directed to it often i have reflected on the tremendous gulf of separation placed between man by his own act and all the divine blessings which could visit him this is illustrated by prayer for while we think it odd that so many prayers of good men for legitimate objects of prayer should seem to be unanswered we nevertheless act as to our prayers in a kind of unconscious hypocrisy as though to our sense they had been answered in some ineffable way and all the while our conduct to speak strictly lies outside all this and remains wholly uninfluenced by it these ideas of god have life only by their own inherent power yet what risk that jews should lapse into supposing themselves separately a favoured people by this very error they committed the rebellion against which they had been warned in believing that they only were concerned in receiving a supernatural aid of redemption thus silently substituting their own merits for the divine purposes all which did in fact happen but their errors were overruled else how could the human race be concerned in their offences errors or ministries the jews forgot what we moderns forget that they were no separate objects of favour with god but only a means of favour what occasion to argalbargal about why god did not sooner accomplish the scheme of christianity for besides that st possibly the scheme in its expansion upon earth required a corresponding expansion elsewhere ndly it is evident even to our human sense that none but the most childish eudamonist whose notion of happiness is that of lazy luxury would think of cramming men bidding them open their mouths and at once drugging them with a sensual opium as all blessing must be without previous and commensurate elevation to the level of that blessing rdly the physical nature of the evil to be undone was such as would not have been objectively would not have been but still less could it subjectively have been for the conception of man that dreadful mystery which it really is had the awful introversion been measured back by fewer steps thly and finally it seems at first sight shocking to say of god that he cannot do this and this but it is not so without adverting to the dark necessities that compass our chaotic sense when we ascend by continual abstraction to the absolute without entangling ourselves vainly in those wildernesses that no created intellect can range or measure even one sole attribute of god his holiness makes it as impossible for him to proceed except by certain steps as it would be impossible for a man though a free agent and apparently master as he feels and thinks of his own life to cut his throat while in a state of pleasurable health both of mind and body political etc sir robert walpole as to patriots was like a man who has originally from his nursery up been thoroughly imbued with the terror of ghosts which by education and example afterwards he has been encouraged to deny half he does disbelieve and under encouraging circumstances he does disbelieve it stoutly but at every fresh plausible alarm his early faith intrudes with bitter hatred against a class of appearances that after all he is upon system pledged to hold false nothing can be more ludicrous than his outcry and his lashing of his own tail to excite his courage and his wrath and his denial than his challenge of the lurking patriots in what he conceives the matter of frauds on the revenue he assaults them as if he saw them standing in a row behind the door and yet he pummels them for being mere men of the shades horrible mockeries had there been any truth in their existence surely so strongly as they muster by their own report some one or other of this fact should have given me warning should have exposed the frauds but no all are silent as the grave but here sir robert walpole is as much wrong as if doubting the value or power of methodist preachers he should make it the test of their useful existence that as often as a highwayman a footpad started out of the wayside from the other side should start a methodist preacher to reason with him and to convert him are the whigs less aristocratic than the tories not at all in tendency by principle they are the same the real difference is not in the creed in the groundwork but in certain points of practice and method he took his stand upon the truth said by me of sir robert peel might seem to argue a lower use of the truth but in fact it is as happens to the article the itself you say the guard speaking of a coach the key speaking of a trunk or watch ie the as by usage appropriated to every coach watch trunk so here the truth namely of the particular perplexity the sepoy mutiny will be best understood if you suppose the roman emperors from romulus to augustus from the alban fathers down to the ostrogoths the whole line of a thousand years crowded into two trunkmakers may be great men they clearly have the upper hand of authors whom all the world admits to be great men for the trunkmaker is the principal in the concern he makes the trunk whereas the author quite a secondary artist furnishes only the linings case of casuistry wraxall justly notices that errors like prince ruperts from excess of courage however ruinous are never resented by a country ergo the inference that prudence would be always if in byngs or lord st germans cases in a matter of doubt held to be bold fighting and yet in morals is that an allowable position personal confessions etc avaunt ye hypocrites who make a whining pretence according to a fixed rule of verbally uttering thanks to god for every chastisement and who say this is good for you so do not i being upright and god seeing my heart who also sees that i murmur not but if it were not good in the end yet i submit he is not offended that with upright sincerity i give no thanks for it and i say that unless a man perceives the particular way in which it has been good for him he cannot sincerely truly or so as not to mock god with his lips give thanks simply on an priori principle though of course he may submit in humbleness i do not believe that the faith of any man in the apparent fact that he will never again see such a person ie by being removed by death is real i believe that the degree of faith in this respect is regulated by an original setting or fixing of our nature quite unconscious to ourselves so again i believe that hope is never utterly withdrawn despair is never absolute and again i believe that at the lowest nadir the resource of dying as a means of escape and translation to new chances and openings is lodged in every man far down below the sunlights of consciousness he feels that his death is not final were it otherwise he could not rush at the escape so lightly indeed were his fate fixed immutably i feel that it would not have been left possible for him to commit suicide justice you say in the usual spirit of vanity y or x has the same degree of the spirit of justice as v this is easily said but the test is what will he do for it suppose a man to propose rewards exclusively to those who assisted at a fire then x and y suppose have equally seen that many did not assist even refused to do so but x perhaps will shrink from exposing them v will encounter any hatred for truth and justice by exposing the undeserving it is a foolish thing to say hard words break no bones how impossible to call up from the depths of forgotten times all the unjust or shocking insinuations all the scornful refusals to understand one aright etc but surely an injury is nothing to them for that may be measured made sensible and cannot be forgotten whereas the other case is like the dispute is he wrong as a poet compared with this is he wrong as a geometrician there need be no anger with the latter dispute it is capable of decision then again a heart so lacerated is required by christianity to forgive the lacerator hard it is to do and imperfectly it is ever done except through the unbuckling of human nature under higher inspirations working together with time instead of being any compliment it is the most profound insult the idea one can write something rapidly it is no homage to the writer it is villainous insensibility to the written two subjects of stories occur to me for my arabian tales founded on the story of the minyas treasurehouse at orchomenus another of an abbess who was such by dispensation but had been married her accomplished son succeeds in carrying off a nun she labours for the discovery and punishment of the unknown criminal till she learns who he is then parting from him for ever in the early dawn she sacrificing to a love that for her was to produce only hatred and the total destruction of the total hopes of her ageing life splendide mendax and the more angel she i find the double effect as the reason of my now reading again with profit every book however often read in earlier times that by and through my greater knowledge and the more numerous questions growing out of that knowledge i have deeper interest and by and through this deeper interest i have a value put upon those questions and i have other questions supervening through the interest alone the interest is incarnated in the wider knowledge the knowledge is incarnated in the interest or at least the curiosity and questions upon trying to imprint upon my memory that at such a period the argives ceased to be called pelasgi and were henceforward called danai i felt how impracticable and doubtless in their degree injurious for though an infinitesimal injury only as regards any single act doubtless yet per se by tendency doubtless all blank efforts of the memory unsupported by the understanding are bad must be any violent efforts of the memory not falling in with a previous preparedness music i am satisfied that music involves a far greater mystery than we are aware of it is that universal language which binds together all creatures and binds them by a profounder part of their nature than anything merely intellectual ever could it is remarkable as proving to me the delibility of caste that the sudras of central india during its vast confusions under the mahrattas have endeavoured to pass themselves for descendants of the kshatriyas or warrior caste by assuming the sacred thread also assumed by the rajpoots and also by some of the sikhs i never see a vast crowd of faces at theatres races reviews but one thing makes them sublime to me the fact that all these people have to die strange it is that this multitude of people so many of them intellectually but also which is worse morally blind are without forethought or sense of the realities of life though i love fun eternal jesting buffoonery punning absolutely kills me such things derive all their value from being made to intervene well with other things this is curious shame pain and poverty shall i endure when ropes or opium can my ease procure this offends nobody not till you say ill buy a rope but now when moneys gone and i no debts can pay selfmurder is an honourable way though the same essentially this shocks all men i have in the course of my misfortunes fasted for thirty years a dreadful fate if it had been to come but being past it is lawful to regard it with satisfaction as having like all fasting and mortification sharpened to an excruciating degree my

is illustrative of h street i confess myself wholly at a loss to comprehend the objections of the westminster reviewer and even of my friend dr nichol to my commentary on the strange appearance in orion the reviewer says that this appearance on which he seems to find my language incomprehensible had been dispersed by lord rosses telescope true or at least so i hear but for all this it was originally created by that telescope it was in the interval between the first report and the subsequent reports from lord rosses telescope that i made my commentary but in the case of contradiction between two reports more accurate report i have not as regards the reviewer there had been no time for this because the book which he reviews is a simple reprint in america which he knows i had had no opportunity of revising but dr nichol perplexes me that a new stage of progress had altered the appearances as doubtless further stages will alter them concerns me nothing though referring to a coming republication for both alike apparently misunderstood the case as though it required a real phenomenon for its basis to understand the matter as it really is i beg to state this case wordsworth in at least four different places one being in the fourth book of the excursion three others in sonnets describes most impressive appearances amongst the clouds a monster for instance with a bellhanging air a dragon agape to swallow a golden spear and various others of affecting beauty would it have been any just rebuke to wordsworth if some friend had written to him i regret most sincerely to say that

political economy embodying every doctrine and numbering them which i have amended or repositioned and introduce them thus in a letter to the politicoeconomical society gentlemen certain ideas fundamental to political economy i presented in a book in the endeavour to effect a certain purpose these were too much intermingled with less elementary ideas in consequence of my defective selfcommand from a dreadful nervous idea and thus by interweaving they were overlapped and lost but i am not disposed to submit to that wrong i affirm steadily that the foundations of political economy are rotten and crazy i defy and taking up my stand as a scholar of aristotle i defy all men to gainsay the following exposures of folly one or any of them and when i show the darkness all round the very base of the hill all readers may judge how great is that darkness or shall i introduce them as a chapter in my logic pagan literature we must never forget that it is not impar merely but also dispar and such is its value in this light that i protest five hundred kings ransoms nay any sum conceivable as a common contribution from all nations would not be too much for the infinite treasure of the greek tragic drama alone is it superior to our own no nor so far as capable of collation not by many degrees approaching to it and were the case therefore one merely of degrees there would be no room for the pleasure i express but it shows us the ultimatum of the human mind mutilated and castrated of its infinities and what is worse of its moral infinities you must imagine not only everything which there is dreadful in fact but everything which there is mysterious to the imagination in the pariah condition before you can approach the heracleid yet even with this pariah how poorly do most men conceive it as nothing more than a civil a police an economic affair valckenaer an admirable greek scholar was not a man of fine understanding nor to say the truth was porson indeed it is remarkable how mean vulgar and uncapacious has been the range of intellect in many firstrate grecians though on the other hand the reader would deeply deceive himself if he should imagine that greek is an attainment other than difficult laborious and requiring exemplary talents greek taken singly is to use an indispensable latin word instar the knowledge of all other languages but men of the highest talents have often beggarly understandings hence in the case of valckenaer we must derive the contradictions in his diatribe he practises this intolerable artifice he calls himself greek philenripideios bespeaks an unfair confidence from the reader he takes credit for being once disposed to favour and indulge euripides in this way he accredits to the careless reader all the false charges or baseless concessions which he makes on any question between euripides and his rivals such men as valckenaer it is who are biased and inflected beforehand without perceiving it by all the commonplaces of criticism these it is true do not arise out of mere shadows usually they have a foundation in some fact or modification what they fail in is in the just interpretation of these truths and in the reading of their higher relations the correggiosity of correggio was precisely meant for valckenaer the sophocleity of sophocles he is keen to recognise and the superiority of sophocles as an artist is undeniable nor is it an advantage difficult to detect on the other hand to be more homeric than homer is no praise for a tragic poet it is far more just pertinent praise it is a ground of far more interesting praise that euripides is granted by his undervalues to be the most tragic greek tragichotatos of tragic poets after that he can afford to let sophocles be greek homerichtos who after all is not greek homerichtutos so long as schylus survives but even so far we are valuing euripides as a poet in another character as a philosopher as a large capacious thinker as a master of pensive and sorrowtainted wisdom as a large reviewer of human life he is as much beyond all rivalship from his scenic brethren as he is below one of them as a scenic artist is the nile ancient so is homer is the nile remote and hiding its head in fable so is homer is the nile the diffusive benefactor of the world so is homer the neid it is not any supposed excellence that has embalmed this poem but the enshrining of the differential roman principle the grand aspiring character of resolution all referred to the central principle of the aggrandizement of rome the sublime of wrath is nowhere exhibited so well as in juvenal yet in juvenal pretty glimpses of rural rest infans cum collusore catello that is pretty there is another which comes to my mind and suggests his rising up and laying aside etc and shows it to be an occasional act and ergo his garden is but a relaxation amusement glances which the haughty eyes of rome threw sometimes gently and relentingly aside on man or woman children or the flowers herodotus is as sceptical as plutarch is credulous how often is now and at this time applied to the fictitious present of the author whilst a man arguing generally beforehand would say that surely a man could always distinguish between now and then historical etc growth of the house of commons the house of commons was the power of the purse and what gave its emphasis to that power simply the growing necessity of standing forces and the growing increase of war so that now out of twenty millions fifteen are applied to army and navy one great evil as in practice it had begun to show itself pressed with equal injustice on the party who suffered from it viz the nation and the party who seemed to reap its benefit this was the fact that as yet no separation had taken place between the royal peculiar revenue and that of the nation the advance of the nation was now st of james i approaching to the point which made the evil oppression and yet had not absolutely reached the point at which it could be undeniably perceived much contest and debate divided the stage of incipient evil from the stage of confessed grievance in spending upon a single fte james i might reasonably allege that he misapplied at any rate his own funds wise or not the act concerned his own private household yet on the other hand in the case of money really public the confusion of the two expenditures invited and veiled the transfer of much from national objects that could wait and were at any rate hidden from effectual scrutiny to the private objects which tempted the kings profusion when mr macaulay speaks so often of england sinking under this or that stuart to a thirdrate power he is anachronizing there was no scale of powers want of roads and intercommunication

otherwise only austria and spain and spain not till joined to austria and france as great powers that touched each other in many points had ever formed a warlike trio no quadrille had existed until the great civil war for life and death between popery and protestantism it was another great evil that the functions towards which by inevitable instincts and tendency of progress the house of commons was continually travelling not i repeat through any encroaching spirit as the court and that house of commons itself partially fancied were not yet developed false laws of men ie laws framed under theories misunderstood of rights and constitutional powers having as much distorted the true natural play of the organic manifestation and tendency towards a whole as ever a dress too tight or a flowerpot too narrow impeded the development of child or plant queen elizabeth therefore always viewed the house of commons as a disturber of the public peace as a mutineer and insurrectionist when any special accident threw it upon its natural function she spoke of state affairs and especially of foreign affairs as beyond their capacity which expression however must in charity be interpreted philosophically as meaning the range of comprehension consistent with their total means of instruction and preparation including therefore secret information knowledge of disposable home resources as known to the official depositaries of state secrets etc and not as the modern reader will understand it simply and exclusively the intellectual power of appreciation since with all her disposition to exalt the qualities of princely persons she could not be so absurdly haughty as to claim for princes and the counsellors whom interest or birth had suggested to them a precedency in pure natural endowments charles was a sincere believer but not an earnest believer of the roman catholic faith james was both sincere and preternaturally earnest the reformation this seems to show two things st that a deep searching and sagaciousfromafar spirit of morality can mould itself under the prompting of christianity such as could not have grown up under paganism for it was the abominations in point of morality en fait de moralit indulgences the confessional absolution the prevalence of a mere ritual the usurpation of forms these it was which rome treated violently and if she draw in her horns for the present still upon any occasion offering upon the cloud of peril passing away clearly she would renew her conduct it was a tendency violently and inevitably belonging to the roman polity combined with the roman interest unless perhaps as permanently controlled by a counterforce ndly the synthesis of this curative force is by apposition of parts separately hardly conscious of the danger or even of their own act for we cannot suppose the vast body of opposition put forward was so under direct conscious appreciation of the evil and by an adequate counteraction doubtless it was by sympathy with others having better information these last burned more vividly as the evil was fiercer that more vivid sympathy drew increase of supporters memorandum in my historical sketches not to forget the period of woe anterior to the siege of jerusalem which josephus describes as occurring in all the grecian cities but which is so unaccountably overlooked by historians the rule is to speak like the foolish and think like the wise and therefore i agree to call our worthy old mother little our little island as that seems to be the prevailing notion otherwise i myself consider great britain rather a tall island a man is not called short because some few of his countrymen happen to be a trifle taller and really i know but of two islands among tens of thousands counted up by gazetteers on our planet that are taller and i fancy with such figures as theirs they are neither of them likely to think of any rivalship with our dear old mother what island for instance would choose to be such a great fat beast as borneo as broad as she is long with no apology for a waist talk of lacing too tight indeed im sure borneo does not injure herself in that way now our mother though shes old and has gone through a world of trouble in her time is as jimp about the waist as a young lass of seventeen look at her on any map of europe and shes quite a picture its an old remark that the general outline of the dear creature exactly resembles a lady sitting she turns her back upon the continent no doubt and thats what makes those foreigneering rascals talk so much of her pride but she must turn her back upon somebody and who is it that should have the benefit of her countenance if not those people in the far west that are come of her own blood they say shes tetyy also well then if she is you let her alone good people of the continent shell not meddle with you if you dont meddle with her shes kind enough and as to her person i do maintain that shes quite tall enough rather thin its true but on the whole a bonny elegant dear old fighting mamma mora alexandrina note on middletons affected sneer a villa of ciceros where probably the usual sound heard would be the groans of tormented slaves had been changed for the cells of christian monks now mark what the hound middleton means is how shocking to literary sensibilities that where an elegant master of latinity had lived there should succeed dull lazy monks writing if they wrote at all in a barbarous style and dreaming away their lives in torpor now permit me to pause a little this is one of those sneers which paley and bishop butler think so unanswerable that we must necessarily lie down and let the sneer ride roughshod over us all let us see and for this reason reader do not grudge a little delay especially as you may skip it dr conyers ought to have remembered in the first place that the villa could not long remain in the hands of cicero another owner would succeed and then the chances would be that the sounds oftenest ascending in the hour of sunset or in the cool of the dawn would be the shrieks of slaves under torture by their own poor miserable fare contrasted with the splendour reeking around them these slaves had a motive such as our tenderlytreated often pampered servants can never know the strength of for breaking the seal of any wine cask from the anecdote told of his own mother by the wretched quintus cicero the foul brother of marcus it appears that generally there was some encouragement to do this on the chance of working down on the master that the violated seal had been amongst the casks legitimately opened for it seems that old mrs ciceros housewifely plan was to seal up all alike empty and not empty consequently with her no such excuse could avail which proves that often it did avail since her stratagem is mentioned as a very notable artifice what follows why that the slave was doubly tempted st by the luxury he witnessed ndly by the impunity on which he might calculate often he escaped by sheer weight of metal in lying like chaucers miller he swore when charged with stealing flour that it was not so but this very prospect and likelihood of escape was often the very snare for tempting to excesses too flagrant or where secret marks had been fixed besides many other openings there were according to the individual circumstances but this was a standing one for tempting the poor unprincipled slave into trespass that irritated either the master or the mistress and then came those periodical lacerations and ascending groans which seneca mentions as the best means of telling what oclock it was in various households since the punishments were going on just at that hour after when the gracious revolution of christianity had taught us and by a memento so solemn and imperishable no longer to pursue our human wrath that hour of vesper sanctity had come which by the tendency of the christian law and according to the degree in which it is observed is for us a type and a symbol and a hieroglyphic of wrath extinguished of selfconquest of charity in heaven and on earth now the monks it is supposable might be commonplace drones often however they would be far other transmitters by their copying toils of those very ciceronian works which but for them would have perished and pausing duly here what sense what propriety would there be in calling on the reader to notice with a shock the profanation of classical ground in such an example as this mark the strange revolutions of ages there where once the divine platos academus stood now rises a huge printinghouse chiefly occupied for the last two years in reprinting platos works why really plato himself would look graciously on that revolution master conyers but next the dullest of these monks would hear the gloria in excelsis oh how pitiful it is to hear b alleging against mahomet that he had done no public miracles what would it then alter your opinion of mahomet if he had done miracles what a proof how full how perfect that christianity in spirit in power in simplicity and in truth had no more hold over b than it had over any pagan pontiff in rome is clear to me from that so then the argument against mahomet is not that he wants utterly the meekness wants wants no that he utterly hates the humility the love that is stronger than the grave the purity that cannot be imagined the holiness as an ideal for man that cannot be approached the peace that passeth all understanding that power which out of a little cloud no bigger than a mans hand grows for ever and ever until it will absorb the world and all that it inherit that first of all created the terror of death and the wormy grave but that first and last she might triumph over time not these it seems by b are the arguments against mahomet but that he did not play legerdemain tricks that he did not turn a cow into a horse in which position b is precisely on a level with those arab sheikhs or perhaps mamelukes whom napoleon so foolishly endeavoured to surprise by chinese tricks aye all this is very well but can you make one to be in cairo and in damascus at the same moment demanded the poor brutalized wretches and so also for b it is nothing oh blind of heart not to perceive that the defect was entirely owing to the age mahomet came to a most sceptical region there was no semblance or shadow among the arabs of that childish credulity which forms the atmosphere for miracle on the contrary they were a hard fierce people and in that sense barbarous but otherwise they were sceptical as is most evident from all that they accomplished which followed the foundation of islamism here lies the delusion upon that point the arabs were evidently like all the surrounding nations they were also much distinguished among all oriental peoples for courage this fact has been put on record in the east indies where all the arab troops have proved themselves by far more formidable than twelve times the number of effeminate bengalese and mahrattas etc at aden where as rude fighters without the science of war they have been most ugly customers in algeria where the french with all advantage of discipline science artillery have found it a most trying and exhausting war well as they are now so they were before mahomet and just then they were ripe for conquest but they wanted a combining motive and a justifying motive mahomet supplied both these says he all nations are idolaters go and thrust them into the mill that they may be transformed to our likeness consequently the great idea of the truth of a truth transcending all available rights on the other side was foreign to mahometanism and any glimmering of this that may seem to be found in it was borrowed was filched from christianity literary the three greatest powers which we know of in moulding human feelings are first christianity secondly the actions of men emblazoned by history and in the third place poetry if the first were represented to the imagination by the atmospheric air investing our planet which we take to be the most awful laboratory of powers mysterious unseen and absolutely infinite the second might be represented by the winds and the third by lightning napoleon and lord byron have done more mischief to the moral feelings to the truth of all moral estimates to the grandeur and magnanimity of man in this present generation than all other causes acting together but how simply by throwing human feelings into false combinations both of them linked the mean to the grand the base to the noble in a way which often proves fatally inextricable to the poor infirm mind of the ordinary spectator here is napoleon simply because he wields a vast national machinery throwing a magic of celerity and power into a particular action which absolutely overpowers the genus attonitorum so that they are reconciled by the dazzle of a splendour not at all in napoleon to a baseness which really is in napoleon the man that never praised an enemy is shown to this vile mob by the light thrown off from the radiant power of france as the greatest of men he is confounded with his supporting element even as the jupiter olympus of phidias that never spared a woman in his lust seemed the holiest of deities when his rottenness was concealed by ivory and gold and his libidinous head was lighted up by sunbeams from above here is lord byron connecting in the portrait of some poor melodramatic hero possibly some noble quality of courage or perseverance with scorn the most puerile and senseless prone enough is poor degraded human nature to find something grand in scorn but after this arbitrary combination of lord byrons never again does the poor man think of scorn but it suggests to him moral greatness nor think of greatness but it suggests scorn as its indispensable condition wordsworth is always recording phenomena as they are enjoyed coleridge as they reconcile themselves with opposing or conflicting phenomena w ws social philosophy is surely shallow it is true the man who has a shallow philosophy under the guidance of christianity has a profound philosophy but this apart such truths as he who made the creature will allow for his frailties etc are commonplace invention as a characteristic of poets i happened this evening saturday august rd to be saying of w w to myself no poet is so free from all cases like this viz where all the feelings and spontaneous thoughts which they have accumulated coming to an end and yet the case seeming to require more to finish it or bring it round like a peal of church bells they are forced to invent and form descants on raptures never really felt suddenly this suggested that invention therefore so far from being a differential quality of poetry was in fact the polar opposite spontaneousness being the true quality tragedy i believe it is a very useful thing to let young persons cultivate their kind feelings by repeated indulgences thus my children often asked when anything was to be paid or given to any person that they might have the satisfaction of giving it so i see clearly that young boys or girls allowed to carry abroad their infant brothers and sisters when the little creature feels and manifests a real dependence upon them in every act and movement which matre prsente they would not have done which again seen and felt calls out every latent goodness of the elder childs heart so again here i have clipped out the case however feeding rabbits but above all the action upon womens hearts in the enormous expansion given by the relation to their own children develops a feeling of tenderness that afterwards sets the model for the world and would die away or freeze or degenerate if it were generally balked now just such an action has tragedy and if the sympathy with calamities caused to noble natures by ignobler or by dark fates were never opened or moved or called out it would slumber inertly it would rust and become far less ready to respond upon any call being made such sensibilities are not consciously known to the possessor until developed punctuation suppose an ordinary case where the involution of clauses went three deep and that each was equally marked off by commas now i say that so far from aiding the logic it would require an immense effort to distribute the relations of logic but the very purpose and use of points is to aid the logic if indeed you could see the points at all in this relation strophe antistrophe apodosis then indeed all would be clear but the six commas will and must be viewed by every reader unversed in the logical mechanism of sentences as merely a succession of ictuses so many minuteguns having no internal system of correspondence but merely repeating and reiterating each other exactly as in men guns horses timbrels baggagewaggons standards sheridans disputatiousness i never heard of any case in the whole course of my life where disputatiousness was the author of any benefit to man or beast excepting always one in which it became a storm anchor for poor sheridan saving him from sudden shipwreck this may be found in mr moores life somewhere about the date of and in chapter xiii the book is thirtyseven miles off which is too far to send for water or for scandal or even for extract though im fond of extract therefore in default of mr moores version i give my own the situation was this sheridan had been cruising from breakfast to dinner amongst jews christians and players men women and herveys and constantly in the same hackney coach so that the freight at last settled like the sandheap of an hourglass into a frightful record of costly moments pereunt et imputantur say some impertinent timepieces in speaking of the hours they perish and are debited to our account yes and what made it worse the creditor was an inexorable old jarvie who though himself a creditor had never heard the idea of credit a guinea might be owing and sheridan seldom remembering his purse had but a shilling which even in a court of irish law seemed too small a compromise to offer black looked the horizon stormy the offing and night was coming on whilst the port of consignment was now within thirty minutes sail suddenly a sight of joy was described driving before the wind on bare poles was a wellknown friend of sheridans richardson famed for various talent but also for an invincible headlong necessity of disputing to pull the checkstring to take his friend on board and to rush into fierce polemic conversation was the work of a moment for sheridan he well understood with this familiar friend how to bring on a hot dispute in three minutes it raged yardarm to yardarm both grew warm sheridan grew purple with rage violently interrupting richardson he said and these are your real sentiments richardson with solemnity and artificial restraint replied most solemnly they are and you stand to them and will maintain them i will said richardson with menacing solemnity and even mournfulness i will to my dying day then said sheridan furiously im hanged if ill stay another minute with a man capable of such abominable opinions bang went the door out he bounced and richardson keeping his seat pursued him with triumphant explosions ah wretch what you cant bear the truth youre obliged to hate the truth that is why you cut and run before it huzza mr sheridan m p for stafford runs like a hare for fear that he should hear the truth precisely so the truth it was that he ran from the truth at this particular moment was too painful to his heart sheridan had fled the awful truth amounted to eighteen shillings yes virtuous richardson you were right truth it was that he fled from truth had just then become too painful to his infirm mind although it was useless to tell him so as by this time he was out of hearing yes said richardson meditatively to himself the truth has at last become insupportable to this unhappy man right it had so and in one minute more it became insupportable even to the virtuous richardson when the coachman revealed the odious extent of the truth viz that the fare now amounted to twoandtwenty shillings as i hate everything that the people love and above all the odious levity with which they adopt every groundless anecdote especially where it happens to be calumnious i beg not to be supposed a believer in the common stories current about sheridans carelessness of pecuniary obligations so far from never paying which is what public slander has not ceased to report of him he was in mr moores language always paying and for once that he paid too little a thousand times he paid a great deal too much had indeed all his excesses of payment been gathered into one fund that fund would have covered his deficits ten times over it is however true that whilst he was continually paying the hundredpound demands against him with all their jewish accumulations of interest he was continually unfurnished with money for his menus plaisirs and trifling personal expenses by strong natural tendency of disposition sheridan was a man of peculiarly sensitive honour and the irregularities into which he fell more conspicuously after the destruction of drury lane by fire pained nobody so much as himself it is the sense of this fact and the belief that sheridan was never a defaulter through habits of selfindulgence which call out in my mind a reaction of indignation at the stories current against him bookbinding and booklettering literature is a mean thing enough in the ordinary way of pursuing it as what the germans call a brodstudium but in its higher relations it is so noble that it is able to ennoble other things supposing them in any degree ministerial to itself the papermaker ergo the ragmaker ergo the linen clothmaker is the true and original creator of the modern press as the archbishop of dublin long ago demonstrated for the art of printing had never halted for want of the typographic secret that was always known known and practised hundreds of years before the christian era it halted for want of a material cheap enough and plentiful enough to make types other than a most costly substitute for handcopying do you hear that gentlemen blockheads that seldom hear anything but yourselves next after the papermaker who furnished the sine qu non takes rank not the engraver or illustrator our modern novelist cannot swim without this caricaturing villain as one of his bladders all higher forms of literature laugh at him but the binder for he by raising books into ornamental furniture has given even to nonintellectual people by myriads a motive for encouraging literature and an interest in its extension any specimen of mr ferrars binding i never saw but by those who have it is said to have been magnificent he and his family were once if not twice visited by charles i and they presented to that prince a most sumptuous bible of their own binding which bible a lady once told me was in that collection gradually formed by george iii at buckingham house and finally presented to the nation by his son i should fear it must be in ruins as a specimen of the little gidding workmanship the man who goes to bed in his coffin dressed in a jewelled robe and a diamondhilted sword is very liable to a visit from the resurrectionman who usually disarms and undresses him the bible that has its binding inlaid with gold sowed with oriental pearl and made horrent with rubies suggests to many a most unscriptural mode of searching into its treasures and too like the miltonic mammons mode of perusing the gorgeous floors of heaven besides that if the bible escaped the parliamentary war the true art of the ferrar family would be better displayed in a case of less cost and luxury certainly in no one art was the stupidity of europe more atrociously recorded than in this particular art practised by the ferrars boundless was the field for improvement and in particular i had myself drawn from this art as practised of old one striking memorial of that remarkable genius for stupidity which in all ages alike seems to haunt man as by an inspiration unless he is roused out of it by panic it is this look at the lettering that is the labels lettered with the titles of books in all libraries that are not of recent date no man would believe that the very earliest attempt to impress a mark of ownership upon some bucket of the argonauts or the rudest scrawl of polyphemus in forging a tarry brand upon some sheep which he had stolen could be so bad so staggering and illegible as are these literary inscriptions how much better to have had a thin tablet or veneering of marble or iron adjusted to the back of the book a stonecutter in a rural churchyard once told me that he charged a penny per letter that may be cheap for a gravestone but it seems rather high for a book plato would cost you fivepence aristotle would be shocking and in decency you must put him into latin which would add twopence more to every volume on a library like that of dresden or the vatican it would raise a national debt to letter the books cause of the novels decline no man it may be safely laid down as a general rule can obtain a strong hold over the popular mind without more or less of real power a reality there must be the artifice the trickery cannot arise in this first stage as by any substitution of a shadow for a reality if the mass of readers feel a power and acknowledge a power in that case power there must be it was the just remark of dr johnson that men do not deceive themselves in their amusements and amusement it is that the great public seek in literature the meaner and the more sensual the demands of a man are so much the less possible it becomes to cheat him seeking for warmth he cannot be wrong when he says that he has found it asking for alcohol he will never be cheated with water his feelings in such a case his impressions instantaneously justify themselves that is they bear witness past all doubting to the certainty of what they report so far there is no opening to mistake the error the opening to the spurious on the largest scale arises first upon the quality of the power strength varies upon an endless scale not merely by its own gradations but by the modes and the degrees in which it combines with other qualities and there are many combinations cases of constant recurrence in which some natural vigour but of no remarkable order enters into alliance with animal propensities where a portentous success will indicate no corresponding power in the artist but only an unusual insensibility to decency and the opinion of thoughtful persons novels are the one sole class of books that ever interest the public that reach its heart or even catch its eye and the reason why novels are becoming much more licentious and much grosser in the arts by which they court public favour lies undoubtedly in the quality of that new reading public which the extension of education has added to the old one an education miserably shallow whilst unavailing for any purpose of real elevation lets in upon the theatre of what is called by courtesy literature a vast additional audience that once would have been excluded altogether this audience changed in no respect from its former condition of intellect and manners and taste bringing only the single qualification of ability to read is now strong enough in numbers to impress a new character upon literature in so far as literature has a motive for applying itself to their wants the consequences are showing themselves and will show themselves more broadly it is difficult with proper delicacy to seek illustrations amongst our own living writers illustrations were all too easily found did we care to enter on the task it is true that during the currency of any year whilst the quantity is liable to indeterminate augmentation ballads will be rather looking down in the market but that is a shadow which settles upon every earthly good thing no greek book for instance amongst the many that have perished would so much rejoice many of us by its resurrection as the comedies of menander yet if a correspondent should write word from pompeii that twentyfive thousand separate dramas of menander had been found in good preservation adding in a postscript that forty thousand more had been impounded within the last two hours and that there was every prospect of bagging two hundred thousand more before morning we should probably petition government to receive the importing vessels with chainshot not even milton or shakespeare could make head against such a lopez de vega principle of ruinous superfluity allowing for this one case of preternatural excess assuming only that degree of limitation which any absolute past must almost always create up to that point we say that there is no conceivable composition or class of compositions which will not be welcomed into literature provided as to matter that it shall embody some natural strain of feeling and provided as to manner that it illustrate the characteristic style of a known generation it might suffice for our present purpose to have once firmly distinguished between the two modes of literature but it may be as well to point out a few corollaries from this distinction which will serve at the same time to explain and to confirm it for instance first of all it has been abundantly insisted on in our modern times that the value of every literature lies in its characteristic part a truth certainly but a truth upon which the german chanticleer would not have crowed and flapped his wings so exultingly had he perceived the original and indispensable schism between the literature of knowledge and the literature of power because in this latter only can anything characteristic of a man or of a nation be embodied the science of no man can be characteristic no man can geometrize or chemically analyze after a manner peculiar to himself he may be the first to open a new road and in that meaning it may be called his road but his it cannot be by any such peculiarities as will found an incommunicable excellence in literature proper viz the literature of power this is otherwise there may doubtless have been many imitative poets wearing little or nothing of a natural individuality but of no poet that ever led his own class can it have been possible that he should have been otherwise than strongly differenced by inimitable features and by traits not transferable consequently the greek to characteristic of which in german cloudland so noisy a proclamation is made as of some transcendental discovery is a mere inference from the very idea of a literature for we repeat that in blank knowledge a separate peculiarity marking the individual is not conceivable whereas in a true literature reflecting human nature not as it represents but as it wills not as a passive minor but as a selfmoving power it is not possible to avoid the characteristic except only in the degree by which the inspiring nature happens to be feeble the exorbitations that differentiate them may be of narrow compass but only where the motive power was originally weak and agreeably to this remark it may be asserted that in all literature properly socalled genius is always manifested and talent generally but in the literature of knowledge it may be doubted very seriously whether there is any opening for more than talent genius may be defined in the severest manner as that which is generally characteristic but a thousand times we repeat that one mans mode of knowing an object cannot differ from another mans it cannot be characteristic and its geniality cannot be externally manifested to have said therefore of the poetry surviving from ancient latium from castile from england that this is nationally characteristic and knowable apart by inalienable differences is saying no more than follows out of the very definition by which any and every literature proper is limited and guarded as a mode of power secondly even in the exceptions and hesitations upon applying the rigour of this distinction we may read the natural recognition however latent or unconscious of the rule itself no man would think for example of placing a treatise on surveying on mensuration on geological stratifications in any collection of his national literature he would be lunatic to do so a birmingham or glasgow directory has an equal title to take its station in the national literature but he will hesitate on the same question arising with regard to a history where upon examination the history turns out to be a mere chronicle or register of events chronologically arranged with no principle of combination pervading it nor colouring from peculiar views of policy nor sympathy with the noble and impassioned in human action the decision will be universal and peremptory to cashier it from the literature yet this case being one of degree ranges through a large and doubtful gamut a history like that of froissart or of herodotus where the subjective from the writer blends so powerfully with the gross objective where the moral picturesque is so predominant together with freshness of sensation which belongs to blissful infancy in human life or to a stage of society in correspondence to it cannot suffer a demur of jealousy as to its privilege of entering the select fold of literature but such advantages are of limited distribution and to say the truth in its own nature neither history nor biography unless treated with peculiar grace and architecturally moulded has any high pretension to rank as an organic limb of literature the very noblest history in much of its substance is but by a special indulgence within the privilege of that classification biography stands on the same footing of the many memorials dedicated to the life of milton how few are entitled to take their station in the literature and why not merely that they are disqualified by their defective execution but often that they necessarily record what has become common property footnotes between the forms modal modish and modern the difference is of that slight order which is constantly occurring between the elizabethan age and our own ish ous ful some are continually interchanging thus pitiful for piteous quarrelous for quarrelsome i deny that there is or could have been one truant fluttering murmur of the heart against the reality of glory and partly for these reasons st that hoc abstracto defrauding man of this you leave him miserably bare bare of everything so that really and sincerely the very wisest men may be seen clinging convulsively and clutching with their dying hands the belief that glory that posthumous fame which for profound ends of providence has been endowed with a subtle power of fraud such as no man can thoroughly look through for those who like myself despise it most completely cannot by any art bring forward a rationale a theory of its hollowness that will give plenary satisfaction except to those who are already satisfied thus cicero feeling that if this were nothing then had all his life been a skirmish one continued skirmish for shadows and nonentities a feeling of blank desolation too startling too humiliating to be faced but ndly the unsearchable hypocrisy of man that hypocrisy which even to himself is but dimly descried that latent hypocrisy which always does and most profitably possess every avenue of every mans thoughts hence a man who should openly have avowed a doctrine that glory was a bubble besides that instead of being prompted to this on a principle which so far raised him above other men must have been prompted by a principle that sank him to the level of the brutes viz acquiescing in total ventrine improvidence imprescience and selfish ease if ease a pagan must have it cum dignitate but above all he must have made proclamation that in his opinion all disinterested virtue was a chimera since all the quadrifarious virtue of the scholastic ethics was founded either on personal selfsufficiency on justice moderation etc etc or on direct personal and exclusive selfinterest as regarded health and the elements of pleasure the tower of siloam every definition is a syllogism now because the minor proposition is constantly false this does not affect the case each man is right to fill up the minor with his own view and essentially they do not disagree with each other a the subject of defis x the truth is the sum of christianity but c is x but my baptist view is the sum of christianity ergo c is a ergo my baptist view is the truth it seems that herod made changes so vast certainly in the surmounting works and also probably in one place as to the foundations that it could not be called the same temple with that of the captivity except under an abuse of ideas as to matter and form of which all nations have furnished illustrations from the ship argo to that of old drake from sir john cutlers stockings to the highlanders or irishmans musket just as if a man spending his life to show the folly of methodism should burst into maudlin tears at sight of john wesley and say oh if all men my dear brothers were but methodists how so if the jews were naturally infidels why did god select them but first they might have and they certainly had other balancing qualities secondly in the sense here meant all men are infidels and we ourselves by the very nature of one object which i will indicate are pretty generally infidels in the same sense as they look at our evidences look at the sort of means by which we often attempt to gain proselytes among the heathen and at home fouler infidelities there are not special pleading working for a verdict etc etc this idea is expanded and followed out in detail in the opening of homer and the homerid but this is evidently the note from which that grew and is here given alike on account of its compactness and felicity ed satire ix lines who can answer a sneer butler unanswerable ridicule said of members of the bristol family xxv omitted passages and variations the rhapsodoi the following on the rhapsodoi is a variation on that which appeared in homer and the homerid with some quite additional and new thoughts on the subject about these people who they were what relation they bore to homer and why they were called rhapsodoi we have seen debated in germany through the last half century with as much rabid ferocity as was ever applied to the books of a fraudulent bankrupt such is the natural impertinence of man if he suspects any secret or any base attempt to hide and conceal things from himself he is miserable until he finds out the mystery and especially where all the parties to it have been defunct for years great indignation seems reasonably to have been felt by all german scholars that any man should presume to have called himself a rhapsodos at any period of grecian history without sending down a sealed letter to posterity stating all the reasons which induced him to take so unaccountable a step no possible solution given to any conceivable question bearing upon the rhapsodoi seems by any tendency to affect any question outstanding about homer and we do not therefore understand the propriety of intermingling this dispute with the general homeric litigation however to comply with the practice of germany we shall throw away a few sentences upon this as a pure ad libitum digression the courteous reader whom we beg also to suppose the most ignorant of readers by way of thus founding a necessity and a case of philosophic reasonableness for the circumstantiality of our own explanations will be pleased to understand that by ancient traditionary usage the word rhapsodia is the designation technically applied to the several books or cantos of the iliad and odyssey so the word fytte has gained a technical appropriation to our narrative poetry when it takes the ballad form now the greek word rhapsody is derived from a tense of the verb rhapto to sew as with a needle to connect and ode a song chant or course of singing if therefore you conceive of a rhapsodia not as the opera but as the opus of a singer not as the form but as the result of his official ministration viz as that section of a narrative poem which forms an intelligible whole in itself whilst in a subordinate relation it is one part of a larger whole this idea represents accurately enough the use of the word rhapsodia in the latter periods of greek literature suppose the word canto to be taken in its literal etymological sense it would indicate a metrical composition meant to be sung or chanted but what constitutes the complexity of the idea in the word rhapsodia is that both its separate elements the poetry and the musical delivery are equally essential neither is a casual neither a subordinate element now the rhapsodoi as may be supposed are the personal correlates of the rhapsodia this being the poem adapted to chanting those were the chanters and the only important question which we can imagine to arise is how far in any given age we may presume the functions of the poetical composer and the musical deliverer to have been united we cannot perceive that any possible relation between a rhapsody considered as a section of a poem and the whole of that poem or any possible relation which this same rhapsody considered as a thing to be sung or accompanied instrumentally could bear to the nakedspeaking rehearsal of the same poem or to the original text of that poem ever can affect the main question of homers integrity the rhapsodoi come to be mentioned at all simply as being one link in the transmission of the homeric poems they are found existing before pisistratus they are found existing after pisistratus and they declined exactly as the art of reading became general we can approximate pretty closely to the time when the rhapsodoi ceased but at what time they began we defy any man to say plato rep x represents them as going back into the days of homer nay according to plato homer himself was a rhapsodos and itinerated in that character so was hesiod and two remarkable lines ascribed to hesiod by one of the scholiasts upon pindar if we could be sure that they were genuine settle that question greek en delo tote prton ego xai homeros aoidoi melpomen en nearois mnois rapsantes aoid then first of all says hesiod did i and homer chant as bards in delos laying the nexus of our poetic composition in promial hymns we understand him to mean this there were many singers and harpers who sang or accompanied the words of others perhaps ancient words at all events not their own naturally he was anxious to have it understood that he and homer had higher pretensions they killed their own mutton they composed the words as well as sang them where both functions were so often united in one mans person it became difficult to distinguish them our own word bard or minstrel stood in the same ambiguity you could not tell in many cases whether the word pointed to the mans poetic or musical faculty anticipating that doubt hesiod says that they sang as original poets for it is a remark of suidas which he deduces laboriously that poetry being uniformly sung in the elder greece acquired the name of greek aoid this term became technically appropriated to the poetry or substance of whatever was sung in contradistinction to the musical accompaniment and the poet was called greek aoidos so far hesiod twice over secures the dignity of their office from misinterpretation and there by the word greek raphantes he indicates the sort of poetry which they cultivated viz that which was expanded into long heroic narratives and naturally connected itself both internally amongst its own parts and externally with other poems of the same class thus having separated homer and himself from the mere musicians next he separates them even as poets from those who simply composed hymns to the gods these heroic legends were known to require much more elaborate study and art yet because a critical reviewer might take occasion to tax his piety in thus composing human legends in neglect of the gods hesiod forestalling him replies youre out there my friend we were both pious and we put our piety into hymns addressed to the gods which with cabinetmakers skill we used also as interludes of transition from one legend to another for it is noticed frequently and especially by a scholiast on aristophanes pac that generally speaking the promia to the different parts of narrativepoems were entirely detached greek kai ouden pros to pragma dlon and explain nothing at all that concerns the business mrs evans and the gazette in his autobiographic sketch introduction to the world of strife he tells of his brothers enterprise in establishing the gazette which was to record their doings and also of mrs evanss place on the gazette the following is evidently a passage which was prepared for that part of the article but was from some cause or other omitted i suppose no creature ever led such a life as i led on the gazette sometimes running up like wallenstein to the giddiest pinnacles of honour then down again without notice or warning to the dust cashiered rendered incapable of ever serving h m again nay actually drummed out of the army my uniform stripped off and the rogues march played after me and all for what i protest to this hour i have no guess if any person knows that person is not myself and the reader is quite as well able to furnish guesses to me as i to him to enlighten me upon the subject as i him mrs evans was a very important person in the play i dont suppose that things could have gone on without her for as there was no writer in the gazette but my brother so there was no reader of it except mrs evans and here came in a shocking annoyance to me that as often as any necessity occurred which was every third day for restoring me to my rank since my brother would not have it supposed that he could be weak enough to initiate such an indulgence the gazette threw the onus of this amiable weakness and consequently of my gratitude upon mrs evans affirming that the majorgeneral had received a pardon and an amnesty for all his past atrocities at the request of a distinguished lady who was obscurely indicated in a parenthesis as the truly honourable mrs evans to listen to the gazette one would have supposed that this woman who so cordially detested me spent her whole time in going down on her knees and making earnest supplications to the throne on my behalf but what signified the representations of the gazette if i knew them to be false aye but i did not know that they were false it is true that my obligations to her were quite aerial and might as the reader will think have been supported without any preternatural effort but exactly these aerial burdens whether of gratitude or of honour most oppressed me as being least tangible and incapable of pecuniary or other satisfaction no sinking fund could meet them and even the dull unimaginative woman herself eternally held up to admiration as my resolute benefactress got the habit i am sure of looking upon me as under nameless obligations to her this raised my wrath it was not that to my feelings the obligations were really a mere figment of pretence on the contrary according to my pains endured they towered up to the clouds but i felt that nobody had any right to load me with favours that i had never asked for and without leave even asked from me and the more real were the favours the deeper the wrong done to me i sought therefore for some means of retaliation and it is odd that it was not till thirty years after that i perceived one it then struck me that the eternal intercession might have been equally odious to her to find herself prostrate for ever weeping like niobe and if the gazette was to be believed refusing to raise herself from the mud or the flinty pavement till i had been forgiven and reinstated in my rank ah how loathsome that must have been to her ah how loathsome the whole cycle of favours were to me considering from whom they came then we had effectually plagued each other and it was not without loud laughter as of malice unexpectedly triumphant that i found one night thirty years after on regretting my powerlessness of vengeance that in fact i had amply triumphed thirty years before so undaunted mrs evans if you live anywhere within call listen to the assurance that all accounts are squared between us and that we balanced our mutual debts by mutual disgust and that if you plagued me perversely i plagued you unconsciously and though shot and bullets were forbidden fruit yet something might be done with hard wadding a good deal of classical literature disappeared in this way which by one who valued no classics very highly might be called the way of all flesh the best of authors he contended had better perish by this warlike consummation than by the inglorious enmity of bookworms and moths honeycombed as most of the books had been which had gone out to india with our two uncles even wadding however was declared to be inadmissible as too dangerous after wounds had been inflicted more than once a lawsuit legacy de quincey in his autobiographic sketch headed laxton tells of the fortune of miss watson who afterwards became lady carbery and also of the legacy left to her in the form of a lawsuit by her father against the east india company and among his papers we find the following passage either overlooked or omitted for some undiscoverable reason from that paper though it has a value in its own way as expressing some of de quinceys views on law and equity and it is sufficiently characteristic to be included here in consequence of her long minority miss watson must have succeeded at once to six thousand a year on completing her twentyfirst year and she also inherited a chancerysuit which sort of property is now rather at a discount in public estimation but let the reader assure himself that even the court of chancery is not quite so black as it is painted that the true ground for the delays and ruinous expenses in ninetynine out of one hundred instances is not legal chicanery still less the wilful circuitousness and wordiness of law processes but the great eternal fact that what through lapse of time decays of memory and loss of documents and what through interested suppressions of truth and the dispersions of witnesses and causes by the score beside the ultimate truth and equity of human disputes is a matter of prodigious perplexity neither is there any possibility that the mass of litigations as to property ever can be made cheap except in proportion as it is made dismally imperfect no power that ever yet was lodged in senates or in councils could avail ever has availed ever will avail to intercept the immeasurable expansion of that law which grows out of social expansion fast as the relations of man multiply and the modifications of property extend must the corresponding adaptations of the law run alongside the pretended arrests applied to this heaving volcanic system of forces by codifications like those of justinian or napoleon had not lasted for a year before all had broke loose from its moorings and was again going ahead with redoubling impetus equally delusive are the prospects held out that the new system of cheap provincial justice will be a change unconditionally for the better already the complaints against it are such in bitterness and extent as to show that in very many cases it must be regarded as a failure and where it is not that it must be regarded as a compromise once you had degrees of the advantage x of y now you have of x of y the true justifications of war the following was evidently intended to appear in the article on war most of what has been written on this subject the cruelty of war in connection with the apparently fierce ethics of the old testament is with submission to sentimentalists false and profoundly unphilosophic it is of the same feeble character as the flashy modern moralizations upon war the true justifications of war lie far below the depths of any soundings taken upon the charts of effeminate earthborn ethics and ethics of god the scriptural ethics search into depths that are older and less measurable contemplate interests that are more mysterious and entangled with perils more awful than merely human philosophy has resources for appreciating it is not at all impossible that a crisis has sometimes arisen for the human race in which its capital interest may be said to have ridden at single anchor upon the issue of a single struggle between the powers of light and darkness upon a motion a bias an impulse given this way or that all may have been staked out of judaism came christianity and the mere possibility of christianity from elder stages of the hebrew race hidden in thick darkness to us descended the only pure glimpse allowed to man of gods nature traditionally but through many generations and fighting at every stage with storms or with perils more than ever were revealed to us this idea of god this holy seed of truth like some secret jewel passing onwards through armies of robbers made its way downward to an age in which it became the matrix of christianity the solitary acorn had reached in safety the particular soil in which it was first capable of expanding into a forest the narrow but at the same time austere truth of judaism furnished the basis which by magic as it were burst suddenly and expanded into a vast superstructure no longer fitted for the apprehension of one single unamiable race but offering shelter and repose to the whole family of man these things are most remarkable about this memorable transmigration of one faith into another of an imperfect into a perfect religion viz that the early stage had but a slight resemblance to the latter nor could have prefigured it to a human sagacity more than a larva could prefigure a chrysalis and secondly that whereas the product viz christianity never has been nor will be in any danger of ruin the germ viz the judaic idea of god the great radiation through which the deity kept open his communication with man apparently must more than once have approached an awful struggle for life this solitary taper of truth struggling across a howling wilderness of darkness had it been ever totally extinguished could probably never have been reillumined it may seem an easy thing for a mere human philosophy to recover and steadily to maintain a pure hebrew conception of god but so far is this from being true that we believe it possible to expose in the closest pagan approximation to this hebrew type some adulterous elements such as would have ensured its relapse into idolatrous impurity philosophy defeated we have come upon a passage which is omitted from the confessions and as it is in every way characteristic we shall give it my studies have now been long interrupted i cannot read to myself with any pleasure hardly with a moments endurance yet i read aloud sometimes for the pleasure of others because reading is an accomplishment of mine and in the slang use of the word accomplishment as a superficial and ornamental attainment almost the only one i possess and formerly if i had any vanity at all connected with any endowment or attainment of mine it was with this for i had observed that no accomplishment was so rare players are the worst readers of all reads vilely and mrs who is so celebrated can read nothing well but dramatic compositions milton she cannot read sufferably people in general read poetry without any passion at all or else overstep the modesty of nature and read not like scholars of late if i have felt moved by anything in books it has been by the grand lamentations of samson agonistes or the great harmonies of the satanic speaker in paradise regained when read aloud by myself a young lady sometimes comes and drinks tea with us at her request and ms i now and then read ws poems to them w bythebye is the only poet i ever met who could read his own verses blank verse he reads admirably this then has been the extent of my reading for upwards of sixteen months it frets me to enter those rooms of my cottage in which the books stand in one of them to which my little boy has access he has found out a use for some of them somebody has given him a bow and arrows god knows who certainly not i for i have not energy or ingenuity to invent a walkingstick thus equipped for action he rears up the largest of the folios that he can lift places them on a tottering base and then shoots until he brings down the enemy he often presses me to join him and sometimes i consent and we are both engaged together in these intellectual labours we build up a pile having for its base some slender modern metaphysician ill able poor man to sustain such a weight of philosophy upon this we place the dutch quartos of descartes and spinoza then a third story of schoolmen in folio the master of sentences suarez picus mirandula and the telemonian bulk of thomas aquinas and when the whole architecture seems firm and compact we finish our system of metaphysics by roofing the whole with duvals enormous aristotle so far there is some pleasure building up is something but what is that to destroying thus thinks at least my little companion who now with the wrath of the pythian apollo assumes his bow and arrows plants himself in the remotest corner of the room and prepares his fatal shafts the bowstring twangs flights of arrows are in the air but the dutch impregnability of the bergenopzooms at the base receives the few which reach the mark and they recoil without mischief done again the baffled archer collects his arrows and again he takes his station an arrow issues forth and takes effect on a weak side of thomas symptoms of dissolution appear the cohesion of the system is loosened the schoolmen begin to totter the stagyrite trembles philosophy rocks to its centre and before it can be seen whether time will do anything to heal their wounds another arrow is planted in the schism of their ontology the mighty structure heaves reels seems in suspense for one moment and then with one choral crash to the frantic joy of the young sagittary lies subverted on the floor kant and aristotle nominalists and realists doctors seraphic or irrefragable what cares he all are at his feet the irrefragable has been confuted by his arrows the seraphic has been found mortal and the greatest philosopher and the least differ but according to the brief noise they have made for nearly two years i believe that i read no book but one and i owe it to the author mr ricardo to make grateful record of it and then he proceeds suddenly in a friend in edinburgh sent me down mr ricardos book etc the highwaymans skeleton in the account which de quincey gives of the highwaymans skeleton which figured in the museum of the distinguished surgeon mr white in his chapter in the autobiographic sketches headed the manchester grammar school he was evidently restrained from inserting one passage which we have found among his papers from considerations of delicacy towards persons who might then still be living but as he has there plainly given the names of the leading persons concerned the famous surgeon cruikshank there can at this time of day be little risk of offending or hurting anyone by presenting the passage which the curious student of the autobiography can insert at the proper point and may feel that its presence adds to the completeness of the impression halfhumorous halfeerie which de quincey was fain to produce by that somewhat grim episode here is the passage it was a regular and respectable branch of public industry which was carried on by the highwaymen of england and all the parties to it moved upon decent motives and by considerate methods in particular the robbers themselves as the leading parties could not be other than firstrate men as regarded courage animal vigour and perfect horsemanship starting from any lower standard than this not only had they no chance of continued success their failure was certain as regarded the contest with the traveller but also their failure was equally certain as regarded the competition within their own body the candidates for a lucrative section of the road were sure to become troublesome in proportion as all administration of the business upon that part of the line was feebly or indiscreetly worked hence it arose that individually the chief highwaymen were sure to command a deep professional interest amongst the surgeons of the land sometimes it happened that a firstrate robber was arrested and brought to trial but from defective evidence escaped meanwhile his fine person had been locally advertised and brought under the notice of the medical body this had occurred in a more eminent degree than was usual to the robber who had owned when living the matchless skeleton possessed by mr white he had been most extensively surveyed with anatomical eyes by the whole body of the medical profession in london their deliberate judgment upon him was that a more absolutely magnificent figure of a man did not exist in england than this highwayman and naturally therefore very high sums were offered to him as soon as his condemnation was certain the robber whose name i entirely forget finally closed with the offer of cruikshank who was at that time the most eminent surgeon in london those days as is well known were days of great irregularity in all that concerned the management of prisons and the administration of criminal justice consequently there is no reason for surprise or for doubt in the statement made by mr white that cruikshank whose pupil mr white then was received some special indulgences from one of the undersheriffs beyond what the law would strictly have warranted the robber was cut down considerably within the appointed time was instantly placed in a chaiseandfour and was thus brought so prematurely into the private rooms of cruikshank that life was not as yet entirely extinct this i heard mr white repeatedly assert he was himself at that time amongst the pupils of cruikshank and three or four of the most favoured amongst these were present and to one of them cruikshank observed quietly i think the subject is not quite dead pray put your knife in mr x y at this point that was done a solemn finis was placed to the labours of the robber and perhaps a solemn inauguration to the labours of the student a cast was taken from the superb figure of the highwayman he was then dissected his skeleton became the property of cruikshank and subsequently of mr white we were all called upon to admire the fine proportions of the man and of course in that hollow and unmeaning way which such unlearned expressors of judgment usually assume we all obsequiously met the demand levied upon our admiration but for my part though readily confiding in the professional judgment of anatomists i could not but feel that through my own unassisted judgment i never could have arrived at such a conclusion the unlearned eye has gathered no rudimental points to begin with not having what are the normal outlines to which the finest proportions tend an eye so untutored cannot of course judge in what degree the given subject approaches to these the ransom for waterloo the following gives a variation on a famous passage in the dream fugue and it may be interesting to the reader to compare it with that which the author printed from these variations it will be seen that de quincey often wrote and rewrote his finest passages and sometimes no doubt found it hard to choose between the readings thus as we ran like torrents thus as with bridal rapture our flying equipage swept over the campo santo of the graves thus as our burning wheels carried warrior instincts kindled earthly passions amongst the trembling dust below us suddenly we became aware of a vast necropolis to which from afar we were hurrying in a moment our maddening wheels were nearing it of purple granite in massive piles was this city of the dead and yet for one moment it lay like a visionary purple stain on the horizon so mighty was the distance in the second moment this purple city trembled through many changes and grew as by fiery pulsations so mighty was the pace in the third moment already with our dreadful gallop we were entering its suburbs systems of sarcophagi rose with crests aerial of terraces and turrets into the upper glooms strode forward with haughty encroachment upon the central aisle ran back with mighty shadows into answering recesses when the sarcophagi wheeled then did our horses wheel like rivers in horned floods wheeling in pomp of unfathomable waters round headlands like hurricanes that ride into the secrets of forests faster than ever light travels through the wilderness of darkness we shot the angles we fled round the curves of the labyrinthine city with the storm of our horses feet and of our burning wheels did we carry earthly passions kindle warrior instincts amongst the silent dust around us dust of our noble fathers that had slept in god since creci every sarcophagus showed many basreliefs basreliefs of battles basreliefs of battlefields battles from forgotten ages battles from yesterday battlefields that long since nature had healed and reconciled to herself with the sweet oblivion of flowers battlefields that were yet angry and crimson with carnage and now had we reached the last sarcophagus already we were abreast of the last basrelief already we were recovering the arrowlike flight of the central aisle when coming up it in counterview to ourselves we beheld the frailest of cars built as might seem from floral wreaths and from the shells of indian seas half concealed were the fawns that drew it by the floating mists that went before it in pomp but the mists hid not the lovely countenance of the infant girl that sate wistful upon the ear and hid not the birds of tropic plumage with which she played face to face she rode forward to meet us and baby laughter in her eyes saluted the ruin that approached oh baby i said in anguish must we that carry tidings of great joy to every people be gods messengers of ruin to thee in horror i rose at the thought but then also in horror at the thought rose one that was sculptured in the basrelief a dying trumpeter solemnly from the field of waterloo he rose to his feet and unslinging his stony trumpet carried it in his dying anguish to his stony lips sounding once and yet once again proclamation that to thy ears oh baby must have spoken from the battlements of death immediately deep shadows fell between us and shuddering silence the choir had ceased to sing the uproar of our laurelled equipage alarmed the graves no more by horror the basrelief had been unlocked into life by horror we that were so full of life we men and our horses with their fiery forelegs rising in midair to their everlasting gallop were petrified to a basrelief oh glacial pageantry of death that from end to end of the gorgeous cathedral for a moment froze every eye by contagion of panic then for the third time the trumpet sounded back with the shattering burst came the infinite rushing of life the seals of frost were raised from our stifling hearts desiderium here is another variation on a famous passage in the autobiographic sketches which will give the reader some further opportunity for comparison at six years of age or thereabouts i write without any memorial notes the glory of this earth for me was extinguished it is finished not those words but that sentiment was the misgiving of my prophetic heart thought it was that gnawed like a worm that did not and that could not die how child a cynic would have said if he had deciphered the secret reading of my sighs at six years of age will you pretend that life has already exhausted its promises have you communicated with the grandeurs of earth have you read milton have you seen rome have you heard mozart no i had not nor could in those years have appreciated any one of them if i had and therefore undoubtedly the crown jewels of our little planet were still waiting for me in the rear milton and rome and don giovanni were yet to come but it mattered not what remained when set over against what had been taken away that it was which i sought for ever in my blindness the love which had existed between myself and my departed sister that as even a child could feel was not a light that could be rekindled no voice on earth could say come again to a flower of paradise like that love such as that is given but once to any exquisite are the perceptions of childhood not less so than those of maturest wisdom in what touches the capital interests of the heart and no arguments nor any consolations could have soothed me into a moments belief that a wound so ghastly as mine admitted of healing or palliation consequently as i stood more alone in the very midst of a domestic circle than ever christian traveller in an african bilidulgerid amidst the tents of infidels or the howls of lions day and night in the darkness and at noonday i sate i stood i lay moping like an idiot craving for what was impossible and seeking groping snatching at that which was irretrievable for ever footnotes born died ed the end
