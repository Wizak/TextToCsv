the grifters by jim thompson copyright as roy dillon stumbled out of the shop his face was a sickish green and each breath he drew was an incredible agony a hard blow in the guts can do that to a man and dillon had gotten a hard one not with a fist which would have been bad enough but from the buttend of a heavy club somehow he got back to his car and managed to slide into the seat but that was all he could manage he moaned as the change in posture cramped his stomach muscles then with a strangled gasp he leaned out the window several cars passed as he spewed vomit into the street their occupants grinning frowning sympathetically or averting their eyes in disgust but roy dillon was too sick to notice or to care if he had when at last his stomach was empty he felt better though still not well enough to drive by then however a prowl car had pulled up behind him a sheriffs car since he was in the county rather than city of los angeles and a brownclad deputy was inviting him to step out to the walk dillon shakily obeyed one too many mister what never mind the cop had already noticed the absence of liquor breath lets see your drivers license dillon showed it to him also displaying with seeming inadvertence an assortment of credit cards suspicion washed off the cops face giving way to concern you seem pretty sick mr dillon any idea what caused it my lunch i guess i know i should know better but i had a chickensalad sandwich and it didnt taste quite right when i was eating it but he let his voice trail away smiling a shy rueful smile mmmhmm the cop nodded grimly that stuff will do it to you well a shrewd upanddown look you all right now want us to take you to a doctor oh no im fine we got a firstaid man over to the substation no trouble to run you over there roy declined pleasantly but firmly any prolonged contact with the cops would result in a record and any kind of record was at best a nuisance so far he had none the scrapes which the grift had led him into had not led him to the cops and he meant to keep it that way the deputy went back to the prowl car and he and his partner drove off roy waved a smiling farewell to them and got back into his own car gingerly wincing a little he got a cigarette lit then convinced that the last of the vomiting was over he forced himself to lean back against the cushions he was in a suburb of los angeles one of the many which resist incorporation despite their interdependence and the lack of visible boundaries from here it was almost a thirtymile drive back into the city a very long thirty miles at this hour of the day he needed to be in better shape than he was to rest a while before bucking the outbound tide of evening traffic more important he needed to reconstruct the details of his recent disaster while they still remained fresh in his mind he closed his eyes for a moment he opened them again focussing them on the changing lights of the nearby traffic standard and suddenly without moving from the car without physically moving from it he was back inside the shop again sipping a limeade at the fountain while he casually studied his surroundings it was little different from a thousand small shops in los angeles establishments with an abbreviated soda fountain a showcase or two of cigars cigarettes and candy and overflowing racks of magazines paperback books and greeting cards in the east such shops were referred to as stationers or candy stores here they were usually called confectionaries or simply fountains dillon was the only customer in the place the one other person present was the clerk a large lumpylooking youth of perhaps nineteen or twenty as dillon finished his drink he noted the boys manner as he tapped ice down around the freezer containers working with a paradoxical mixture of diligence and indifference he knew exactly what needed to be done his expression said and to hell with doing a bit more than that nothing for show nothing to impress anyone the bosss son dillon decided putting down his glass and sliding off the stool he sauntered up toward the cash register and the youth laid down the sawedoff ball bat with which he had been tamping then wiping his hands on his apron he also moved up to the register ten cents he said and a package of those mints too twenty cents twenty cents hmm roy began to fumble through his pockets while the clerk fidgeted impatiently now i know ive got some change here bound to have i wonder where the devil exasperatedly he shook his head and drew out his wallet im sorry mind cashing a twenty the clerk almost snatched the bill from his hand he slapped the bill down on the cash register ledge and counted out the change from the drawer dillon absently picked it up continuing his fumbling search of his pockets now doesnt that get you i mean you know darned well youve got something but he broke off eyes widening with a pleased smile there it is two dimes just give me back my twenty will you the clerk grabbed the dimes from him and tossed back the bill dillon turned casually toward the door pausing on the way out for a disinterested glance at the magazine display thus for the tenth time that day he had worked the twenties one of the three standard gimmicks of the short con grift the other two are the smack and the tat usually good for bigger scores but not nearly so swift nor safe some marks fall for the twenties repeatedly without ever tipping dillon didnt see the clerk come around the counter the guy was just there all of a sudden a pouty snarl on his face swinging the sawedoff bat like a battering ram dirty crook he whinnied angrily dirty crooks keep cheatin me and cheatin me an papa cusses me out for it the butt of the bat landed in dillons stomach even the clerk was startled by its effect now you cant blame me mister he stammered you were askin for it i i give you change for twenty dollars an then you have me give the twenty back an an his selfrighteousness began to crumble nnow you kknow you did rnmister roy could think of nothing but his agony he turned swimming eyes on the clerk eyes flooded with painfilled puzzlement the look completely demolished the youth it wwas jjust a mistake mister yyou made a mmistake an i rnmade a rnrnmistake an rnister he backed away terrified ddont look at me like that you killed me dillon gasped you killed me you rotten bastard nah pplease dont say tthat mister im dying dillon gasped and then somehow he had gotten out of the place and now seated in his car and reexamining the incident he could see no reason to fault himself no flaw in his technique it was just bad luck hed simply caught a goof and goofs couldnt be figured he was right about that and hed been right about something else although he didnt know it as he drove back to los angeles constantly braking and speeding up in the thickening traffic repeatedly stopping and starting with every passing minute he was dying death might be forestalled if he took proper care of himself otherwise he had no more than three days to live roy dillons mother was from a family of backwoods white trash she was thirteen when she married a thirtyyearold railroad worker and not quite fourteen when she gave birth to roy a month or so after his birth her husband suffered an accident which made her a widow thanks to the circumstances of its happening it also made her welloff by the communitys standards a whole two hundred dollars a month to spend on herself which was right where she meant to spend it her family on whom she promptly dumped roy had other ideas they kept the boy for three years occasionally managing to wheedle a few dollars from their daughter then one day her father appeared in town bearing roy under one arm and swinging a horsewhip with the other and he proceeded to demonstrate his lifelong theory that a gal never got too old to whip since lilly dillons character had been molded long before it was little changed by the thrashing but she did keep roy having no choice in the matter and frightened by her fathers grim promises to keep an eye on her she moved out of his reach settling down in baltimore she found lucrative and undemanding employment as a bgirl or more accurately it was undemanding as far as she was concerned lilly dillon wasnt putting out for anyone not at least for a few bucks or drinks her nominal heartlessness often disgruntled the customers but it drew the favorable attention of her employers after all the world was full of bimboes tramps who could be had for a grin or a gin but a smart kid a doll who not only had looks and class but was also smart well that kind of kid you could use they used her in increasingly responsible capacities as a managing hostess as a recruiter for a chain of establishments as a spotter of stickyfingered and bungling employees as courier liaison officer fingerwoman as a collector and disburser and so on up the ladder or should one say down it the money poured in but little of the shower settled on her son she wanted to pack him off to boarding school only drawing back indignantly when the charges were quoted to her a couple thousand dollars a year plus a lot of extras and just for taking care of a kid just for keeping a kid out of trouble why for that much money she could buy a nice mink jacket they must think she was a sucker she decided nuisance that he was shed just look after roy herself and hed darned well keep out of trouble or shed skin him alive she was of course imbued with certain ineradicable instincts eroded and atrophied though they were so she had her rare moments of conscience also certain things had to be done for the sake of appearances to stifle charges of neglect and the unpleasantness pursuant thereto in either case obviously and as roy instinctively knew whatever she did was for herself out of fear or as a salve for her conscience generally her attitude was that of a selfish older sister to an annoying little brother they quarreled with each other she delighted in gobbling down his share of some treat while he danced about her in helpless rage youre mean just a dirty old pig thats all dont you call me names you snot striking at him ill learn you learn me learn me dont even have enough sense to say teach i do too i did say teach he was an excellent student in school and exceptionally wellbehaved learning came easily for him and good behavior seemed simply a matter of common sense why risk trouble when it didnt make you anything why be profitlessly detained after school when you could be out hustling newspapers or running errands or caddying time was money and money was what made the world go around as the smartest and bestbehaved boy in his classes he naturally drew the displeasure of the other kind but no matter how cruelly or frequently he was attacked lilly offered only sardonic condolence only one arm she would say if he exhibited a twisted and swollen arm or if a tooth had been knocked out only one tooth and when he received an overall mauling with dire threats of worse to come well what are you kicking about they may kill you but they cant eat you oddly enough he found a certain comfort in her backhanded remarks on the surface they were worse than nothing merely insult added to injury but beneath them lay a chilling and callous logic a fatalistic doorbedamned philosophy which could accommodate itself to anything but oblivion he had no liking for lilly but he came to admire her shed never given him anything but a hard time which was about the extent of her generosity to anyone but shed done all right she knew how to take care of herself she showed no soft spots until he was entering his teens a handsome wholesomelooking youth with coalblack hair and wideset gray eyes then to his secret amusement he began to note a subtle change in her attitude a softening of her voice when she spoke to him and a suppressed hunger in her eyes when she looked at him and seeing her thus knowing what was behind the change he delighted in teasing her was something wrong did she want him to clear out for a while and leave her alone oh no roy really i i like being together with you now lilly youre just being polite ill get out of your way right now please hhoney biting her lip at the unaccustomed endearment a shamed flush spreading over her lovely features please stay with me after all im im yyour rnmother but she wasnt remember shed always passed him off as her younger brother and it was too late to change the story ill leave right now lilly i know you want me to you just dont want to hurt my feelings he had matured early as was natural enough by the time he was seventeengoingoneighteen the spring that he graduated from high school he was as mature as a man in his twenties on the night of his graduation he told lilly that he was pulling out for good pulling out shed been expecting that he guessed but she wasnt resigned to it bbut but you cant youve got to go to college cant no money she laughed shakily and called him silly avoiding his eyes refusing to be rejected as she must have known she would be of course you have money ive got plenty and anything i have is yours you anything i have is yours roy eyes narrowed appreciably that would make a good title for a song lilly you can go to one of the really good schools roy harvard or yale or some place like that your grades are certainly good enough and with my money our money now lilly you know you need the money for yourself you always have she flinched as though he had struck her and her face worked sickishly and the trim sizenine suit seemed suddenly to hangon her a cruel moral toa life that had gotten her everything and given her nothing and for a moment he almost relented he almost pitied her and then she spoiled it all she began to weep to bawl like a child which was a silly stupid thing for lilly dillon to do and to top off the ridiculous and embarrassing performance she threw on the corn ddont be mean to me roy please please dont yyou youre bbreaking my heart roy laughed out loud he couldnt restrain himself only one heart lilly he said roy dillon lived in a hotel called the grosvenorcarlton a name which hinted at a grandeur that was wholly nonexistent it boasted one hundred rooms one hundred baths but it was purely a boast actually there were only eighty rooms and thirtyfive baths and those included the hall baths and the two lobby restrooms which were not really baths at all it was a fourstory affair with a white sandstone facade and a small terrazzofloored lobby the clerks were elderly pensioners who were delighted to work for a minuscule salary and a free room the negro bellboy whose badge of office was a discarded conductors cap also doubled as janitor elevator operator and allaround handyman with such arrangements as these the service left something to be desired but as the briskly jovial proprietor pointed out anyone who was in a helluva hurry could hurry right on out to one of the beverly hills hotels where he could doubtless get a nice little room for fifty bucks a day instead of the grosvenorc arltons minimum of fifty a month generally speaking the grosvenorcarlton was little different than the numerous other family and commercial hotels which are strung out along west seventh and santa monica and other arterial streets of west los angeles establishments catering to retired couples and working men and women who required a closein address mostly these latter single people were men clerks white collar workers and the like for the proprietor was strongly prejudiced against unattached women put it this way mr dillon he said during the course of their initial meeting i rent to a woman and she has to have a room with a bath i insist on it see because otherwise shes got the hall bath tied up all the time washing her goddamn hair and her clothes and every other damned thing she can think of so the minimum for a room with a bath is seventeen a week almost eighty bucks a month just for a place to sleep and no cooking allowed and just how many of these chicks make enough to pay eighty a month for a sleeping room and take all their meals in restaurants and buy clothes and a lot of frigging goo to smear on the faces that the good lord gave em and and you a godfearing man mr dillon roy nodded encouragingly not for the world would he have interrupted the proprietor people were his business knowing them was and the only way of knowing was to listen to them well so am i i and my late wife goddamn god rest her we entered the church at the same time that was thirtyseven years ago down in wichita falls texas where i had my first hotel and thats where i began to learn about chicks they just dont make the money for hotel livin see and theres only one way they can get it by selling their stuff you know tapping them cute little piggy banks they all got at first they just do it now and then just enough to make ends meet but pretty soon they got the bank open twentyfour hours a day why the hell not is the way they see it all they got to do is open up that cute little slot and the money pours out and its no skin off their butts if they give a hotel a bad name oh i tell you mr dillon ive hotelled all over this wonderful land of ours and im telling you that hookers and hotellin just dont mix its against gods laws and its against mans laws youd think the police would be too busy catching real criminals instead of snooping around for hookers but thats the way the gravy stains as the saying is and i dont fight it an ounce of prevention thats my motto if you keep out the chicks you keep out the hookers and youve got a nice clean respectable place like this one without a lot of cops hanging around why if a cop comes in here now i know hes a new man and i tell him hed better come back after he checks with headquarters and he never comes back mr dillon hes damned well told that it aint necessary because this is a hotel not a hook shop im pleased to hear that mr simms roy said truthfully ive always been very careful where i lived right a mans got to be simms said now lets see you wanted a tworoom suite say parlor bedroom and bath fact is we dont have much demand for suites here got the suites split off into room with bath and room without but he unlocked a door and ushered his prospective tenant into a roomy bedroom its high ceilings marking its prewar vintage the connecting door opened into another room a duplicate of the first except that it had no bath this was the former parlor and simms assured roy that it could be converted back into one in short order sure we can take out this bedroom furniture move back the parlor stuff in no time at all desk lounge easy chairs anything you want within reason some of the finest furniture you ever saw dillon said he would like to take a look at it and simms conducted him to the basement storeroom it was by no means the finest he had ever seen of course but it was decent and comfortable and he neither expected nor wanted anything truly fine he had a certain image to maintain a portrait of a young man who made rather a good living just good no better and lived well within it he inquired the rental on the suite simms approached the issue circuitously pointing out the twin necessities of maintaining a highclass clientele for he would settle for nothing less by god and also making a profit which was goddamn hard for a godfearing man to do in these times why some of these peasants we get in here i mean that try to get in here theyll fight you for a burnedout light globe you just cant please em know what i mean its like crackerjacks you know the more they get the more they want but thats the way the cinnamon rolls i guess and like we used to say down in witchita falls if you cant stand posts you better not dig holes uh one hundred and twentyfive a month mr dillon that sounds reasonable roy smiled ill take it im sorry mr dillon id like to shave it a little for you i aint saying i wouldnt shave it for the right kind of tenant if youd guarantee now to stay a minimum of three months why mr simms said roy why i could make you a special rate ill lean over backward to mr simms dillon said firmly ill take the place on a years lease first and last months rent in advance and one hundred and twentyfive a month will be fine it it will the proprietor was incredulous youll lease for a year at a hundred and twentyfive and and i will i dont believe in moving around a lot i make a profit in my business and i expect others to make one in theirs simms gurgled he gasped his paunch wriggled in his pants and his entire face including the area which extended back into his balding head reddened with pleasure he was a shrewd and practiced student of human nature he declared he knew peasants when he saw them and he knew gentlemen hed immediately spotted roy dillon as one of the latter and youre smart he nodded wisely you know it just aint good business to chisel where you live what the hell whats the percentage in chiselling a hotel for a few bucks people youre going to see every day if its going to make em a little down on you youre absolutely right dillon said warmly simms said he was damned tootin he was right suppose for example that there was an inquiry about a guest of the peasant type what could you honestly say about him anyway beyond saying that he did live there and it was your christian practice to say nothing about a man unless you could say something good but if a gentleman was the subject of the inquiry well then honesty compelled you to say so he didnt simply room at the hotel he lived there a man of obvious character and substance who leased by the year and dillon nodded and smiled letting him ramble on the grosvenorcarlton was the sixth hotel hed visited since his arrival from chicago all had offered quarters which were equal to and as cheap or cheaper than those he had taken here for there is a chronic glut of rooms in los angeless smaller hotels but he had found vaguely indefinable objections to all of them they didnt look quite right they didnt feel quite right only the grosvenorcarlton and simms had had the right feel and look one more thing simms was saying now this is your home see renting like you do its just the same as if you were in an apartment or house its your castle like the law says and if you should want to have a guest you know a lady guest why you got a perfect right to thank you for telling me roy nodded gravely i dont have anyone in mind at the moment but i usually make friends wherever i go course a finelooking young fellow like you is bound to have lady friends and i bet they got class too none of these roundheels that crumb a place up just by walking through the lobby never dillon assured him im very careful of the friends i make mr simms particularly the lady friends he was careful during his fouryear tenancy at the hotel he had had only one female visitor a divorcee in her thirties and everything about her looks dress and manners was abundantly satisfactory even to the discriminating mr simms the only fault he could find with her was that she did not come often enough for moira langtry was also discriminating given her own way something that dillon frequently refrained from giving her as a matter of policy she wouldnt have come within a mile of the grosvenorcarlton after all she had a very nice apartment of her own a place with one bedroom two baths and a wet bar if he really wanted to see her and she was beginning to doubt that he did why couldnt he come out there well why cant you she said as he sat up in bed phoning to her its no further for you than it is for me but youre so much younger dear a youthful female like you can afford to humor a doddering old man flattery will get you nowhere mister she was pleased im five years older and i feel every minute of it dillon grinned five years older hell she was ten if she was a day the fact is im a little under the weather he explained no no its nothing contagious i happened to trip over a chair the other night in the dark and it gave me a nasty whack in the stomach well i guess i could come thats my girl id hold my breath if i wasnt panting mmm lets hear you pant pant he said you poor thing she said moirall hurry just as fast as she can apparently she had been dressed to go out when he called for she arrived in less than an hour or perhaps it only seemed that way he had got up to unlock the door preparatory to her arrival and returning to bed he had felt strangely tired and faint so he had let his eyes drift shut and when he opened them a very little later seemingly she was entering the room sweeping into it on her tiny spikeheeled shoes a billowing but compact bundle of woman with glossily black hair and direct darklyburning eyes she paused just inside the threshold for a moment selfassured but suppliant posing like one of those arrogantly inviting mannequins then she reached behind her feeling for and finding the doorkey and turning it with a soft click roy forgot to wonder about her age she was old enough was moira langtry she was young enough his silent approval spoke to her and she gave a little twitch to her body letting the ermine stole hang from one shoulder then hips swaying delicately she came slowly across the room small chin outthrust seemingly tugged forward by the bountiful imbalance within the small white blouse she stopped with her knees pressed against his bed and looking upward he could see nothing but the tip of her nose above the contours of her breasts raising a finger he poked her in one then the other youre hiding he said come out come out wherever you are she sank gracefully to her knees let her dark eyes burn into his face you stink she said tonelessly the blouse shimmering with her words i hate you the twins seem to be restless he said maybe we should put them to bed you know what im going to do im going to smother you he said death where is thy sting and then he was necessarily voiceless for a while after an incredibly soft sweetsmelling eternity he was allowed to come up for air and he spoke to her in a whisper you smell good moira like a bitch in a hothouse darling what a beautiful thing to say maybe you dont smell good i do too you just said so it could be your clothes its me want me to prove it to you he did and she did when he first settled in los angeles roy dillons interest in women was prudently confined by necessity he was twentyone an oldish twentyone his urge toward the opposite sex was as strong as any mans flourishing even stronger perhaps because of the successes that lay behind him but he was carrying light as the saying is he had looked around extensively and carefully before choosing los angeles as a permanent base of operations and his capital was now reduced to less than a thousand dollars that was a lot of money of course unlike the bigcon operator whose elaborate scenesetting may involve as much as a hundred thousand dollars the shortcon grifter can run on peanuts but roy dillon while remaining loyal to the short con was abandoning the normal scheme of things at twentyone he was weary of the hitandget he knew that the constant getting jumping from one town to another before the heat got too hot could absorb most of the hits even of a thrifty man so that he might work as hard and often as he safely could and still wind up with the wolf nipping at the seat of his threadbare pants roy had seen such men once on an excursion special out of denver he had run into a mob of them poor devils so depleted in capital that they had had to pool their resources they were working in a monte swindle the dealer was cast as the wise guy whom the others were determined to take while he turned his head to argue with the two shills holding the three cards open on his palm the roper had drawn a small mark on the top card winking extravagantly at roy take him pal his stage whisper was ridiculously loud put down that big bill you got the fifty or the hundred roy whispered back the hundred hurry could i bet five hundred well uh naw you just better make it a hundred to start the dealers conveniently outstretched hand was getting tired the shills were running out of arguments to distract his attention but roy persisted with his cruel joke how big is the marked card an ace damnit the other two are deuces now does an ace beat deuces does an hell yes damnit now bet the other passengers in the bar car were catching on beginning to grin roy laboriously took out his wallet and took out a cnote the dealer counted out a crumpled mass of ones and fives then he shuffled palming the marked ace for a marked deuce and switching one of the deuces for an unmarked ace one that was unmarked that is to the naked eye the showdown came the three cards were slapped face down on the table roy studied them squinting i cant see so good he complained let me borrow your glasses and deftly he appropriated the dealers readers through the tinted glass he promptly identified the ace and pulled in the money the mob slunk out of the car to the jeers of the other passengers at the next town a wide place in a muddy road they jumped the train probably they had no funds to ride farther as the train pulled out roy saw them standing on the deserted platform shoulders hunched against the cold naked fear on their pale gaunt faces and in the warm comfort of the club car he shivered for them he shivered for himself that was where the hitandget landed you where it could land you this or something far worse than this was the fate of the unrooted men to whom roots were a hazard rather than an asset and the bigcon boys were no more immune to it than their relatively petty brethren in fact their fate was often worse suicide dope addiction and the dts the big house and the nut house she sat up swinging her legs off the bed and got a cigarette from the reading stand after it was lit he took it for himself and she got herself another roy she said look at me oh i am looking dear believe me i am now please is is this all we have roy is it all were going to have im not knocking it understand but shouldnt there be something more how could we top a thing like that tickle each others feet she looked at him silently the burning eyes turning lackluster staring at him from behind an invisible veil without turning her head she extended a hand and slowly tamped out her cigarette that was a funny he said you were supposed to laugh oh i am laughing dear she said believe me i am she reached down picked up a stocking and began to draw it on a little troubled he pulled her around to face him what are you driving at moira marriage i didnt say that but thats what i asked she frowned hesitating then shook her head i dont think so im a very practical little girl and i dont believe in giving any more than i get that might be pretty awkward for a matchbook salesman or whatever you are he was stung but he kept on playing would you mind handing me my first aid kit i think ive just been clawed dont worry kittys had all her shots the fact is the matchbooks arejust a sideline my real business is running a whorehouse overhead and income were always in a neckandneck race one sour deal and they were on the skids and it wasnt going to happen to roy dillon for his first year in los angeles he was strictly a square john an independent salesman calling on small businessmen gliding back into the grift he remained a salesman and he was still one now he had a credit rating and a bank account he was acquainted with literally hundreds of people who would attest to the excellence of his character sometimes they were required to do just that when suspicion threatened to build into a police matter but naturally he never called upon the same ones twice and it didnt happen often anyway security gave him selfassurance security and selfassurance had bred a high degree of skill in accomplishing so much he had had no time for women nothing but the casual comeandgo contacts which any young man might have it was not until late in his third year that he had started looking around for a particular kind of woman someone who was not only highly desirable but who would be willing to even prefer to accept the only kind of arrangement which he was willing to offer he found her moira langtry that is in church it was one of those screwball outfits which seem to flourish on the west coast the head clown was a yogi or a swami or something of the kind while his audience listened as though hypnotized he droned on and on of the supreme wisdom of the east never once explaining why the worlds highest incidence of disease death and illiteracy endured at the fount of said wisdom roy was a little stunned to find such a one as moira langtry present she just wasnt the type he was aware of her puzzlement when she saw him but he had his reasons for being there it was an innocent way of passing the time cheaper than movies and twice as funny also while he was doing very well as it was he was not blind to the possibility of doing better and a man just might see a way to do it at gatherings like these the audiences were axiomatically boobs mostly welltodo boobs middleaged widows and spinsters women suffering from a vague itch which might be scratched for a bundle so well you never knew did you you could keep your eyes open without going out on a limb the clown finished his act baskets were passed for the adoration offering moira tossed her program in one of them and walked out grinning dillon followed her she was lingering in the lobby making a business out of pulling on her gloves as he approached she looked up with cautious approval now what he said was a nice girl like you doing in a place like that oh you know she laughed lightly i just dropped in for a glass of yogurt tsk tsk its a good thing i didnt offer you a martini it certainly is i wont settle for less than a double scotch they took it from there it took them rapidly to where they were now or reasonable facsimiles thereof lately today in particular he sensed that she wanted it to take them somewhat further there was just one way of handling that in his opinion with the light touch no one could simultaneously laugh and be serious he let his hand walk down her body and come to rest on her navel you know something he said if you put a raisin in that you could pass as a cookie dont she said picking up his hand and dropping it to the bed or you could draw a ring around it and pretend youre a doughnut im beginning to feel like a doughnut she said the part in the middle oh fine i was afraid it might be something shameful then cutting him off firmly pulling him back into line but you see what im driving at roy we dont know a thing about each other were not friends were not even acquainted its just been early to bed and early to bed from the time we met you said you werent knocking it im not its very necessary to me but i dont feel that it should begin and end with that its like trying to live on mustard sandwiches and you want pate steak something nourishing aah hell roy she shook her head fretfully i dont know maybe it isnt on the menu maybe im in the wrong restaurant madame is too cruel pierre weel drown heemself in ze soup pierre doesnt care she said if madame lives or dies hes made that pretty clear she started to rise with a certain finality of movement he caught her and pulled her back to the bed pulled her body against his again he felt of her carefully he smoothed her hair and kissed her lips mmm yes he said yes im sure of it the sale is final and no exchanges here we go again she said out into outer space before we have our feet on the ground i mean i went to a great deal of trouble to find you a very nice little partridge perhaps there are better birds in the bushes but again there might not be and and a bird in bed is better than a bush or something im afraid im crabbing your monologue roy wait he held onto her im trying to tell you something that i like you and that im lazy i dont want to look any further so just show me the price tag and if can ill buy thats better i have an idea it might be quite profitable for both of us so where do we begin a few evenings on the town a fling at las vegas mmm no iguess not besides you couldnt afford it surprise he said curtly i wouldnt even make you pay your own way now roy she rumpled his hair affectionately that isnt the kind of thing have in mind anyway a lot of girls glitter and glassware if were going some place it ought to be at the other end of the street you know relaxed and quiet so that we can talk for a change well la jollas nice this time of year la jollas nice any time of year but are you sure you can afford keep it up he warned her one more word of that song and youll have the reddest butt in la jolla people will think its another sunset pooh whos afraid of you and get the hell out of here will you go crawl back under your culvert youve drained me dry and got me to splurge my lifes savings and now you want to talk me to death she laughed fondly and got up when she was dressed she knelt again at his bedside for a goodbye kiss are you sure youre all right roy she smoothed the hair back from his forehead you look rather pale oh god he groaned will this woman never leave she puts me through a double shift and then she says i look pale she left smiling smugly very pleased with herself roy arose wearily his legs wobbling as he made the round trip to the bathroom he dropped back down on the bed in a heap a little worried about himself for the first time what could be the cause of this anyway this strange overpowering fatigue not moira surely he was used to her not the fact that he had eaten very little during the past three days he often had spells when he didnt feel hungry and this had been one of them whatever he ate bounced back in a brownishcolored liquid which was strange since hed eaten nothing but ice cream and milk frowning he leaned forward and examined himself there was a faint purplishyellow bruise on his stomach but it didnt hurt any more unless he pushed on it very hard hed had no pain since the day he was slugged so he shrugged and lay back down it was just one of those things he guessed he didnt feel sick if a man was sick he felt sick he piled the pillows on top of one another and reclined in a halfsitting position that seemed to be better but tired as he was he was restless with an effort he reached his trousers from a nearby chair and dug a quarter from the watch pocket offhand it looked like any other quarter but it wasnt quite the tail side was worn down the head was not holding it back between the fleshy part of his first two fingers hidden edgewise by them he could identify the two sides he flipped it into the air caught it and brought it down against his other hand with a smack for this was the smack one version of it one of the three standard shortcon gimmicks tails he murmured and there was tails he tossed the coin again and called for heads and heads came up he began closing his eyes on the calls making sure that he wasnt unconsciously cheating the coin went up and down his palm deceptively smacking the back of his hand heads tails heads heads and then there was no smack his eyes closed and stayed closed that was a little after noon when he opened them again twilight was shading the room and the phone was ringing he looked around wildly not recognizing where he was not knowing where he was lost in a world that was as strange as it was frightening then drifting back into consciousness he picked up the phone yes he said and then what what hows that again for what the clerk was saying made no sense at all a visitor mr dillon a very attractive young lady she says a tactful laugh she says shes your mother at seventeen going on eighteen roy dillon had left home he took nothing with him but the clothes he wore clothes he had bought and paid for himself he took no money but the little in the pockets of his clothes and that too he had earned he wanted nothing from lilly she had given him nothing when he needed it when he was too small to get for himself and he wasnt letting her into the game at this late date he had no contact with her during the first six months he was away then at christmas time he sent her a card and on mothers day he sent her another both were of the gooey sentimental type dripping with sickly sweetness but the latter was a real dilly hearts and flowers and fat little angels swarmed over it in an insanely hilarious montage the engraved message was dedicated to dear old mom and it gushed tearfully of goodnight kisses and platters and pitchers of ovenfresh cookies and milk when a little boy came in from play you would have thought that dear old mom had been the proprietor of a combination dairybakery serving no customer but her own little tyke he was laughing so hard when he sent it that he almost botched up the address but afterward he had some sobering second thoughts perhaps the joke was on him yes perhaps by gibing at her he was revealing a deep and lasting hurt admitting that she was tougher than he and that naturally wouldnt do hed taken everything she had to hand out and it hadnt made a dent in him he damned well mustnt ever let her think that it had so he kept in touch with her after that at christmas and on her birthday and so on but he was very correct about it he just didnt think enough of her he told himself to indulge in ridicule it would take a lot better woman than lilly dillon to get to him the only way he showed his true feelings was in the presents they exchanged for while lilly could obviously afford far better gifts than he he would not admit it at least he did not until the effort to keep up with or outdo her not only threatened his longrange objectives but revealed itself for what it was another manifestation of hurt she had hurt him or so it looked and childishly he was rejecting her attempts at atonement she might think that anyway and he couldnt let her so he had written her casually that giftgiving had been overcommercialized and that they should stick to token remembrances from then on if she wanted to donate to charity in his name fine boys town would be appropriate he of course would make a donation in her name say to some institution for wayward women well but that is getting ahead of the story skipping over its principal element new york is a twohour ride from baltimore at seventeen going on eighteen roy went there the logical objective of a young man whose only assets were good looks and an inherent yen for the fast dollar needing to earn and to be paid immediately he took work selling on a flat commission doortodoor stuff magazines photo coupons cooking utensils vacuum cleaners anything that looked promising all of it promised much and gave little perhaps miles of michigan had made his first month by showing super suitings to his friends and perhaps ohara of oklahoma earned ninety dollars a day by taking orders for the oopsy doodle baby walker but roy doubted it like hell by literally knocking himself out he made as high as in one week but that was his very best week the average was between seventyfive and eighty dollars and he had to hump to get that still it was better than working as a messenger or taking some small clerical job which promised good opportunity and possibility to advance in lieu of an attractive wage promises were cheap suppose he went to one of those places and promised to be president some day so how about a little advance the selling was no good but he knew of nothing else he was very irked with himself here he was nineteen going on twenty and already a proven failure what was wrong with him anyway what had lilly had that he didnt have then he stumbled onto the twenties it was a fluke the chump the proprietor of a cigar store had really pulled it on himself preoccupied roy had continued to fumble for a coin after receiving the change from the bill and the fidgety storekeeper delayed in waiting on other customers had suddenly lost patience for petes sake mister he snapped its only a nickel just pay me the next time youre in then he threw back the twenty and roy was a block away before he realized what had happened on the heels of the realization came another an ambitious young man did not wait for such happy accidents he created them and he forthwith started to do so he was coldly told off at two places at three others it was pointed out more or less politely that he was not entitled to the return of his twenty at the remaining three he collected he was exuberant at his good luck he wondered if there were any gimmicks similar to the twenties ways of picking up as much money in a few hours as a fool made in a week there were he was introduced to them that night in a bar whence he had gone to celebrate a customer sat down next to him jostling his elbow a little of his drink was spilled and the man apologetically insisted on buying him a fresh one then he bought still another round at this point of course roy wanted to buy a round but the mans attention had been diverted he was peering down at the floor then reaching down and picking up a dice cube which he laid on the bar did you drop this pal no well look i dont like to drink so fast but if you want to roll me for a round just to keep things even they rolled roy won which naturally wouldnt do at all they rolled again for the price of four drinks and this time the guy won and of course that wouldnt do either he just wouldnt allow it hell they were just swapping drinks friendly like and he certainly wasnt going to walk out of here winner well roll for eight drinks this time well call it five bucks even and then the tat with its rapidly doubling bets is murder on a fool that is its vicious beauty unless he is carrying very heavy the man withthebestofit strips him on a relatively innocent number of winning rolls roys griftings were down the drain in twenty minutes in another ten all of his honest money had followed it the guy felt very bad about it he said so himself roy must take back a couple bucks of his loss and but the taste of the grift was strong in roys mouth the taste and the smell he said firmly that he would take back half of the money the grifter his name was mintz could keep the other half for his services as an instructor in swindling you can begin the lessons right now he said start with that dice gimmick you just worked on me there were some indignant protests from mintz some stern language from roy but in the end they adjourned to one of the booths and that night and for some nights afterward they played the roles of teacher and pupil mintz held back nothing on the contrary he talked almost to the point of becoming tiresome for here was a blessed chance to drop pretense he could show how smart he was as his existence normally precluded doing and do it in absolute safety mintz did not like the twenties it took a certain indefinable something which he did not have and he never worked it without a partner someone to distract the chump while the play was being made as for working with a partner he didnt like that either it cut the score right down the middle it put an apple on your head and handed the other guy a shotgun because grifters it seemed suffered an irresistible urge to beat their colleagues there was little glory in whipping a fool hell fools were made to be whipped but to take a professional even if it cost you in the long run ah that was something to polish your pride mintz liked the smack it was natural you know everyone matched coins he particularly liked the tat whose many virtues were almost beyond enumeration hook a group of guys on that tat and you had it made for the week the tat must always be played on a very restricted surface a bar or a booth table thus you could not actually roll the die although of course you appeared to you shook your hand vigorously holding the cube on a high point never shaking it at all and then you spun it out letting it skid and topple but never turn if the marks became suspicious you shot out of a cup or more likely a glass since you were in a bar room but again you did not really shake the die you held it as before clicking it vigorously against the glass in a simulated rattle and then you spun it out as before it took practice sure everything did if things got too warm the bartender would often give you a takeout for a good tip call you to the phone or say that the cops were coming or something like that bartenders were chronically fed up with drinkers theyd as soon see them chumped as not if it made them a buck and unless the guys were their friends mintz knew of many gimmicks other than the three standards some of them promised payoffs exceeding the normal shortcon top of a thousand dollars but these invariably required more than one man as well as considerable time and preparation were in short bordering bigcon stuff and they had one very serious disadvantage if the fool tipped you were caught you hadnt made a mistake you hadnt just been unlucky youd just had it there were two highly essential details of grifting which mintz did not explain to his pupil one of them defied explanation in was an acquired trait something each man had to do on his own and in his own way ie retaining a high degree of anonymity while remaining in circulation you couldnt disguise yourself naturally it was more a matter of not doing anything of avoiding any mannerism any expression any tone or pattern of speech any posture or gesture or walk anything at all that might be remembered thus the first unexplained essential presumably mintz didnt explain the second one because he saw no need to it was something that roy must certainly know the lessons ended roy industriously went to work on the grift he acquired a handsome wardrobe he moved to a good hotel indulging himself extravagantly he still built up a roll of more than four thousand dollars months passed then one day when he was eating in an astoriasection lunchroom a detective came in looking for him conferring with the proprietor he described roy to a t he had no photo of him but he did have a police artists reconstruction and it was an excellent likeness roy could see them looking down his way as they talked and he thought wildly of running of beating it back through the kitchen and on out the back door probably the only thing that kept him from running was the weakness of his legs and then he looked at himself in the backcounter mirror and he breathed a shuddery sigh of relief the day had turned warm after he left his hotel and hed checked his hat coat and tie in a subway locker then only an hour or so ago hed got a butchstyle haircut so he was changed considerably enough anyway to keep him from being collared but he was shaken right down to his shoe soles he sneaked back to his hotel room wondering if hed ever have the guts to work again he stayed in the hotel until dark and then he went looking for mintz mintz was gone from the small hotel where he had lived hed left months ago leaving no forwarding address roy started hunting for him by sheer luck he found him in a bar six blocks away the grifter was horrified when roy told him what had happened you mean youve been working here all this time youve been working steady my god do you know where ive been in the last six months a dozen places all the way to the coast and back but why i mean new yorks a big city why mintz cut him off impatiently new york wasnt a big city he said it just had a lot of people in it and they were crammed into a relatively small area and no you didnt help your odds much by getting out of jampacked manhattan and into the other boroughs not only did you keep bumping into the same people people who worked in manhattan and lived in astoria jackson heights et cetera but you were more conspicuous there easier to be spotted by the fools and kid a blind man could spot you look at that haircut look at the fancy wristwatch and them threetone sports shoes why dont you wear a black eyepatch too and a mouthful of gold teeth roy reddened he asked troubledly if every city was like this did you have to keep jumping from place to place using up your capital and having to move on just about the time you got to know your way around what do you want mintz shrugged egg in your beer you can usually play a fairly long stand in los angeles because it aint just one town its a county full of towns dozens of em and with traffic so bad and a lousy transportation system the people dont mix around like they do in new york but he wagged a finger severely but that still doesnt mean you can run wild kid youre a grifter see a thief youve got no home and no friends and no visible means of support and you damned well better not ever forget it i wont roy promised but mintz yeah roy smiled and shook his head keeping his thought to himself suppose i did have a home a regular place of residence suppose i had hundreds of friends and acquaintances suppose i had a job and and there was a knock on the door and he said come in lilly and his mother came in she didnt seem to have aged a year in the seven since hed last seen her he was twentyfive now which meant that she was crowding thirtynine but she appeared to be in her very early thirties say about thirtyone or two she looked like like why of course moira langtry that was who she reminded him of you couldnt say that they actually looked like each other they were both brunettes and about the same size but there was absolutely no facial resemblance it was more a type similarity than a personal one they were both members of the same flock women who knew just what it took to preserve and enhance their natural attractiveness women who were either endowed with what it took or spared no effort in getting it lilly took a chair diffidently unsure of her welcome quickly explaining that she was in los angeles on business im handling playback money at the tracks roy ill be getting back to baltimore as soon as the races are over roy nodded equably the explanation was reasonable playback knocking the odds down on a horse by heavy parimutuel betting was common in bigtime bookmaking im glad to see you lilly id have been hurt if you hadnt dropped by and im glad to see you roy i she looked around the room leaning forward a little to peer into the bathroom slowly her diffidence gave way to a puzzled frown roy she said whats this all about why are you living in a place like this whats wrong with it stop kidding me it isnt you thats what wrong just look at it look at those corny clown pictures thats a sample of my sons taste roy dillon goes for corn roy would have laughed if he hadnt been so weak the four pictures were his own additions to the decorations concealed in their box frames was his grifted dough fiftytwo thousand dollars in cash he murmured that he had rented the place as he found it the best that he could afford after all he was just a commission salesman and and thats another thing lilly said four years in a town like los angeles and a peanut selling job is the best you can do you expect me to believe that its a front isnt it this dump is a front youre working an angle and dont tell me youre not because i wrote the book lilly his faint voice seemed to come from miles away lilly mind your own damned business she said nothing for a moment recovering from his rebuke reminding herself that he was more stranger than son then halfpleading you dont have to do it roy youve got so much on the ball so much more than i ever had and you know what it does to a person roy i his eyes were closed an apparent signal to shut up or get out forcing a smile she said okay she wouldnt start scolding the minute she saw him why are you still in bed sson are you sick nothing he muttered just she came over to the side of the bed timidly she put the palm of her hand to his forehead let out a startled gasp why roy youre ice cold what light bloomed over his pillows as she switched on the table lamp he heard another gasp roy whats the matter youre as white as a sheet nothin his lips barely moved no ssweat lilly suddenly he had become terribly frightened he knew without knowing why that he was dying and with the terrible fear of death was an unbearable sadness unbearable because there was no one who cared no one to assuage it no one no one at all to share it with him only one death roy well what are you kicking about but they cant eat you can they they can kill you but they cant eat you dont he sobbed his voice pushing up through an overpowering drowsiness ddont laugh at me i i wont im not laughing honey i listen to me roy she squeezed his hand fiercely you dont seem to be sick no fever or where do you hurt did someone hurt you he didnt hurt there had been no pain since the day of his slugging but hit he mumbled three days ago three days ago how where were you hit what wait a minute darling just wait until mother makes a phone call and then in what was record time for the grosvenorcarlton she got an outside line she spoke over the phone her voice cracking like a whip lilly dillon doctor i work for justus amusement company out of baltimore and what dont you brush me off buster dont tell me you never heard of me if i have to have bobojustus call you well all right then lets see how fast you can get over here she slammed down the receiver and turned back to roy the doctor came out of breath and looking a little sullen then forgetting his wounded dignity as his eyes drank in lilly so sorry if i was abrupt mrs dillon now dont tell me this strapping young man can be your son never mind that lilly chopped off his flattery do something for him i think hes in a pretty bad way well now lets just see he moved past her looked down at the pale figure on the bed abruptly his light manner washed away and his hand moved quickly testing roys heart probing for pulse and blood pressure how long has he been like this mrs dillon curtly not turning to look at her i dont know he was in bed when i came in about an hour ago we talked and he seemed to be all right except that he kept getting weaker and ill bet he did any history of ulcers no i mean im not sure i havent seen him in seven years and whats the matter with him doctor do you know whether hes been in any kind of accident during the last few days anything that might have injured him internally no she corrected herself again well yes he was he was trying to tell me about it three days ago he was hit in the stomach some barroom drunk i suppose any vomiting afterward coffeecolored the doctor yanked down the sheet nodding grimly at sight of the bruise well i dont know whats his bloodtype do you know that no i he dropped the sheet and picked up the phone as he summoned an ambulance breaking the hotels outside call record for the second time that day he stared at lilly with a kind of worried reproach he hung up the phone i wish youd known his blood type he said if i could have got some blood into him now instead of having to wait until hes typed is it hell be all right wont he well do all we can oxygen will help some but will he be all right his bloodpressure is under a hundred mrs dillon hes had an internal hemorrhage stop it she wanted to scream at him i asked you a question i asked you if im sorry he said evenly the answer is no i dont think he can live until he gets to the hospital lilly swayed she got hold of herself drawing herself straight making her voice firm and she spoke to the doctor very quietly my son will be all right she said if he isnt ill have you killed carol roberg arrived at the hospital at five in the afternoon an hour before the beginning of her shift the mere thought of being late to work terrified her and by coming so early she could get a bargainpriced meal in the employees cafeteria before going on duty that was very important to carol a good meal at a low price even when she wasnt hungry which was seldom even in america where no one seemed ever to be hungry she was always subtly worried about when she would eat again her white nurses uniform was so stiffly starched that it gave off little pops and crackles as she hurried down the marble corridor cut overlong in the european fashion it made her look like a child dressed in its mothers clothes and the skirt and cuffs flared upward at the corners seeming to set a pattern for her eyes her mouth her brows and the tips of her short bobbed hair all her features had an amusing turnedup look and no amount of inner solemnity could conquer it in fact the more solemn she was the more determinedly severe the greater was the effect of suppressed laughter a child playing at being a woman entering the cafeteria she moved straight to the long serving counter blushing selfconsciously careful to avoid looking at anyone who might be looking her way several times here and elsewhere she had been drawn into joining other diners and the experience had been painfully awkward the men interns and technicians made jokes which were beyond her limited idiom so that she never knew quite what her response should be as for the other nurses they were nice enough they wanted to be friendly but there was a great gulf between them which only time could bridge she did not talk or think or act as they did and they seemed to take her ways as a criticism of theirs carol took a tray and silverware from the serving counter and studied the steamy expanse of food carefully weighing each item against the other she made her selections potatoes and gravy were eight cents then the twoorder would be fifteen yes a penny less the twoorder the fat counter woman laughed oh you mean a double a double yes it is fifteen the woman hesitated looked around conspiratorially tell you what honey well make it the same price as a single hmm ill just go a little bit heavy with the spoon you can do this carols turnedup eyes rounded with awe it would not cause trouble for me hah i own this joint honey carol guessed that that made it all right it would not be stealing her conscience comfortable she also accepted the two extra sausages which the woman buried beneath her order of knockwurst and sauerkraut she was hesitating at the dessert section about to decide that she could have a strudel in view of her other economies when she heard the voices back down the line the fat woman talking to another attendant kosher kid can really put it away cant she when she gets it for nothin sure thats how them kikes get ahead carol froze for a moment then stiffly she moved on paying her check and carrying her tray to a table in a distant corner of the room she began to eat methodically forcing down the suddenly tasteless food until it once again became tasteful and desirable that was the way one had to do to do the best one could and accept things as they were usually they did not seem so bad after a while if they were not actually good then they became so by virtue of the many things that were worse almost everything was relatively good eating was better than starving living better than dying even a simulated friendliness was better than none at all people had to care at least a little to pretend her own kith and kind immigrants like herself had not always done that she had come to the united states under the auspices of relatives an aunt and uncle who had fled austria before the anschluss now welltodo they had taken her into their home and given her probationary status as a daughter but with certain unstated stipulations that she become one with them that she live as they lived without regard to how she had lived before and carol could not do that the ritual dining the numerous sets of dishes each to be used only for a certain kind of food were almost offensive to her so much waste in a world filled with want contrariwise it seem foolish to fast in the midst of abundance she was repelled by the bearded pinkmouthed shiddem for all his judaic learning to her he seemed a parasite who should be forced to work as others did she was shocked to find stupidity masquerading as pride or what she thought of as stupidity the imperviousness to a new language and a new and possibly better way of life all in all she was frightened by the conscientious apartness sensing in it the seeds of tragedy because they were good to her or meant to be she tried to be as they were she was even willing to believe that they were right and that she was wrong but mere trying willingness was not enough for them they accused her of abandoning her faith one that she could never remember knowing their tyranny in its own way seemed almost as bad as that she had fled from and at last she had had to flee from them life outside the refugee world wasnt easy the alternative to it often seemed to be a world with quite as many prejudices as the one she had left but it was not always that way there were some people who were completely indifferent to what she had been that is they were indifferent in a critical sense they the rare few mrs dillon was their best example accepted her for what she was now and she saw mrs dillon approaching moving past the other tables with her easy imperiousness hastily carol set down her teacup and came to her feet please sit down mrs dillon i will get you some tea yes some coffee something to eat nothing lilly smiled waving her back to her chair i wont be staying at the hospital this evening and i wanted to talk to you before i left there is something wrong i i have done no youre doing just fine everythings fine lilly assured her get yourself some more tea if you like theres no hurry id better not carol shook her head it is almost six and the other nurse im paying the other nurse too lilly said flatly shes working for me not the hospital if she doesnt want to work a little overtime for extra pay she can quit carol nodded and murmured meekly this was a side of mrs dillon she had never seen before lillys smile returned now just relax and rest easy carol i like your work i like you i hope you like me too my son and i oh i do very much you have been very nice to me why is it that you dont have a regular job that youre just working extra well carol hesitated over her answer the hospital almost every hospital it graduates its own nurses and i am not such a graduate then the regular jobs like in the doctors offices they usually want skills that i do not have often bookkeeping and shorthand and i understand how do you make out on this special duty work all right well i do not always make so much carol said seriously it depends on how much work i can get and that is not always a great deal and of course there are the fees to the nurses registry but well it is enough whatever when know more and when i better understand english yeah sure how old are you carol twentyseven oh lilly was surprised i wouldnt have thought you were that old i feel much older sometimes like i had lived forever but yes i am twentyseven well no matter any boy friends going steady with anyone no lilly thought that was strange too now a girl like you must have had plenty of opportunities carol shook her head her upturned features humorously solemn she lived in a furnished room she pointed out and she could not properly receive young men in it then since it was necessary to work whenever she could and since she worked irregular hours it was not possible to plan ahead nor to be sure of keeping a social engagement if any were made also she concluded blushing also the young men try to do certain things they often i am greatly embarrassed lilly nodded gently feeling a strange tenderness toward the girl here was something someone absolutely real and the reality was all to the good perhaps under different circumstances she might have turned out as wholesome and honest and real as carol was but she shook herself mentally to hell with that noise she was what she was and thus roy had become what he was and there was nothing to be done about her assuming that she wanted anything done but perhaps it wasnt too late to youre probably wondering why i was so nosy inquisitive i mean lilly said well its like this i dont want to jinx my son by saying that hes going to be all right but oh im sure he will be mrs dillon i dont say it lilly said sharply knocking on the wooden top of the table it might bring bad luck lets just say that when and if he is able to leave the hospital id like you to go on looking after him for a while at my apartment i mean do you think youd like that carol nodded eagerly her eyes shining shed already had more than two weeks of steady employment with mrs dillon more than shed ever had before what a wonderful thing it would be to go on working for her and her nice son indefinitely well thats fine then lilly said its all settled now ive got to run along but yes i was just wondering carol hesitated i was wondering if if mr dillon would want me he is always very kind but she hesitated again not knowing how to say what she meant without sounding impolite lilly said it for her you mean roy resents me hes against anything i do simply because i do it oh no i did not mean that not exactly anyway i was just well its close enough lilly smiled trying to make her voice light but dont worry about it dear youre working for me not him anything do for him is for his own good so it doesnt matter if hes a little resentful at first carol nodded a trifle dubiously lilly arose from her chair and began drawing on her gloves well just keep this to ourselves for the time being she said its just possible that roy will suggest it himself whatever you say carol murmured they walked to the door of the cafeteria together then lilly headed toward the lobby entrance and carol hurried away toward her patients room the other nurse left as soon as they had checked the chart together roy gave carol a weakly lazy grin and told her she looked very bad you belong in bed miss roberg he said ill give you part of mine i do not carol blushed furiously you will not oh but you do ive seen girls with that look before bed is the only thing that will cure em carol giggled unwillingly feeling very wicked roy told her severely that she mustnt laugh about such things youd better behave or i wont kiss you goodnight then youll be sorry i will not carol blushed and wriggled and giggled now you stop it roy stopped the teasing after a minute or two she was honestly embarrassed by it he guessed and he wasnt up to much funmaking himself suspended from a metal stand on the left side of his bed was a jar of syrupylooking blood a tube extended from the upended top of it to a quilllike needle in his arm on the right sideof the bed a similar device dripped saline water into the artery of his other arm the blood and water had been fed into him thus since his arrival in the hospital lying constantly on his back with his arms held flat he ached almost incessantly his only relief coming when his body and arms became numb sometimes he found himself wondering if life was worth such a price but the wondering was humorous strictly on the wry side hed had a long look at death and he hadnt liked the look of it at all he was very very glad to be alive now that he was apparently out of danger however he did regret one thing that it was lilly who had saved his life the one person to whom he wished to owe nothing he now owed everything a debt he could never repay he could fret and argue the matter in his mind he could cite his own incredibly tough constitution an irrestible will to live as the true source of his survival the doctors themselves had practically said as much hadnt they it was scientifically impossible theyd said for a man to live when his blood pressure and hemoglobin fell below a certain level yet his had been well below that level when he arrived at the hospital unassisted he had been clinging to life on his own before anything had been done for him so so nothing hed needed help fast and lilly had got it for him moira hadnt seen his need he hadnt no one had but lilly and just where for that matter had he got the mental and physical toughness to hold on until he had medical help from strangers huhuh any way you looked at it he owed his life to lilly and lilly unconsciously or deliberately was making sure that he didnt forget it in a sweetly feline fashion shed put such a frost on moira langtry that moira had stopped coming to the hospital after a couple of visits she called every day letting him know that she was concerned about him but she didnt come back again and lilly often managed to be on hand at the time of her calls practically restricting his end of the conversation to monosyllables lilly obviously intended to break up his affair with moira nor did her intentions end there shed selected a day nurse for him who was a real turtle competent enough but homely as a mud fence then by contrast shed picked a little doll for night duty a kid that was bound to appeal to him even if lilly hadnt given her a clear field with no competition oh he could see what was happening everywhere he looked he could see the shadow of lillys fine hand and just what could he do about it anyway tell her to get the hell away and leave him alone could he say okay you saved my life does that give you any claim on me a doctor came in not the one who had visited at the hotel lilly had dismissed him right at the beginning but a merrylooking young man behind him came an orderly wheeling a metaltopped cart roy looked at the implements on it and let out a groan oh no not that thing again you mean you dont like it the doctor laughed hes kidding us isnt he nurse he loves to have his stomach pumped please carol frowned reprovingly it is not funny aah you cant hurt this guy rally round now and well get it over with the orderly held him on one side one hand clamping over the intravenous needle carol held the needle into the other arm her free hand poised over a bowl of tiny ice cubes the doctor picked up a narrow rubber tube and pushed it up into his nose now hold still keedo hold still or youll jerk those needles loose roy tried to hold still but he couldnt as the tube went up into his nose and down into his throat he jerked and struggled gagging gasping for breath he tried to break free of them and the doctor cursed him merrily and carol pressed little ice lumps between his lips please to swallow mr dillon swallow the ice and the tube will go down with it roy kept swallowing at last the tube was down his throat and into his stomach the doctor made some minor adjustments in it moving it up and down slightly hows that not hitting bottom is it roy said he didnt think so it seemed to be all right good the doctor checked the glass receptacle to which the pump was attached ill be back in thirty minutes nurse if he gives you any trouble sock him in the stomach carol nodded coldly she looked after him frowning as he strode out of the room then came over to the bed and patted away the sweat from roys face i am sorry i hope it does not bother you too much its all right he felt a little abashed at the fuss he had made im just kind of conscious of it you know i know the worst part is getting it down but afterward it is not good you cannot swallow well and your breathing is eversoslightly hampered and never do you become accustomed to it always there is the consciousness of something wrong you sound like youd been pumped yourself i have been many times internal bleeding no i began to bleed after a time but i was not bleeding to begin with yes he frowned i dont get you why were you being pumped out if i dont know she smiled suddenly and shook her head it was a very long time ago anyway it is not pleasant to talk about but and i think you should not talk so much either you will just lie still please and do nothing to disturb your stomach contents i dont see how there could be any contents well anyway she said firmly and he let it go at that it was easy to drop the subject easy in his insistent need to survive to ignore all possible distractions years of practice had made it so easy that it was almost automatic he lay quietly watching carol as she moved about the room seeing her youthful freshness as a refreshing relief from moira a very nice little kid he thought just about as nice as they came so doubtless she must be left that way on the other hand wouldnt it be a little strange if a girl as attractive as she was had remained strictly on the nice side werent the odds all against it and if she did know the score well it was something to think about certainly it would be a pleasant way of putting lilly in her place the doctor returned he checked the glass container of the pump and chortled happily nothing but bile thats what hes full of nurse as if you didnt know he removed the stomach tube then wonder of wonders he ordered the intravenous needles removed from roys arms why not why should we baby a goldbrick like you oh go to hell roy grinned at him flexing his arms luxuriously just let me stretch sassy hmm how about something to eat you mean that liquid chalk you call milk bring it on brother nope tonight you get steak mashed potatoes the works you can even have a couple of cigarettes youre kidding the doctor shook his head became serious you havent bled any in three days its time your stomach resumed peristalsis started toughening itself up and it cant do it on liquids roy was just a little uneasy after all it was his stomach the doctor assured him that he had nothing to worry about if your stomach wont take it well just have to open you up and cut out a piece no trouble at all he walked out whistling again carol looked after him frowning that man ooh i would like to shake him good you think it will be all right roy asked to have solid food i mean im not particularly hungry and of course it will be all right otherwise you would not be allowed to have it she took one of his hands in hers looked down at him so protectively that he wanted to smile he restrained the impulse clinging to her hand while he gently urged her into the chair at his side youre a good little girl he said softly ive never known anyone like you tthank you her eyes fell and her voice dropped to a whisper i have known no one like you either he lay studying her in the gathering twilight of the room examining the small honest face with its tenderly upturning features thinking how much she looked like some gravely innocent child then he turned on his side and eased over near the edge of the bed im going to miss you carol will i see you after i leave here i i do not know she was breathing heavily still not looking at him i i would like to bbut i must work whenever i can whenever i am ccalled and carol yyes come here he drew her forward by the hand his free hand dropping around her shoulders she looked up at last eyes frightened hanging back desperately and then suddenly she was in his arms her face pressed against his like me carol oh yes her head jerked in assent so so much bbut listen he said and then as she listened waiting he was silent putting on the brakes telling himself that this was as far as it should go but was it he would need looking after for a while wouldnt he lilly had hinted at something of the kind suggesting that he stay in her apartment for a week or so hed been against it of course first because it was her suggestion and secondly because it seemed pointless with her away at the tracks so much hed still be on his own but carol shivered against him delicately he started to shove her away and unwillingly his arms tightened around her i was just thinking he said ill still be a little rocky after i leave here maybe yes she raised her head smiled down at him excitedly you would want me to tend you for a while yes that is it youd like that yes oh my yes well he said awkwardly well think about it see what my mother has to say i live in a hotel myself so id have to stay at her place and and it will be all right her eyes were dancing i know how do you mean i mean it is what your mother wants i we were not going to say anything about it yet she was not sure how you would feel and and her voice died away under his flateyed stare quick anxiety tugged at the tippedup corners of her mouth please tthere is something wrong not a thing he said no sir everythings just fine the fourth race was over the trackside crowds surged back through the areaway which passed beneath the grandstand and led into the vaulted arena of bars lunchrooms and parimutuel windows some of them were hurrying smiling broadly or wearing smug tightlipped grins they headed toward payoff windows others the majority came more slowly scanning their racing programs tip sheets and forms their faces indifferent desperate angry or sullen these were the losers and some of them went on through the exits to the parking lot and some stopped at the bars and most of them moved toward the bet windows it was still early in the day there were still a lot of full pockets the crowd would not shake out much before the end of the sixth race lilly dillon collected three bets at as many windows putting the money to one side in her purse for it would have to be accounted forshe hurried toward the bet windows her betting money the playback dough that came by wire each day was already separated into sheafs of twenties fifties and hundreds she used the twenties as much as her limited time would allow usually five and ten at a time with the fifties she was more cautious the hundreds were disposed of with downright stinginess possibly rather probably much of her caution was wasted the treasury agents had no interest in the betting they were normally on the lookout only for wins the cashing in of fistfuls of fifty and hundreddollar tickets and lilly was not there to win and seldom did her activities were largely precautionary not usually concerned with favorites or semifavorites the odds on such horses pretty much took care of themselves she dealt mainly in likely runners and longshots and they rarely wound up in the money when they did she collected on them only when it seemed absolutely safe if it didnt she simply let the winnings go keeping the parimutuel tickets as a matter of record to an extent she was a free agent she had certain general instructions but within them she was allowed and expected to use her own judgment that didnt make things any easier for her of course on the contrary it was a hard job and she was well paid for it and there were ways of adding to that pay ways which bobo justus frowned upon but which were very difficult to detect she strolled off toward one of the bars her eyes shrewdly watchful behind the dark sunglasses several times she stooped quickly and picked up a discarded ticket adding them to the ones in her purse losing tickets were usually thrown away as long as they werent torn or suspiciously trampled she could count them as money spent a certain number of them anyway it wasnt something you could lean on too hard shed only gone overboard once at this meet and that had been a mistake rather shed done it to cover a mistake it had happened almost three weeks ago right after roy had gone into the hospital perhaps that was how it had come about shed had her mind on him instead of her job but anyway a real dog had come in at a hundredandforty for two and she didnt have a dime down on him shed been too frightened and worried to sleep that night shed been even more frightened the next day when the papers hinted at heavy offtrack betting on the nag as an expensive but necessary precaution shed sent five thousand dollars of her own money back to baltimore her pretended winnings on the horse and apparently that had taken the heat off of her for shed had no word from bobo but days passed before she was resting easy for a while she was even carrying a gun when she went to the bathroom she stood at the bar sipping a rum and cola looking at the milling crowd with something approaching disgust where did they come from she thought wearily why did they buck a stupid racket like this many of them were downright shabby some of them even had children with them mothers with kids men in cheap sportshirts and baggy slacks grandmothers with cigarettes dangling from their mouths gaah it was enough to turn a persons stomach she turned away from them shifting wearily from foot to foot she was wearing a sports outfit a simple but expensive ensemble of fawncolored slacks blouse and jacket with flatheeled buckskin oxfords everything was cool and lightweight the most comfortable things she could put on but nothing could compensate for her hours of standing as the fifth and sixth races dragged by as she moved back and forth from the betting and payoff windows the struggle between her growing tiredness and the neverending need to be alert almost reached a stalemate it was hard to think of anything but sitting down of resting for at least a few minutes it was impossible to think about it need and necessity fought with one another pulling her this way and that tugging her forward and holding her back adding unbearably to the burden she already carried there were seats in the grandstand of course but those were for yokels by the time she got into the stands she would be due at the windows the effort of going back and forth would take more from her than it gave as for the clubhouse with its comfortable chairs and pleasant cocktail lounge well naturally that was out there was too much money floating around too much heavy betting the treasury boys loved the place she set down her cup of coffee her third in the last hour and trudged away toward the mutuel windows the seventh race the next to the last was coming up it always drew some of the days heaviest play and the yokels were rushing to buy tickets as lilly pushed her way through them a sardonic thought suddenly struck her and despite her weariness she almost laughed out loud now isn t this something she thought twentyfive years getting out of the mob and im right back in it hell ive never even been away she collected a couple of bets on the seventh disposing of the money as she hurried toward the parking lot there was nothing in the last race that couldnt be missed by beating it out now before the crowd swarmed down from the stands she could avoid the lastminute traffic jam her car was parked back near the gate in a space as near to it as a big tip would buy a convertible it was a very good car but by no means the most expensive not even faintly flashy its one distinctive feature was something that couldnt be seen a secret trunk compartment containing one hundred and thirty thousand dollars in cash as she approached the car now and saw the man standing beside it lilly wondered whether shed ever live to spend the money bobo justus had wavy irongray hair and a deeply tanned chiseledlooking face he was a small man short that is but he had the head and torso of a sixfooter knowing his sensitivity about his height lilly was grateful for her flatheeled shoes that was one thing in her favor at least but she doubted that it would count for much judging by his expression he addressed her tonelessly his lips barely moving you goddamned sillylooking pig driving a goddamned circus wagon why dont you paint a bullseye on it hang a couple of cowbells on the bumper now bo convertibles are quite common in california convertibles are quite common in california he mimicked her weaving his shoulders prissily are they as common as twotiming doublecrossing whores hah are they you sneaky little slut bo she looked around quickly hadnt we better go some place private he drew back a hand as though to slap her then gave her a shove toward the car get with it he said the beverly hills i get you alone and im going to pop every pimple on your pretty pink butt she started the car and drove out through the gate as they joined the stream of townbound traffic he resumed his tightlipped abuse lilly listened attentively trying to decide whether he was building up steam or letting it off probably the last she guessed since it had been almost three weeks since her blunder murderously angry he probably would have taken action before this most of the time she was silent making no response except when it was asked for or seemed urgently indicated told you to watch that fifth race didnt i and by god you really watched it didnt you i bet you stood there grinning clear to your ankles while the dog comes in at a hundredandforty per bo i how much did your pals cut you in for huh or did they give you the same kind of screwing you gave me what the hell are you anyway a studhorse with tits i was down on the nag lilly said quietly you know i was bo after all you wouldnt have wanted me to bet it off the board you were down on it huh now ill ask you just one question do you want to stick to that story or do you want to keep your teeth i want to keep my teeth now ill ask you one more question do you think i got no contacts out here you think i couldnt get a report on the play on that horse no i dont think that im sure you could bo that nag paid off at just the opening price there wasnt hardly a flutter on the tote board from the time the odds were posted he lit a cigarette took a couple of quick angry puffs what kind of crap you handing me anyway lilly there aint enough action to tickle the tote but you claim a fivegrand win now how about it huh you ready to fly straight or not she drew in a deep breath hesitated nodded there was only one thing to do now to tell the truth and hope for the best she did so justus sat turned in the seat studying analyzing her expression throughout the recital when she had finished he faced back around again sat in deadpan silence for several minutes so you were just stupid he said asleep at the switch you think im going to buy that lilly nodded evenly hed already bought it she said three weeks ago suspected the truth before he was told you know you did bo if you hadnt id be dead by now maybe you will be yet sister maybe youll wish you was dead maybe i laid out better than a hundred yards for a screwing just about the highestpriced piece of tail in history i figure on getting what i paid for then youd better do some more figuring lilly said im not that kind of punching bag real sure about that are you positive give me a cigarette please he took a cigarette from his package and tossed it across the seat she picked it up and tossed it back to him light it please bo i need both hands in this traffic she heard a sound something between a laugh and a snort anger and admiration then he lit the cigarette and placed it between her lips as they rode on she could sense the looks he slanted at her almost see the workings of his mind she was a problem to him a very special and valued employee one whom he actually liked had yet erred badly it was unintentional her one serious mistake in more than twenty years of faithful service so there was strong argument for forgiveness on the other hand he was showing unusual forbearance in allowing her to live and more hardly seemed to be indicated obviously there was much to be said for both sides of the debate having forgiven so much he could forgive completely or having forgiven so much he need forgive no more they were almost at the hotel before he reached his decision i got a lot of people working for me lilly i cant have things like this happening it never happened before bo she fought to keep her voice level free of any hint of begging it wont happen again it happened once he said with me thats practically making a habit of it all right she said youre calling the shots you got any kind of long coat in the car anything you can wear home over your clothes no a dull ache came into her stomach he hesitated then said it didnt matter hed lend her his raincoat ought to be right in style out here goddamnedest sloppiestlooking women i ever seen she stopped the car at the hotel entrance and an attendant took charge of it bobo handed her out to the steps then courteously gave her his arm as they entered the building they crossed the lobby bobo holding himself very erect and entered the elevator he had a suite on the fourth floor unlocking the door he motioned for her to precede him she did so letting her body go limp preparing herself for what she knew was coming but you could never prepare for a thing like that not fully the sudden shoveblow sent her hurtling into the room stumbling and tripping over her own feet and finally landing in a skidding sprawl on the floor as she slowly picked herself up he locked the door drew the shades and entered the bathroom emerging immediately with a large towel crossing to the sideboard he took a number of oranges from a bowl of fruit dropped them in the towel and pulled up its ends to form a bag he came toward her swinging it loosely again lilly tried to brace herself with limpness she knew the oranges she knew all such gimmicks though never before had she been the victim of any the oranges was an item from the dummychuckers workbag a frammis of the professional accident fakers beaten with the fruit a person sustained bruises far out of proportion to his actual injuries he looked badly hurt when he was hardly hurt at all but he could be hurt if he was hit hard enough and in certain areas of his body without feeling much pain at the time he could have his internal organs smashed used in just the right way the oranges produced much the same effect as an enema or douche of plasterofparis bobo drew closer he stopped in front of her he moved to one side and little behind her he gripped the towel with both hands and swung and let the oranges spill harmlessly to the floor he gestured she bent to pick up the fruit and then again she was sprawling and his knees were in her back and his hand was against her head and she was pinned spreadeagled against the carpet a couple passed in the hallway laughing and talking a couple from another planet from the dining room from another world came the faint sound of music there was the click of a cigarette lighter the smell of smoke then the smell of burning flesh as he held the glowing coal against the back of her right hand he held it with measured firmnessjust enough to keep it burning without crushing it out his knees worked with expert cruelty the cigarette burned into her hand and his knees probed the sensitive nerves of her spine it was a timeless world an endless hell there was no escape from it there was no relief in it she couldnt cry out it was impossible even to squirm the world was at once to be endured and unendurable and the one possible relief was within her own small body scalding urine spurted from her loins it seemed to pour from her in a flood and bobo stood up releasing her and she got up and went into the bathroom she held her hand under the icewater tap then patted it with a towel and examined it the burn was ugly but it didnt appear to be serious none of the large veins were affected she lowered her slacks and swabbed herself with a slightly moistened towel that was about as much as could be done here the raincoat would cover up her stained clothes she left the bathroom crossed to the lounge where bobo was seated and accepted the drink he gave her he took out his wallet and extended a thick sheaf of new bills your five grand lilly i almost forgot thanks bo how you making out these days anyway stealing much from me not much my folks didnt raise any stupid kids lilly said i just clip a buck here and a buck there it mounts up but nobody gets hurt thats right justus nodded approvingly take a little leave a little i look on it this way lilly said shrewdly enunciating his own philosophy a person that dont look out for himself is too dumb to look out for anyone else hes a liability right bo absolutely youre a thousand percent right lil or else hes working an angle if he doesnt steal a little hes stealing big right i like that suit bo i dont know what there is about it but somehow it makes you look so much taller yeah he beamed at her you really think so you know a lot of people been telling me the same thing their amiable talk continued as twilight slid into the room and lillys hand ached and the wet clothes burned and chafed her flesh she had to leave him feeling good about her she had to make sure that the score between them was settled and that he was actually letting her off so lightly they discussed several business matters she had handled for him in detroit and the twin cities on her circuitous way to the coast bobo revealed that he was only in town for the day tomorrow he was heading back east via vegas galveston and miami another drink lilly well just a short one ive got to be running along pretty soon whats the hurry thought maybe we could have dinner together id like to but it was best not to stay best to quit while she was ahead shed been very very lucky apparently but luck could run out on you ive got a son living here bo a salesman i dont get to see him very often so well sure sure he nodded hows he making out hes in the hospital some kind of stomach trouble i usually visit him every night sure naturally he frowned gettin everything he needs anything i can do lilly thanked him shaking her head hes doing fine i think hell be getting out in a day or two well youd better run along bobo said a boys sick he wants his mother she got the raincoat out of the closet and belted it around her they said good night and she left a little urine had trickled down her legs making them itch and sting and leaving an unpleasant sogginess in her shoes her underpants chafed and stung and the seat of the slacks seemed to have soaked through the ache in her right hand grew spread slowly up into her wrist and arm she hoped she hadnt soiled bobos lounge shed been very lucky considering the amount her blunder must have cost him but a little thing like that might spoil it she picked up her car and drove away from the hotel as she entered her apartment she kicked out of her shoes began flinging her clothes from her leaving them in a trail behind her as she hurried toward the bathroom she closed its door kneeling she went down in front of the toilet as though it were an altar and a great sob shook her body weeping hysterically laughing and crying she began to vomit lucky got off easy boy am i lucky at a few minutes before noon moira langtry came out of the arched door of the hospital and crossed the street to the parking lot shed risen unusually early that day in order to turn herself out with extra care and the result was all that she could have hoped for she was a brunette dream a fragrant sultryeyed vision of loveliness the nurses had looked after her enviously as she tripped down the corridor the doctors and interns had almost drooled their eyes lingering on the delicate shivering of her breasts and the sensual swing of her rounded little hips women almost always disliked moira she was glad that they did taking it as a compliment and returning their dislike men of course were invariably drawn to her a reaction which she expected and cultivated but was emotionally cold to very rarely did they appeal to her roy dillon was one of the rare ones who did in her own way she had been faithful to him during the three years of their acquaintance roy was fun roy stirred her manwise he was the luxury which she had clutched to herself no more than a halfdozen times in her life six men out of the hundreds who had had her body if she could put him to practical use fine she hoped and believed she could do just that if not she still wanted him and she did not intend to have him taken from her it wasnt of course that she absolutely couldnt do without him women who got that way over a man were strictly for the movies but she simply couldnt afford such a loss its clear threat to her security when things reached the point where she couldnt hold a man then she was finished she might as well do a high brodie out of the nearest window so today she had risen early knocking herself out to be a knockout thinking that by arriving at the hospital at an offhour she could see roy alone for a change and tease his appetite for what he had been missing it was highly necessary she felt particularly with his mother working against her and throwing that cute little nurse at him and today after all the trouble shed gone to his damned snotty mother was there it was almost as though mrs dillon had read her mind intuitively suspecting her visit to the hospital and busting her goddamned pants to be there at the same time smoldering moira reached the parking lot the pimplyfaced attendant hastened to open the door of her car and as she climbed into it she rewarded him with a look at her legs she drove off the lot breathing heavily wishing that she could get lilly dillon alone in a good dark alley the more she thought about her recent visit the angrier she became thats what you got for trying to be nice to people you tried to be nice to em and they made you look like a fool please dont tell me that i cant really be roys mother mrs langtry im rather tired of hearing it sorry i didn t mean it of course you re abou tfifty mrs dillon just about dear just about your own age i think id better leave i can give you a lift if you like its only a chrysler convertible but it probably beats riding a bus thanks i have my bicycle with me lilly mrs langtry drives a cadillac not really but dont you think theyre rather common mrs langtry i know theyre a very good car but it seems like every overdressed hustler you see these days is driving a cadillac moiras hands tightened on the wheel of the car she told herself that she could cheerfully kill mrs dillon she could strangle her with her bare hands at her apartment house she turned the cadillac over to the doorman and went on through the lobby to the grille and cocktail lounge it was well into the noonhour now many of the tables were occupied and waiters in smart white pea jackets were hurrying in and out of the kitchen with trays of delicately smelling food one of them brought moira an outsize menu she studied it hesitating over the filet mignon sandwich with stuffed mushrooms she was hungry breakfast had consisted of her usual unsweetened grapefruit and black coffee but she needed a drink more than she needed food two or three strong reassuring drinks and she could allow herself only so many calories a day closing the menu she handed it back to the waiter just a drink now allen she smiled ill eat later on certainly mrs langtry a martini perhaps gibson mmm no something with a little more character i believe a sidecar say with bourbon instead of brandy and allen no triple sec please emphatically the waiter wrote on his pad we always use cointreau in a sidecar now would you like the rim of the glass sugared or plain plain about an ounce and a half of bourbon to an ounce of cointreau and a twist of lime peel instead of lemon right away mrs langtry and allen yes mrs langtry i want that served in a champagne glass a thoroughly chilled glass please certainly moira watched him as he hurried away her carefully composed features concealing an incipient snicker now wasnt that something she thought no wonder the world was going to hell when a grown man pranced around in a monkey suit brownnosing dames who made a big deal out of ordering a belt of booze where had it all started she wondered where the beginning of this detour which had sidetracked civilization into mixing drinks with one hand and stirring up bombs with the other she thought about it not thinking in those words of course simply feeling that the times were out of joint with themselves and that the most emphasis was put on the leastworthwhile pursuits what it all boiled down to really was everybody giving everybody else a hard time for no good reason whatever and the hell of it was that there seemed to be no way of getting on the right track you couldnt be yourself anymore if a woman ordered a straight doubleshot with a beer chaser in a place like this theyd probably throw her out ditto if she asked for a hamburger with raw onions you just couldnt march to your own music nowadays you couldnt even hear it she could no longer hear it it was lost the music which each person had inside himself and which put him in step with things as they should be lost along with the big bluff man the joking introspective man who had taught her how to listen for it cole langley cole the farmer langley her drink came and she took a quick sip of it then with a touch of desperation she halfemptied the glass that helped she could think of cole without wanting to break up she and the farmer had lived together for ten years ten of the most wonderful years of her life it had been a kind of campingoutliving the kind that most people would turn up their noses at but it was that way by choice not necessity with cole it seemed the only possible way to live they always traveled by chaircar in those days they wore whatever they felt like wearing usually overalls or khakis for him and gingham for her when it was possible to obtain cole would have a twoquart jar of corn whiskey in a paper sack instead of eating in diners they carried a huge lunch wrapped in newspapers and every time the train stopped cole would hop off and buy gobs of candy and cold drinks and cookies and everything else he could lay hands on they couldnt begin to eat so much themselves naturally cole gloried in abundance but he was a rather finicky eater and a very light drinker the food and the booze were to pass around and the way he did it no one ever refused he knew just the right thing to say to each person a line of scripture a quote from shakespeare a homely joke before theyd been in the car an hour everyone was eating and drinking and warming up to everyone else and cole would be beaming on them as though they were a bunch of kids and he was a doting father women didnt hate her in those days men didnt look at her the way they did now friendliness the ability to make friends was the farmers stock in trade of course something eventually to be cashed in on through smalltown banks via a series of simpleseeming but bewildering maneuvers but he insisted on regarding the payoffs as no more than a fair exchange for mere money a thing useless and meaningless in itself he traded great hopes anda new perspective on life and nothing was ever managed so that the frammis would show through for what it was always the people were left with hope and belief what more could they want anyway what could be more important in life than having something to hope for and something to believe in for more than a year they lived on a rundown farm in missouri a rocky claysoiled sixty acres with a completely unmodernized house and an outdoor privy that was their best time together it was a twohole privy and sometimes theyd sit together in it for hours peering out at the occasional passersby on the rutted redclay road watching the birds hop about in the yard talking quietly or reading from the stack of old newspapers and magazines that cluttered one corner of the building now look at this moira he would say pointing to an advertisement while the price of steak has gone up twentythree cents a pound in the last decade the price of coal has only advanced one and onehalf cents per pound it looks like the coal dealers are giving us quite a break doesnt it well she didnt always know how to respond to him whether he was just making an idle comment or telling her something or maybe they arent either hed say when you consider that meat is normally sold by the pound and coal by the ton now and then shed come up with just the right answer like the time hed pointed out that four out of five doctors took aspirin and what did she think about that anyway id say the fifth doctor was a lucky guy she said hes the only one who doesnt have headaches and cole had been very pleased with her they got a lot of fun out of the advertisements for years afterward she could look at some nominally straightforward pronouncement and break into laughter beware the wiry zone are germs lurking in your nooks and crannies you too can learn to dance even now she laughed over them but wryly with sardonic bitterness not as she and cole langley had laughed one day when he was trying to dig down to the bottom of the magazine pile it toppled over uncovering a small boxlike structure with a hole cut in the top a kids toilet moira had made some comment about its being cute but cole went on staring at it the laughter dying in his eyes his mouth loosening sickishly then he turned and whispered to her ill bet they killed the kid ill bet its buried down there under us she was stunned speechless she sat staring at him unable to move or speak and cole seemed to take her silence for agreement he went on talking lowvoiced even more impellingly persuasive than he normally was and after a time there was no reality but the hideousness he created and she found herself nodding to what he said no no child should be allowed to live yes all children should be killed at birth or as soon afterward as possible it was the kindest thing to do it was the only way to spare them the futile torment the frustrating and senseless torture the paradoxically evil mess which represented life on the planet earth subconsciously she knew she was seeing him for the first time and that the laughing gregarious cole was only a shadow fleeing its owners convictions subconsciously she wanted to scream that he was wrong that there were no absolutes of any kind and that the real man might well be fleeing the shadow but she lacked the vocabulary for such thoughts the mentality to string them together they wandered about in her subconscious unguided and uncohered while cole as always was utterly convincing so in the end she had been persuaded she agreed with everything he said and suddenly he had started cursing her so she was a faker too a stinking hypocrite she could do nothing for herself and nothing for anyone else because she believed in nothing from that day on the farmer was on the toboggan they jumped from the sticks to st louis and when he wasnt dead drunk he was shooting himself full of hop they had a hefty hunk of loot rather moira had it secretly in the way of many wives although she was not legally his wife she had been ratholing money for years but the substantial sum she had cached wouldnt last a month at the rate he was going so as she saw it there was only one thing to do she took up hustling there was no stigma attached to it in their professional circle in fact it was an accepted practice for a woman to prostitute herself when her man was low on his back but whores per se were a dime a dozen and only girls with class the expensively turnedout dames could pull down the big money and cole was infuriated by a classy moira he grew fanatical in his charges that she was a hypocrite and unbeliever shouting down her pleas that she wished only to help him wildly he declared that she was a whore at heart that she had always been a whore that she had been one when he met her that was not true in her early working life as a photographers model and cocktail waitress she had occasionally given herself to men and received gifts in return but it wasnt the same as whoring she had liked the men involved what she gave them was given freely without bargaining as were their gifts to her so coles false charges insensibly made though they were began to hurt more and more perhaps he didnt know what he was saying or perhaps he did but even the innocent blow of a child can be painful possibly more so than that of an adult since its victim cannot bring himself to strike back his only recourse when the pain becomes unbearable is to put himself beyond the childs reach moiras last memory of cole the farmer langley was that of a wildly weeping man in overalls shouting whore from the curb in front of their swank apartment house as a grinning cabdriver drove her away she wanted to leave the ratholed money for him or half of it at least but she knew it was useless it would either be stolen from him or he would throw it away he was beyond help her help in any event and anything she might do would only prolong his agony what had happened to him she didnt know deliberately she had tried to avoid knowing but she hoped that he was dead it was the best she could hope for the man she had loved so much moira took a long sip of her third bourbon sidecar feelingjust a little skittish she grinned at the man who was approaching her table his name was grable charles grable and he was the manager of the apartment house dressed in striped trousers and a black broadcloth morning coat he had rather closeset eyes and a plump peevishlooking face his attempt to look stern as he sat down gave his small mouth a babylike pout dont tell me now moira said solemnly youre addison simms of seattle and we had lunch together in the fall of what what are you talking about grable snapped now you listen to me moira i how is your wiry zone moira said are hidden germs lurking in your nooks and crannies moira he leaned forward angrily dropping his voice im telling you for the last time moira i want your bill settled today every last penny of it your rent and all the other charges youve run up you either pay it or im locking you out of your apartment now charles dont i always pay my bills arent they always settled one way or another grable flushed and looked over his shoulder a halfpleading halfwhining note came into his voice i cant do that any more moira i simply cant people staying over their leases coming in ahead of their leasedates paying money that i dont show on the books i i i understand moira gave him a sad sultry look you just dont like me any more no no thats not it at all i you dont either she pouted if you did you wouldnt act this way i told you i couldnt help it i i he saw the lurking mockery in her eyes all right he snarled laugh at me but youre not making a thief out of me any longer youre nothing but a cheap little little cheap charles now i didnt think i was at all cheap im through talking he said firmly either you settle up by five oclock tonight or out you go and ill hold on to every thing you own he stamped away with a kind of furtive indignation moira shrugged indifferently and picked up her drink hes a secret sufferer she told herself stop getting up nights men she signaled for her check penciled on a dollar tip for the waiter as he nodded gracefully pulling back her chair she told him that he too could learn to dance all you need is the magic step she said its as simple as onetwothree he laughed politely cloudnine kidding was old stuff in a place like this like some coffee before you leave mrs langtry thank you no moira smiled the drinks were very good allen she left the lounge and passed back through the lobby recovering her car she headed toward the downtown business district all things considered she had lived quite economically since her arrival in los angeles economically that is insofar as her own money was concerned of the boodle with which she had skipped st louis she still had several thousand dollars plus of course such readily negotiable items as her car jewelry and furs but lately she had had an increasingly strong hunch that her life here was drawing to a close and that it was time to cash in wherever and whatever she could she hated to leave the city particularly hated the idea that it would mean giving up roy dillon but it didnt necessarily have to mean that and if it did well it just couldnt be helped hunches were to be heeded you did what you had to do arriving downtown she parked the car on a privatelyoperated lot it was owned by a betterclass jewelry store one which she had patronized both as a buyer and seller though largely the last the doorman touched his cap and swung open the plateglass doors for her and one of the junior executives came forward smiling mrs langtry how nice to see you again now how can we serve you today moira told him he nodded gravely and led her back to a small private office closing the door he seated her at the desk and sat down opposite her moira took a bracelet from her purse and handed it to him his eyes widened appreciatively beautiful he murmured reaching for a loupe a wonderful piece of workmanship now lets just see moira watched him as he snapped on a gooseneck lamp and turned the bracelet in his clean strong hands he had waited on her several times before he wasnt handsome almost homely in fact but she liked him and she knew that he was strongly attracted to her he let the loupe drop from his eye shook his head with genuine regret i cant understand a thing like this he said its something you almost never see how what do you mean moira frowned i mean this is some of the finest filigreed platinum ive ever seen practically a work of art but the stones no theyre not diamonds mrs langtry excellent imitations but still imitations moira couldnt believe him cole had paid four thousand dollars for the bracelet but they must be diamonds they cut glass mrs langtry he smiled wryly glass will cut glass practically anything will let me show you a positive test for diamonds he handed her the loupe and took an eyedropper from his desk carefully he dropped a miniscule amount of water on the stones do you see how the water splashes over them slides off in a sheet with real diamonds it wont do that it clings to the surface in tiny droplets moira nodded dully and took the loupe from her eye do you happen to know where it was purchased mrs langtry im sure your money could be recovered she didnt know quite possibly cole had bought it as a fake it isnt worth anything to you why of course it is he said warmly i can offer you well five hundred dollars very well if youll give me a check please he excused himself and left for several minutes he returned with the check placed it in an envelope for her and sat down again now he said i hope youre not too badly disappointed with us youll give us an opportunity to serve you again i hope moira hesitated she glanced at the small sign on his desk mr carter the store was named carters the owners son perhaps i should have told you mrs langtry with a valued customer such as you wed be very happy to call at your home its not at all necessary for you to come to the store if theres anything you think we might be interested in i have only one thing mr carter moira looked at him evenly are you interested well id have to see it of course but you are seeing it mr carter youre looking right at it he looked puzzled then startled then his face assumed something of the same expression it had worn when he was examining the bracelet you know something mrs langtry a bracelet like the one you sold us we seldom run across anything like that a fine setting and workmanship are usually indicative of precious stones it always hurts me when i find theyre not i always hope he raised his eyes that im mistaken moira smiled liking him better than ever at this point she said i think i should say ouch say it for both of us mrs langtry he laughed this is one of those times when i almost wish i wasnt married almost they walked to the entrance together the lovely smartlydressed woman and the homely cleanlooking young man as they said goodbye he held her hand for a moment i hope everything straightens out for you mrs langtry i do wish i could have helped just stay in there and pitch moira told him youre on the right team very hungry by now she had coffee and a small salad at a drugstore then she returned to her apartment house the manager was on the lookout for her and he was knocking at her door almost as soon as she had closed it curtly he thrust an itemized bill at her moira examined it her eyebrows raising now and then a lot of money charles she murmured you wouldnt have padded it a little would you dont you talk to me that way you owe every doggone cent of it and you know it and by golly youre going to pay it maybe i could get the dough from your wife do you suppose charlie maybe your kiddies would crack their piggy banks you leave them out of this you go near my family and ill ill his voice broke into a pleading whine yyou you wouldnt do that would you moira moira gave him a disgusted look oh dont wet your pants for gods sake mark the damned bill paid and ill get you the money she turned abruptly and entered her bedroom opening her purse she took out a roll of bills and dropped it on the dressing table then as she undressed swiftly slipping into a sheer black negligee her weary frown suddenly broke and she snickered laughing silently shespread herself out on the bed she often broke into sudden fits of merriment faced with some unpleasant facet of the present she would force her mind away from it letting it wander vagrantly until it seized upon some ridiculous parallel or paradox and then for no apparent reason she laughed now the laughter became briefly audible and grable called to her suspiciously from the vicinity of the doorway what are you up to moira what are you laughing about you wouldnt understand charles just a little item from the luncheon menu come on in he came in he looked at her and gulped then frantically pulled his gaze away i want that mmoney moira i want it right now well there it is the negligee fell open as she waved a bare foot at the dresser theres the money and heres little moira he strode toward the dressing table just before he reached it his step faltered and he turned slowly around moira i i he stared at her gulping again licking back the sudden saliva from the corners of his babyish mouth and this time he could not pull his eyes away moira looked down at herself following the course of his gaze the automatic clutch charles she murmured it comes with the de luxe upholstery and the highspeed wiry zone he made a little rush toward her he stopped weakly a hand held out in wretched appeal pplease moira please please ive been good to you ive let you stay hhere month after month and you will wont you just moira said nope it couldnt be done all passengers must pay as they entered and no free passes or rebates thats a strict rule of the intercourse commerce commission charles all common carriers are governed by it please you got to you jjust got to almost sobbing he sagged down on his knees at the side of the bed oh god god god ddont make me only one choice to a customer moira said firmly the lady or the loot so whats it going to be and then as he abruptly flung himself at her as if i didnt know she lay looking up past his shoulder trying to blot out his panting thrusting presence forcing her mind away from him and to roy dillon their last afternoon at the hotel why his sudden hemorrhage anyway a young guy with an apparently castiron stomach what had happened to bring it on or was it really on the level could it be some angle his mother was working to break them up she looked like an angleplayer plenty like one you could see that she was sharp as a tack and twice as hard anyone could see it that knew their way around and she was loaded with dough and moira didnt want to think about her the snotty little witch anything else but not her shed like to do something about her but she rolled her eyes at the ceiling what a character this guy was what a revolting character he must be wearing forty dollars worth of toilet water and hair gook but it didnt really touch him it was just sort of wrapped around him like foil around a chunk of limburger and when you got down under it ooops she tightened her lips quickly her cheeks bulging with repressed merriment she tried to jerk her mind away from its source from that darned crazy menu but it just wouldnt go away and again she was shaking with laughter whassa matter gasped grable how can you laugh at a nothing nnever mind charles i jjust ah ha ha ha im ssorry but ahh ha ha ha luncheon special broiled hothouse tomato under generous slice of ripe cheese lilly dillons apartment was on the top floor of a sunset strip building a few blocks east of the city limits of beverly hills rented furnished it consisted of a bedroom bath powder room kitchen living room and den the den was on the rear or south side of the building and a hospital bed had been put into it for roy he lay on it today in pajamas and bathrobe its head cranked up so that he could look out over unlimited miles of oil fields ocean and beach towns he felt lazy and comfortable he felt restless and guilty this was the beginning of his third week out of the hospital he was fully recovered and there was no valid excuse for his remaining here and yet he lingered on lilly wanted him to the doctors passively encouraged him to seeing little to be gained by his protracted convalescence but a broad margin of safety in it the ruptured vessels of his stomach could open up again under just the right circumstances they could be reruptured thus if he wished to remain completely inactive and beyond reach of the smallest risk it was quite agreeable with the doctors aside from lilly and the matter of his health roy had another reason for staying on a guilty reason and one he tried not to admit to she carol roberg was in the kitchen now cleaning up their luncheon dishes and doubtless preparing a dessert for them he didnt want any himself he had gained almost seven pounds in the past two weeks but he knew that she did and not for the world would he have interfered carol was very dainty about her eating as she was about everything but he had never seen anyone who could stow away so much food so quickly he wondered about that her insatiable appetite when he was not wondering about her in a different way most women he knew seemed hardly to eat anything moira for example moira he squirmed uneasily as he recalled her visit this morning he had told her yesterday in a subdued telephone conversation that lilly was leaving the apartment early today and suggested that she drop by so she had come pulling up startled when she saw carol then giving him a quick questioning look carol sat down in the living room with them she apparently felt that it was only polite to do so and she tried to make conversation about the weather and the usual routine topics when after what was probably the longest halfhour on record she had finally excused herself and gone into the kitchen moira turned on him tightmouthed i tried to send her out roy said helplessly i told her to take off a few hours tried to if it were me youd just said to beat it im sorry he said i wanted to be alone as much as you did he glanced quickly over his shoulder then went down beside her chair and took her into his arms she submitted to a kiss but there was no response to it he kissed her again letting his hands rove over her body probing the soft sweetscented curves after weeks of enforced continence and the constant temptation which carol represented he had never wanted moira as much as he did at that moment but abruptly she had pulled away from him just how much longer do you plan on staying here roy she asked when are you moving back to the hotel well i dont know exactly pretty soon i imagine youre not in much of a hurry are you you like it here roy said awkwardly that he had no complaints he was being well taken care of much better than he could be in a hotel and lilly was anxious to have him stay mmm ill bet she is and ill bet youre darned well taken care of too what do you mean are you kidding ive seen the way you looked at that simpering little simp of a nurse either youre losing your grip or you think shes too good to tumble she is but im not oh for gods sake he reddened look im sorry about today if there was any way i could get rid of her without hurting her feelings naturally you couldnt do that oh no lets just say that i wouldnt do it then he said tiring of apology well forget it she picked up her gloves and stood up if it suits you it suits me he followed her out into the hallway trying to smooth over the rift without unbending too far liking her desiring her more than he ever had yet wary as always of any tightening of her hold upon him ill be out of here any day now he assured her im probably a hell of a lot more anxious than you are well she smiled tentatively the dark eyes searching his face im not so sure of that youll see maybe we can go to la jolla this weekend just maybe im practically sure of it he said ill give you a ring hmm so he had got things straightened out for a time at least and after a fashion but he had gotten nothing in return nothing but the status quo and unsatisfied desire squirmed in him relentlessly something was going to have to give he told himself with moiras presence still lingering with him with carol so readily accessible carol he wondered just what he should do about her anyway or whether he should do anything about her she looked completely virginal and if she was that was that shed remain that way as far as he was concerned but looks could be deceptive and sometimes when she consented to a kiss and she clung to him for a moment well he wasnt so sure about her status was in fact almost positive that he had judged it wrongly and in that case of course she came in from the kitchen bearing two creamtopped parfait glasses he accepted one of them and she sat down with the other smiling he watched as she dipped into it wanting to sweep her up in his arms and give her a hearty squeeze good he said wonderful she exclaimed enthusiastically then looking up at him pinking with selfconsciousness all the time here i am eating you think i am such a pig yes roy laughed if they made pigs like you id start raising them how about eating mine too but it is yours more i could not possibly eat sure you can he said swinging his legs off the bed will you come into the bedroom when youre through i will come now you want your rubdown yes no no he said quickly theres no hurry finish your ice cream first he crossed the deeply carpeted living room and entered the bedroom entering the bedroom he hesitated for a long moment almost deciding to stop now while he could then swiftly before he could change his mind he flung off the robe and his pajama top and stretched out on the bed carol came in a minute or two later she started to get the alcohol bottle from the bathroom and he held out his hand to her come here carol i want to ask you something she nodded and sat down on the edge of the bed he drew her closer bringing her face down to his and then as their lips met he began to draw her prone nervously her body suddenly stiffening she tried to pull away oh no please roy i i its all right i want to ask you something carol will you tell me the truth well she tried to muster a smile it is so important to you or perhaps you are teasing me again yes its very important to me he said are you a virgin carol the smile washed abruptly from her face and for a moment it was something completely blank then a trace of color came back into it and her eyes fell and almost imperceptibly she shook her head no i am not a virgin youre not he was vaguely disappointed i am not not by many times under its surface firmness her voice shook slightly and now you will not like me any more not like you why of course i do i like you more than ever bbut she smiled tremulously began to glow with a kind of joyous incredulity you really mean it you would not tease about so important a thing whats so important about it now come on honey laughing joyously she allowed him to pull her down against him hugged him with laughing wonderment oh my she said she was so happy and then with no real resistance bubbling with the happiness he had given her but shouldnt we wait roy you would not like me better i couldnt like you any better he tugged impatiently at her white uniform how do you get this damned thing but there is something else you must know you have a right to know i i cannot have children roy never that stopped him made him hesitate but only for a second she had an awkward way of phrasing things twisting them around hindsideto and putting the emphasis in the wrong places so she couldnt have children and that was all to the good but he would have taken care of that anyway who cares he said almost groaning in his hunger for her its okay and its okay if youre not a virgin now cant you stop talking for gods sake and yes oh yes roy she clung to him in wondrous surrender guiding his fumbling hands also i want to and it is your right the uniform fell away from her the underthings the innate modesty the fears the past in the drapedrawn dimness of the room she was reborn and there was no past but only a future the purplish brand still lingered on her outflung left arm but now it was merely a childhood scar time dulled shrunken by growth it didnt matter what it memorialized didnt matter the sterilization the loss of virginity for he had said it didnt so the thing itself was without meaning the indelible imprint of the dachau concentration camp she came out of the bathroom modestly wearing her underthings now still flushed and warm and glowing primly protective she drew up the sheet and tucked it over his chest i must take care of you she said now more than ever you are most important to me roy grinned at her lazily she was sweet a lot of woman he thought and about the most honest one hed ever met if she hadnt told him that she wasnt virginal you are all right roy you do not hurt any place i never felt better in my life he laughed not that i havent been feeling okay that is good it would be terrible if i had given you hurt he repeated that he was feeling fine she was just what hed needed she said seriously that she also had needed him and he laughed again winking at her i believe you honey how long has it been anyway or shouldnt i ask how long she frowned a little her head tilted in puzzlement then oh she said well it it was never mind he said quickly forget it it was there she extended the tattooed arm there also i was made sterile there he frowned i dont whats that anyway she explained absently her smile fixing the tiltedup eyes looking at him and through him toward something far beyond seemingly she was speaking of the abstract a dull and tenuous theorem scarcely worthy of recital seemingly she was reading from a fairy tale a thing so filled with terrors that they clung stagnating to one another never advancing the plot or theme physically motionless merely horror piled upon horror until they sagged slowly downward drawing the listener with them yes yes that is right she smiled at him as though at a precocious child yes i was very young seven or eight i think that was the reason you see to discover the earliest possible age at which a female might conceive it can be very early in life as young as five i think but an average minimum age was being sought with my mother and grandmother it was the other way i mean how old could the female be my grandmother died shortly after the beginning of the experiment but my mother roy wanted to vomit he wanted to shake her to beat her standing apart from himself as she was standing from herself he was furious with her subjectively his thoughts were not a toodistant parallel of the current popular philosophizing the things you heard and read and saw everywhere the pious mourning of sin the joyous absolution of the sinners the uncomfortable frowns and glancesaskance at those who recalled their misdeeds after all the onetime friends poor fellows were now our friends and it was bad taste to show gasstoves on television after all you couldnt condemn a people could you and what if they had done exactly that themselves should you make the same regrettable error after all they hated the reds as much as we did they were as eager as we were to blow every stinking red in the world to hell and gone and after all those people the allegedly sinnedagainst had brought most of the trouble on themselves it was their own fault it was her own fault now listen to me he broke in on her angrily no i dont want to hear any more damnit if youd told me about it in the first place instead of just saying that letting me think that that i know she said it was very bad of me but i too was thinking something else well now he mumbled i dont want to put you in the wrong i like you i think the world of you carol thats why i asked you what i did told you it was important to me i can see now how you might have taken it the wrong way and i wish to god there was something i could do to square things up but but why did she keep looking at him that way smiling that totally vacant smile waiting for him to fill the vacuum with life he had said he was sorry apologized for something that was partially her own fault but still she sat there waiting did she seriously expect him to give up his life the only way of life acceptable to him merely to correct a mistake well she had no right to do so even if he could give what she had expected and apparently still desired he would not do it she was a nice girl and it wouldnt be fair to her now ill tell you what he said smiling ingratiatingly we cant change whats already happened so why dont we just pretend it didnt happen how will that be hmm okay well just forget this and make a brand new start she looked at him silently fine roy said briskly thats my sweet girl now ill skim on out of here and let you finish dressing and and uh he left pulling on his robe as he went out of the room returning to the den he flopped back down on the hospital bed stared out unseeing at the panorama to the south still seeing the girl in the bedroom hed put things very badly he guessed his usual glibness had failed him just when he needed it most and hed sounded peevish and smalltime what had happened to him he wondered what had gone wrong with his pitch it had been an honest mistake shed suffered no actual loss because of it why couldnt he make her understand that why when he could so easily pull a real swindle without a kickback you can t cheat an honest man he thought and was unreasonably irritated by the thought he heard her approaching the starchy rustle of her uniform working up a smile he sat up and turned around she was wearing her coat a quaintly oldworld garment she was carrying her small nurses kit i am leaving now she said is there anything you want before i go leaving but oh now look he said winningly you cant do that you know its not professional a nurse cant walk out on a patient you do not need a nurse we both know it at any rate i have ceased to be a nurse to you but but damnit carol she turned away from him started for the door he looked after her helplessly for a moment then caught up with her and pulled her around facing him now im not going to let you do this he said theres no reason to you need the job and my mother and i both want you to have it why let me go please she pulled away from him again moving toward the door hastily he placed himself in front of her dont he begged if youre sore at me okay maybe you think youve got a right to be but my mothers involved here what will she think i mean what will i tell her when she comes home and finds youre he broke off reddening realizing that he had sounded fearful of lilly a ghost of a smile touched carols lips your mother will be disappointed she said but not surprised i think i have thought your mother did not understand you but now i know that she does roy looked away from her he said curtly that that wasnt what he meant at all youve got some money coming to you your wages if youll tell me how much nothing your mother paid me last night all right then but theres still today for today nothing i gave nothing of value she said roy let out an angry snort stop acting like a twoyearold kid will you youve got some money coming to you and by god youre going to take it he snatched the wallet from his robe pocket jerked out its contents and extended it toward her now how much what do i owe you for today she looked down at the money carefully shuffling through it with a finger she selected three bills and held them up three dollars yes i have heard that was the usual price you seem to know he snapped aah carol why thank you it is really too much she turned crossed the carpet to the door and went out roy raised his hands helplessly and let them drop to his sides that was that you couldnt square a beef with a stupe he went into the kitchen warmed up some coffee and drank it standing up rinsing out his cup he glanced at the clock above the stove lilly would be home in a few hours there was something he must do before she got here it wouldnt make this carol thing all right with her and it would mean tipping his hand but it had to be done for his own sake dressing and going down to the street he was just a little rocky but not because there was anything wrong with himonly from his long inactivity by the time he had gotten a taxi and reached his hotel he felt as strong as he ever had he was a little embarrassed by his reception at the hotel of course hed always worked to make himself likable that was an essential part of his front but he was still warmed and vaguely discomfited at the way he was welcomed home by simms and the owners employees he was glad that he didnt have to chump them leave them up the creek paddleless where people who liked him were customarily left flustered he accepted their congratulations on his recovery reassured them as to the present state of his health he agreed with simms that sickness came to all men always inconveniently and unexpectedly and that that was how the permanent waved at last he escaped to his room he took three thousand dollars from one of the clown pictures then having carefully replaced the picture on the wall he left the hotel and went back to lillys apartment the place seemed strangely empty without carol hungeringly empty as it always is when a familiar something or someone is no longer where it was there is a haunting sense of wrongness of things amiss here is a niche crying to be filled and the one thing that will fill it will not roaming restlessly from room to room he kept listening for her kept seeing her in his minds eye he could see her everywhere the small stifflystarched figure the glossy tipcurling hair the roseandwhite face the small clean features upturned in childlike innocence he could hear her voice everywhere and always he you was in what she said did he want something was there something she could do for him was he all right he must always tell her please if he wanted anything you are all right yes it would be terrible if i had given you hurt he started to enter the bathroom then came up short in the doorway a towel was draped over the sink scrubbed rinsed and hung up to dry but still faintly imbued with the yellowishness of washedout blood roy swallowed painfully then he dropped it into the hamper and slammed down the lid the long hours dragged by hours that had always seemed short until today a little after dusk lilly returned as usual she left her troubles outside the door came in with an expectant smile on her face why youre all dressed how nice she said wheres my girl carol shes not here roy said she oh well i guess i am a little late and of course youre all right she sat down made gestures of fanning herself whew that lousy traffic i could make better time hopping on one foot roy hesitated wanting to tell her glad of anything that would let him delay hows your hand the burn okay she waved it carelessly it looks like im branded for life but at least it learned taught me something keep away from boobs with cigars i think you should have it bandaged no can do have to dip in and out of my purse too much anyway its coming along all right she dismissed the subject carelessly pleased but somewhat embarrassed by his unusual concern as the room grew silent she took a cigarette from her purse smiled gayly as roy hurried to light it hey now it looks like i really rate around here doesnt it a little more of this and whats that she looked down at the money he had dropped into her lap frowning she raised her eyes three thousand dollars he said i hope its enough to square us up the hospital bills and all well sure but you cant oh she said tiredly i guess you can cant you i hoped you were playing it straight but i guess but you knew i wasnt roy nodded and now theres something else youve got to know about carol from sunset strip a muted gradually increasing clamor floated up to lillys apartment the sounds of the dinner hour and the early beginnings of the nightclubs day earlier from about four until seven there had been the racket of the business traffic trucks heavy and light pickups making their last deliveries of the day and then turning tail toward the city passenger cars speeding and skidding and jockeying for position as they swarmed out from town to their own duchies of brentwood bel air and beverly hills the cars were of all kinds and sizes from hot rods on up but there was an awesome abundance even a predominance at times of the upperbracket makes caught once in the strips traffic roy had examined its content and except for two motorcycles and a ford he had seen nothing for as far as he could see but cadillacs rollsroyces lincolns and imperials now listening to the nights throbbing roy wished he was down there on the strip or practically any place but where he was he had told lilly about carol as quickly as he could anxious to get it over with but brushed over it had probably sounded worse than in detail he had felt the need togo back through it again to explain just how what had led into what but that seemed only to worsen matters making him appear to pose as an honest if earthy young man who had been put to shameful disadvantage by the willful stupidity of a young woman there was just no good way of telling the story he guessed there simply wasnt despite her definite nonprudishness and the fact she had never played the role of mother as he saw it he gave a start as lillys purse slid to the floor with a thump he bent forward to pick it up then settled back uneasily as he saw what had fallen from the purse a small silencerequipped gun her hand closed around it she straightened again hefting it absently then seeing his unease her mouth twisted in a tight grin dont worry roy its a temptation ill admit but it would cost me my permit well i wouldnt want you to do that roy said not after the trouble ive already caused oh now you shouldnt feel that way lilly said youve paid your bill havent you tossed money at me like it was going out of style youve explained and youve apologized you didnt really do anything to explain or apologize for did you i was stupid she was stupid stupid enough to love and trust you and to put the best possible interpretation on what you did and said we were fools in other words and its a grifters job to take the fools have your own way about it roy snapped ive apologized done everything i can but if you want to get nasty but i always was nasty wasnt i always giving you a hard time there was just no good in me never ever and you damned well couldnt miss a chance to get back at me whaat he looked at her sharply what the hell are you talking about the same thing youve spent your life brooding about and pitying yourself about and needling me about because you had a hard time as a kid because i didnt measure up to your standards of motherhood roy blurted out surlily that she hadnt measured up to anyone elses standards either then a little shamefaced he tacked on a halfhearted retraction now i dont really mean that lilly you just got me sore anyway youve certainly done plenty out here a lot more than i had any right to expect and never mind she cut him off it wasnt enough youve proved it wasnt but theres a thing or two id like to get straight roy to your way of thinking i was a bad mother no i was so lets face it but i wonder if it occurred to you that i didnt look on myself that way at all well he hesitated well no i dont suppose you did its all a matter of comparison right in the good neighborhoods you were raised in and stacked up against the other mothers you saw there i stank but i didnt grow up in that kind of environment roy where i was raised a kid was lucky if he got three months of school in his life lucky if he didnt die of rickets or hookworm or plain old starvation or something worse i cant remember a day from the time i was old enough to remember anything that i had enough to eat and didnt get a beating roy lit a cigarette glancing at her over the match more irritated than interested in what she was saying what did it all amount to anyway maybe shed had a tough childhood although hed have to take her word for that all he knew about was his own but having had one and knowing how it felt why had she handed him the same kind of deal she knew better she hadnt been under the same ugly social pressures that had been brought to bear on her own parents why hell she was married and living away from home at about the age hed finished grammar school something about the last thought dug into him cut through the layered rationalizations which warmed him in their rosy glow while holding her off in outer darkness irritably he wondered just how soon he could decently break out of here that was all he wanted not excuses not explanations because of carol and because he did owe lilly something he himself had been cast in the role of apologizer and explainer and manfully he had accepted it but he became aware at last that the room was silent had been silent for some time lilly was leaning back in her chair looking at him with a tiredly crooked smile i seem to be keeping you up she said why dont you just run along and leave me to stew in my sins now lilly he made a defensive gesture youve never heard me reproach you for anything but you have plenty to reproach me for havent you it was pretty lousy of me to be a child at the same time you were to act like a child instead of a grown woman yes sir i was a real stinker not to grow up and act grown up as fast as you thought that i should roy was stung what do you want me to do he demanded pin a halo on you youre doing a pretty good job of that yourself and making you look like a heel at the same time hmm but thats the way i am you know the way ive always been always picking on poor little roy oh for gods sake lilly now ive got just one more thing to say i dont suppose it will do any good but ive got to say it anyway get out of the grift roy get out right now and stay out why why dont you get out yourself why lilly stared at him are you seriously asking me why why you brainless sap id be dead if i even looked like i wanted out its been that way since i was eighteen years old you dont get out of things like this youre carried out roy wet his lips nervously maybe she wasnt exaggerating although it was comforting to think that she must be but he wasnt in her league and he never would be im strictly shortcon lilly he said nothing but smalltime stuff i can walk away from it any time i want to it wont always be small time with you it couldnt be youre only twentyfive years old and already you can lay out three grand without turning a hair youre only twentyfive and youve come up with a new angle on the grift how to take fools for profit without changing hotels so are you going to stop there her head wagged in a firm negative huhuh the grifts like everything else you dont standstill you either go up or down usually down but my roys going up roy was guiltily flattered he pointed out that however it was it was still the con it didnt have the dangers that the organized rackets had it doesnt huh lilly asked well you could have fooled me now i heard of a guy just about your age who got hit so hard in the guts that it almost killed him well uh sure sure that doesnt count thats different and heres something else thats different she held up the burned hand do you know how i really got that burn well ill tell you she told him and he listened sickishly shamed and embarrassed unwilling to associate such things with his mother and unable to connect them with himself insofar as he could they tended to widen the rift that lay between him and lilly she saw how he felt saw that it was no use a slow fury welled through her tired body so thats that she said and it doesnt have anything to do with you does it just another chapter in the perils of lilly dillon and very interesting too he said his voice light maybe you should write a book lilly maybe you should write one lilly said carol roberg would make a good chapter roy came stiffly to his feet he nodded coldly picked up his hat and started toward the door then paused with a gesture of appeal lilly he said just what are you driving at anyway what more can i do about carol than ive already done youre asking me lilly said bitterly youve actually got the guts to stand there and ask me what you should do but youre suggesting that i should marry her ask her to marry me oh now come off of it what kind of break would that be for her oh god god god god lilly moaned coloring roy slammed on his hat im sorry im such a big disappointment to you im going now lilly looked at him as he still hesitated and remarked that she hadnt noticed thats the second time youve fooled me tonight she said now you see him and now you see him and when he goes nobody knows he left abruptly striding down the corridor his steps slowed and he paused teetered on the point of turning back at about the same instant lilly jumped up from her chair started toward the door and herself paused in teetering indecision they were so much alke so much a part of one another they were that close for a moment the moment passed a moment before murder then flouting instinct each made his decision each as he always had went his own way roy had his delayed dinner in a downtown restaurant he ate hungrily telling himself and doubtless meaning it that it was good to be eating in a restaurant it was what he was used to the subtle sameness of the food whatever the restaurant had a reassuring quality about it not unlike a mothers milk to a child in its familiar and dependable nurture it bolstered ones believeorperish credo that the more things changed the more they remained the same similarly it was good to be back in his own hotel bed for here also would be his own bed wherever it was standardized always ready and waiting for him simultaneously providing the pleasurable perquisites of permanence and impermanence perhaps in his dreams carol briefly shared the bed with him and he winced almost crying out but there were entirely amenable wraiths also comfortably standardized who came quickly to the rescue they asked no more of him than he did of them a sensual but immaculate penetration which achieved its end without mental or moral involvement one bathed quickly or lingeringly sans the danger of nearing the water so all in all roy dillon slept well that night awakening early he lay for a while in the presumable posture of all men awakening hands locked under his head eyes gazing absently at the ceiling letting his mind roam then with a brisk abandonment of bed he washed dressed and left the hotel he ate breakfast he visited a barber shop indulged himself in the works and went back to his tworoom suite after bathing he put on completely fresh clothes hat and shoes included and again left the hotel he got his car from its parking lot and turned it out into the traffic at first he felt a little awkward nervous after his prolonged absence from driving but that passed quickly in a few blocks he was himself again moving the car along with automatic ease driving with the same unthinking skill that a stenographer applies to a typewriter he was part of this river of cars aiding its sluggish tide and in turn aided by it without losing his identity free to turn out of the tide when he chose he still belonged to something like many business establishments that had once been a traditional integrand of the downtowns whole the jobbing house of sarber webb was now set down in a quasiresidential district commodiously released for a restless hiatus from the sprawling giant which would inevitably surround it again the firm was housed in a roomy sandstoneandbrick building a lofty onestory high for perhaps threefourths of its area at the rear it jutted up to a storyandahalf thus accommodating the company offices roy put his car on the private lot at the side of the building whistling absently his eyes approving as he surveyed the familiar scene around him he took his briefcase from the car someone else was looking them over too he saw but without his own casualness a young man well perhaps he wasnt quite so young in shirtsleeves but wearing a vest a clerk in appearance he stood well back on the wide sidewalk bordering the building looking critically up and down and around and occasionally jotting into a small notebook he turned and watched as roy approached his gaze uncompromising at first incipiently disapproving then as roy came on unflinching and grinned and nodded hi the gaze registered a little warmth and its proprietor nodded in return hi he said almost as though the word embarrassed him roy passed on grinning mentally shaking his head a long broad service counter stretched along the interior front of the building breached at one end by a wicket behind it racks of stockshelves ranged rearward bulging neatly with the thousandodd items which were wholesaled by sarber webb and forming a halfdozen parallel aisles it was early and he was the only salesmancustomer in the place usually at this hour most of the clerks were either having coffee across the street or propped up along the counter in clusters smoking and talking until they could resign themselves to the day but there was no such homey nonsense this morning everyone was present without a cigarette or coffee carton in sight the aisles hummed with activity the pulling of orders inventorying restocking dusting and rearranging everyone was busy or much harder pretending to be busy through the years he had become friendly with all of them and all came forward for a handshake and a word of congratulation on his recovery but they wasted no time about it puzzled roy turned to the clerk who was opening a catalogue for him whats hit this place he asked i havent seen anyone as busy since the joint caught fire kaggs hit it thats what kaggs is that anything like the galloping crud the clerk laughed grimly you can say that again brother he brushed imaginary sweat from his brow if that sonofabitch stays around much longer kaggs he elaborated was one of the homeoffice big shots a seeming mixture of comptroller troubleshooter and efficiency expert came out here right after you went into the hospital one of those college punks he looks like and he aint had a kind word for anyone aint no one knows anything but him and everyones either a dopeoff or a bum now you know thats not so roy you wont find a harderworkin more efficient group of boys anywhere than we got right here thats right roy nodded agreeably although it was very far from right maybe hell run me off dyou suppose i was going to tell you he did chop off several of the salesmen just wont wholesale to em any more and what kind of sense does that make theyre all selling on commission if they dont sell they dont make nothing so psst here he comes as roy had suspected kaggs was the criticallooking young man he had seen outside the building a split second after the clerk had spoken he was upon them shooting out his hand like a weapon kaggs home office he said glad to meet you this is mr dillon the clerk said nervously obsequious roys one of our best salesmen mr kaggs he is the best kaggs didnt give the clerk a glance which isnt saying much for this place want to talk to you dillon he turned still clinging to roys hand as though to hustle him along roy remained where he was pulling kaggs back around with a jerk he smiled pleasantly as the homeoffice man blinked at him startled that was a pretty backhanded compliment mr kaggs he said and i never let people get away with things like that if i did i wouldnt be a good salesman kaggs considered the statement nodded with curt judiciousness youre right i apologize now id still like to talk to you lead the way roy said picking up his briefcase kaggs led him back down the counter abruptly swerving away from the wicket and moving toward the building entrance how about some coffee okay sets a bad example too much piddling around here already but its hard to talk with so many people trying to listen in you dont seem to think much of them roy remarked kaggs said crisply as they started across the street that he had no feelings at all about people in the abstract it depends on how they stack up if theyre on the ball ive got plenty of consideration for em in the restaurant he asked for milk as well as coffee mixing the two together a little at a time as he sipped from his cup ulcers he explained your trouble too right then without waiting for an answer he went on had you spotted when you passed me this morning dillon nothing slobby or sloppy about you looked like you were going somewhere and you knew the way figured then that you must be dillon connected you with your sales right away and when i said that it didnt say much for webb sarber your being the best man i mean i meant just that you stack up as a topflight man in my book but youve had no incentive here no one walking on your heels just a lot of halfasses so the tendencys been not to stretch yourself im bouncing the slobs incidentally makes no difference to me if they are only on commission if theyre not making good money theyre not giving us good representation and we cant afford to have em around whats your selling experience anyway before you came here i mean sellings all ive done since i left high school roy said not knowing what all this was leading up to but willing to go along for the ride you name it ive sold it all doortodoor stuff premiums brushes pots and pans magazines youre singing my song kaggs grinned crookedly im the guy who worked his way through college peddling subscriptions you switched to businesshouse selling when you came with us why its easier to get into doors roy said and you can build up regular customers the housetohouse stuff is mostly oneshot kaggs nodded approvingly ever supervise salesmen you know kind of head them up keep em on their toes ive run housetohouse crews roy shrugged who hasnt i havent dont have the talent for it somehow or tact roy smiled or tact but never mind me i do all right the point is webb sarber need a sales manager should have had one right along someone whos proved hes a salesman and can handle other salesmen hed have a lot of deadwood to clear out or put some sap back into em hire new men and give em a good draw if they cut the stuff what do you think i think its a good idea roy said now i dont know offhand what your best years earnings have been around sixtysix hundred i believe but put it this way well top your best year by fifteen hundred make it eight thousand in round numbers thats just a beginning of course give you a year at eight and if youre not worth a lot more than that by then ill kick you the hell out but i know you will be worth more knew you were my kind of man from the minute i saw you this morning and now that weve got that settled im going to borrow one of your cigarettes and have a real cup of coffee and if my stomach doesnt like it ill kick it the hell out too roy held out his cigarette package in the rapidfire delivery of kaggs talk he had let its meaning slip away from him and coming to him abruptly hitting him like a blow his hand gave a convulsive jerk kaggs looked at him blinking something wrong incidentally dont cigarettes and coffee bother you your ulcers i mean roy nodded shook his head i uh it wasnt a bad ulcer just happened to be in a bad place struck a vein i look mr kaggs perk roy perk for percy and smile when you say that how old are you roy twentyfive or six fine no reason at all why you cant roys mind raced desperately a sales manager him roy dillon grifter de luxe a sales manager but he couldnt be damnit it would be too confining too proscribed he would lose the freedom of movement necessary to carrying on the grift the job itself the importance of it would preclude any such activities as a commission salesman he might reasonably loiter in the places where the grift could be practiced but as webb sarbers sales manager no the slightest rumble would dump him cold he couldnt take the job on the other hand how could he turn it down without arousing suspicion how could you reasonably refuse a job that was right up your alley one that was not only much better than the one you had but promised to become far far better glad to get this thing settled roy perk kaggs was saying now weve wasted enough time here so if youre through with your coffee mr kaggs perk roy said i cant take the job i cant take it right away i mean this is the first day ive been up and around and i just dropped by to say hello and oh kaggs looked at him judiciously well you do look a little pale how soon will you be ready a week well i the doctors checking me over in a week but im not sure that two weeks then or take a little longer if you have to be plenty of work and youve got to be in shape for it but you need a man right now it wouldnt be fair to you to i take care of the beingfairtome department kaggs permitted himself an icy grin things been going to hell this long they can go a little longer but but there was nothing more to say perhaps he could think of an out for himself during the next week or so but none occurred to him now they walked back across the street together and then he went on by himself to his car he got into it uncertainly started the motor then cut it off again what now how could he pass the time that kaggs had given him selling was out of the question of course since he was supposedly unready to work but there was the other his real occupation the source of the wealth behind the four clown pictures he started the car again then with a dismayed grunt he again shut it off since work was out so also was the grift he wouldnt dare turn a trick not before the weekend at least when he would normally be idle and could unsuspiciously indulge in some onthetowning the weekend and this was only wednesday he thought about moira with an unconscious frown he dismissed her from his mind not today it was too soon after carol starting his car for the third time he drove around for a couple of hours then had lunch at a drivein and returned to the hotel he spent a restless afternoon reading he had dinner and killed the evening at the movies faced with more idleness the following day he was again moved to call moira but somehow without seeming to think about it he rang carols number instead coming to the phone drowsyvoiced she said she could not see him they had no reason to see each other oh now we might have he said why dont we get together and talk about it she hesitated about what exactly well you know a lot of things well have lunch and no she said firmly no roy it is impossible anyway i am working regularly at the hospital now night duty in the day i must sleep in the evening then suddenly it had become very important that he see her before you go to work or i can pick you up in the morning after you finish i he rushed on he had a new job he explained or well he was thinking about taking a new job he wanted her opinion on it and no she said no roy and she hung up on the following day he called moira langtry but there again he was defeated he was surprised as well as irritated since momentarily she had seemed to welcome an early start on their la jolla weekend reversing herself in practically the same breath it couldnt be done she explained at least due to delicate womanly reasons a periodic difficulty it wouldnt be very practical tomorrow mmm no she was afraid not but the next day sunday should be fine roy suspected that she was simply a little miffed at him that this was his punishment for his weeks of inattentiveness certainly however he was of no mind to plead with her so he said casually that sunday would be fine with him too and the arrangements were made on that basis he killed the rest of that day or most of it with a trip to the santa monica beaches the next day being saturday he was free to hit the grift again but after some mental shillyshallying he decided against it let it go he wasnt quite in the mood he needed to snap out of himself a little more to shake off certain disturbing memories which might add to the hazards of a profession which already had hazards enough he loafed through the day he became broody almost he pitied himself what a way to live he thought resentfully always watching every word he said carefully scrutinizing every word that was said to him and never making a move that wasnt studiously examined in advance figuratively he walked through life on a high wire and he could turn his mind from it only at his own peril of course he was wellpaid for his efforts the loot had piled up fast and it would go on piling up but there was the trouble it simply piled up as useless to him as so many soap coupons needless to say this state of things would not go on forever he would not forever live a secondclass life in a secondclass hotel in another five years his grifted loot would total enough for retirement and he could drop caution with the grift which impelled it but those five years were necessary to insure that retirement filling it with all the things he had been forced to forego and just suppose he didnt live five years or even one year or even one day or the brooding exhausted itself and him as well the interminable day passed and he fell asleep and then wondrously it was morning then at last he had something to do they were making the trip by train the southbound oneoclock and moira was meeting him at the station roy parked his car on the railroad lot he would rent another for their holiday use and took his bag out of the trunk it was only a quarter after twelve far too early to expect moira roy bought their tickets gave the seat numbers and his bag to a welltipped redcap and entered the station bar he had a drink stretching it out as he glanced occasionally at the clock at twenty minutes to one he got up from his stool and went back through the entrance the sunday southbound was always crowded carrying not only the civilian traffic but the swarms of marines and sailors returning to their duty stations at camp pendleton and san diego roy watched as they streamed through the numbered gates and down the long ramps which led to the trains a little nervously he again checked the time ten minutes until one that was enough time of course but not too much the station was more than a block in depth and the train ramp was practically a block long if moira didnt get here very quickly she might as well stay home five minutes until one four minutes sourly roy gave up and started back to the bar she wouldnt do this deliberately he was sure probably shed been caught up in a traffic jam one of the gordianknots of snarledup cars which afflicted the citys supposedly highspeed freeways but damnit if shed ever start any place a little early instead of waiting until the last minute he heard his name called he whirled and saw her coming through the entrance trotting behind the redcap who carried her baggage the man flashed a smile at roy as he passed do my best boss just you stay behind me roy grabbed moira and hurried her along with him sorry she panted darned apartment house elevator stuck an never mind save your breath he said they raced the marblefloored length of the building passed through the gate and on down into the seemingly endless stretch of ramp at its far end a trainman stood watch in hand as they approached he pocketed the watch and started up the short sideramp to the loading platform they followed him passed him as the train pulled out they caught the last car a train porter escorted them to their seats breathless they slumped into them and for the next thirty minutes they hardly stirred at last as they were pulling out of the town of fullerton moiras head turned on the whiteslipped seat back and she grinned at him youre a good man mcgee and youre a good woman mrs murphy he said whats your secret underwear in the chowder natch whats yours roy said his derived from inspirational reading i was reading a wonderful story just as you came in author named bluegum labloat ever hear of him mmm it does sound slightly familiar i think this is the best thing hes done roy said the setting is the mens washroom in a bus station and the characters are a clean old man and a fat young boy who live in one of the coin toilets they ask little of the world only the privacy incident to doing what comes naturally but do they get it heck no every time they begin to function you should excuse the language some diarrheal dope rushes up and drops a dime in the slot and in his coarse surrender to need their own desire is lost in the end fruition frustrated they gather up the apple cores from the urinals and go off into the woods to bake a pie moira gave him a severe look im going to call the conductor she declared i couldnt buy your silence with a drink the silence ill buy a couple of hours of it after that you buy the drink and be sure you rinse your mouth out with it roy laughed ill wait for you if you like go moira said firmly closing her eyes and leaning back against the seat go boy go roy patted her on the flank rising he walked the two cars to the barlounge he was feeling good again back in form the brooding introspectiveness of recent days had slipped from him and he felt like swinging as he had expected the lounge was crowded unless he could squeeze in with some group which was what he intended to do there was no place to sit he surveyed the scene approvingly then turned to the attendant behind the small bar ill have a bourbon and water he said bonded sorry sir cant serve you unless youre seated lets see how much is it anyway eightyfive cents sir but i cant two dollars roy nodded laying two bills on the counter exact change right he got his drink glass in hand he started down the aisle swaying occasionally with the movement of the train halfway down the car he allowed himself to be swayed against a booth where four servicemen sat jolting their drinks and slopping a little of his own on the table he apologized profusely youve got to let me buy you a round no i insist waiter vastly pleased they urged him to sit down squeezing over in the booth to make room the drinks came and disappeared over their protests he bought another round but it aint fair pal were buyin the next time no sweat roy said pleasantly im not sure i can drink another one but he broke off glancing down at the floor he frowned squinted then stooping he reached slightly under the booth and straightening again he dropped a small dotted cube on the table did one of you fellows drop this he asked the tat rolled the bets doubled and redoubled with the deceptive swiftness of the train the money streamed into roy dillons pockets when his four dupes thought about him later it would be as a helluva nice guy so amiably troubled by his unwanted and unintended winnings as to make shameful any troubled thought of their own when roy thought about them later but he would not all his thinking was concentrated on them the time of their fleecing in keeping them constantly diverted and disarmed and in the high intensity of that concentration in fueling its whitehot flames he had nothing of them left for afterthoughts they enjoyed their drinks his were tasteless occasionally one of them went to the toilet he could not now and then they looked out the window remarking on the beauty of the passing scenery for it was beautiful with the snowy beaches the green and gold of the groves the bluegray mountains and the white houses with redtiled roofs strikingly reminiscent of the south of france but while roy chimed in with appropriate comments he did not look where they looked nor see what they saw at last swarming up out of his concentration he saw that the car had emptied and that the train was creeping through the industrial outskirts of san diego the terminus of the rail trip rising wringing hands all around with the servicemen he turned to leave the barlounge and there was moira smiling at him from its head thought id better come looking for you she said have fun oh you know just rolling for drinks he shrugged sorry i left you alone so long forget it she smiled taking his arm i didnt mind a bit roy rented a car at san diego and they drove out to their la jolla hotel it sat in a deep lawn high on a bluff overlooking the pacific moira was delighted with it breathing in the clean cool air she insisted on a brief tour of the grounds before they went inside now this is something like she declared this is living and sliding a sultry glance at him i dont know how ill show my appreciation oh ill think of something roy said maybe you can rinse out my socks for me he registered for them and they followed the bellboy upstairs their rooms were on opposite sides of a corridor and moira looked at him quizzically demanding an explanation why the apartheid bit she said not that i cant stand it if you can i thought it would be better that way separate rooms under our own namesjust in case theres any trouble you know why should there be any trouble roy said easily that there shouldnt be any there was no reason why there should be but why take chances after all were right across from each other now if youd like me to show you how convenient it is he pulled her into his arms and they stood locked together for a moment but when he started to take it from there she pulled away later hmm she stooped before the mirror idly prinking at her hair i hurried so fast this morning that im only halfthrown together later it is roy nodded agreeably like something to eat now or would you rather wait for dinner oh dinner by all means ill give you a ring he left her still stooped before the mirror and crossed to his own room unpacking his bag he decided that she was curious rather than peeved about the separate rooms and that in any case the arrangement was imperative he was known as a single man departing from that singleness he would have to use an assumed name and where then was his protective front so carefully and painfully built up through the years he was bound to the front bound to and bound by it if moira was puzzled or peeved then she could simply get over being puzzled or peeved he wished he hadnt had to explain to her since explanations were always bad he also regretted that she had seen him operating in the club car but the wish and the regret were small things idly reflective rather than worrisome anyone might do a little gambling for drinks anyone might be cautious about hotel registrations why should moira regard the first as a professional activity and the second as a cover for it a front which must always accrue to him like a shadow unpacked roy stretched out on the bed surprisingly grateful for the chance to rest he had not realized that he was so tired that he could be so glad to lie down apparently he reflected he was still not fully recovered from the effects of his hemorrhage lulled by the distant throb of the ocean he fell into a comfortable doze awakening just before dusk he stretched lazily and sat up unconsciously smiling with the pleasure of his comfort saltscented air wafted in through the windows far off to the west beneath a pastel sky an orangered sun sank slowly into the ocean many times he had seen the sun set off the southern california coast but each time was a new experience each sunset seemed more beautiful than the last reluctantly as the phone rang he turned away from its splendor moiras voice came gaily over the wire boo you ugly man are you buying me dinner or not absolutely not he said give me one good reason why i should cant not over the phone write me a letter then cant no mail deliveries on sunday excuses he grumbled always excuses well okay but its strictly hamburgers they had cocktails on the hotels patio bar then driving farther on in to the city they ate at a seafood restaurant jutting out over the ocean moira had declared an armistice with her diet and she proved that she meant it the meal opened with a lobster cocktail practically a meal in itself served with hot garlicbread and a fresh green salad the main course was a sizzling platter of assorted seafoods bordered by a rim of delicatelybrowned potatoes then came dessert a fluffy cheesecake and pots of black black coffee moira sighed happily as she accepted a cigarette as i said earlier this is living i honestly dont think i can move then of course you dont feel like dancing silly she said whatever gave you an idea like that she loved dancing and she danced very well as for that matter did he more than once he caught the eyes of other patrons on them seeing them also moira pressed closer to him bending her supple body to his after perhaps an hour of dancing when the floor became oppressively crowded they went for a moonlight drive up the coast turning around and heading back at the city of oceanside the mounting waves of the night tide foamed with phosphorus they came rolling in from the distant depths of the ocean striking against the shore in a steady series of thunderlike roars on the rocky outcrops of the shore an occasional seal gleamed blackly it was almost eleven when roy got them back to their hotel and moira was suppressing a yawn she apologized saying it was the weather not the company but when they again stood in front of their rooms she held out her hand in good night you dont mind do you roy its been such a wonderful evening i guess i just wore myself out of course you did he said im pretty tired myself youre sure now youre sure you dont mind beat it he said pushing her through her door its okay but of course it wasnt okay and he minded a great deal he entered his own room restraining an angry urge to slam the door stripping out of his clothes he sat down on the edge of the bed puffed surlily at a cigarette a hell of a holiday this was it would serve her right if he walked out on her the phone tinkled faintly it was moira she spoke with repressed laughter open your door what he grinned expectantly what for open it and find out you fathead he hung up and opened his door there was a sibilant gangway from the door opposite his and he stood back and moira came skipping across the hail her black hair stood in a sedate pile on her head she was completely naked gravely a finger under her chin she curtsied before him i hope you dont mind sir she said i just washed my clothes and i couldnt do a thing with them then gurgling choking with laughter she collapsed in his arms oh you she gasped if you could have seen your face when i told you good night you looked sso so ah ha ha he picked her up and tossed her on the bed they had a hell of a time but afterward after she had gone back to her own room depression came to him and what had seemed like such a hell of a time became distasteful even a little disgusting it was the depression of surfeit the tail of selfindulgences kite you flew high wide and handsome imposing on the breeze that might have wafted you along indefinitely and then it was gone and down down down you went tossing restlessly in the darkness roy told himself that the gloom was natural enough and a small enough price to pay for what he had received but as to the last at least he was not convinced there was too much of a sameness about the evenings delights he had been the same route too many times hed been there before so doubledamned often and however you traveled backward forward or walking on your hands you always got to the same place you got nowhere in other words and each trip took a little more out of you still did he really want anything changed even now in his misery werent his thoughts already reaching out and across the hall he flung his legs over the side of the bed and sat up lighting a cigarette pulling a robe around his shoulders he sat looking out into the moonlit night thinking that perhaps it wasnt him or them he or moira that had brought him to this gloomy despair perhaps it was a combination of things he didnt have his strength back yet hed used up a lot of energy in catching the train and grifting after so long an idleness had been unusually straining on him then thered been a lot of little things moiras curiosity about the separate rooms for example and that heavy dinner at least twice as much as he needed or wanted then after all that his mind went back to the dinner now the enormous quantity and richness of it and suddenly the cigarette tasted lousy to him and a wave of nausea surged up through his stomach he ran to the bathroom a hand over his mouth cheeks bulging and he got there barely in time he rid himself of the food every miserable mouthful of it he rinsed out his mouth with warm water then drank several glasses of cold and immediately he began vomiting again bending over the sink he anxiously studied his stomachs washings and to his relief he found them clear there was no telltale trace of brown that would signify internal bleeding shivering a little he tottered back to bed and pulled the covers over him he felt a lot better now lighter and cleaner he closed his eyes and was promptly asleep he slept soundlessly dreamlessly seeming to compress two hours of sleep in one awakening at about sixthirty he knew hed had his quota and that further sleep was out of the question he shaved showered and dressed that took no more than a halfhour drag it out as he would so there it was only seven oclock in the morning and he as much at loose ends as if he was back in la certainly he couldnt call moira at such an hour moira had indicated last night that she intended to sleep until noon and that she would cheerfully murder anyone who awakened her before then at any rate he was in no hurry at all to see moira it was labor enough to pull himself together again without the necessity of entertaining her going down to the hotel coffee shop he had some toast and coffee but he only did it as a matter of discipline of virtue regardless of nightsbefore a man ate breakfast in the morning he ate hungry or not or else he inevitably found himself in trouble strolling down a whitegraveled walk to the cliff above the ocean he let his eyes rove aimlessly over the expanse of sea and sand the icylooking whitecaps the blinking faraway sails of boats the sweeping constantly searching gulls desolation eternal infinite like dostoevskis conception of eternity a fly circling about a privy the few signs of life only emphasized the loneliness at this hour of the morning a very little of it went a long way with roy dillon abruptly he turned away from it and headed for the rented car the coffee and toast hadnt set at all well with him he needed something to settle his stomach and he could think of only one thing that would do it a bottle of good beer or better still ale and he knew it was not to be found so early in the day in a community like la jolla the bars here the cocktail lounges rather would not open until shortly before lunch if there were morning drinkers in the town and doubtless there were they had their own private bars to drink from turning the car toward san diego roy drove out of the southerly outskirts of la jolla and into the more humble districts beyond slowing occasionally for a swift appraisal of the various drinking establishments many of them were open but they were not the right kind they would have only the west coast beers which to roys way of thinking were undrinkable none of them certainly would have a good ale nearing san diego he drove up mission valley for a mile or so then swinging up a long hill he entered mission hills there after some thirty minutes of wandering about he found what he was looking for it wasnt a fancy place at all not one of those glossy cocktail lounges where drinks were secondary to atmosphere just a good solidlooking bar with an air that immediately inspired confidence the proprietor was counting cash into his register when roy entered a graying wirylooking man with a tanned smilewrinkled face he nodded a greeting in the backbar mirror yes sir whatll it be roy put a name to it and the proprietor said that certainly he had good ale if ale wasnt good it was slop give you imported or ballantines roy chose ballantines and the proprietor was pleased at his gratified reaction good huh yknow i think ill just have one myself roy took an immediate liking to the guy and the feeling was reciprocated he liked the look of this place its unassuming honesty and decency the quiet pride of its owner in being its owner within ten minutes they were on a firstname basis roy was explaining his presence in town using his holidaying as an excuse for offhour drinking bert the proprietor revealed that he also shunned the prenoon drink but he was going on vacation tomorrow so what was the harm anyway two men came in downed a doubleshot each and hurried out again bert looked after them with a touch of sadness and came back to roy that was no way to drink he said occasionally even the best of men needed a drink or two in the morning but they shouldnt drink it that way as he left to wait on another customer he brushed against a backbar display stand of salted nuts moving it slightly out of its original position and staring absently in that direction roy saw something that made him frown he stood up a little from his stool for another look making sure of what he had seen he sat down again puzzled and troubled a punchboard a punchboard in a place like this bert was no fool either in the con or the everyday sense but a punchboard was strictly a fools item back at the time roy was just starting out there were still a few teams working the boards one man planting them the other knocking them over but he hadnt seen any in years everyone had tipped long ago and trying to plant a board now was the equivalent of asking for a busted jaw of course some small merchants and barkeeps still bought boards on their own punching out the winning numbers at the start and thus giving the suckers no chance at all but bert wouldnt do that bert roy laughed wryly to himself took a foamy sip of the ale what was this anyway was he roy dillon actually concerned about the honesty or dishonesty of a barkeep or the possibility that he might be swindled another customer had come in a khakiclad workman and bert was serving him a coke coming back down the bar with two fresh bottles of ale he refilled their glasses and roy allowed himself to notice the board oh that thing the proprietor retrieved it from the backbar and laid it in front of him some fellow walked out and left it here three or four months ago didnt notice it until after he was gone i was going to throw it away but i get a customer now and then who wants to try his luck so he paused tentatively want to have a try chances run from a cent to a dollar well roy looked down at the board affixed to the top were five goldcolored imitation coins representing cash prizes of five to one hundred dollars under each of them a number was printed to win one had only to punch out a corresponding number or numbers from the thousands on the board none of the winners had been punched out bert obviously was as honest as he looked well said roy picking up the little metal key which dangled from the board what can i lose he punched a few numbers laying them out for berts inspection on his sixth punch he hit the fivedollar prize and the proprietor smilingly laid the money on the counter roy let it lay again poised the key over the board he couldnt tell bert that this was a chumps gimmick to do so would reveal knowledge that no honest man should have most certainly and even though someone else was bound to do it he couldnt take the man himself the grift just wasnt for him today or so he rationalized there just wasnt enough at stake if he knocked off every prize on the board the take would be under two hundred dollars and naturally hed never get away with knocking them all off the pros of the racket had always gone for the big one and left the others alone he however had already hit the five so he punched out the tendollar number still smiling pleased rather than disconcerted bert again laid money on the counter roy brought the key up for another punch this was the way to do it hed decided the way to get the board out of circulation one more prize the twentyfive and hed point out that something must be screwy about the board bert would be obliged to get rid of it and he of course would refuse to accept his winnings he punched out the third lucky number properly startled he cleared his throat for the tipoff but bert his smile slightly stiffened now had turned to glance at the coke customer yes sir he said something else yes sir the man said his voice grimly light yes sir theres something else all right you got a federal gamblingtax stamp huh what dont have one huh well ill tell you something else you dont have wont have it long anyway your liquor license bbut bert had paled under his tan california liquor licenses were worth a small fortune bbut you cant do that we were just tell it to the state and federal boys im local he flipped open a leather credentialcase nodded coldly at roy youre pretty stupid mister no one but a stupe would knock a chump off for three balls in a row roy looked at him evenly i dont know what youre talking about he said and i dont like your language on your feet im arresting you for bunco youre making a mistake officer im a salesman and i you giving me a hard time huh hah why you grifting sonofabitch he grabbed roy by the lapels yanked him furiously to his feet and slammed him up against the wall first there was the search the turning out of pockets the probing and slapping of garments the hand brought up on either side of the testicles then came the questions the demanded answers that were immediately labeled lies your right name goddamn you never mind them phony credentials all you hustlers got em that is my right name i live in los angeles and ive worked for the same company for four years stop lying whos working the boards with you how many other places you pulled this gimmick my health has been bad i came down to la jolla last night a friend and i on a holiday all right all right now were gonna start all over again and by god you better come clean officer there are at least a hundred businessmen here in town who can identify me ive been selling to them for years and drop it drop that crap now whats your right name the same questions over and over the same answers over and over now and then the cop turned to the wall telephone to pass his information on for checking but still the information checking out he would not give up he knew what he knew with his own eyes he had seen the bunco worked a punchboard swiftly knocked for three prizes and roys perfect front notwithstanding how could the clear evidence of grifting be ignored he was on the phone again now his heavy face sullen as he got the answers to his questions roy sidled a glance at the bar owner bert he looked at the punchboard on the counter fixedly and again raised his eyes to bert nodded to him ever so slightly but he couldnt be sure that bert got the message the cop slammed up the phone he stared at roy sourly rubbed a meaty hand over his face hesitating he tried to form the words which the situation called for the apology which outraged instinct and flouted the evidence of his own eyes from up the bar roy heard a dull grinding sound the garbage disposal he grinned quietly to himself well officer he said any more questions thats all the cop jerked his head looks like i maybe made a mistake yes you slam me around and insult me and treat me like a criminal and then you say you maybe made a mistake thats supposed to smooth everything over well mouth tight choking over the words sorry pologize no offense roy was content to settle for that savagely the cop turned on bert all right mister i want the number of your liquor license im turning you in for for wheres that punchboard what punchboard damn you dont you pull that crap on me the board that was right there on the counter the one that this guy was playing now you either hand it over or ill find it myself bert picked up a rag and began mopping the couflter i usually clean up this time of day he said clear up all the odds and ends of junk and throw em down the garbage disposer now i cant say that i remember any punchboard but if there was one here you threw it away yyou think you can get away with that cant i bert said the cop stammered in furious incoherence he said youll see by god youll see and turning savagely to roy you too mister you aint got me fooled a damned bit im gonna be on the lookout for you and the next time you hit this town he whirled and stalked out of the place grinning roy sat back down at his stool acts like hes sore about something he said how about another ale no bert said what now look bert im sorry if there was any trouble but it was your punchboard i didnt i know it was my mistake but i never make the same mistake twice now i want you to leave and i dont want you to come back another customer came in and bert began to wait on him roy arose and walked out the dazzling sunlight struck against his face its strength doubled with the contrast of the cool and shadowed bar the cold ale how much had he drunk anyway roiled in his stomach then uneasily settled back he wasnt drunk by any means he never got drunk but it wasnt smart to start back to la jolla without eating there was a small restaurant around the next corner and he had a bowl of soup there and two cups of black coffee startled he noticed the time as he left five minutes after one and he glanced around for a telephone but the place apparently had none no public phone at any rate so he went on out to his car it was probably best not to call moira he decided the police would have called her and he didnt want to make explanations over the phone he went back down the long hill to mission valley then took the road left toward the coast it was about twenty minutes drive to la jolla twentyfive minutes at the outside then he would be back at the hotel with moira lightly explaining the cop trouble as a a case of mistaken identity no no something more ordinary something that might logically evolve from an innocent circumstance this car for example was a rented car the last driver might have been involved in a serious traffic violation he had fled say from the scene of an accident so when the police spotted the car this morning well sure there were inconsistencies in the story the police would have known it was a rented car by the license number but that wasnt up to him to explain hed been the victim of a police booboo who could figure out their mistakes a hell of a morning he thought it was berts punchboard why should he get tough with me what the hell do i care what a barkeep thinks near the intersection with pacific highway the traffic about him thickened and at the highway itself it was stalled in a fourlane tangle which two cops were struggling to undo that didnt jibe with the normal pattern of monday in san diego traffic wasnt this bad even during the shiftchanges at the aircraft plants and it was the wrong hour for that the cars crept forward slowly roys car moving with them almost an hour later near mission beach he turned off the highway and into a filling station and here he learned the reason for the congestion the horses were running at del mar it was the beginning of the local racing season in another thirty minutes the traffic had thinned and rejoining it he reached la jolla some twenty minutes later so he was very late and entering the hotel he called moiras room from the lobby there was no answer but she had left a message for him with the clerk why yes mr dillon she said to tell you shed gone to the races the races roy frowned youre sure yes sir but she was only going to stay for part of the days program shell be back early she said i see roy nodded by the way was there a call from the police about me a couple of hours ago the clerk admitted delicately that there had been also revealing that there had been a similar call to mrs langtry naturally we spoke of you in the highest terms mr dillonit was uh nothing serious i hope nothing thanks roy said and he went on up to his room he stood for some time before the french windows staring out at the sunsparkled sea then eyes hurting a little he stretched out on the bed letting his thoughts roam at will piercing them together with hunch and instinct until they formed a pattern first there was her curiosity about the way he lived the job he held why did he stay on year after year at a place like the grosvenorcarlton why did he cling year after year to a relatively smalltime commission job then there were her subtle complaints about their relationship they didnt really know each other they needed to get acquainted so he had arranged this excursion a means of getting acquainted and how did she use the time why by putting him on his own at every opportunity and then sitting back to see what happened so now she knew she must know her actions today proved that she did the police had called her about him yet she had not been concerned she had known that he would be all right that just as his front had held up for years it would continue to hold up in this trouble whatever that trouble was so having found out all that she needed to she had gone off to the races the races abruptly he sat up scowling his mild annoyance with her turning to anger she had stalled on coming to la jolla after being so anxious for the trip she had unreasonably found reason to postpone it until this week because this was the beginning of the del mar meet and the tracks in the la area were temporarily inactive or maybe not he couldnt be absolutely sure that she was nosing into lillys business as she had nosed into his it might be that she was simply sore at him for leaving her alone so long and that she had gone to the races as a way of expressing her displeasure moira returned to the hotel around four oclock fretting humorously over the discomforts of her cab ride pretending to pout at roy for going off without her i just thought id teach you a lesson you big stinker youre not mad are you im not sure i understand that the police called you about me oh that she shrugged what was the trouble anyway you wouldnt have any idea well she began to draw in a little bit coming over to the bed she sat down gingerly at his side roy ive been wanting to talk to you for a long time but before i could i wanted to make sure that let it ride a little he said carelessly did you see lilly at the races lilly oh you mean your mother isnt she living in los angeles now roy said that she was but the la meets closed last week so shed be down here at del mar wouldnt she how do i know what are you getting at anyway she started to get up he held her taking a grip on the front of her dress now ill ask you again did you see lilly at the del mar track no how could i i sat in the clubhouse roy smiled thinly pointing out her blunder and lilly wouldnt be in the clubhouse hmm now how did you know that because i i she colored guiltily all right roy i saw her i was snooping but its not like you think i was just curious about her wondering why shed come to los angeles and she was always so nasty to me i knew she was knocking me to you every chance she got so i just thought who is she to be so high and mighty and i talked with a friend of mine in baltimore and and i see you must have some very knowledgeable friends roy she begged dont be angry with me i wouldnt do anything to hurt her any more than i would you youd better never try he said lilly travels in some very fast company i know she nodded meekly im sorry dear lilly didnt see you today oh no i didnt hang around roy honest she kissed him smiling into his eyes now about us yes he nodded we may as well go back to los angeles hadnt we youve found out what you wanted to know now honey dont take it like that i think i must have known for a longtime i was just waiting for the right opportunity to talk to you and just what do you know about me anyway i know youre a shortcon operator a very good one apparently you talk the lingo whats your pitch the long end the bigcon he nodded waited she snuggled close to him pressing his hand against her breast wed make a hell of a team roy we think alike we get along well together why darling we could work for two months out of the year and live high for the other ten i wait he said gently pushing her away this isnt something to rush into moira its going to take a lot of talking about well so lets talk not here we didnt come here on business we dont talk it here she searched his face and her smile faded a little i see she said you think it might be hard to give me a turndown here it would be easier on the home grounds youre smart he said maybe youre too smart moira but i didnt say i was turning it down well she shrugged and stood up if thats the way you want it thats the way i want it he said they caught the six oclock train back to los angeles it was crowded as the train coming down had been but the composition of the crowd was different these passengers were largely business people men who had put in a long day in san diego and were now returning to their los angeles homes or those who lived in san diego and were due in los angeles early in the morning then there were those few who had overstayed their weekends and faced reproaches or worse when they arrived in the california metropolis the holiday spirit was definitely absent a kind of moodiness pervaded the train and some of it enveloped moira and roy they had a drink in the halfempty lounge then discovering that the train carried no diner they remained in the car for the rest of their ride seated in the cozy closeness of a booth her thigh pressed warmly against his moira looked out at the aching loneliness of the sea the naked and hungering hills the houses closed firmly to all but themselves the idea that she had propounded to him something that was merely desired became a tigerish must a thing that had to be it was either that or nothing and so it had to be that she could not go on as she had the past few years eking out her capital with her body exchanging her bodys use for the sustenance it needed there were not enough years left and the body inevitably used more than it received always as the years grew fewer the more rapidly the flesh depleted itself so an end to things as they had been an end to the race with self the mind grew youthful with use increasingly eager with the demands of its owner anxious and able to provide for the body that gave it shelter to imbue it with its own youth and vigor or a reasonable facsimile thereof and thus the mind must be used from now on the everlucrative schemes which the mind could concoct and put into practice her mind and roys the two working together as one and the money which he could and must supply perhaps she had pushed her hand a little too hard no man liked to be pushed perhaps her interest in lilly dillon had been a blunder every man was sensitive about his mother but no matter what she suggested was right and reasonable it would be good for both of them it was what had to be and damn him hed better he made some casual comment nudging her for a response and seething with her own thoughts she turned on him her face aged with hatred startled he drew back frowning hey now whats the matter nothing just thinking about something she smiled dropping the mask so swiftly that he was not sure of what he had seen what was it you said he shook his head he couldnt remember what it was now but maybe i should know your name lady your right one how about langley langley he puzzled over it for a moment then langley you mean the farmer you teamed with farmer langley thats me pal well now he hesitated what happened to him anyway i heard a lot of stories but the same thing that happens to all of em a lot of them i mean he just blew up booze dope the route i see he said i see now dont you worry about him she snuggled closer to him misreading his attitude thats all over and done with theres just us now moira langtry and roy dillon hes still alive isnt he possibly i really dont know she said and she might have said and i dont care for the knowledge had come to her suddenly though unsurprisingly that she didnt care that she had never really cared about him it was as though she had been hypnotized by him overwhelmed by his personality as others had been forced to go his way to accept his as the right and only way yet always subconsciously resisting and resisting slowly building up hatred for being forced into a life and what kind of life was it anyway for an attractive young woman that was entirely foreign to the one she wanted it was nothing clear defined nothing she was consciously aware of or could admit to but still she knew in her secret mind knew and felt guilty about it and so when the blowup came she had tried to take care of him but even that had been a means of striking back at him the final firm push over the brink and subconsciously knowing this she had felt still more guilty and was haunted by him yet now her feelings brought to the surface she saw there was not and had never been anything to feel guilty about the farmer had got what he deserved anyone who deprived her of something she wanted deserved what he got it was pinefifteen when the train pulled into los angeles she and roy had a good dinner in the station restaurant then they ran through a light rain to his car and drove out to her apartment she threw off her wraps briskly turned to him holding out her arms he held her for a moment kissing her but inwardly drawing back a little subtly cautioned by something in her manner now she said drawing him down onto the lounge now we get down to business do we he laughed awkwardly before we do that maybe wed better i can scrape up ten grand without much trouble that would leave twenty or twentyfive for your end theres a place in oklahoma now wide open if the ice is right as good as fort worth was in the old days we can move in there with a wire store and wait said roy hold it keed it would be perfect roy say ten grand for the store ten for the ice and another ten for i said to hold it not so fast he said angering a little now i havent said i was going to throw in with you what she looked at him blankly a slight glaze over her eyes what did you say he repeated the statement softening it with a laugh youre talking some tall figures what makes you think ive got that kind of money why you must have youre bound to she smiled at him firmly a teacher reproving an errant child now you know you do roy do i yes i watched you work on the train as slick an operator as i ever saw you dont get that smooth overnight it takes years and youve been getting away with it for years living on a square john income and taking the fools for and ive been doing some taking myself twice in less than two months enough to put me in the hospital here and in san diego today so what she brushed the interruption aside that doesnt change anything all it proves is that its time you moved up get up where theres big dough at stake and you dont have to stick your neck out every day maybe i like it where i am well i dont like it what are you trying to pull on me anyway what the hell are you trying to hand me he stared at her not knowing whether to laugh or be angry his lips twitching uncertainly he had never seen this woman before he had never heard her before the rain whispered against the window distantly there was a faint whirring of an elevator and with it with those sounds the sound of her heavy breathing labored furious id better run along now he said well talk about it some other time well talk about it now by god then he said quietly theres nothing to talk about moira the answer is no he stood up she jumped up with him why she demanded just tell me why damn you roy nodded a glint coming into his eyes he said that the best reason he could think of was that she scared the hell out of him ive seen people like you before baby doubletough and sharp as a tack and they get what they want or else but they dont get by with it forever bull huhuh history sooner or later the lightning hits em honey i dont want to be around when it hits you he started for the door wildeyed her face mottled with rage she flung herself in front of him its your mother isnt it sure it is one of those keepitinthefamily deals thats why you act so funny around each other thats why you were living at her apartment whaat he came to a dead stop what are you saying dont act so goddamned innocent you and your own mother gah im wise to you i should have seen it before why you rotten sonofabitch how is it hmm how do you like how do you like this roy said he slapped her suddenly catching her with a backhanded slap as she reeled she leaped at him hands clawed and he grabbed her by the hair and flung her and she came down sprawling on the floor a little wonderingly he looked at her as she raised her smudged and reddened face you see he said you see why it wouldnt do moira you ddirty bastard youre going to see something im sorry moira he said good night and good luck at the curb outside her apartment house he lingered briefly before entering his car relishing the rain against his face liking the cool clean feel of it here was normality something elemental and honest he was very glad he was out here in the rain instead of up there with her back at his hotel he lay awake for a time thinking about moira wondering at how little sense of loss he felt at losing her was tonight merely a finalizing of something that he had long intended to do it seemed so it had the feeling about it of the expected it might even be that his strong attraction for carol had been a reaction to moira an attempt to attach himself to another woman and thus be detached from her carol he fidgeted uncomfortably then put her out of his mind hed have to do something about her he decided some day soon somehow hed have to smooth things over with her as for moira he frowned on the point of falling asleep then relaxed with a shake of his head no no danger there shed gotten sore and blown her top but she was probably regretting it already at any rate there was nothing she could do and she was too smart to try her own position was too tenuous she was wide open for a smackingdown herself he fell into a deep sleep having slept so little the night before he rested well and it was after nine when he awakened he sprang out of bed feeling good and full of energy starting to plan the days schedule as he reached for a robe then slowly drearily he sat back down for here he was again as he had been last week here he was again still confronted by emptiness barred from his selling job barred from any activity faced with a day an endless series of days with nothing to do dully he cursed kaggs he cursed himself again hopefully hopeless as he bathed and shaved as he dressed and went out to breakfast he sought some way out of the impasse and his mind came up with the same two answers answers which were wholly unacceptable one he could take the sales managers job take it without further stalling around and give up the grifting or two he could jump town and go to another city begin all over again as he had begun when he first came to los angeles breakfast over he got into his car and began to drive aimlessly without destination the most tiresome way of driving when this became unbearable as it very shortly did he pulled in to the curb and parked peevishly his mind returned to the impossible problem kaggs he thought bitterly that damned perk kaggs why couldnt he have left me alone why did he have to be so damned sure that i the futile thinking interrupted itself his frown faded and a slow smile played around his lips kaggs was a man of snap judgment a man who made up his mind in a hurry so probably he would unmake it just as fast he would take no nonsense from anyone given sufficient reason and without apology he would snatch back from the sales managers job as promptly as he had proffered roy called him from a nearby drugstore he was still forbidden to work for a while he said but perhaps kaggs would like to have lunch with him kaggs said that he seldom took time for lunch he usually settled for a sandwich in his office maybe you should start going out roy told him oh you mean on account of my ulcers well i mean on account of your disposition it might help you to get along better with people he grinned coldly listening to the startled silence that poured over the wire then kaggs said equably well maybe it would at that twelve oclock suit you no it doesnt id rather eat at one kaggs said fine that was better for him too one oclock then the little place across the street roy hung up the phone he considered the advisability of showing up late for the appointment and decided against it that would be simply rudeness crudeness it would do nothing but arouse kaggs suspicions already perhaps he had pursued the line of brusqueness too far he arrived at the restaurant a little before one they ate at a small table in the rear of the place and somehow the meeting went pretty much as the first one had somehow and much to roys annoyance the feeling of empathy grew between them toward the end of the meal kaggs did a surprising thing surprising that is for him reaching across the table he gave roy a shy slap on the shoulder feeling lousy arent you boy like you could bite nails what roy looked at him startled what makes you think that youd just have to i know i would a man can idle around so long and then it begins to drive him nuts why dont you come back to the office with me for a while sort of look the setup over well i youre busy and so ill put you to work too kaggs stood up smiling im kidding of course you can just look around take a gander at the salesmens file if you like do what you want to and pull out when you want to well roy shrugged why not the question was rhetorical he could think of no valid reason to decline similarly finding himself in kaggs office at sarber webb he was forced to accept the file which kaggs shoved in front of him to show at least a semblance of interest in its various cards resentfully he saw himself a victim of kaggs highhandedness kaggs had taken charge of him again as he had on that first day but that wasnt really true more accurately he was his own victim his own slave he had made personality a profession created a career out of selling himself and he could not stray far or for long from his selfmade self he riffled through the cards unseeing he began to see them to read the meaning in them they became people and money and life itself and thoughtfully one at a time he took them out of the file and spread them out on the desk he picked up a pencil reached for a lined pad of scratch paper as he worked kaggs gave him an occasional covert glance and a smug smile tightened his thin lips a couple of hours passed and kaggs arose and strolled over to his desk how are you doing sit down roy said and as the other man obeyed i think this record system is all wrong perk i dont want to tread on anyones toes whoever set it up but tread away nothings sacred around here well its misleading a waste of time take this man here his gross sales for the week are six hundred and fifty dollars his commission over in this column totals eightyone dollars whats his percentage of the weeks sales id have to figure it up roughly eight per cent not necessarily depending on what he sold he might have some twentyfive per cent stuff in there the point is just what the hell was it that he sold how much of it was practically lossleader stuff items that we have to sell in order to compete kaggs looked at him sharply hesitated well of course theres his sales slips thats what his commissions were figured from but where are the sales slips accounting gets a copy inventory gets a copy and of course the customer gets one at the time of purchase why does inventory need a copy the stuff is checked off at the time it leaves the shop isnt it or at least it could be youve got some duplicate effort if it isnt where you need a copy is here in the salesmans file but not in a file like this of course there isnt enough room but it doesnt have to be like this we dont have so many salesmen that we couldnt set up a separate file on each one give each man a section in one of the filing cabinets kaggs scratched his head hmm he said well maybe it ought to be done perk it just about has to be if youre going to have a clear picture of whats going on tie the sales slips to the salesmen and you know which men are selling and which are running a milk route ordertakers you know what items are moving and which need pushing and which should be dropped entirely of course youll know all that eventually anyway but waiting can cost you a hell of a lot of money and roy broke off abruptly suddenly abashed by his tone and his words he shook his head dismayed like a man coming into wakefulness just listen to me he said i come in here for the first time and i start kicking your system to pieces so kick it some more kick the crap out of it kaggs beamed at him how are you feeling anyway getting tired want to knock off for the day no im okay but well lets see then kaggs skidded his chair closer and reached for a pencil what would you say to an hour went by two hours in the outer offices one of the clerks turned a startled stare on her neighbor did you hear that she whispered he was laughing old picklepuss kaggs laughed out loud i heard said the other girl grimly but i dont believe it that guy never learned how to laugh at fivethirty that evening the telephone operator plugged in her night numbers and closed her board the outer offices darkened and became silent as the last of the office employees filed out and at six the downstairs workers departing to the muted clanging of the timeclock the silence and the dimness became absolute at eight oclock perk kaggs removed his glasses and rubbed his eyes he looked around blinking absently and a bewildered look spread over his face with an amazed curse he jumped to his feet my god look at the time where the hell did the day go to what roy frowned whats the matter perk come on youre getting out of here right this minute damnit my god kaggs swore again i ask you to drop in for a few minutes and you put in a days work they had a late dinner together as they said good night kaggs gave him a sharp searching glance level with me roy he said quietly you do want this job dont you you want to be sales manager well roy hesitated for a flicker of a second there it was here was his chance to refuse and he knew suddenly that he could refuse without apology or explanation he could say simply no that he didnt want it and that would be that he could go back to his old life where he had left it for something had happened between him and kaggs something that made them friends and friends do not question each others motives why of course i want it he said firmly what gave you the idea that i didnt nothing i just thought that nothing kaggs returned to his usual briskness to hell with it to hell with you go home and get some sleep and dont show up at the shop again until the doctor says youre ready youre the boss roy grinned night perk driving back to the hotel he started to rationalize his decision to find some devious reason for doing what he had done but that passed very quickly why shouldnt he take a job that he wanted to take why shouldnt a man want a friend a real friend when he has never before had one he put the car away and entered the hotel the elderly night clerk hailed him you had a phone call this morning mr dillon your mother my mother roy paused why didnt you leave word for me where i work i was going to sir but she said not to bother didnt have time to wait i guess roy picked up a house phone put in a call to lillys apartment he hung up a moment or two later puzzled uneasy lilly was gone she had checked out of her apartment this morning leaving no forwarding address he went upstairs frowning he shucked out of his clothes and lay down on the bed he tossed and turned for a while worrying then gradually he relaxed and began to doze lilly could take care of herself there could be must be an innocent reason for her sudden move del mar she might have moved there for the race meet or she might have found a more desirable apartment here in town that had to be taken immediately or perhaps bobojustus had suddenly recalled her to baltimore he fell asleep after what seemed only an instant he came awake sunlight flooded the room it was late in the morning he was conscious that the phone had been ringing for a very long time it was now silent but its din was still in his ears he started to reach for it his senses dull not fully free of the stupor of sleep and there was a knock on the door a steady knocking he crossed to it opened it enough to look out he blinked at the man there then the man identifying himself stating his business with professional regret apologizing for the errand that had brought him here roy let the door open wide and he stood shaking his head as the man came inside no he shouted silently it wasn t true it was some stupid mistakelilly wouldn tbein tucson why why he said it aloud glaring at his visitor the latter pursed his lips thoughtfully you didnt know she was in arizona mr dillon she didnt tell you she was going of course she didnt because she didnt go i i he hesitated some of his caution asserting itself i mean my mother and i werent very close we went our own ways i hadnt seen her for almost eight years until she came here a few weeks ago but i understand the man nodded that jibes with our information such as it is well youre wrong anyway roy said doggedly its someone else my mother wouldnt im afraid not mr dillon it was her own gun registered to her the proprietor of the tourist court remembers that she was very distraught of course it does seem a little odd that shed use a gun with a silencer on it for for something like that but and she didnt it doesnt make sense it never does mr dillon it never makes sense when a person commits suicide the man was slightly bald heavyset with a plump honest face his name was chadwick and he was a treasury department agent obviously he felt a little awkward about being here at such a time but it was his job distasteful though it might be and he meant to do it he did however lead into his business circuitously you understand why i came rather than the local police mr dillon it really isnt their affair at least at this point im afraid there may be some unpleasant publicity later on when the circumstances of your mothers death are revealed an attractive widow with so much money in her possession but i see said roy the money more than a hundred and thirty thousand dollars mr dillon hidden in the trunk of her car im very much afraid delicately im afraid she hadnt paid taxes on it shed been falsifying her returns for years roy gave him a wry look the body was discovered this morning about eight oclock right you seem to have been a very busy little man chadwick agreed simply that he had been our office here hasnt had time to make a thorough investigation but the evidence is indisputable your mother couldnt have saved that much out of hen reported income she was a tax evader how terrible too bad you cant put her in jail please chadwick winced i know how you feel but im sorry roy said quietly that wasnt very fair just what do you want me to do mr chadwick well im required to ask if you intend to lay claim to the money if you care to say that is possibly youd rather consult a lawyer before you decide no roy said i wont lay any claim to the money i dont need it and i dont want it thank you thank you very much now i wonder if you can give me any information as to the source of your mothers income it seems obvious you know that there must have been tax evasions on the part of others and roy shook his head i imagine you know as much about my mothers associates as i do mr chadwick probably he added with a tiredly crooked grin you know a hell of a lot more chadwick nodded gravely and stood up hesitating hat in hand he glanced around the room and there was approval in his eyes and a quiet concern lillys money had had to be impounded he murmured her car everything she owned but roy mustnt think that the government was heartless in these matters any sum necessary for her burial would be released youll want to see to the arrangements personally i imagine but if theres anything i can do to help he took a business card from his wallet and laid it on the table if you can tell me when you might care to leave for tucson if you are going that is ill notify the local authorities and id like togo nowjust as soon as i can get a plane let me help you chadwick said he picked up the phone and called the airport he spoke briskly reciting a government code number he glanced at roy get you out in an hour mr dillon or if thats too soon ill make it ill be there roy said and he began flinging on his clothes chadwick accompanied him to his car shook hands with him warmly as roy opened the door good luck to you mr dillon iwish we could have met under happier circumstances youve been fine roy told him and im glad we met regardless he had never seen the traffic worse than it was that day it took all his concentration to get through it and he was glad for the respite from thinking about lilly he got to the airport with ten minutes to spare picking up his ticket he hurried toward the gate to his plane and then moved by a sudden hunch he swerved into a telephone booth a minute or two later he emerged from it grimfaced a cold rage in his heart he went onto his plane it was a propeller job since his trip was a relatively short one a mere five hundred and eighty miles as it circled the field and winged south a stewardess began serving the preluncheon drinks roy took a double bourbon sipping it he settled back in his seat and gazed out the window but the drink was tasteless and he gazed at nothing lilly poor lilly she hadnt killed herself shed been murdered for moira langtry was also gone from her apartment moira also had checked out yesterday morning leaving no forwarding address there was one thing about playing the angles if you played them long enough you knew the other guys as well as you knew your own most of the time it was like you were looking out the same window given a certain set of circumstances you knew just about what he would do or what he had done so without actually knowing what had happened just how and why lilly had been brought to her death roy knew enough he could make a guess which came astonishingly close to the truth moira had a contact in baltimore moira knew that lilly would be carrying heavy that like any successful operator she would have accumulated a great deal of money which would never be very far from her as to just how far just where it might be hidden moira didnt know she might look forever without finding it thus lilly had had to be put on the run for running she would take the loot with her necessarily narrowing its possible whereabouts to her immediate vicinity how to make her run no problem there for a fearful shadow lies constantly over the residents of uneasy street it casts itself through the ostensibly friendly handshake or the gorgeously wrapped package it beams out from the babys carriage the barbers chair the beauty parlor every neighbor is suspect every outsider everyone period even ones own husband or wife or sweetheart there is no ease on uneasy street the longer ones tenancy the more untenable it becomes you didnt need to frighten lilly only to frighten her a little more and if you had a contact at her home base someone to give her a friendly warning by telephone roy finished his drink he ate the lunch which the stewardess served him she took the tray away and he smoked a cigarette and the plane dropped lower over the desert and came into the tucson glide pattern a police car was waiting for him at the airport it carried him swiftly into the city and a police captain took him into a private office and gave him such facts as he could checked into the motor court around ten last night mr dillon its that big place with the two swimming pools you passed it on the way into town the night clerk says she seemed pretty jumpy but i dont know that you can put much stock in that people always remember that other people acted or looked or talked funny after somethings happened to em anyway your mother left a seventhirty call and when she didnt answer her phone one of the maids finally got around to looking in on her lilly was dead she was lying in bed in her nightclothes the gun was on the floor at the side of the bed judging by her appearance roy winced shed put the muzzle in her mouth and pulled the trigger there was no disarray in the room no sign of a struggle no suicide note thats about all we know mr dillon the captain concluded and he added with casual pointedness unless you can tell us something roy said that he couldnt and that was true he could only say what he suspected and such guilty suspicions would only damage him while proving nothing at all against moira it might make a little trouble for her cause her to be picked up and questioned but it would accomplish no more than that i dont know what i could tell you he said ive got an idea that she traveled with a pretty fast crowd but im sure youre already aware of that yes do you think it might not have been suicide that someone killed her no the captain frowned hesitantly i cant say that i think that not exactly theres nothing to indicate murder it does seem strange that shed come all the way from los angeles to kill herself and that shed get into her nightclothes before doing it but well suicides do strange things id say that she was badly frightened so afraid of being killed that she went out of her mind that sounds reasonable roy nodded do you think someone followed her to the motel the person whod frightened her i mean possibly but the place is on the highway you know people are coming in and out at all hours if the guilty person was one of them it would be practically impossible to tab him and short of getting his confession to making a death threat i dont know how we could stick him if he was tabbed roy murmured agreement there was only one thing more that he could say one more little nudge toward moira that he could safely give the captain im sure youve already looked into it captain but what about fingerprints wouldnt they uh fingerprints the officer smiled sadly fingerprints are for detective stories mr dillon if you dusted this office youd probably have a hard time finding a clear set of mine youd probably find hundreds of smudged prints and unless you knew when they were made and just who you were looking for i dont know what the devil youd do with them aside from that criminals at work have an unfortunate habit of wearing gloves and many of the worst ones have no police record your mother for example had never been mugged or printed im sorry he added quickly i didnt mean to refer to her as a criminal but i understand roy said its all right now there are a few items of your mothers personal property which youll want her wedding ring and so on if youll just sign this receipt roy signed and was given a thin brown envelope he pocketed it the pitiful residue of lillys hard and harried years and the captain escorted him back to the waiting police car the undertaking establishment was on a side street a sedately imposing building of white stucco which blazed blindly in the afternoon sun but inside it was almost sickeningly cool roy shivered slightly as he stepped into the toofragrant interior the manager of the place apparently alerted to his coming sprang forward sympathetically so sorry mr dillon so terribly sorry no matter how we try to prepare for these tragic moments im all right roy removed his arm from the mans grasp id like to see my mothers my mother please shouldnt you sit down a moment first or perhaps youd like a drink no roy said firmly i wouldnt it might be best mr dillon it would give us a little time to uh well you understand sir due to the unusual financial involvements we have been unable to uh perform the cosmetic duties which we normally would the loved ones remains the poor dear face curtly roy cut him off he understood he said also he said enjoying the managers wince of distaste he knew what a bullet fired into a womans mouth could do to her face now i want to see her now as you wish sir the man drew himself up please to follow me he led the way to a whitetiled room behind the chapel the cold here was icy a series of drawers was set into one of the frostily gleaming walls he gripped a drawer by its metal handle and gave it a tug and it glided outward on its bearings with an offended gesture he stepped back and roy advanced to the crypt and looked into it he looked and looked quickly away he started to turn away and then slowly concealing his surprise he forced his eyes back on the woman in the coffin they were about the same size the same coloring they had the same full but delicatelyboned bodies but the hands the hand where was the evil burn that had been inflicted on it where was the scar that such a burn must leave well doubtless it was on the hand of the woman who had killed this woman the woman whom moira langtry had intended to kill and who had killed moira langtry instead it was late evening when the dusty cadillac reached downtown los angeles pulled up a few doors short of the grosvenorcarlton the driver leaned wearily over the wheel for a moment limp with exhaustion a little dizzy from sleeplessness then resolutely she raised her head removed the tinted sunglasses and studied herself in the mirror her eyes were strained bloodshot but that didnt matter they would probably be a hell of a lot worse she suspected before she was safely out of this mess the glasses covered them also helping to disguise her face with the glasses on and with the scarf drawn tightly around her head and under her chin she could pass as moira langtry shed done it back at the tucson motel and she could do it again she made some minor adjustments on the scarf pulling it a little lower on her forehead then throwing off her weariness subjecting it to her will she got out of the car and entered the hotel the clerk greeted her with the anxious smile of the aged he heard her request a command rather and a touch of uncertainty tinged his smile well uh mr dillons out of town mrs langtry went to tucson this morning and i know that but hes due back in just a few minutes im supposed to meet him here now if youll kindly give me his key but but you wouldnt like to wait down there no i would not imperiously she held out her hand the key please fumbling he took the key from the rack and gave it to her looking after her as she swung toward the elevator he thought with nonbitterness that fear was the worst part of being old the anxiety born of fear a fella knew that he wasnt much good any more oh yes he knew it and he knew he didnt always talk too bright and he couldnt really look nice no matter how hard he tried so knowing in his heart that it was impossible to please anyone he struggled valiantly to please everyone and thus he made mistakes one after the other until finally he could no more bear himself than other people could bear him and he died but maybe he thought hopefully this would be all right after all mrs langtry and mr dillon weregood friends and visitors did sometimes wait in a guests room when the guest was out meanwhile entering roys room the woman locked the door and sagged against it briefly resting then dropping the sunglasses and her modishly large handbag on the bed she went resolutely to the four boxframed clown pictures they had caught her attention the first time she had seen them something that struck a jarring note entirely incompatible with the known tastes of their owner they couldnt have been there as decoration so they must serve another purpose and without seeing the symbolism in the four wisely grinning faces clotho lachesis atropos and a fourth selfnominated fate roy dillon she had guessed what that purpose was now prying loose the backs of the pictures she saw that her guess was right the money tumbled out sheaf after sheaf of currency stuffing it into her bag she was struck with unwilling admiration for roy he must be good to have piled up this much then stifling this emotion telling herself that the theft would be good for him by pointing up the fruitlessness of crime she finished her task large as it was the bag bulged with its burden of loot she could barely close the clasp and she wasnt at all sure that it would stay closed she hefted it frowning she put it under her arm draping an end of the stole over it checked her appearance in the mirror it didnt look bad she thought not too bad if only the damned thing didnt fly open as she was passing through the lobby she considered the advisability of leaving some of the money behind and abruptly vetoed the idea huhuh she needed that dough every damned penny of it and a lot more besides she gave the mirror a final swift glance then the purse clutched tightly under her arm she crossed to the door and unlocked it pulled it open and fell back with a startled gasp hello lilly said roy dillon the basic details of her story were just about what roy expected them to be first there had been the warning call from baltimore then responding to it her frantic unreasoning flight she drove as hard as she could and as long as she could when she could go no further she turned in at the tucson tourist court the place had a garage rather than individual car ports and she hadnt liked that but she was too tired to go farther and since a garage attendant was on duty at all times she could not reasonably object to the arrangement she put the loaded gun under her pillow she undressed and went to bed yes naturally she had locked her door but that probably didnt mean much those places motels and tourist courts lost so many keys that they often had them made interchangeable the same keys unlocking different doors and that was doubtless the case here anyway she awakened hours later with two hands clutching her throat hands that silenced any outcry she might make as they strangled her to death she couldnt see who it was she didnt care she had been warned that she would be killed and now she was being killed and that was enough to know she got the gun from under her pillow blindly she had shoved it upward into the face of her assailant and pulled the trigger and and lilly shuddered convulsively her voice breaking god roy you don t know what it was like what it means to killsomeoneallyour life you hear about it and read about it bbut but when you do it yourself moira was in her nightclothes an old trick of nocturnal prowlers caught in anothers room they lay it to accident claiming that they left their own room on some innocent errand and somehow strayed into the wrong one there was a tagged key in moiras pocket the key to a nearby room also it was the key to lillys predicament it pointed to a plan readymade and without thinking she knew what she must do she put moira in her bed she wiped her own fingerprints from the gun and pressed moiras prints upon it she spent the night in moiras room and in the morning she checked out under moiras name and with the dead womans clothes naturally she couldnt take her own car the car and the money hidden in it now belonged to moira also for moira was now lillian dillon and lilly was moira langtry and so it must always be what a mess and ailfor nothing iguess i was jake with bobo all the time but now that its happened she paused brightening a little well maybe its a break for me after all ive been wanting out of the racket for yea rs and now im out i can make a clean start and youve already made a start roy said but it doesnt look very clean to me im sorry lilly flushed guiltily i hated to take your money but dont be sorry roy said youre not taking it for a long moment a silent secondlong eternity lilly sat staring at her son looking into eyes that were her eyes meeting a look as level as her own so much alike she thought and the thought was also his why can t i make him understand she thought and he thought why can t i make her understand shakily a cold deadness growing in her heart she arose and went into the bathroom she bathed her face in the sink patted it dry with a towel and took a drink of water then thoughtfully she refilled the glass and carried it out to her son why thank you lilly he said touched by the small courtesy disarmed by it and lilly told herself hes askingfor it ihelped him when he was in a bind and if he tries to hold out on me now well he just hadn t better i have to have that dough roy she said she had a bankbook in her purse but that doesnt do me any good i cant risk tapping it all she had on her was a few hundred bucks and what the hell am i going to do with that roy said she could do quite a bit with it a few hundred would get her to san francisco or some other nottoodistant city it would give her a month to live quietly while she looked for a job a job lilly gasped im almost forty years old and ive never held a legit job in my life you can do it roy said youre smart and attractive there are any number of jobs you can hold just dump the cad somewhere bury it a cad wont fit in with the way youll be living and save it lilly cut him off with an angry knifing gesture you sit there telling me what to do a guy socrooked that he has to eat soup with a corkscrew i shouldnt have to tell you you should be able to see it for yourself roy leaned forward pleadingly a legit job and a quiet life are the only way for you lil you start showing up at the tracks or the hot spots and bobos boys will be on you i know that damnit i know ive got to lay low and i will but the other its good advice lilly im following it myself yeah sure you are i see you giving up the grift whats so strange about it its what you wanted you kept pushing it at me okay lilly said so youre on the level so you dont need the money do you you dont need it or want it so why the hell wont you give it to me roy sighed tried to explain why to explain acceptably the most difficult of propositions ie that the painful thing you are doing for a person is really for his or her own good and yet talking to her watching her distress there was in his mind unadmitted an almost sadistic exulting harking back to childhood perhaps rooted back there back in the time when he had known need or desire and been denied because the denial was good for him now it was his turn now he could do the right thing and yes it was right simply by doing nothing now now now the pimp disciplining his whore listening to her pleas and striking yet another blow now now now he was the wise and strong husband taking his frivolous wife in hand now now now his subconscious was taking note of the bond between them the lewd forbidden and until now unadmitted bond and so he must protect her keep her from the danger which the money would inevitably lead her to keep her available now look lilly he said reasonably that money wouldnt last you forever maybe seven or eight years what would you do then well id think of something dont worry about that part roy nodded evenly yes he said youd think of something another racket another bobo justus to slap you around and burn holes in your hand thats the way it would turn out lilly that way or worse if you cant change now while youre still relatively young how could you do it when you were crowding fifty fifty there was an ancient sound about it and the odor of haggishness and the mousemouthed look of death and carol ah yes carol a dear girl a desirable girl perhaps except for the untilnowu nadm itted bond the girl but as it was onlya ploy apawn in the game of life death and love between roy and lillian dillon so so thats how it is lil roy said why i cant let you have the money i mean uh his voice faltered weakily his eyes straying away from hers after a moment lilly nodded i know what you mean she said i think i know well he gestured his hands suddenly awkward its certainly simple enough yes lilly said its simple enough very simple and its something else too there was a peculiar glow in her eyes a strange tightness to her face a subdued huskiness to her voice watching him studying him she slowly crossed one leg over the other were criminals roy lets face it we dont have to be lil im turning over a new leaf so can you but weve always had class weve kept our private lives fairly straight theres been certain things we wouldnt do i know so theres no complications i can we can the leg was swinging gently hinting speaking to him holding him hypnotized roy what if i told you i wasnt really your mother that we werent related huh he looked up startled why i youd like that wouldnt you of course you would you dont need to tell me now why would you like it roy he gulped painfully attempted a laugh of assumed nonchalance everything was getting out of hand out of his hands and into hers the sudden awareness of his feelings the sudden understanding of himself all the terror and the joy and the desire held him thralled and wordless roy so softly that he could hardly hear it yyes he gulped again yes i want that money roy ive got to have it now what do i have to do to get it lilly he said or tried to say it and perhaps he did say some of what he meant to lilly you know you cant go on like you were you know youll be caught killed you know im only trying to help you if you didnt mean so much to me id let you have the damned money but ive got to stop you i i maybe she was going to be fair about this you mean you really wont give it to me roy you wont or will you cant i change your mind what can i do to get it and how could he tell her how say the unsayable and yet as she arose moved toward him with the tempting grace with which moira had used to move moira another older woman who had in essence been lilly he tried to tell her and jumbled as it was it was enough for lilly why dont you finish your water dear she said and gratefully welcoming this brief respite he raised the glass and lilly her grip tight on the heavy purse swung it with all her might its my fault she told herself the way i raised him his age my age wrestling and brawling him as though he were a kid brother my fault my creation but what the hell can i do about that now the purse crashed against the glass shattering it the purse flew open and the money spewed out in a green torrent a torrent splattered and splashed with red lilly looked at it bewilderedly she looked at the gushing wound in her sons throat he rose up out of his chair clutching at it and an ugly shard of glass oozed out between his fingers he said bubblingly lil i wwhyy and then his knees crumpled under him and he doubled over and pitched down upon the carpet of redstained bills it was over that quickly over before she could explain or apologize insofar as there was anything to explain or apologize for matteroffactly she began to toe the unstained money to one side gathering the bills into a pile she tied them up in a towel from the bathroom stowed it inside her clothes and took a final look around the room all clear it looked like her son had been killed by moira by someone who didnt exist sure her own fingerprints were all over the room but that wouldnt mean anything after all shed been a visitor to roys room before his death and anyway lilly dillon was officially dead and maybe i am she thought maybe i wish to god that i was bracing herself she let her eyes stray down to her son abruptly a great sob tore through her body and she wept uncontrollably that passed she laughed gave the thing on the floor an almost jeering glance well kid its only one throat huh and then she went out of the room and the hotel and out into the city of angels about the author james meyers thompson was born in
