marmion ed bayne i scott at ashestiel sir walter scotts love of the country induced him after his marriage in to settle in a cottage at the pretty village of lasswade near edinburgh four years after leaving this district he took mr morritt of rokeby to see the little dwelling telling him that though not worth looking at it was our first house when newly married and many a contrivance it had to make it comfortable he then enumerated various devices by which he had secured for mrs scott and himself what seemed to both at the time additional convenience and elegance in and about their home his reminiscences culminated in an account of an arch over the gateway which he had constructed by fastening together the tops of two convenient willows and placing above them a cross made of two sticks this is very beautiful and characteristic and there is much freshness and charm in the further picture of the young cottagers rejoicing over the success of the arrangements to be sure scott concluded it is not much of a lion to show a stranger but i wanted to see it again myself for i assure you after i constructed it mamma mrs scott and i both of us thought it so fine we turned out to see it by moonlight and walked backwards from it to the cottagedoor in admiration of our own magnificence and its picturesque effect it was his way to invest his circumstances with an interest over and above what intrinsically belonged to them and to prompt his friends to a share in his delight when in scott was appointed sheriff of selkirkshire a condition attaching to his post was that he should reside during part of the year within the bounds of his sheriffdom he then removed from lasswade and settled at ashestiel on the tweed seven miles from selkirk this is his own account of the new home we found a delightful retirement by my becoming the tenant of my intimate friend and cousingerman colonel russell in his mansion of ashestiel which was unoccupied during his absence on military service in india the house was adequate to our accommodation and the exercise of a limited hospitality the situation is uncommonly beautiful by the side of a fine river whose streams are there very favourable for angling surrounded by the remains of natural woods and by hills abounding in game in point of society according to the heartfelt phrase of scripture we dwelt amongst our own people and as the distance from the metropolis was only thirty miles we were not out of reach of our edinburgh friends in which city we spent the terms of the summer and winter sessions of the court that is five or six months in the year the functions of the sheriff of selkirkshire admitted of considerable leisure and scott settled at ashestiel full of literary projects as well as heartily prepared to meet his new responsibilities and to add to his numerous and valuable friendships an enterprise that early engaged his attention was a complete edition of the british poets but the deliberations on the subject came to nothing except in so far as they helped towards the preparation of campbells specimens of the british poets which appeared in writing scott regarding his project of a complete edition of the poets his friend george ellis said much as i wish for a corpus poetarum edited as you would edit it i should like still better another minstrel lay by the last and best minstrel and the general demand for the poem seems to prove that the public are of my opinion the work of editing however he seemed at the time determined on having and he finally abandoned the idea of an exhaustive issue of the british poetry previous to his own time and settled down to edit dryden this was a work much needed and scott did it extremely well as may be seen by comparing his own issue of drydens life and works in with the recent reproduction of it admirably edited by mr george saintsbury he had likewise as he mentions in the general preface to the novels begun waverley about and other literary engagements received their share of attention he wrote articles for the edinburgh review besides doing such minor if useful literary service as editing for constable original memoirs written during the great civil wars and so on at the same time there were prospects of professional advancement an account of which he gives in the following terms in the introduction to marmion an important circumstance had about the same time taken place in my life hopes had been held out to me from an influential quarter of a nature to relieve me from the anxiety which i must have otherwise felt as one upon the precarious tenure of whose own life rested the principal prospects of his family and especially as one who had necessarily some dependence upon the favour of the public which is proverbially capricious though it is but justice to add that in my own case i have not found it so mr pitt had expressed a wish to my personal friend the right hon william dundas now lord clerk register of scotland that some fitting opportunity should be taken to be of service to me and as my views and wishes pointed to a future rather than an immediate provision an opportunity of accomplishing this was soon found one of the principal clerks of session as they are called official persons who occupy an important and responsible situation and enjoy a considerable income who had served upwards of thirty years felt himself from age and the infirmity of deafness with which it was accompanied desirous of retiring from his official situation as the law then stood such official persons were entitled to bargain with their successors either for a sum of money which was usually a considerable one or for an interest in the emoluments of the office during their life my predecessor whose services had been unusually meritorious stipulated for the emoluments of his office during his life while i should enjoy the survivorship on the condition that i discharged the duties of the office in the meantime mr pitt however having died in the interval his administration was dissolved and was succeeded by that known by the name of the fox and grenville ministry my affair was so far completed that my commission lay in the office subscribed by his majesty but from hurry or mistake the interest of my predecessor was not expressed in it as had been usual in such cases although therefore it only required payment of the fees i could not in honour take out the commission in the present state since in the event of my dying before him the gentleman whom i succeeded must have lost the vested interest which he had stipulated to retain i had the honour of an interview with earl spencer on the subject and he in the most handsome manner gave directions that the commission should issue as originally intended adding that the matter having received the royal assent he regarded only as a claim of justice what he would have willingly done as an act of favour i never saw mr fox on this or on any other occasion and never made any application to him conceiving that in doing so i might have been supposed to express political opinions contrary to those which i had always professed in his private capacity there is no man to whom i would have been more proud to owe an obligation had i been so distinguished by this arrangement i obtained the survivorship of an office the emoluments of which were fully adequate to my wishes and as the law respecting the mode of providing for superannuated officers was about five or six years after altered from that which admitted the arrangement of assistant and successor my colleague very handsomely took the opportunity of the alteration to accept of the retiring annuity provided in such cases and admitted me to the full benefit of the office at ashestiel scott systematically planned his day he had his mornings for his multifarious work and the after part of the day was given to necessary recreation and to his friends he was an ardent member of the edinburgh light horse at a time when volunteers of a practical and energetic character seemed likely to be needed and at ashestiel he combined a certain military routine with his legal and literary arrangements james skene of rubislaw one of his best friends and most frequent visitors mentions that before beginning his deskwork in the morning he uniformly visited his favourite steed and neither captain nor lieutenant nor the lieutenants successor brown adam so called after one of the heroes of the minstrelsy liked to be fed except by him skene is the friend to whom scott addresses the introduction to canto iv charged with touching and beautiful reminiscences of earlier days they were comrades in the edinburgh light horse volunteers scott being quartermaster and skene cornet their friendship had been one of eleven years standing when the dedicatory epistle was written eleven years we now may tell since we have known each other well since riding side by side our hand first drew the voluntary brand with regard to the introductions it may now be said that they are better where they are than if the poet had published them separately as at one time he seems to have intended see notes p it is sometimes said by those anxious to learn the story that these introductory epistles should be steadily ignored and the cantos read in strict succession in answer to an assertion of opinion like this it is hardly necessary to say more than that probably those interested in the narrative alone could not do better than avoid the introductions but it will be well for them to miss various other things besides will they for example care for the impassioned address of constance to her judges for the landlords tale of grammarye for sir david lyndsays narrative or even for the many descriptive passages that interrupt the free progress of the tale their reading would appear to be done on the plan of those who get through novels or other works of imagination by carefully omitting the dialogue and all those passages in which the author pauses to describe or to reflect it is needless to say that this is not the spirit in which to approach marmion as it stands scott wrote with his friends about him and it was part of his own enjoyment of his work to interest them in what for the time was receiving the main part of his attention his talk with mr morritt in front of the little cottage at lasswade is highly significant as illustrative of his attitude towards his friends his healthy humorous happy nature wanted sympathy appreciation sociality and good cheer for its complete normal development and this alone would explain the writing of the introductions but there is more than this he talked over his subject and his progress with friends competent to discuss and advise and he showed them portions of the poem as he advanced there are indications in the introductions of certain discussions that had arisen over his conception and treatment and surely few readers would like to miss from the volume the clever and humorous apology for his own method which the poet advances in the introduction to the third canto william erskine refined critic and lifelong friend is asked to be patient and generous while the poet proceeds in his own way still kind as is thy wont attend and in the minstrel spare the friend though wild as cloud as stream as gale flow forth flow unrestraind my tale further the introductions do not in any case interrupt the progress of the poem scott was dealing with a great national theme a cause he and his friends could understand and appreciate and both before starting and at every pause he has something to say that is apposite and suggestive his countrys wintry state is the keynote of the first introduction which is an appropriate prelude to a great national tragedy weird border legends and the touching and mysterious silences of lone st marys lake fitly introduce the mysterious man of woe the third and the fourth introductions with their features of personal interest and their bright reminiscences of tales that charmed and scenes on the fieldday or the drill are easily connected with the hostel and the camp spensers wandering squire of dames the vigorous description of the queen of the north and the tribute to the notes that marie translated blondel sung all tell in their due place as preparatory to the canto on the court while the ominous record emanating from a yuletide retreat could not be more fitly interrupted than by a battle of national disaster scott then may have thought of publishing the introductions separately but it is well that he ultimately allowed his better judgment to prevail it is not necessary to dwell on their special descriptive features which readily assert themselves and give scott a high and honoured place among naturepoets his quick and minute observation his sense of colour and harmonious effects and his skill of arrangement are admirable throughout ii composition of marmion in scott accompanied an uncle into northumberland and made his first acquaintance with the scene of flodden writing to his friend william clerk lockharts life ii he says never was an affair more completely bungled than that days work was suppose one army posted upon the face of a hill and secured by high grounds projecting on each flank with the river till in front a deep and still river winding through a very extensive valley called milfield plain and the only passage over it by a narrow bridge which the scots artillery from the hill could in a moment have demolished add that the english must have hazarded a battle while their troops which were tumultuously levied remained together and that the scots behind whom the country was open to scotland had nothing to do but to wait for the attack as they were posted yet did twothirds of the army actuated by the perfervidum ingenium scotorum rush down and give an opportunity to stanley to occupy the ground they had quitted by coming over the shoulder of the hill while the other third under lord home kept their ground and having seen their king and about of their countrymen cut to pieces retired into scotland without loss fifteen years after this was written scott began the composition of marmion and it is interesting to note that so early in life as the date of this letter indicates he was so keenly alive to the great blunder in military tactics made by james iv and his advisers and so manifestly stirred to eloquent expression of his feeling in november scott began marmion designed as a romance of feudalism to succeed the border study in the lay of the last minstrel the circumstances of the time no doubt to some extent prompted the choice of subject napoleon was diligently working out his ambitious scheme of a western empire and plotting the ruin of great britain as an indispensable feature of the arrangement scott was not always intimately acquainted with the details of current politics but when a subject fairly roused his interest he was not slow to take part in its discussion this is notably illustrated in this very year by the outspoken and energetic political ballad he produced over the acquittal of lord melville from a serious charge this ballad which went very straight to the heart of its subject and left no doubt as to the party feeling of the writer not only arrested general attention but gave considerable offence to the leaders on the side so sharply handled it is given with an explanation of the circumstances that called it forth in lockharts life ii ed while however party politics was not always a subject that interested scott patriotism was a constituent element of his character he had a keen sense of national dignity and honour as the extract from his flodden letter alone sufficiently testifies and had circumstances demanded it of him he would almost certainly have distinguished himself as a trooper on the field of battle thus it was not only his love of a picturesque theme that inspired him with his tale of flodden field but likewise his patriotic ardour and his desire to touch the national heart marmion is epical in character and movement and it is at the same time a brilliant and suggestive delineation of a national effort illustrating keen sense of honour resolute purpose and pathetic manly devotion james iv was probably wrong and he was certainly very rash in attempting to do battle with henry viii but although his people were aware of his mistake and his advisers did all in their power to dissuade him he was supported to the last with a heroism that recalls thermopylae this was a display of national character that appealed directly and powerfully to scott prompting him to the production of his loftiest and most energetic verse mournful associations will ever cluster around the tragic battle of flodden that most dolent day as lyndsay aptly calls it but all the same the record remains of what heroic men had it in them to do for king and country where groom fought like noble squire like knight as fearlessly and well scott intended to work slowly and carefully through his new poem but as he explains in the introduction circumstances interrupted his design particular passages he says of a poem which was finally called marmion were laboured with a good deal of care by one by whom much care was seldom bestowed the publication however was hastened by the misfortunes of a near relation and friend lockhart life ii explains that the reference is to his brother thomass final withdrawal from the profession of writer to the signet which arrangement seems to have been quite necessary towards the end of at any rate the poem was finished in a shorter time than had been at first intended the subject suited scott so exactly that even in default of a special stimulus there need be no surprise at the rapidity of his composition after he had fairly begun to move forward with it dryden it may be remembered was so held and fascinated by his alexanders feast that he wrote it off in a night cowper had a similar experience with john gilpin and burnss powerful dramatic tale tam oshanter was produced with great ease and rapidity de quincey records that in his own case his very best work was frequently done when he was writing against time scotts energy and fluency of composition are clearly indicated in the following passage in lockharts life ii when the theme was of a more stirring order he enjoyed pursuing it over brake and fell at the full speed of his lieutenant i well remember his saying as i rode with him across the hills from ashestiel to newark one day in his declining years oh man i had many a grand gallop among these braes when i was thinking of marmion but a trotting canny pony must serve me now his friend mr skene however informs me that many of the more energetic descriptions and particularly that of the battle of flodden were struck out while he was in quarters again with his cavalry in the autumn of in the intervals of drilling he says scott used to delight in walking his powerful black steed up and down by himself upon the portobello sands within the beating of the surge and now and then you would see him plunge in his spurs and go off as if at the charge with the spray dashing about him as we rode back to musselburgh he often came and placed himself beside me to repeat the verses that he had been composing during these pauses of our exercise this is wholly in keeping with the production of such poetry of movement as that of marmion and it deserves its due place in estimating the work of scott just as wordsworths staid and sober walks around his garden or among the hills by which he was surrounded are carefully considered in connexion with his deliberate meditative verse scott wrote the introduction to canto iv just a year after he had begun the poem and between that time and the middle of february the work was finished there is no rashness in saying that rapidity of production did not detract from excellence of result indeed it is admiration rather than criticism that is challenged by the reflection that in these short months the poet should have turned out so much verse of high and enduring quality iii characteristics of the poem marmion is avowedly a descriptive poem it is a series of skilful and impressive pictures not only remarkable in themselves but conspicuous in their own kind in poetical literature scott is said to have been deficient or at any rate imperfectly trained in certain sense activities but there is no denying his quick perception of colour and his strong sense of the leading points in a landscape even minute features are seized and utilized with ease and precision while the larger elements of a scene are depicted with breadth sense of proportion and clearness and impressiveness of arrangement this holds true whether the description is merely a vivid presentment of what the imagination of the poet calls from the remote past or a delineation of what has actually come under his notice norham at twilight with the solitary warder on the battlements and crichtoun castle as scott himself saw it instantly commend themselves by their realistic vigour and their consistent verisimilitude any visitor to norham will still be able to imagine the stir and the imposing spectacle described in the opening stanzas of the first canto and it is a pleasure to follow scotts minute and faithful picture of crichtoun by examining the imposing ruin as it stands at the present day then it is impossible not to feel that the edinburgh of the sixteenth century was exactly as it is depicted in the poem and that the troops on the borough moor were disposed as seen by the trained military eye of sir walter scott it would be difficult to find anywhere a more striking ancient stronghold than tantallon nor would it be easy to conceive a more appropriate scene for that grim and exciting morning interview in which the venerable douglas found that he had harboured a recreant knight above all there is the great battle scene standing alone in literature for its carefully detailed delineation its persistent minuteness its rapidity of movement its balanced effects its energetic purpose and surpassing everything in modern verse for its vivid homeric realism fifteen years before as we have seen scott had the progress of the battle in his minds eye and at length he produced his description as if he had been present in the character of a skilful and interested spectator there are envious people who decline to admit that scott discovered his scenery and who contend that others knew all about it before and appreciated it in their own way be it so and yet the fact remains that scott likewise saw and appreciated in the way peculiar to him and thereby enabled his numerous readers to share his enjoyment a very interesting and suggestive account of the new popularity given to the flodden district by the publication of marmion will be found in lockharts life iii in the autumn of scott visited rokeby doing the journey on horseback along with his eldest boy and girl on ponies the following is an episode of the way halting at flodden to expound the field of battle to his young folks he found that marmion had as might have been expected benefited the keeper of the publichouse there very largely and the village boniface overflowing with gratitude expressed his anxiety to have a scotts head for his signpost the poet demurred to this proposal and assured mine host that nothing could be more appropriate than the portraiture of a foaming tankard which already surmounted his doorway why the painter man has not made an ill job said the landlord but i would fain have something more connected with the book that has brought me so much good custom he produced a wellthumbed copy and handing it to the author begged he would at least suggest a motto from the tale of flodden field scott opened the book at the deathscene of the hero and his eye was immediately caught by the inscription in black letter drink weary pilgrim drink and pray for the kind soul of sibyl grey c well my friend said he what more would you have you need but strike out one letter in the first of these lines and make your painterman the next time he comes this way print between the jolly tankard and your own name drink weary pilgrim drink and pay scott was delighted to find on his return that this suggestion had been adopted and for aught i know the romantic legend may still be visible the characters in the poem are hardly less vigorous in conception and presentation than the descriptions it may be true as carlyle asserts in his ungenerous essay on scott that he was inferior to shakespeare in delineation of character but even admitting that we shall still have ample room for approval and admiration of his work so far as the purposes of the poem are concerned the various personages are admirably utilized we come to know marmion himself very intimately the interest gradually deepening as the real character of the palmer and his relations to the hero are steadily developed these two take prominent rank with the imaginary characters of literature james iv that champion of the dames and likewise undoubted military leader is faithfully delineated in accordance with historical records and contemporary estimates those desirous of seeing him as he struck the imagination of a poet in his own day should read the eulogy passed upon him by barclay in his ship of fools the passage in which this occurs is an interpolation in the division of the poem entitled of the ruine and decay of the holy faith catholique the other characters are all distinctly suited to the parts they have to perform acting on the licence sanctioned by horatian authority atque ita mentitur sic veris falsa remiscet primo ne medium medio ne discrepet imum scott appropriates sir david lyndsay to his purpose presenting him even as he presents the stately and venerable angus with faithful and striking picturesqueness bishop douglas is exactly suited to his share in the development of events and had room likewise been found for the court poet dunbar author of jamess epithalamium the thrissill and the rois it would have been both a fit and a seemly arrangement had scott remembered that dunbar was a favourite of queen margarets he might have introduced him into an interesting episode the passage devoted to the queen herself is exquisite and graceful its restrained and effective pathos making a singularly direct and significant appeal the other female characters are well conceived and sustained while constance in the trial scene reaches an imposing height of dramatic intensity after the descriptions and the characterisation the remaining important features of the poem are its marked practical irony and its episodes marmion despite his many excellences is throughout and for obvious reasons the victim of a persistent nemesis scott is much interested in his hero one fancies that if it were only possible he would in the end extend his favour to him and grant him absolution but his sense of artistic fitness prevails and he will abate no jot of the painful ordeal to which he feels bound to submit him marmion is a knight with a claim to nothing more than the half of the proverbial qualifications he is sans peur but not sans reproche and it is one expression of the practical irony that constantly lurks to assail him that even his fearlessness quails for a time before the phantom knight on gifford moor the whole attitude of the palmer is ironical and after the bitter parting with angus at tantallon marmion is weighted with the depressing reflection that numerous forces are conspiring against him and with the knowledge that it is his old rival de wilton that has thrown off the palmers disguise and preceded him to the scene of war in his last hour the practical irony of his position bears upon him with a concentration of keen and bitter thrusts clare whom he intended to defraud ministers to his last needs he learns that constance died a bitter death at lindisfarne and just when he recognises his greatest need of strength his life speedily ebbs away there is a certain grandeur of impressive tragical effort in his last struggles as he feels that whatever he may himself have been he suffers in the end from the merciless machinery of a false ecclesiastical system the practical irony follows him even after his death for it is a skilful stroke that leaves his neglected remains on the field of battle and places a nameless stranger in his stately tomb as regards the episodes it may just be said in a word that they are appropriate and instead of retarding the movement of the piece as has sometimes been alleged they serve to give it breadth and massiveness of effect of course there will always be found those who think them too long just as there are those whose narrowness of view constrains them to wish the introductions away if the poets conception of marmion be fully considered it will be seen that the hosts tale is an integral part of his purpose and there is surely no need to defend either sir david lyndsays tale or the weird display at the cross of edinburgh the episode of lady herons singing carries its own defence in itself seeing that the song of lochinvar holds a place of distinction among lyrics expressive of poetical motion after all we must bear in mind that though it pleases scott to speak of his tale as flowing on wild as cloud as stream as gale he was still conscious that he was engaged upon a poem and that a poem is regulated by certain artistic laws if we strive to grasp his meaning we shall not be specially inclined to carp at his method it may at the same time be not unprofitable to look for a moment at some of the notable criticisms of the poem iv criticisms of the poem when marmion was little more than begun scotts publishers offered him a thousand pounds for the copyright and as this soon became known it naturally gave rise to varied comment lord byron thought it sufficient to warrant a gratuitous attack on the author in his english bards and scotch reviewers this is a portion of the passage and thinkst thou scott by vain conceit perchance on public taste to foist thy stale romance though murray with his miller may combine to yield thy muse just halfacrown per line no when the sons of song descend to trade their bays are sear their former laurels fade as a matter of fact there was on scotts part no trade whatever in the case if a publisher chose to secure in advance what he anticipated would be a profitable commodity that was mainly the publishers affair and the poet would have been a simpleton not to close with the offer if he liked it scott admirably disposes of byron as follows in the introduction the publishers of the lay of the last minstrel emboldened by the success of that poem willingly offered a thousand pounds for marmion the transaction being no secret afforded lord byron who was then at general war with all who blacked paper an apology for including me in his satire entitled english bards and scotch reviewers i never could conceive how an arrangement between an author and his publishers if satisfactory to the persons concerned could afford matter of censure to any third party i had taken no unusual or ungenerous means of enhancing the value of my merchandise i had never higgled a moment about the bargain but accepted at once what i considered the handsome offer of my publishers these gentlemen at least were not of opinion that they had been taken advantage of in the transaction which indeed was one of their own framing on the contrary the sale of the poem was so far beyond their expectation as to induce them to supply the authors cellars with what is always an acceptable present to a young scottish housekeeper namely a hogshead of excellent claret a second point on which scott was attacked was the character of marmion it was held that such a knight as he undoubtedly was should have been incapable of forgery scott himself of course knew better than his critics whether or not this was the case but with his usual good nature and generous regard for the opinion of others he admitted that perhaps he had committed an artistic blunder dr leyden in particular for whose judgment he had special respect wrote him from india a furious remonstrance on the subject fortunately he made no attempt to change what he had written his main reason being that corrections however in themselves judicious have a bad effect after publication he might have added that any modification of the heros guilt would have entirely altered the character of the poem and might have ruined it altogether he had never apparently gone into the question thoroughly after his first impressions of the type of knights existing in feudal times for though he states that similar instances were found and might be quoted he is inclined to admit that the attribution of forgery was a gross defect readers interested in the subject will find by reference to pikes history of crime i that scott was perfectly justified in his assumption that a feudal knight was capable of forgery those who understand how intimate his knowledge was of the period with which he was dealing will of course be the readiest to believe him rather than his critics but when he seems doubtful of himself and ready to yield the point it is well that the strength of his original position can thus be supported by the results of recent investigation jeffrey in the edinburgh review not being able to understand and appreciate this new devotion to romance and probably stimulated by his misreading of the reference to fox in the introduction to canto i did his utmost to cast discredit on marmion scott was too large a man to confound the separate spheres of politics and literature whereas it was frequently the case with jeffrey as indeed it was to some extent with literary critics on the other side as well to estimate an authors work in reference to the party in the state to which he was known to belong it was impossible to deny merits to scotts descriptions and the extraordinary energy of the most striking portions of the poem but jeffrey groaned over the inequalities he professed to discover and lamented that the poet should waste his strength on the unprofitable effort to resuscitate an oldfashioned enthusiasm they had been the best of friends previously and scott as we have seen worked for the edinburgh review but it was now patent that the old literary intimacy could not pleasantly continue nor is it surprising that scott should have felt that the edinburgh review had become too autocratic and that he should have given a helping hand towards the establishing of the quarterly review as a political and literary organ necessary to the balance of parties v the text of the poem scott himself revised marmion in and the interleaved copy which he used formed the basis of the text given by lockhart in the uniform edition of the poetical works published in this will remain the standard text it is that which is followed in the present volume in which there will be found only three in reality only two important instances of divergence from lockharts readings the earlier editions have been collated with that of and mr w j rolfes careful and scholarly boston edition has likewise been consulted it has not been considered necessary to follow mr rolfe in several alterations he has made on lockhart but he introduces one emendation which readily commends itself to the readers intelligence and it is adopted in the present volume this is in the punctuation of the opening lines in the first stanza of canto ii lockhart completes a sentence at the end of the fifth line whereas the sense manifestly carries the period on to the eleventh line in the third introd line the reading of the earlier editions is followed in giving from me instead of for me as the meaning is thereby simplified and made more direct in iii xiv the modern versions of lockharts text give proudest princes veil their eyes where lockhart himself agrees with the earlier editions in reading vail the restoration of the latter form needs no defence the elizabethan words in the poem are not infrequent giving it as they do a certain air of archaic dignity and there can be little doubt that vail was scotts word here used in its shakespearian sense of lower or cast down and recalling venus as she vailed her eyelids marmion a tale of flodden field in six cantos alas that scottish maid should sing the combat where her lover fell that scottish bard should wake the string the triumph of our foes to tell leyden to the right honourable henry lord montague c c c this romance is inscribed by the author advertisement it is hardly to be expected that an author whom the public have honoured with some degree of applause should not be again a trespasser on their kindness yet the author of marmion must be supposed to feel some anxiety concerning its success since he is sensible that he hazards by this second intrusion any reputation which his first poem may have procured him the present story turns upon the private adventures of a fictitious character but is called a tale of flodden field because the heros fate is connected with that memorable defeat and the causes which led to it the design of the author was if possible to apprize his readers at the outset of the date of his story and to prepare them for the manners of the age in which it is laid any historical narrative far more an attempt at epic composition exceeded his plan of a romantic tale yet he may be permitted to hope from the popularity of the lay of the last minstrel that an attempt to paint the manners of the feudal times upon a broader scale and in the course of a more interesting story will not be unacceptable to the public the poem opens about the commencement of august and concludes with the defeat of flodden th september

the freemans arm to aid the freemans laws hadst thou but lived though strippd of power a watchman on the lonely tower thy thrilling trump had roused the land when fraud or danger were at hand by thee as by the beaconlight our pilots had kept course aright as some proud column though alone thy strength had proppd the tottering throne now is the stately column broke the beaconlight is quenchd in smoke the trumpets silver sound is still the warder silent on the hill oh think how to his latest day when death just hovering claimd his prey with palinures unalterd mood firm at his dangerous post he stood each call for needful rest repelld with dying hand the rudder held till in his fall with fateful sway the steerage of the realm gave way then while on britains thousand plains one unpolluted church remains whose peaceful bells neer sent around the bloody tocsins maddening sound but still upon the hallowd day convoke the swains to praise and pray while faith and civil peace are dear grace

legendary lay oer poets bosom holds its sway how on the ancient minstrel strain time lays his palsied hand in vain and how our hearts at doughty deeds by warriors wrought in steely weeds still throb for fear and pitys sake as when the champion of the lake enters morganas fated house or in the chapel perilous despising spells and demons force holds converse with the unburied corse or when dame ganores grace to move alas that lawless was their love he sought proud tarquin in his den and freed full sixty knights or when a sinful man and unconfessd he took the sangreals holy quest and

the rays flashd back again the western blaze in lines of dazzling light ii saint georges banner broad and gay now faded as the fading ray less bright and less was flung the evening gale had scarce the power to wave it on the donjon tower so heavily it hung the scouts had parted on their search the castle gates were barrd above the gloomy portal arch timing his footsteps to a march the warder kept his guard low humming as he paced along some ancient border gatheringsong iii a distant trampling sound he hears he looks abroad and soon appears oer horncliffhill a plump of spears beneath a pennon gay a horseman darting from the crowd like lightning from a summer cloud spurs on his mettled courser proud before the dark array beneath the sable palisade that closed the castle barricade his buglehorn he blew the warder hasted from the wall and warnd the captain in the hall for well the blast he knew and joyfully that knight did call to sewer squire and seneschal iv now broach ye a pipe of malvoisie bring pasties of the doe and quickly make the entrance free and bid my heralds ready be and every minstrel sound his glee and all our trumpets blow and from the platform spare ye not to

and let the drawbridge fall v along the bridge lord marmion rode proudly his redroan charger trode his helm hung at the saddlebow well by his visage you might know he was a stalworth knight and keen and had in many a battle been the scar on his brown cheek reveald a token true of bosworth field his eyebrow dark and eye of fire showd spirit proud and prompt to ire yet lines of thought upon his cheek did deep design and counsel speak his forehead by his casque worn bare his thick mustache and curly hair coalblack and grizzled here and there but more through toil than age his squareturnd joints and strength of limb showd him no carpet knight so trim but in close fight a champion grim in camps a leader sage vi well was he armd from head to heel in mail and plate of milan steel but his strong helm of mighty cost was all with burnishd gold embossd amid the plumage of the crest a falcon hoverd on her nest with wings outspread and forward breast een such a falcon on his shield soard sable in an azure field the golden legend bore aright who checks at me to death is dight blue was the chargers broiderd rein blue ribbons deckd his arching mane the knightly housings ample fold was velvet blue and trappd with gold vii behind him rode two gallant squires of noble name and knightly sires they burnd the gilded spurs to claim for well could each a warhorse tame could draw the bow the sword could sway and lightly bear the ring away nor less with courteous precepts stored could dance in hall and carve at board and frame loveditties passing rare and sing them to a lady fair viii

they had marchd a weary way ix tis meet that i should tell you now how fairly armd and orderd how the soldiers of the guard with musket pike and morion to welcome noble marmion stood in the castleyard minstrels and trumpeters were there the gunner held his linstock yare for welcomeshot prepared enterd the train and such a clang as then through all his turrets rang old norham never heard x the guards their morricepikes advanced the trumpets flourishd brave the cannon from the ramparts glanced and thundering welcome gave a blithe salute in martial sort the minstrels well might sound for as lord marmion crossd the court he scatterd angels round welcome to norham marmion stout heart and open hand well dost thou brook thy gallant roan thou flower of english land xi two pursuivants whom tabarts deck with silver scutcheon round their neck stood on the steps of stone by which you reach the donjon gate and there with herald pomp and state they haild lord marmion they haild him lord of fontenaye of lutterward and scrivelbaye of tamworth tower and town and he their courtesy to requite gave them a chain of twelve marks weight all as he lighted down now largesse largesse lord marmion knight of the crest of gold a blazond shield in battle won neer guarded heart so bold xii they marshalld him to the castlehall where the guests stood all aside and loudly nourishd the trumpetcall and the heralds loudly cried room lordings room for lord marmion with the crest and helm of gold full well we know the trophies won in the lists at cottiswold there vainly ralph de wilton strove gainst marmions force to stand to him he lost his ladylove and to the king his land ourselves beheld the listed field a sight both sad and fair we saw lord marmion pierce his shield and saw his saddle bare we saw the victor win the crest he wears with worthy pride and on the gibbettree reversed his foemans scutcheon tied place nobles for the falconknight room room ye gentles gay for him who conquerd in the right marmion of fontenaye xiii then steppd to meet that noble lord sir hugh the heron bold baron of twisell and of ford and captain of the hold he led lord marmion to the deas raised oer the pavement high and placed him in the upper placethey feasted full and high the whiles a northern harper rude chanted a rhyme of deadly feud how the fierce thirwalls and ridleys all stout willimondswick and hardriding dick and hughie of hawdon and will o the wall have set on sir albany featherstonhaugh and taken his life at the deadmansshaw scantly lord marmions ear could brook the harpers barbarous lay yet much he praised the pains he took and well those pains did pay for ladys suit and minstrels strain by knight should neer be heard in vain xiv now good lord marmion heron says of your fair courtesy i pray you bide some little space in this poor tower with me here may you keep your arms from rust may breathe your warhorse well seldom hath passd a week but giust or feat of arms befell the scots can rein a mettled steed and love to couch a spear saint george a stirring life they lead that have such neighbours near then stay with us a little space our northern wars to learn i pray you for your ladys grace lord marmions brow grew stern xv the captain markd his alterd look and gave a squire the sign a mighty wassellbowl he took and crownd it high with wine now pledge me here lord marmion but first i pray thee fair where hast thou left that page of thine that used to serve thy cup of wine whose beauty was so rare when last in raby towers we met the boy i closely eyed and often markd his cheeks were wet with tears he fain would hide his was no rugged horseboys hand to burnish shield or sharpen brand or saddle battlesteed but meeter seemd for lady fair to fan her cheek or curl her hair or through embroidery rich and rare the slender silk to lead his skin was fair his ringlets gold his bosom when he sighd the russet doublets rugged fold could scarce repel its pride say hast thou given that lovely youth to serve in ladys bower or was the gentle page in sooth a gentle paramour xvi lord marmion ill could brook such jest he rolld his kindling eye with pain his rising wrath suppressd yet made a calm reply that boy thou thoughtst so goodly fair he might not brook the northern air more of his fate if thou wouldst learn i left him sick in lindisfarn enough of him but heron say why does thy lovely lady gay disdain to grace the hall today or has that dame so fair and sage gone on some pious pilgrimage he spoke in covert scorn for fame whisperd light tales of herons dame xvii unmarkd at least unreckd the taunt careless the knight replied no bird whose feathers gaily flaunt delights in cage to bide norham is grim and grated close hemmd in by battlement and fosse and many a darksome tower and better loves my lady bright to sit in liberty and light in fair queen margarets bower we hold our greyhound in our hand our falcon on our glove but where shall we find leash or band for dame that loves to rove let the wild falcon soar her swing shell stoop when she has tired her wing xviii nay if with royal jamess bride the lovely lady heron bide behold me here a messenger your tender greetings prompt to bear for to the scottish court addressd i journey at our kings behest and pray you of your grace provide for me and mine a trusty guide i have not ridden in scotland since james backd the cause of that mock prince warbeck that flemish counterfeit who on the gibbet paid the cheat then did i march with surreys power what time we razed old ayton tower xix for suchlike need my lord i trow norham can find you guides enow for here be some have prickd as far on scottish ground as to dunbar have drunk the monks of st bothans ale and driven the beeves of lauderdale harried the wives of greenlaws goods and given them light to set their hoods xx now in good sooth lord marmion cried were i in warlike wise to ride a better guard i would not lack than your stout forayers at my back but as in form of peace i go a friendly messenger to know why through all scotland near and far their king is mustering troops for war the sight of plundering border spears might justify suspicious fears and deadly feud or thirst of spoil break out in some unseemly broil a herald were my fitting guide or friar sworn in peace to bide or pardoner or travelling priest or strolling pilgrim at the least xxi the captain mused a little space and passd his hand across his face fain would i find the guide you want but ill may spare a pursuivant the only men that safe can ride mine errands on the scottish side and though a bishop built this fort few holy brethren here resort even our good chaplain as i ween since our last siege we have not seen the mass he might not sing or say upon one stinted meal aday so safe he sat in durham aisle and prayd for our success the while our norham vicar woe betide is all too well in case to ride the priest of shoreswood he could rein the wildest warhorse in your train but then no spearman in the hall will sooner swear or stab or brawl friar john of tillmouth were the man a blithesome brother at the can a welcome guest in hall and bower he knows each castle town and tower in which the wine and ale is good twixt newcastle and holyrood but that good man as ill befalls hath seldom left our castle walls since on the vigil of st bede in evil hour he crossd the tweed to teach dame alison her creed old bughtrig found him with his wife and john an enemy to strife sans frock and hood fled for his life the jealous churl hath deeply swore that if again he venture oer he shall shrieve penitent no more little he loves such risks i know yet in your guard perchance will go xxii young selby at the fair hallboard carved to his uncle and that lord and reverently took up the word kind uncle woe were we each one if harm should hap to brother john he is a man of mirthful speech can many a game and gambol teach full well at tables can he play and sweep at bowls the stake away none can a lustier carol bawl the needfullest among us all when time hangs heavy in the hall and snow comes thick at christmas tide and we can neither hunt nor ride a foray on the scottish side the vowd revenge of bughtrig rude may end in worse than loss of hood let friar john in safety still in chimneycorner snore his fill roast hissing crabs or flagons swill last night to norham there came one will better guide lord marmion nephew quoth heron by my fay well hast thou spoke say forth thy say xxiii here is a holy palmer come from salem first and last from rome one that hath kissd the blessed tomb and visited each holy shrine in araby and palestine on hills of armenie hath been where noahs ark may yet be seen by that red sea too hath he trod which parted at the prophets rod in sinais wilderness he saw the mount where israel heard the law mid thunderdint and flashing levin and shadows mists and darkness given he shows saint jamess cockleshell of fair montserrat too can tell and of that grot where olives nod where darling of each heart and eye from all the youth of sicily saint rosalie retired to god xxiv to stout saint george of norwich merry saint thomas too of canterbury cuthbert of durham and saint bede for his sins pardon hath he prayd he knows the passes of the north and seeks far shrines beyond the forth little he eats and long will wake and drinks but of the stream or lake this were a guide oer moor and dale but when our john hath quaffd his ale as little as the wind that blows and warms itself against his nose kens he or cares which way he goes xxv gramercy quoth lord marmion full loth were i that friar john that venerable man for me were placed in fear or jeopardy if this same palmer will me lead from hence to holyrood like his good saint ill pay his meed instead of cockleshell or bead with angels fair and good i love such holy ramblers still they know to charm a weary hill with song romance or lay some jovial tale or glee or jest some lying legend at the least they bring to cheer the way xxvi ah noble sir young selby said and finger on his lip he laid this man knows much perchance een more than he could learn by holy lore still to himself hes muttering and shrinks as at some unseen thing last night we listend at his cell strange sounds we heard and sooth to tell he murmurd on till morn howeer no living mortal could be near sometimes i thought i heard it plain as other voices spoke again i cannot tell i like it not friar john hath told us it is wrote no conscience clear and void of wrong can rest awake and pray so long himself still sleeps before his beads have markd ten aves and two creeds xxvii let pass quoth marmion by my fay this man shall guide me on my way although the great archfiend and he had sworn themselves of company so please you gentle youth to call this palmer to the castlehall the summond palmer came in place his sable cowl oerhung his face in his black mantle was he clad with peters keys in cloth of red on his broad shoulders wrought the scallop shell his cap did deck the crucifix around his neck was from loretto brought his sandals were with travel tore staff budget bottle scrip he wore the faded palmbranch in his hand showd pilgrim from the holy land xxviii when as the palmer came in hall nor lord nor knight was there more tall or had a statelier step withal or lookd more high and keen for no saluting did he wait but strode across the hall of state and fronted marmion where he sate as he his peer had been but his gaunt frame was worn with toil his cheek was sunk alas the while and when he struggled at a smile his eye look d haggard wild poor wretch the mother that him bare if she had been in presence there in his wan face and sunburnd hair she had not known her child danger long travel want or woe soon change the form that best we know for deadly fear can time outgo and blanch at once the hair hard toil can roughen form and face and want can quench the eyes bright grace nor does old age a wrinkle trace more deeply than despair happy whom none of these befall but this poor palmer knew them all xxix lord marmion then his boon did ask the palmer took on him the task so he would march with morning tide to scottish court to be his guide but i have solemn vows to pay and may not linger by the way to fair st andrews bound within the oceancave to pray where good saint rule his holy lay from midnight to the dawn of day sung to the billows sound thence to saint fillans blessed well whose spring can frenzied dreams dispel and the crazed brain restore saint mary grant that cave or spring could back to peace my bosom bring or bid it throb no more xxx and now the midnight draught of sleep where wine and spices richly steep in massive bowl of silver deep the page presents on knee lord marmion drank a fair good rest the captain pledged his noble guest the cup went through among the rest who draind it merrily alone the palmer passd it by though selby pressd him courteously this was a sign the feast was oer it hushd the merry wassel roar the minstrels ceased to sound soon in the castle nought was heard but the slow footstep of the guard pacing his sober round xxxi with early dawn lord marmion rose and first the chapel doors unclose then after morning rites were done a hasty mass from friar john and knight and squire had broke their fast on rich substantial repast lord marmions bugles blew to horse then came the stirrupcup in course between the baron and his host no point of courtesy was lost high thanks were by lord marmion paid solemn excuse the captain made till filing from the gate had passd that noble train their lord the last then loudly rung the trumpet call thunderd the cannon from the wall and shook the scottish shore around the castle eddied slow volumes of smoke as white as snow and hid its turrets hoar till they rolid forth upon the air and met the river breezes there which gave again the prospect fair introduction to canto second to the rev john marriott a m ashestiel ettrick forest the scenes are desert now and bare where flourishd once a forest fair when these waste glens with copse were lined and peopled with the hart and hind yon thorn perchance whose prickly spears have fenced him for three hundred years while fell around his green compeers yon lonely thorn would he could tell the changes of his parent dell since he so grey and stubborn now waved in each breeze a sapling bough would he could tell how deep the shade a thousand mingled branches made how broad the shadows of the oak how clung the rowan to the rock and through the foliage showd his head with narrow leaves and berries red what pines on every mountain sprung oer every dell what birches hung in every breeze what aspens shook what alders shaded every brook here in my shade methinks hed say the mighty stag at noontide lay the wolf ive seen a fiercer game the neighbouring dingle bears his name with lurching step around me prowl and stop against the moon to howl the mountainboar on battle set his tusks upon my stem would whet while doe and roe and reddeer good have bounded by through gay greenwood then oft from newarks riven tower sallied a scottish monarchs power a thousand vassals musterd round with horse and hawk and horn and hound and i might see the youth intent guard every pass with crossbow bent and through the brake the rangers stalk and falcners hold the ready hawk and foresters in greenwood trim lead in the leash the gazehounds grim attentive as the bratchets bay from the dark covert drove the prey to slip them as he broke away the startled quarry bounds amain as fast the gallant greyhounds strain whistles the arrow from the bow answers the harquebuss below while all the rocking hills reply to hoofclang hound and hunters cry and bugles ringing lightsomely of such proud huntings many tales yet linger in our lonely dales up pathless ettrick and on yarrow where erst the outlaw drew his arrow but not more blithe that silvan court than we have been at humbler sport though small our pomp and mean our game our mirth dear marriott was the same rememberst thou my greyhounds true oer holt or hill there never flew from slip or leash there never sprang more fleet of foot or sure of fang nor dull between each merry chase passd by the intermitted space for we had fair resource in store in classic and in gothic lore we markd each memorable scene and held poetic talk between nor hill nor brook we paced along but had its legend or its song all silent now for now are still thy bowers untenanted bowhill no longer from thy mountains dun the yeoman hears the wellknown gun and while his honest heart glows warm at thought of his paternal farm round to his mates a brimmer fills and drinks the chieftain of the hills no fairy forms in yarrows bowers trip oer the walks or tend the flowers fair as the elves whom janet saw by moonlight dance on carterhaugh no youthful barons left to grace the forestsheriffs lonely chase and ape in manly step and tone the majesty of oberon and she is gone whose lovely face is but her least and lowest grace though if to sylphid queen twere given to show our earth the charms of heaven she could not glide along the air with form more light or face more fair no more the widows deafend ear grows quick that ladys step to hear at noontide she expects her not nor busies her to trim the cot pensive she turns her humming wheel or pensive cooks her orphans meal yet blesses ere she deals their bread the gentle hand by which theyre fed from yair which hills so closely bind scarce can the tweed his passage find though much he fret and chafe and toil till all his eddying currents boil her long descended lord is gone and left us by the stream alone and much i miss those sportive boys companions of my mountain joys just at the age twixt boy and youth when thought is speech and speech is truth close to my side with what delight they pressd to hear of wallace wight when pointing to his airy mound i calld his ramparts holy ground kindled their brows to hear me speak and i have smiled to feel my cheek despite the difference of our years return again the glow of theirs ah happy boys such feelings pure they will not cannot long endure condemnd to stem the worlds rude tide you may not linger by the side for fate shall thrust you from the shore and passion ply the sail and oar yet cherish the remembrance still of the lone mountain and the rill for trust dear boys the time will come when fiercer transport shall be dumb and you will think right frequently but well i hope without a sigh on the free hours that we have spent together on the brown hills bent when musing on companions gone we doubly feel ourselves alone something my friend we yet may gain there is a pleasure in this pain it soothes the love of lonely rest deep in each gentler heart impressd tis silent amid worldly toils and stifled soon by mental broils but in a bosom thus prepared its still small voice is often heard whispering a mingled sentiment twixt resignation and content oft in my mind such thoughts awake by lone saint marys silent lake thou knowst it well nor fen nor sedge pollute the pure lakes crystal edge abrupt and sheer the mountains sink at once upon the level brink and just a trace of silver sand marks where the water meets the land far in the mirror bright and blue each hills huge outline you may view shaggy with heath but lonely bare nor tree nor bush nor brake is there save where of land yon slender line bears thwart the lake the scatterd pine yet even this nakedness has power and aids the feeling of the hour nor thicket dell nor copse you spy where living thing conceald might lie nor point retiring hides a dell where swain or woodman lone might dwell theres nothing left to fancys guess you see that all is loneliness and silence aids though the steep hills send to the lake a thousand rills in summer tide so soft they weep the sound but lulls the ear asleep your horses hooftread sounds too rude so stilly is the solitude nought living meets the eye or ear but well i ween the dead are near for though in feudal strife a foe hath laid our ladys chapel low yet still beneath the hallowd soil the peasant rests him from his toil and dying bids his bones be laid where erst his simple fathers prayd if age had tamed the passions strife and fate had cut my ties to life here have i thought twere sweet to dwell and rear again the chaplains cell like that same peaceful hermitage where milton longd to spend his age twere sweet to mark the setting day on bourhopes lonely top decay and as it faint and feeble died on the broad lake and mountains side to say thus pleasures fade away youth talents beauty thus decay and leave us dark forlorn and grey then gaze on dryhopes ruind tower and think on yarrows faded flower and when that mountainsound i heard which bids us be for storm prepared the distant rustling of his wings as up his force the tempest brings twere sweet ere yet his terrors rave to sit upon the wizards grave that wizard priests whose bones are thrust from company of holy dust on which no sunbeam ever shines so superstitions creed divines thence view the lake with sullen roar heave her broad billows to the shore and mark the wildswans mount the gale spread wide through mist their snowy sail and ever stoop again to lave their bosoms on the surging wave then when against the driving hail no longer might my plaid avail back to my lonely home retire and light my lamp and trim my fire there ponder oer some mystic lay till the wild tale had all its sway and in the bitterns distant shriek i heard unearthly voices speak and thought the wizard priest was come to claim again his ancient home and bade my busy fancy range to frame him fitting shape and strange till from the task my brow i cleard and smiled to think that i had feard but chief twere sweet to think such life though but escape from fortunes strife something most matchless good and wise a great and grateful sacrifice and deem each hour to musing given a step upon the road to heaven yet him whose heart is ill at ease such peaceful solitudes displease he loves to drown his bosoms jar amid the elemental war and my black palmers choice had been some ruder and more savage scene like that which frowns round dark lochskene there eagles scream from isle to shore down all the rocks the torrents roar oer the black waves incessant driven dark mists infect the summer heaven through the rude barriers of the lake away its hurrying waters break faster and whiter dash and curl till down yon dark abyss they hurl rises the fogsmoke white as snow thunders the viewless stream below diving as if condemnd to lave some demons subterranean cave who prisond by enchanters spell shakes the dark rock with groan and yell and well that palmers form and mien had suited with the stormy scene just on the edge straining his ken to view the bottom of the den where deep deep down and far within toils with the rocks the roaring linn then issuing forth one foamy wave and wheeling round the giants grave white as the snowy chargers tail drives down the pass of moffatdale marriott thy harp on isis strung to many a border theme has rung then list to me and thou shalt know of this mysterious man of woe canto second the convent the breeze which swept away the smoke round norham castle rolld when all the loud artillery spoke with lightningflash and thunderstroke as marmion left the hold it curld not tweed alone that breeze for far upon northumbrian seas it freshly blew and strong where from high whitbys cloisterd pile bound to saint cuthberts holy isle it bore a bark along upon the gale she stoopd her side and bounded oer the swelling tide as she were dancing home the merry seamen laughd to see their gallant ship so lustily furrow the green seafoam much joyd they in their honourd freight for on the deck in chair of state the abbess of saint hilda placed with five fair nuns the galley graced ii twas sweet to see these holy maids like birds escaped to

to view the castle with its battled walls the ancient monasterys halls a solemn huge and darkred pile placed on the margin of the isle x in saxon strength that abbey frownd with massive arches broad and round that rose alternate row and row on ponderous columns short and low built ere the art was known by pointed aisle and shafted stalk the arcades of an alleyd walk to emulate in stone on the deep walls the heathen dane had pourd his impious rage in vain and needful was such strength to these exposed to the tempestuous seas scourged by the winds eternal sway open to rovers fierce as they which could twelve hundred years withstand winds waves and northern pirates hand not but that portions of the pile rebuilded in a later style showd where the spoilers hand had been not but the wasting seabreeze keen had worn the pillars carving quaint and moulderd in his niche the saint and rounded with consuming power the pointed angles of each tower yet still entire the abbey stood like veteran worn but unsubdued xi soon as they neard his turrets strong the maidens raised saint hildas song and with the seawave and the wind their voices sweetly shrill combined and made harmonious close then answering from the sandy shore halfdrownd amid the breakers roar according chorus rose down to the haven of the isle the monks and nuns in order file from cuthberts cloisters grim banner and cross and relics there to meet saint hildas maids they bare and as they caught the sounds on air they echoed back the hymn the islanders in joyous mood rushd emulously through the flood to hale the bark to land conspicuous by her veil and hood signing the cross the abbess stood and blessd them with her hand xii suppose we now the welcome said suppose the convent banquet made all through the holy dome through cloister aisle and gallery wherever vestal maid might pry no risk to meet unhallowd eye the stranger sisters roam till fell the evening damp with dew and the sharp seabreeze coldly blew for there even summer night is chill then having strayd and gazed their fill they closed around the fire and all in turn essayd to paint the rival merits of their saint a theme that neer can tire a holy maid for be it known that their saints honour is their own xiii then whitbys nuns exulting told how to their house three barons bold must menial service do while horns blow out a note of shame and monks cry fye

daughters fail to vie with these in holy tale his bodys restingplace of old how oft their patron changed they told how when the rude dane burnd their pile the monks fled forth from holy isle oer

tales had whitbys fishers told and said they might his shape behold and hear his anvil sound a deadend clang a huge dim form seen but and heard when gathering storm and night were closing round but this as tale of idle fame the nuns of lindisfarne disclaim xvii while round the fire such legends go far different was the scene of woe where in a secret aisle beneath council was held of life and death it was more dark and lone that vault than the worst dungeon cell old colwulf built it for his fault in penitence to dwell when he for cowl and beads laid down the saxon battleaxe and crown this den which chilling every sense of feeling hearing sight was calld the vault of penitence excluding air and light was by the prelate sexhelm made a place of burial for such dead as having died in mortal sin might not be laid the church within twas now a place of punishment whence if so loud a shriek were sent as reachd the upper air the hearers blessd themselves and said the spirits of the sinful dead bemoand their torments there xviii but though in the monastic pile did of this penitential aisle some vague tradition go few only save the abbot knew where the place lay and still more few were those who had from him the clew to that dread vault to go victim and executioner were blindfold when transported there in low dark rounds the arches hung from the rude rock the sidewalls sprung the gravestones rudely sculptured oer half sunk in earth by time half wore were all the pavement of the floor the mildewdrops fell one by one with tinkling plash upon the stone a cresset in an iron

in secrecy were placed the heads of convents three all servants of saint benedict the statutes of whose order strict on iron table lay in long black dress on seats of stone behind were these three judges shown by the pale cressets ray the abbess of saint hildas there sat for a space with visage bare until to hide her bosoms swell and teardrops that for pity fell she closely drew her veil yon shrouded figure as i guess by her proud mien and flowing dress is tynemouths haughty prioress and she with awe looks pale and he that ancient man whose sight has long been quenchd by ages night upon whose wrinkled brow alone nor ruth nor mercys trace is shown whose look is hard and stern saint cuthberts abbot is his style for sanctity calld through the isle the saint of lindisfarne xx before them stood a guilty pair but though an equal fate they share yet one alone deserves our care her sex a pages dress belied the cloak and doublet loosely tied obscured her charms but could not hide her cap down oer her face she drew and on her doublet breast she tried to hide the badge of blue lord marmions falcon crest but at the prioress command a monk undid the silken band that tied her tresses fair

for broken vows and convent fled xxi when thus her face was given to view although so pallid was her hue it did a ghastly contrast bear to those bright ringlets glistering fair her look composed and steady eye bespoke a matchless constancy and there she stood so calm and pale that bur her breathing did not fail and motion slight of eye and head and of her bosom warranted that neither sense nor pulse she lacks you might have thought a form of wax wrought to the very life was there so still she was so pale so fair xxii her comrade was a sordid soul such as does murder for a meed who but of

the luckless wretch might shriek well might her paleness terror speak for there were seen in that dark wall two niches narrow deep and tall who enters at such grisly door shall neer i ween find exit more in each a slender meal was laid of roots of water and of bread by each in benedictine dress two haggard monks stood motionless who holding high a blazing torch showd the grim entrance of the porch reflecting back the smoky beam the darkred walls and arches gleam hewn stones and cement were displayd and building tools in order laid xxiv these executioners were chose as men who were with mankind foes and with despite and envy fired into the cloister had retired or who in desperate doubt of grace strove by deep penance to efface of some foul crime the stain for as the vassals of her

brought there they knew not how and knew not where xxv and now that blind old abbot rose to speak the chapters doom on those the wall was to enclose alive within the tomb but stoppd because that woful maid gathering her powers to speak essayd twice she essayd and twice in vain her accents might no utterance gain nought but imperfect murmurs slip from her convulsed and quivering lip twixt each attempt all was so still you seemd to hear a distant rill twas oceans swells and falls for though this vault of sin and fear was to the sounding surge so near a tempest there you scarce could hear so massive were the walls xxvi at length an effort sent apart the blood that curdled to her heart and light came to her eye and colour dawnd upon her cheek a hectic and a flutterd streak like that left on the cheviot peak by autumns stormy sky and when her silence broke at length still as she spoke she gatherd strength and armd herself to bear it was a fearful sight to see such high resolve and

fitzeustace lay scarce by the pale moonlight were seen the foldings of his mantle green lightly he dreamt as youth will dream of sport by thicket or by stream of hawk or hound of ring or glove or lighter yet of ladys love a cautious tread his slumber broke and close beside him when he woke in moonbeam half and half in gloom stood a tall form with nodding plume but ere his dagger eustace drew his master marmions voice he knew xxviii fitzeustace rise i cannot rest yon churls wild legend haunts my breast and graver thoughts have chafed my mood the air must cool my feverish blood and fain would i ride forth to see the scene of elfin chivalry arise and saddle me my steed and gentle eustace take good heed thou dost not rouse these drowsy slaves i would not that the prating knaves had cause for saying oer their ale that i could credit such a tale then softly down the steps they slid eustace the stable door undid and darkling marmions steed arrayd while whispering thus the baron

slowly rode xxx fitzeustace followd him abroad and markd him pace the village road and listend to his horses tramp till by the lessening sound he judged that of the pictish camp lord marmion sought the round wonder it seemd in the squires eyes that one so wary held and wise of whom twas said he scarce received for gospel what the church believed should stirrd by idle tale ride forth in silence of the night as hoping half to meet a sprite arrayd in plate and mail for little did fitzeustace know that passions in contending flow unfix the strongest mind wearied from doubt to doubt to flee we welcome fond credulity guide confident though blind xxxi little for this fitzeustace cared but patient waited till he heard at distance prickd to utmost speed the foottramp of a flying steed come townward rushing on first dead as if on turf it trode then clattering on the village road in other pace than forth he yode returnd lord marmion down hastily he sprung from selle and in his haste wellnigh he fell to the squires hand the rein he threw and spoke no word as he withdrew but yet the moonlight did betray the falconcrest was soild with clay and plainly might fitzeustace see by stains upon the chargers knee and his left side that on the moor he had not kept his footing sure long musing on these wondrous signs at length to rest the squire reclines broken and short for still between

sagely said where is the life which late we led that motley clown in arden wood whom humorous jacques with envy viewd not even that clown could amplify on this trite text so long as i eleven years we now may tell since we have known each other well since riding side by side our hand first drew the voluntary brand and sure through many a varied scene unkindness never came between away these winged years have flown to join the mass of ages gone and though deep markd like all below with chequerd shades of joy and woe though thou oer realms and seas hast ranged markd cities lost and empires changed while here at home my narrower ken somewhat of manners saw and men though varying wishes hopes and fears feverd the progress of these years vet now days weeks and months but seem the recollection of a dream so still we glide down to the sea of fathomless eternity even now it scarcely seems a day since first i tuned this idle lay a task so often thrown aside when leisure graver cares denied that now novembers dreary gale whose voice inspired my opening tale that same november gale once more whirls the dry leaves on yarrow shore their vexd boughs streaming to the sky once more our naked birches sigh and blackhouse heights and ettrick pen have donnd their wintry shrouds again and mountain dark and flooded mead bid us forsake the banks of tweed earlier than wont along the sky mixd with the rack the snow mists fly the shepherd who in summer sun had something of our envy won as thou with pencil i with pen the features traced of hill and glen he who outstretchd the livelong day at ease among the heathflowers lay viewd the light clouds with vacant look or slumberd oer his tatterd book or idly busied him to guide his angle oer the lessend tide at midnight now the snowy plain finds sterner labour for the swain when red hath set the beamless sun through heavy vapours dark and dun when the tired ploughman dry and warm hears half asleep the rising storm hurling the hail and sleeted rain against the casements tinkling pane the sounds that drive wild deer and fox to shelter in the brake and rocks are warnings which the shepherd ask to dismal and to dangerous task oft he looks forth and hopes in vain the blast may sink in mellowing rain till dark above and white below decided drives the flaky snow and forth the hardy swain must go long with dejected look and whine to leave the hearth his dogs repine whistling and cheering them to aid around his back he wreathes the plaid his flock he gathers and he guides to open downs and mountainsides where fiercest though the tempest blow least deeply lies the drift below the blast that whistles oer the fells stiffens his locks to icicles oft he looks back while streaming far his cottage window seems a star loses its feeble gleam and then turns patient to the blast again and facing to the tempests sweep drives through the gloom his lagging sheep if fails his heart if his limbs fail benumbing death is in the gale his paths his landmarks all unknown close to the hut no more his own close to the aid he sought in vain the morn may find the stiffend swain the widow sees at dawning pale his orphans raise their feeble wail and close beside him in the snow poor yarrow partner of their woe couches upon his masters breast and licks his cheek to break his rest who envies now the shepherds lot his healthy fare his rural cot his summer couch by greenwood tree his rustic kirns loud revelry his native hillnotes tuned on high to marion of the blithesome eye his crook his scrip his oaten reed and all arcadias golden creed changes not so with us my skene of human life the varying scene our youthful summer oft we see dance by on wings of game and glee while the dark storm reserves its rage against the winter of our age as he the ancient chief of troy his manhood spent in peace and joy but grecian fires and loud alarms calld ancient priam forth to arms then happy those since each must drain his share of pleasure share of pain then happy those beloved of heaven to whom the mingled cup is given whose lenient sorrows find relief whose joys are chastend by their grief and such a lot my skene was thine when thou of late wert doomd to twine just when thy bridal hour was by the cypress with the myrtle tie just on thy bride her sire had smiled and blessd the union of his child when love must change its joyous cheer and wipe affections filial tear nor did the actions next his end speak more the father than the friend scarce had lamented forbes paid the tribute to his minstrels shade the tale of friendship scarce was told ere the narrators heart was cold far may we search before we find a heart so manly and so kind but not around his honourd urn shall friends alone and kindred mourn the thousand eyes his care had dried pour at his name a bitter tide and frequent falls the grateful dew for benefits the world neer knew if mortal charity dare claim the almightys attributed name inscribe above his mouldering clay the widows shield the orphans stay nor though it wake thy sorrow deem my verse intrudes on this sad theme for sacred was the pen that wrote thy fathers friend forget thou not and grateful title may i plead for many a kindly word and deed to bring my tribute to his grave tis little but tis all i have to thee perchance this rambling strain recalls our summer walks again when doing nought and to speak true not anxious to find aught to do the wild unbounded hills we ranged while oft our talk its topic changed and desultory as our way ranged unconfined from grave to gay even when it flagged as oft will chance no effort made to break its trance we could right pleasantly pursue our sports in social silence too thou gravely labouring to pourtray the blighted oaks fantastic spray i spelling oer with much delight the legend of that antique knight tirante by name yclepd the white at eithers feet a trusty squire pandour and camp with eyes of fire jealous each others motions viewd and scarce suppressd their ancient feud the laverock whistled from the cloud the stream was lively but not loud from the white thorn the mayflower shed its dewy fragrance round our head not ariel lived more merrily under the blossomd bough than we and blithesome nights too have been ours when winter stript the summers bowers careless we heard what now i hear the wild blast sighing deep and drear when fires were bright and lamps beamd gay and ladies tuned the lovely lay and he was held a laggard soul who shunnd to quaff the sparkling bowl then he whose absence we deplore who breathes the gales of devons shore the longer missd bewaild the more and thou and i and dearloved r and one whose name i may not say for not mimosas tender tree shrinks sooner from the touch than he in merry chorus well combined with laughter drownd the whistling wind mirth was within and care without might gnaw her nails to hear our shout not but amid the buxom scene some grave discourse might intervene of the good horse that bore him best his shoulder hoof and arching crest for like mad toms our chiefest care was horse to ride and weapon wear such nights weve had and though the game of manhood be more sober tame and though the fieldday or the drill seem less important now yet still such may we hope to share again the sprightly thought inspires my strain and mark how like a horseman true lord marmions march i thus renew canto fourth the camp eustace i said did blithely mark the first notes of the merry lark the lark sang shrill the cock he crew and loudly marmions bugles blew and with their light and lively call brought groom and yeoman to the stall whistling they came and free of heart but soon their mood was changed complaint was heard on every part of something disarranged some clamourd loud for armour lost some brawld and wrangled with the host by beckets bones cried one i fear that some false scot has stolen my spear young blount lord marmions second squire found his steed wet with sweat and mire although the rated horseboy sware last night he dressd him sleek and fair while chafed the impatient squire like thunder old hubert shouts in fear and wonder help gentle blount help comrades all bevis lies dying in his stall to marmion who the plight dare tell of the good steed he loves so well gaping for fear and ruth they saw the charger panting on his straw till one who would seem wisest cried what else but evil could betide with that cursed palmer for our guide better we had through mire and bush been lanternled by friar rush ii fitzeustace who the cause but guessd nor wholly understood his comrades clamorous plaints suppressd he knew lord marmions mood him ere he issued forth he sought and found deep plunged in gloomy thought and did his tale display simply as if he knew of nought to cause such disarray lord marmion gave attention cold nor marvelld at the wonders told passd them as accidents of course and bade his clarions sound to horse iii young henry blount meanwhile the cost had reckond with their scottish host and as the charge he cast and paid ill thou deservest thy hire he said dost see thou knave my horses plight fairies have ridden him all the night and left him in a foam i trust that soon a conjuring band with english cross and blazing brand shall drive the devils from this land to their infernal home for in this haunted den i trow all night they trampled to and fro the laughing host lookd on the hire gramercy gentle southern squire and if thou comest among the rest with scottish broadsword to be blest sharp be the brand and sure the blow and short the pang to undergo here stayd their talk for marmion gave now the signal to set on the palmer showing forth the way they journeyd all the morning day iv the greensward way was smooth and good through humbies and through saltouns wood a forestglade which varying still here gave a view of dale and hill there narrower closed till over head a vaulted screen the branches made a pleasant path fitzeustace said such as where errantknights might see adventures of high chivalry might meet some damsel flying fast with hair unbound and looks aghast and smooth and level course were here in her defence to break a spear here too are twilight nooks and dells and oft in such the story tells the damsel kind from danger freed did grateful pay her champions meed he spoke to cheer lord marmions mind perchance to show his lore designd for eustace much had pored upon a huge romantic tome in the hallwindow of his home imprinted at the antique dome of caxton or de worde therefore he spoke but spoke in vain for marmion answerd nought again v now sudden distant trumpets shrill in notes prolongd by wood and hill were heard to echo far each ready archer graspd his bow but by the flourish soon they know they breathed no point of war yet cautious as in foemans land lord marmions order speeds the band some opener ground to gain and scarce a furlong had they rode when thinner trees receding showd a little woodland plain just in that advantageous glade the halting troop a line had made as forth from the opposing shade issued a gallant train vi first came the trumpets at whose clang so late the forest echoes rang on prancing steeds they forward pressd with scarlet mantle azure vest each at his trump a banner wore which scotlands royal scutcheon bore heralds and pursuivants by name bute islay marchmount rothsay came in painted tabards proudly showing gules argent or and azure glowing attendant on a kingatarms whose hand the armorial truncheon held that feudal strife had often quelld when wildest its alarms vii he was a man of middle age in aspect manly grave and sage as on kings errand come but in the glances of his eye a penetrating keen and sly expression found its home the flash of that satiric rage which bursting on the early stage branded the vices of the age and broke the keys of rome on milkwhite palfrey forth he paced his cap of maintenance was graced with the proud heronplume from his steeds shoulder loin and breast silk housings swept the ground with scotlands arms device and crest embroiderd round and round the double tressure might you see first by achaius borne the thistle and the fleurdelis and gallant unicorn so bright the kings armorial coat that scarce the dazzled eye could note in living colours blazond brave the lion which his title gave a train which well beseemd his state but all unarmd around him wait still is thy name in high account and still thy verse has charms sir david lindesay of the mount lord lion kingatarms viii down from his horse did marmion spring soon as he saw the lionking for well the stately baron knew to him such courtesy was due whom royal james himself had crownd and on his temples placed the round of scotlands ancient diadem and wet his brow with hallowd wine and on his finger given to shine the emblematic gem their mutual greetings duly made the lion thus his message said though scotlands king hath deeply swore neer to knit faith with henry more and strictly hath forbid resort from england to his royal court yet for he knows lord marmions name and honours much his warlike fame my liege hath deemd it shame and lack of courtesy to turn him back and by his order i your guide must lodging fit and fair provide till finds king james meet time to see the flower of english chivalry ix though inly chafed at this delay lord marmion bears it as he may the palmer his mysterious guide beholding thus his place supplied sought to take leave in vain strict was the lionkings command that none who rode in marmions band should sever from the train england has here enow of spies in lady herons witching eyes to marchmount thus apart he said but fair pretext to marmion made the right hand path they now decline and trace against the stream the tyne x at length up that wild dale they wind where crichtoun castle crowns the bank for there the lions care assignd a lodging meet for marmions rank that castle rises on the steep of the green vale of tyne and far beneath where slow they creep from pool to eddy dark and deep where alders moist and willows weep you hear her streams repine the towers in different ages rose their various architecture shows the builders various hands a mighty mass that could oppose when deadliest hatred fired its foes the vengeful douglas bands xi crichtoun though now thy miry court but pens the lazy steer and sheep thy turrets rude and totterd keep have been the minstrels loved resort oft have i traced within thy fort of mouldering shields the mystic sense scutcheons of honour or pretence quarterd in old armorial sort remains of rude magnificence nor wholly yet had time defaced thy lordly gallery fair nor yet the stony cord unbraced whose twisted knots with roses laced adorn thy ruind stair still rises unimpaird below the courtyards graceful portico above its cornice row and row of fair hewn facets richly show their pointed diamond form though there but houseless cattle go to shield them from the storm and shuddering still may we explore where oft whilom were captives pent the darkness of thy massy more or from thy grassgrown battlement may trace in undulating line the sluggish mazes of the tyne xii another aspect crichtoun showd as through its portal marmion rode but yet twas melancholy state received him at the outer gate for none were in the castle then but women boys or aged men with eyes scarce dried the sorrowing dame to welcome noble marmion came her son a stripling twelve years old profferd the barons rein to hold for each man that could draw a sword had marchd that morning with their lord earl adam hepburn he who died on flodden by his sovereigns side long may his lady look in vain she neer shall see his gallant train come sweeping back through crichtoundean twas a brave race before the name of hated bothwell staind their fame xiii and here two days did marmion rest with every rite that honour claims attended as the kings own guest such the command of royal james who marshalld then his lands array upon the boroughmoor that lay perchance he would not foemans eye upon his gathering host should pry till full prepared was every band to march against the english land here while they dwelt did lindesays wit oft cheer the barons moodier fit and in his turn he knew to prize lord marmions powerful mind and wise traind in the lore of rome and greece and policies of war and peace xiv it chanced as fell the second night that on the battlements they walkd and by the slowly fading light of varying topics talkd and unaware the heraldbard said marmion might his toil have spared in travelling so far for that a messenger from heaven in vain to james had counsel given against the english war and closer questiond thus he told a tale which chronicles of old in scottish story have enrolld xv sir david lindseys tale of all the palaces so fair built for the royal dwelling in scotland far beyond compare linlithgow is excelling and in its park in jovial june how sweet the merry linnets tune how blithe the blackbirds lay the wild buck bells from ferny brake the coot dives merry on the lake the saddest heart might pleasure take to see all nature gay but june is to our sovereign dear the heaviest month in all the year too well his cause of grief you know june saw his fathers overthrow woe to the traitors who could bring the princely boy against his king still in his conscience burns the sting in offices as strict as lent king jamess june is ever spent xvi when last this ruthful month was come and in linlithgows holy dome the king as wont was praying while for his royal fathers soul the chanters sung the bells did toll the bishop mass was saying for now the year brought round again the day the luckless king was slain in katharines aisle the monarch knelt with sackclothshirt and iron belt and eyes with sorrow streaming around him in their stalls of state the thistles knightcompanions sate their banners oer them beaming i too was there and sooth to tell bedeafend with the jangling knell was watching where the sunbeams fell through the staind casement gleaming but while i markd what next befell it seemd as i were dreaming steppd from the crowd a ghostly wight in azure gown with cincture white his forehead bald his head was bare down hung at length his yellow hair now mock me not when good my lord i pledge to you my knightly word that when i saw his placid grace his simple majesty of face his solemn bearing and his pace so stately gliding on seemd to me neer did limner paint so just an image of the saint who proppd the virgin in her faint the loved apostle john xvii he steppd before the monarchs chair and stood with rustic plainness there and little reverence made nor head nor body bowd nor bent but on the desk his arm he leant and words like these he said in a low voice but never tone so thrilld through vein and nerve and bone my mother sent me from afar sir king to warn thee not to war woe waits on thine array if war thou wilt of woman fair her witching wiles and wanton snare james stuart doubly warnd beware god keep thee as he may the wondering monarch seemd to seek for answer and found none and when he raised his head to speak the monitor was gone the marshal and myself had cast to stop him as he outward passd but lighter than the whirlwinds blast he vanishd from our eyes like sunbeam on the billow cast that glances but and dies xviii while lindesay told his marvel strange the twilight was so pale he markd not marmions colour change while listening to the tale but after a suspended pause the baron spoke of natures laws so strong i held the force that never superhuman cause could eer control their course and three days since had judged your aim was but to make your guest your game but i have seen since past the tweed what much has changed my sceptic creed and made me credit aught he staid and seemd to wish his words unsaid but by that strong emotion pressd which prompts us to unload our breast even when discoverys pain to lindesay did at length unfold the tale his village host had told at gifford to his train nought of the palmer says he there and nought of constance or of clare the thoughts which broke his sleep he seems to mention but as feverish dreams xix in vain said he to rest i spread my burning limbs and couchd my head fantastic thoughts returnd and by their wild dominion led my heart within me burnd so sore was the delirious goad i took my steed and forth i rode and as the moon shone bright and cold soon reachd the camp upon the wold the southern entrance i passd through and halted and my bugle blew methought an answer met my ear yet was the blast so low and drear so hollow and so faintly blown it might be echo of my own xx thus judging for a little space i listend ere i left the place but scarce could trust my eyes nor yet can think they serve me true when sudden in the ring i view in form distinct of shape and hue a mounted champion rise ive fought lordlion many a day in single fight and mixd affray and ever i myself may say have borne me as a knight but when this unexpected foe seemd starting from the gulf below i care not though the truth i show i trembled with affright and as i placed in rest my spear my hand so shook for very fear i scarce could couch it right xxi why need my tongue the issue tell we ran our course my charger fell what could he gainst the shock of hell i rolld upon the plain high oer my head with threatening hand the spectre shook his naked brand yet did the worst remain my dazzled eyes i upward cast not opening hell itself could blast their sight like what i saw full on his face the moonbeam strook a face could never be mistook i knew the stern vindictive look and held my breath for awe i saw the face of one who fled to foreign climes has long been dead i well believe the last for neer from vizor raised did stare a human warrior with a glare so grimly and so ghast thrice oer my head he shook the blade but when to good saint george i prayd the first time eer i askd his aid he plunged it in the sheath and on his courser mounting light he seemd to vanish from my sight the moonbeam droopd and deepest night sunk down upon the heath twere long to tell what cause i have to know his face that met me there calld by his hatred from the grave to cumber upper air dead or alive good cause had he to be my mortal enemy xxii marvelld sir david of the mount then learnd in story gan recount such chance had happd of old when once near norham there did fight a spectre fell of fiendish might in likeness of a scottish knight with brian bulmer bold and traind him nigh to disallow the aid of his baptismal vow and such a phantom too tis said with highland broadsword targe and plaid and fingers red with gore is seen in rothiemurcus glade or where the sable pinetree shade dark tomantoul and auchnaslaid dromouchty or glenmore and yet whateer such legends say of warlike demon ghost or lay on mountain moor or plain spotless in faith in bosom bold true son of chivalry should hold these midnight terrors vain for seldom have such spirits power to harm save in the evil hour when guilt we meditate within or harbour unrepented sin lord marmion turnd him half aside and twice to clear his voice he tried then pressd sir davids hand but nought at length in answer said and here their farther converse staid each ordering that his band should bowne them with the rising day to scotlands camp to take their way such was the kings command xxiii early they took dunedins road and i could trace each step they trode hill brook nor dell nor rock nor stone lies on the path to me unknown much might if boast of storied lore but passing such digression oer suffice it that their route was laid across the furzy hills of braid they passd the glen and scanty rill and climbd the opposing bank until they gaind the top of blackford hill xxiv blackford on whose uncultured breast among the broom and thorn and whin a truantboy i sought the nest or listed as i lay at rest while rose on breezes thin the murmur of the city crowd and from his steeple jangling loud saint giless mingling din now from the summit to the plain waves all the hill with yellow grain and oer the landscape as i look nought do i see unchanged remain save the rude cliffs and chiming brook to me they make a heavy moan of early friendships past and gone xxv but different far the change has been since marmion from the crown of blackford saw that martial scene upon the bent so brown thousand pavilions white as snow spread all the boroughmoor below upland and dale and down a thousand did i say i ween thousands on thousands there were seen

made so lindesay bade the palisade that closed the tented ground their men the warders backward drew and carried pikes as they rode through into its ample bound fast ran the scottish warriors there upon the southern band to stare and envy with their wonder rose to see such wellappointed foes such length of shafts such mighty bows so huge that many simply thought but for a vaunt such weapons wrought and little deemd their force to feel through links of mail and plates of steel when rattling upon flodden vale the clothyard arrows flew like hail ii nor less did marmions skilful view glance every line and squadron through and much he marvelld one small land could marshal forth such various band for menatarms were here heavily sheathed in mail and plate like iron towers for strength and weight on flemish steeds of bone and height with battleaxe and spear young knights and squires a lighter train practised their chargers on the plain by aid of leg of hand and rein each warlike feat to show to pass to wheel the croupe to gain and high curvett that not in vain the sword sway might descend amain on foemans casque below he saw the hardy burghers there march armd on foot with faces bare for vizor they wore none nor waving plume nor crest of knight but burnishd were their corslets bright their brigantines and gorgets light like very silver shone long pikes they had for standing fight twohanded swords they wore and many wielded mace of weight and bucklers bright they bore iii on foot the yeoman too but dressd in his steeljack a swarthy vest with iron quilted well each at his back a slender store his forty days provision bore as feudal statutes tell his arms were halbert axe or spear a crossbow there a hagbut here a daggerknife and brand sober he seemd and sad of cheer as loath to leave his cottage dear and march to foreign strand or musing who would guide his steer to till the fallow land yet deem not in his thoughtful eye did aught of dastard terror lie more dreadful far his ire than theirs who scorning dangers name in eager mood to battle came their valour like light straw on name a fierce but fading fire iv not so the borderer bred to war he knew the battles din afar and joyd to hear it swell his peaceful day was slothful ease nor harp nor pipe his ear could please like the loud slogan yell on active steed with lance and blade the lightarmd pricker plied his trade let nobles fight for fame let vassals follow where they lead burghers to guard their townships bleed but wars the borderers game their gain their glory their delight to sleep the day maraud the night oer mountain moss and moor joyful to fight they took their way scarce caring who might win the day their booty was secure these as lord marmions train passd by lookd on at first with careless eye nor marvelld aught well taught to know the form and force of english bow but when they saw the lord arrayd in splendid arms and rich brocade each borderer to his kinsman said hist ringan seest thou there canst guess which road theyll homeward ride o could we but on border side by eusedale glen or liddells tide beset a prize so fair that fangless lion too their guide might chance to lose his glistering hide brown maudlin of that doublet pied could make a kirtle rare v next marmion marked the celtic race of different language form and face a various race of man just then the chiefs their tribes arrayd and wild and garish semblance made the chequerd trews and belted plaid and varying notes the warpipes brayd to every varying clan wild through their red or sable hair lookd out their eyes with savage stare on marmion as he passd their legs above the knee were bare their frame was sinewy short and spare and hardend to the blast of taller race the chiefs they own were by the eagles plumage known the hunted reddeers undressd hide their hairy buskins well supplied the graceful bonnet deckd their head back from their shoulders hung the plaid a broadsword of unwieldy length a dagger proved for edge and strength a studded targe they wore and quivers bows and shafts but o short was the shaft and weak the bow to that which england bore the islesmen carried at their backs the ancient danish battleaxe they raised a wild and wondering cry as with his guide rode marmion by loud were their clamouring tongues as when the clanging seafowl leave the fen and with their cries discordant mixd grumbled and yelld the pipes betwixt vi thus through the scottish camp they passd and reachd the city gate at last where all around a wakeful guard armd burghers kept their watch and ward well had they cause of jealous fear when lay encampd in field so near the borderer and the mountaineer as through the bustling streets they go all was alive with martial show at every turn with dinning clang the armourers anvil clashd and rang or toild the swarthy smith to wheel the bar that arms the chargers heel or axe or falchion to the side of jarring grindstone was applied page groom and squire with hurrying pace through street and lane and marketplace bore lance or casque or sword while burghers with important face described each newcome lord discussd his lineage told his name his following and his warlike fame the lion led to lodging meet which high oerlookd the crowded street there must the baron rest till past the hour of vesper tide and then to holyrood must ride such was the kings behest meanwhile the lions care assigns a banquet rich and costly wines to marmion and his train and when the appointed hour succeeds the baron dons his peaceful weeds and following lindesay as he leads the palacehalls they gain vil old holyrood rung merrily that night with wassell mirth and glee king james within her princely bower feasted the chiefs of scotlands power summond to spend the parting hour for he had charged that his array should southward march by break of day well loved that splendid monarch aye the banquet and the song by day the tourney and by night the merry dance traced fast and light the maskers quaint the pageant bright the revel loud and long this feast outshone his banquets past it was his blithest and his last the dazzling lamps from gallery gay cast on the court a dancing ray here to the harp did minstrels sing there ladies touched a softer string with longeard cap and motley vest the licensed fool retaild his jest his magic tricks the juggler plied at dice and draughts the gallants vied while some in close recess apart courted the ladies of their heart nor courted them in vain for often in the parting hour victorious love asserts his power oer coldness and disdain and flinty is her heart can view to battle march a lover true can hear perchance his last adieu nor own her share of pain viii through this mixd crowd of glee and game the king to greet lord marmion came while reverent all made room an easy task it was i trow king jamess manly form to know although his courtesy to show he doffd to marmion bending low his broiderd cap and plume for royal was his garb and mien his cloak of crimson velvet piled trimmd with the fur of marten wild his vest of changeful satin sheen the dazzled eye beguiled his gorgeous collar hung adown wrought with the badge of scotlands crown the thistle brave of old renown his trusty blade toledo right descended from a baldric bright white were his buskins on the heel his spurs inlaid of gold and steel his bonnet all of crimson fair was buttond with a ruby rare and marmion deemd he neer had seen a prince of such a noble mien ix the monarchs form was middle size for feat of strength or exercise shaped in proportion fair and hazel was his eagle eye and auburn of the darkest dye his short curld beard and hair light was his footstep in the dance and firm his stirrup in the lists and oh he had that merry glance that seldom ladys heart resists lightly from fair to fair he flew and loved to plead lament and sue suit lightly won and shortlived pain for monarchs seldom sigh in vain i said he joyd in banquet bower but mid his mirth twas often strange how suddenly his cheer would change his look oercast and lower if in a sudden turn he felt the pressure of his iron belt that bound his breast in penance pain in memory of his father slain even so twas strange how evermore soon as the passing pang was oer forward he rushd with double glee into the stream of revelry thus dimseen object of affright startles the courser in his flight and half he halts half springs aside but feels the quickening spur applied and straining on the tightend rein scours doubly swift oer hill and plain x oer jamess heart the courtiers say sir hugh the herons wife held sway to scotlands court she came to be a hostage for her lord who cessfords gallant heart had gored and with the king to make accord had sent his lovely dame nor to that lady free alone did the gay king allegiance own for the fair queen of france sent him a turquois ring and glove and charged him as her knight and love for her to break a lance and strike three strokes with scottish brand and march three miles on southron land and bid the banners of his band in english breezes dance and thus for frances queen he drest his manly limbs in mailed vest and thus admitted english fair his inmost counsels still to share and thus for both he madly plannd the ruin of himself and land and yet the sooth to tell nor englands fair nor frances queen were worth one pearldrop bright and sheen from margarets eyes that fell his own queen margaret who in lithgows bower all lonely sat and wept the weary hour xi the queen sits lone in lithgow pile and weeps the weary day the war against her native soil her monarchs risk in battle broil and in gay holyrood the while dame heron rises with a smile upon the harp to play fair was her rounded arm as oer the strings her fingers flew and as she touchd and tuned them all ever her bosoms rise and fall was plainer given to view for all for heat was laid aside her wimple and her hood untied and first she pitchd her voice to sing then glanced her dark eye on the king and then around the silent ring and laughd and blushd and oft did say her pretty oath by yea and nay she could not would not durst not play at length upon the harp with glee mingled with arch simplicity a soft yet lively air she rung while thus the wily lady sung xii lochinvar lady herons song o young lochinvar is come out of the west through all the wide border his steed was the best and save his good broadsword he weapons had none he rode all unarmd and he rode all alone so faithful in love and so dauntless in war there never was knight like the young lochinvar he staid not for brake and he stoppd not for stone he swam the eske river where ford there was none but ere he alighted at netherby gate the bride had consented the gallant came late for a laggard in love and a dastard in war was to wed the fair ellen of brave lochinvar so boldly he enterd the netherby hall among bridesmen and kinsmen and brothers and all then spoke the brides father his hand on his sword for the poor craven bridegroom said never a word o come ye in peace here or come ye in war or to dance at our bridal young lord lochinvar i long wood your daughter my suit you denied love swells like the solway but ebbs like its tide and now am i come with this lost love of mine to lead but one measure drink one cup of wine there are maidens in scotland more lovely by far that would gladly be bride to the young lochinvar the bride kissd the goblet the knight took it up he quaffd off the wine and he threw down the cup she lookd down to blush and she lookd up to sigh with a smile on her lips and a tear in her eye he took her soft hand ere her mother could bar now tread we a measure said young lochinvar so stately his form and so lovely her face that never a hall such a galliard did grace while her mother did fret and her father did fume and the bridegroom stood dangling his bonnet and plume and the bridemaidens whisperd twere better by far to have matchd our fair cousin with young lochinvar one touch to her hand and one word in her ear when they reachd the halldoor and the charger stood near so light to the croupe the fair lady he swung so light to the saddle before her he sprung she is won we are gone over bank bush and scaur theyll have fleet steeds that follow quoth young lochinvar there was mounting mong graemes of the netherby clan forsters fenwicks and musgraves they rode and they ran there was racing and chasing on cannobie lee but the lost bride of netherby neer did they see so daring in love and so dauntless in war have ye eer heard of gallant like young lochinvar xiii the monarch oer the siren hung and beat the measure as she sung and pressing closer and more near he whisperd praises in her ear in loud applause the courtiers vied and ladies winkd and spoke aside the witching dame to marmion threw a glance where seemd to reign the pride that claims applauses due and of her royal conquest too a real or feignd disdain familiar was the look and told marmion and she were friends of old the king observed their meeting eyes with something like displeased surprise for monarchs ill can rivals brook even in a word or smile or look straight took he forth the parchment broad which marmions high commission showd our borders sackd by many a raid our peaceful liegemen robbd he said on day of truce our warden slain stout barton killd his vessels taen unworthy were we here to reign should these for vengeance cry in vain our full defiance hate and scorn our herald has to henry borne xiv he paused and led where douglas stood and with stern eye the pageant viewd i mean that douglas sixth of yore who coronet of angus bore and when his blood and heart were high did the third james in camp defy and all his minions led to die on lauders dreary flat princes and favourites long grew tame and trembled at the homely name of archibald bellthecat the same who left the dusky vale of hermitage in liddisdale its dungeons and its towers where bothwells turrets brave the air and bothwell bank is blooming fair to fix his princely bowers though now in age he had laid down his armour for the peaceful gown and for a staff his brand yet often would flash forth the fire that could in youth a monarchs ire and minions pride withstand and even that day at council board unapt to soothe his sovereigns mood against the war had angus stood and chafed his royal lord xv his giantform like ruind tower though falln its muscles brawny vaunt hugeboned and tall and grim and gaunt seemd oer the gaudy scene to lower his locks and beard in silver grew his eyebrows kept their sable hue near douglas when the monarch stood his bitter speech he thus pursued lord marmion since these letters say that in the north you needs must stay while slightest hopes of peace remain uncourteous speech it were and stern to say return to lindisfarne until my herald come again then rest you in tantallon hold your host shall be the douglas bold a chief unlike his sires of old he wears their motto on his blade their blazon oer his towers displayd yet loves his sovereign to oppose more than to face his countrys foes and i bethink me by saint stephen but een this morn to me was given a prize the first fruits of the war taen by a galley from dunbar a bevy of the maids of heaven under your guard these holy maids shall safe return to cloister shades and while they at tantallon stay requiem for cochrans soul may say and with the slaughterd favourites name across the monarchs brow there came a cloud of ire remorse and shame xvi in answer nought could angus speak his proud heart swelld wellnigh to break he turnd aside and down his cheek a burning tear there stole his hand the monarch sudden took that sight his kind heart could not brook now by the bruces soul angus my hasty speech forgive for sure as doth his spirit live as he said of the douglas old i well may say of you that never king did subject hold in speech more free in war more bold more tender and more true forgive me douglas once again and while the king his hand did strain the old mans tears fell down like rain to seize the moment marmion tried and whisperd to the king aside oh let such tears unwonted plead for respite short from dubious deed a child will weep a brambles smart a maid to see her sparrow part a stripling for a womans heart but woe awaits a country when she sees the tears of bearded men then oh what omen dark and high when douglas wets his manly eye xvii displeased was james that stranger viewd and tamperd with his changing mood laugh those that can weep those that may thus did the fiery monarch say southward i march by break of day and if within tantallon strong the good lord marmion tarries long perchance our meeting next may fall at tamworth in his castlehall the haughty marmion felt the taunt and answerd grave the royal vaunt much honourd were my humble home if in its halls king james should come but nottingham has archers good and yorkshire men are stem of mood northumbrian prickers wild and rude on derby hills the paths are steep in ouse and tyne the fords are deep and many a banner will be torn and many a knight to earth be borne and many a sheaf of arrows spent ere scotlands king shall cross the trent yet pause brave prince while yet you may the monarch lightly turnd away and to his nobles loud did call lords to the dance a hall a hall himself his cloak and sword flung by and led dame heron gallantly and minstrels at the royal order rung out blue bonnets oer the border xviii leave we these revels now to tell what to saint hildas maids befell whose galley as they saild again to whitby by a scot was taen now at dunedin did they bide till james should of their fate decide and soon by his command were gently summond to prepare to journey under marmions care as escort honourd safe and fair again to english land the abbess told her chaplet oer nor knew which saint she should implore for when she thought of constance sore she feard lord marmions mood and judge what clara must have felt the sword that hung in marmions belt had drunk de wiltons blood unwittingly king james had given as guard to whitbys shades the man most dreaded under heaven by these defenceless maids yet what petition could avail or who would listen to the tale of woman prisoner and nun mid bustle of a war begun they deemd it hopeless to avoid the convoy of their dangerous guide xix their lodging so the king assignd to marmions as their guardian joind and thus it fell that passing nigh the palmer caught the abbess eye who warnd him by a scroll she had a secret to reveal that much concernd the churchs weal and health of sinners soul and with deep charge of secrecy she named a place to meet within an open balcony that hung from dizzy pitch and high above the stately street to which as common to each home at night they might in secret come xx at night in secret there they came the palmer and the holy dame the moon among the clouds rose high and all the city hum was by upon the street where late before did din of war and warriors roar you might have heard a pebble fall a beetle hum a cricket sing an owlet flap his boding wing on giless steeple tall the antique buildings climbing high whose gothic frontlets sought the sky were here wrapt deep in shade there on their brows the moonbeam broke through the faint wreaths of silvery smoke and on the casements playd and other light was none to see save torches gliding far before some chieftain of degree who left the royal revelry to bowne him for the war a solemn scene the abbess chose a solemn hour her secret to disclose xxi o holy palmer she began for sure he must be sainted man whose blessed feet have trod the ground where the redeemers tomb is found for his dear churchs sake my tale attend nor deem of light avail though i must speak of worldly love how vain to those who wed above de wilton and lord marmion wood clara de clare of glosters blood idle it were of whitbys dame to say of that same blood i came and once when jealous rage was high lord marmion said despiteously wilton was traitor in his heart and had made league with martin swart when he came here on simnels part and only cowardice did restrain his rebel aid on stokefields plain and down he threw his glove the thing was tried as wont before the king where frankly did de wilton own that swart in guelders he had known and that between them then there went some scroll of courteous compliment for this he to his castle sent but when his messenger returnd judge how de wiltons fury burnd for in his packet there were laid letters that claimd disloyal aid and proved king henrys cause betrayd his fame thus blighted in the field he strove to clear by spear and shield to clear his fame in vain he strove for wondrous are his ways above perchance some form was unobserved perchance in prayer or faith he swerved else how could guiltless champion quail or how the blessed ordeal fail xxii his squire who now de wilton saw as recreant doomd to suffer law repentant ownd in vain that while he had the scrolls in care a stranger maiden passing fair had drenchd him with a beverage rare his words no faith could gain with clare alone he credence won who rather than wed marmion did to saint hildas shrine repair to give our house her livings fair and die a vestal votress there the impulse from the earth was given but bent her to the paths of heaven a purer heart a lovelier maid neer shelterd her in whitbys shade no not since saxon edelfled only one trace of earthly strain that for her lovers loss she cherishes a sorrow vain and murmurs at the cross and then her heritage it goes along the banks of tame deep fields of grain the reaper mows in meadows rich the heifer lows the falconer and huntsman knows its woodlands for the game shame were it to saint hilda dear and i her humble votress here should do a deadly sin her temple spoild before mine eyes if this false marmion such a prize by my consent should win yet hath our boisterous monarch sworn that clare shall from our house be torn and grievous cause have i to fear such mandate doth lord marmion bear xxiii now prisoner helpless and betrayd to evil power i claim thine aid by every step that thou hast trod to holy shrine and grotto dim by every martyrs tortured limb by angel saint and seraphim and by the church of god for mark when wilton was betrayd and with his squire forged letters laid she was alas that sinful maid by whom the deed was done oh shame and horror to be said she was a perjured nun no clerk in all the land like her traced quaint and varying character perchance you may a marvel deem that marmions paramour for such vile thing she was should scheme her lovers nuptial hour but oer him thus she hoped to gain as privy to his honours stain illimitable power for this she secretly retaind each proof that might the plot reveal instructions with his hand and seal and thus saint hilda deignd through sinners perfidy impure her houses glory to secure and clares immortal weal xxiv twere long and needless here to tell how to my hand these papers fell with me they must not stay saint hilda keep her abbess true who knows what outrage he might do while journeying by the way o blessed saint if eer again i venturous leave thy calm domain to travel or by land or main deep penance may i pay now saintly palmer mark my prayer i give this packet to thy care for thee to stop they will not dare and o with cautious speed to wolseys hand the papers bring that he may show them to the king and for thy wellearnd meed thou holy man at whitbys shrine a weekly mass shall still be thine while priests can sing and read what ailst thou speak for as he took the charge a strong emotion shook his frame and ere reply they heard a faint yet shrilly tone like distant clarion feebly blown that on the breeze did die and loud the abbess

while nought confirmd could ear or eye discern of sound or mien yet darkly did it seem as there heralds and pursuivants prepare with trumpet sound and blazon fair a summons to proclaim but indistinct

hand the palmer still was with the band angus like lindesay did command that none should roam at large but in that palmers altered mien a wondrous change might now be seen freely he spoke of war of marvels wrought by single hand when lifted for a native land and still lookd high as if he plannd some desperate deed afar his courser would he feed and stroke and tucking up his sable frocke would first his mettle bold provoke then soothe or quell his pride old hubert said that never one he saw except lord marmion a steed so fairly ride xxviii some halfhours march behind there came by eustace

to win let him take living land and life but to be marmions wedded wife in me were deadly sin and if it be the kings decree that i must find no sanctuary in that inviolable dome where even a homicide might come and safely rest his head though at its open portals stood thirsting to pour forth blood for blood the kinsmen of the dead yet one asylum is my own against the dreaded hour a low a silent

weeping and wailing loud arose round patient clare the clamorous woes of every simple nun his eyes the gentle eustace dried and scarce rude blount the sight could bide then took the squire her rein

hurrying posts or fleeter fame with every varying day and first they heard king james had won etall and wark and ford and then that norham castle strong was taen at that sore marvelld marmion and douglas hoped his monarchs hand would soon subdue northumberland but whisperd news there came that while his host inactive lay and melted by degrees away king james was dallying off the day with herons wily dame such acts to chronicles i yield go seek them there and see mine is a tale of flodden field and not a history at length they heard the scottish host on that high ridge had made their post which frowns oer millfield plain and that brave surrey many a band had gatherd in the southern land and marchd into northumberland and camp at wooler taen marmion like charger in the stall that hears without the trumpetcall began to chafe and swear a sorry thing to hide my head in castle like a fearful maid when such a field is near needs must i see this battleday death to my fame if such a

come adieu dear heber life and health and store of literary wealth canto sixth the battle while great events were on the gale and each hour brought a varying tale and the demeanour changed and cold of douglas fretted marmion bold and like the impatient steed of war he snuffd the battle from afar and hopes were none that back again herald should come from terouenne where englands king in leaguer lay before decisive battleday whilst these things were the mournful clare did in the dames devotions share for the good countess ceaseless prayd to heaven and saints her sons to aid and with short interval did pass from prayer to book from book to mass and all in high baronial pride a life both dull and dignified yet as lord marmion nothing pressd upon her intervals of rest dejected clara well could bear the formal state the lengthend prayer though dearest to her wounded heart the hours that she might spend apart ii i said tantallons dizzy steep hung oer the margin of the deep many a rude tower and rampart there repelld the insult of the air which when the tempest vexd the sky half breeze half spray came whistling by above the rest a turret square did oer its gothic entrance bear of sculpture rude a stony shield the bloody heart was in the field and in the chief three mullets stood the cognizance of douglas blood the turret held a narrow stair which mounted gave you access where a parapets embattled row did seaward round the castle go sometimes in dizzy steps descending sometimes in narrow circuit bending sometimes in platform broad extending its varying circle did combine bulwark and bartisan and line and bastion tower and vantagecoign above the booming ocean leant the farprojecting battlement the billows burst in ceaseless flow upon the precipice below whereer tantallon faced the land gateworks and walls were strongly mannd no need upon the seagirt side the steepy rock and frantic tide approach of human step denied and thus these lines and ramparts rude were left in deepest solitude iii and for they were so lonely clare would to these battlements repair and muse upon her sorrows there and list the seabirds cry or slow like noontide ghost would glide along the darkgrey bulwarks side and ever on the heaving tide look down with weary eye oft did the cliff and swelling main recall the thoughts of whitbys fane a home she neer might see again for she had laid adown so douglas bade the hood and veil and frontlet of the cloister pale and benedictine gown it were unseemly sight he said a novice out of convent shade now her bright locks with sunny glow again adornd her brow of snow her mantle rich whose borders round a deep and fretted broidery bound in golden foldings sought the ground of holy ornament alone remaind a cross with ruby stone and often did she look on that which in her hand she bore with velvet bound and broiderd oer her breviary book in such a place so lone so grim at dawning pale or twilight dim it fearful would have been to meet a form so richly dressd with book in hand and cross on breast and such a woeful mien fitzeustace loitering with his bow to practise on the gull and crow saw her at distance gliding slow and did by mary swear some lovelorn fay she might have been or in romance some spellbound queen for neer in workday world was seen a form so witching fair iv once walking thus at evening tide it chanced a gliding sail she spied and sighing thought the abbess there perchance does to her home repair her peaceful rule where duty free walks hand in hand with charity where oft devotions tranced glow can such a glimpse of heaven bestow that the enraptured sisters see high vision and deep mystery the very form of hilda fair hovering upon the sunny air and smiling on her votaries prayer o wherefore to my duller eye did still the saint her form deny was it that seard by sinful scorn my heart could neither melt nor burn or lie my warm affections low with him that taught them first to glow yet gentle abbess well i knew to pay thy kindness grateful due and well could brook the mild command that ruled thy simple maiden band how different now condemnd to bide my doom from this dark tyrants pride but marmion has to learn ere long that constant mind and hate of wrong descended to a feeble girl from red de clare stout glosters earl of such a stem a sapling weak he neer shall bend although he break v but see what makes this armour here for in her path there lay targe corslet helm she viewd them near the breastplate pierced ay much i fear weak fence wert thou gainst foemans spear that hath made fatal entrance here as these dark bloodgouts say thus wilton oh not corslets ward not truth as diamond pure and hard could be thy manly bosoms guard on yon disastrous day she raised her eyes in mournful mood wilton himself before her stood it might have seemd his passing ghost for every youthful grace was lost and joy unwonted and surprise gave their strange wildness to his eyes expect not noble dames and lords that i can tell such scene in words what skilful limner eer would choose to paint the rainbows varying hues unless to mortal it were given to dip his brush in dyes of heaven far less can my weak line declare each changing passions shade brightening to rapture from despair sorrow surprise and pity there and joy with her angelic air and hope that paints the future fair their varying hues displayd each oer its rivals ground extending alternate conquering shifting blending till all fatigued the conflict yield and mighty love retains the field shortly i tell what then he said by many a tender word delayd and modest blush and bursting sigh and question kind and fond reply vi de wiltons history forget we that disastrous day when senseless in the lists i lay thence draggd but how i cannot know for sense and recollection fled i found me on a pallet low within my ancient beadsmans shed austin rememberst thou my clare how thou didst blush when the old man when first our infant love began said we would make a matchless pair menials and friends and kinsmen fled from the degraded traitors bed he only held my burning head and tended me for many a day while wounds and fever held their sway but far more needful was his care when sense returnd to wake despair for i did tear the closing wound and dash me frantic on the ground if eer i heard the name of clare at length to calmer reason brought much by his kind attendance wrought with him i left my native strand and in a palmers weeds arrayd my hated name and form to shade i journeyd many a land no more a lord of rank and birth but mingled with the dregs of earth oft austin for my reason feard when i would sit and deeply brood on dark revenge and deeds of blood or wild mad schemes upreard my friend at length fell sick and said god would remove him soon and while upon his dying bed he beggd of me a boon if eer my deadliest enemy beneath my brand should conquerd lie even then my mercy should awake and spare his life for austins sake vii still restless as a second cain to scotland next my route was taen full well the paths i knew fame of my fate made various sound that death in pilgrimage i found that i had perishd of my wound none cared which tale was true and living eye could never guess de wilton in his palmers dress for now that sable slough is shed and trimmd my shaggy beard and head i scarcely know me in the glass a chance most wondrous did provide that i should be that barons guide i will not name his name vengeance to god alone belongs but when i think on all my wrongs my blood is liquid flame and neer the time shall i forget when in a scottish hostel set dark looks we did exchange what were his thoughts i cannot tell but in my bosom musterd hell its plans of dark revenge viii a word of vulgar augury that broke from me i scarce knew why brought on a village tale which wrought upon his moody sprite and sent him armed forth by night i borrowd steed and mail and weapons from his sleeping band and passing from a postern door we met and counterd hand to hand he fell on giffordmoor for the deathstroke my brand i drew o then my helmed head he knew the palmers cowl was gone then had three inches of my blade the heavy debt of vengeance paid my hand the thought of austin staid i left him there alone o good old man even from the grave thy spirit could thy master save if i had slain my foeman neer had whitbys abbess in her fear given to my hand this packet dear of power to clear my injured fame and vindicate de wiltons name perchance you heard the abbess tell of the strange pageantry of hell that broke our secret speech it rose from the infernal shade or featly was some juggle playd a tale of peace to teach appeal to heaven i judged was best when my name came among the rest ix now here within tantallon hold to douglas late my tale i told to whom my house was known of old won by my proofs his falchion bright this eve anew shall dub me knight these were the arms that once did turn the tide of fight on otterburne and harry hotspur forced to yield when the dead douglas won the field these angus gave his armourers care ere morn shall every breach repair for nought he said was in his halls but ancient armour on the walls and aged chargers in the stalls and women priests and greyhaird men the rest were all in twisel glen and now i watch my armour here by law of arms till midnights near then once again a belted knight seek surreys camp with dawn of light x there soon again we meet my clare this baron means to guide thee there douglas reveres his kings command else would he take thee from his band and there thy kinsman surrey too will give de wilton justice due now meeter far for martial broil firmer my limbs and strung by toil once more o wilton must we then risk newfound happiness again trust fate of arms once more and is there not an humble glen where we content and poor might build a cottage in the shade a shepherd thou and i to aid thy task on dale and moor that reddening brow too well i know not even thy clare can peace bestow while falsehood stains thy name go then to fight clare bids thee go clare can a warriors feelings know and weep a warriors shame can red earl gilberts spirit feel buckle the spurs upon thy heel and belt thee with thy brand of steel and send thee forth to fame xi that night upon the rocks and bay the midnight moonbeam slumbering lay and pourd its silver light and pure through loophole and through embrazure upon tantallon tower and hall but chief where arched windows wide illuminate the chapels pride the sober glances fall much was there need though seamd with scars two veterans of the douglas wars though two grey priests were there and each a blazing torch held high you could not by their blaze descry the chapels carving fair amid that dim and smoky light chequering the silvery moonshine bright a bishop by the altar stood a noble lord of douglas blood with mitre sheen and rocquet white yet showd his meek and thoughtful eye but little pride of prelacy more pleased that in a barbarous age he gave rude scotland virgils page than that beneath his rule he held the bishopric of fair dunkeld beside him ancient angus stood doffd his furrd gown and sable hood oer his huge form and visage pale he wore a cap and shirt of mail and leand his large and wrinkled hand upon the huge and sweeping brand which wont of yore in battle fray his foemans limbs to shred away as woodknife lops the sapling spray he seemd as from the tombs around rising at judgmentday some giant douglas may be found in all his old array so pale his face so huge his limb so old his arms his look so grim xii then at the altar wilton kneels and clare the spurs bound on his heels and think what next he must have felt at buckling of the falchion belt and judge how clara changed her hue while fastening to her lovers side a friend which though in danger tried he once had found untrue then douglas struck him with his blade saint michael and saint andrew aid i dub thee knight arise sir ralph de wiltons heir for king for church for lady fair see that thou fight and bishop gawain as he rose said wilton grieve not for thy woes disgrace and trouble for he who honour best bestows may give thee double de wilton sobbd for sob he must whereer i meet a douglas trust that douglas is my brother nay nay old angus said not so to surreys camp thou now must go thy wrongs no longer smother i have two sons in yonder field and if thou meetst them under shield upon them bravely do thy worst and foul fall him that blenches first xiii not far advanced was morning day when marmion did his troop array to surreys camp to ride he had safeconduct for his band beneath the royal seal and hand and douglas gave a guide the ancient earl with stately grace would clara on her palfrey place and whisperd in an under tone let the hawk stoop his prey is flown the train from out the castle drew but marmion stoppd to bid adieu though something i might plain he said of cold respect to stranger guest sent hither by your kings behest while in tantallons towers i staid part we in friendship from your land and noble earl receive my hand but douglas round him drew his cloak folded his arms and thus he spoke my manors halls and bowers shall still be open at my sovereigns will to each one whom he lists howeer unmeet to be the owners peer my castles are my kings alone from turret to foundationstone the hand of douglas is his own and never shall in friendly grasp the hand of such as marmion clasp xiv burnd marmions swarthy cheek like fire and shook his very frame for ire and this to me he said an twere not for thy hoary beard such hand as marmions had not spared to cleave the douglas head and first i tell thee haughty peer he who does englands message here although the meanest in her state may well proud angus be thy mate and douglas more i tell thee here even in thy pitch of pride here in thy hold thy vassals near nay never look upon your lord and lay your hands upon your sword i tell thee thourt defied and if thou saidst i am not peer to any lord in scotland here lowland or highland far or near lord angus thou hast lied on the earls cheek the flush of rage oercame the ashen hue of age fierce he broke forth and darest thou then to beard the lion in his den the douglas in his hall and hopest thou hence unscathed to go no by saint bride of bothwell no up drawbridge grooms what warder ho let the portcullis fall lord marmion turnd well was his need and dashd the rowels in his steed like arrow through the archway sprung the ponderous grate behind him rung to pass there was such scanty room the bars descending razed his plume xv the steed along the drawbridge flies just as it trembled on the rise nor lighter does the swallow skim along the smooth lakes level brim and when lord marmion reachd his band he halts and turns with clenched hand and shout of loud defiance pours and shook his gauntlet at the towers horse horse the douglas cried and chase but soon he reind his furys pace a royal messenger he came though most unworthy of the name a letter forged saint jude to speed did ever knight so foul a deed at first in heart it liked me ill when the king praised his clerkly skill thanks to saint bothan son of mine save gawain neer could pen a line so swore i and i swear it still let my boybishop fret his fill saint mary mend my fiery mood old age neer cools the douglas blood i thought to slay him where he stood tis pity of him too he cried bold can he speak and fairly ride i warrant him a warrior tried with this his mandate he recalls and slowly seeks his castle halls xvi the day in marmions journey wore yet eer his passions gust was oer they crossd the heights of stanrigmoor his troop more closely there he scannd and missd the palmer from the band palmer or not young blount did say he parted at the peep of day good sooth it was in strange array in what array said marmion quick my lord i ill can spell the trick but all night long with clink and bang close to my couch did hammers clang at dawn the falling drawbridge rang and from a loophole while i peep old bellthecat came from the keep wrappd in a gown of sables fair as fearful of the morning air beneath when that was blown aside a rusty shirt of mail i spied by archibald won in bloody work against the saracen and turk last night it hung not in the hall i thought some marvel would befall and next i saw them saddled lead old cheviot forth the earls best steed a matchless horse though something old prompt to his paces cool and bold i heard the sheriff sholto say the earl did much the master pray to use him on the battleday but he preferrd nay henry cease thou sworn horsecourser hold thy peace eustace thou bearst a brain i pray what did blount see at break of day xvii in brief my lord we both descried for then i stood by henrys side the palmer mount and outwards ride upon the earls own favourite steed all sheathed he was in armour bright and much resembled that same knight subdued by you in cotswold fight lord angus wishd him speed the instant that fitzeustace spoke a sudden light on marmion broke ah dastard fool to reason lost he mutterd twas nor fay nor ghost i met upon the moonlight wold but living man of earthly mould o dotage blind and gross had i but fought as wont one thrust had laid de wilton in the dust my path no more to cross how stand we now he told his tale to douglas and with some avail twas therefore gloomd his rugged brow will surrey dare to entertain gainst marmion charge disproved and vain small risk of that i trow yet clares sharp questions must i shun must separate constance from the nun o what a tangled web we weave when first we practise to deceive a palmer too no wonder why i felt rebuked beneath his eye i might have known there was but one whose look could quell lord marmion xviii stung with these thoughts he urged to speed his troop and reachd at eve the tweed where lennels convent closed their march there now is left but one frail arch yet mourn thou not its cells our time a fair exchange has made hard by in hospitable shade a reverend pilgrim dwells well worth the whole bernardine brood that eer wore sandal frock or hood yet did saint bernards abbot there give marmion entertainment fair and lodging for his train and clare next morn the baron climbd the tower to view afar the scottish power encampd on flodden edge the white pavilions made a show like remnants of the winter snow along the dusky ridge long marmion lookd at length his eye unusual movement might descry amid the shifting lines the scottish host drawn out appears for flashing on the hedge of spears the eastern sunbeam shines their front now deepening now extending their flank inclining wheeling bending now drawing back and now descending the skilful marmion well could know they watchd the motions of some foe who traversed on the plain below xix even so it was from flodden ridge the scots beheld the english host leave barmorewood their evening post and heedful watchd them as they crossd the till by twisel

tide and stems it gallantly eustace held clare upon her horse old hubert led her rein stoutly they braved the currents course and though far downward driven per force the southern bank they gain behind them straggling came to shore as best they might the train each oer his head his yewbow bore a caution not in vain deep need that day that every string by wet unharmd should sharply ring a moment then lord marmion staid and breathed his steed his men arrayd then forward moved his band until lord surreys rearguard won he halted by a cross of stone that on a hillock standing lone did all the field command xxiii hence might they see the full array of either host for deadly fray their marshalld lines stretchd east and west and fronted north and south and distant salutation passd from the loud cannon mouth not in the close successive rattle that breathes the voice of modern battle but slow and far between the hillock gaind lord marmion staid here by this cross he gently said you

to the vanguard go edmund the admiral tunstall there with thee their charge will blithely share there fight thine own retainers too beneath de burg thy steward true thanks noble surrey marmion said nor farther greeting there he paid but parting like a thunderbolt first in the vanguard made a halt where such a shout there rose of marmion marmion that the cry up flodden mountain shrilling high startled the scottish foes xxv blount and fitzeustace rested still with lady clare upon the hill on which for far the day was spent the western sunbeams now were bent the cry they heard its meaning knew could plain their distant comrades view sadly to blount did eustace say unworthy office here to stay no hope of gilded spurs today but see look up on flodden bent the scottish foe has fired his tent and sudden as he spoke from the sharp ridges of the hill all downward to the banks of till was wreathed in sable smoke volumed and fast and rolling far the cloud enveloped scotlands war as down the hill they broke nor martial shout nor minstrel tone announced their march their tread alone at times one warning trumpet blown at times a stifled hum told england from his mountainthrone king james did rushing come scarce could they hear or see their foes until at weaponpoint they close they close in clouds of smoke and dust with swordsway and with lances thrust and such a yell was there of sudden and portentous birth as if men fought upon the earth and fiends in upper air oh life and death were in the shout recoil and rally charge and rout and triumph and despair long lookd the anxious squires their eye could in the darkness nought descry xxvi at length the freshening western blast aside the shroud of battle cast and first the ridge of mingled spears above the brightening cloud appears and in the smoke the pennons flew as in the storm the white seamew then markd they dashing broad and far the broken billows of the war and plumed crests of chieftains brave floating like foam upon the wave but nought distinct they see wide raged the battle on the plain spears shook and falchions flashd amain fell englands arrowflight like rain crests rose and stoopd and rose again wild and disorderly amid the scene of tumult high they saw lord marmions falcon fly and stainless tunstalls banner white and edmund howards lion bright still bear them bravely in the fight although against them come of gallant gordons many a one and many a stubborn badenochman and many a rugged border clan with huntly and with home xxvii far on the left unseen the while stanley broke lennox and argyle though there the western mountaineer rushd with bare bosom on the spear and flung the feeble targe aside and with both hands the broadsword plied twas vain but fortune on the right with fickle

prayer i gallop to the host and to the fray he rode amain followd by all the archer train the fiery youth with desperate charge made for a space an opening large the rescued banner rose but darkly closed the war around like pinetree rooted from the ground it sank among the foes then eustace mounted too yet staid as loath to leave the helpless maid when fast as shaft can fly bloodshot his eyes his nostrils spread the loose rein dangling from his head housing and saddle bloody red lord marmions steed rushd by and eustace maddening at the sight a look and sign to clara cast to mark he would return in haste then plunged into the fight xxviii ask me not what the maiden feels left in that dreadful hour alone perchance her reason stoops or reels perchance a courage not her own braces her mind to desperate tone the scatterd van of england wheels she only said as loud in air the tumult roard is wilton there they fly or maddend by despair fight but to die is wilton there with that straight up the hill there rode two horsemen drenchd with gore and in their arms a helpless load a wounded knight they bore his hand still straind the broken brand his arms were smeard with blood and

o woman in our hours of ease uncertain coy and hard to please and variable as the shade by the light quivering aspen made when pain and anguish wring the brow a ministering angel thou scarce were the piteous accents said when with the barons casque the maid to the nigh streamlet ran forgot were hatred wrongs and fears the plaintive voice alone she hears sees but the dying man she stoopd her by the runnels side but in abhorrence backward drew for oozing from the mountains side where raged the war a darkred tide was curdling in the streamlet blue where shall she turn behold her mark a little fountain cell where water clear as diamondspark in a stone basin fell above some halfworn letters say drink weary pilgrim drink and pray for the kind soul of sybil grey who built this cross and well she filld the helm and back she hied and with surprise and joy espied a monk supporting marmions head a pious man whom duty brought to dubious verge of battle fought to shrieve the dying bless the dead xxxi deep drank lord marmion of the wave and as she stoopd his brow to lave is it the hand of clare he said or injured constance bathes my head then as remembrance rose speak not to me of shrift or prayer i must redress her woes short space few words are mine to spare forgive and listen gentle clare alas she said the while o think of your immortal weal in vain for constance is your zeal she died at holy isle lord marmion started from the ground as light as if he felt no wound though in the action burst the tide in torrents from his wounded side then it was truth he said i knew that the dark presage must be true i would the fiend to whom belongs the vengeance due to all her wrongs would spare me but a day for wasting fire and dying groan and priests slain on the altar stone might bribe him for delay it may not be this dizzy trance curse on yon base marauders lance and doubly cursed my failing brand a sinful heart makes feeble hand then fainting down on earth he sunk supported by the trembling monk xxxii with fruitless labour clara bound and strove to stanch the gushing wound the monk with unavailing cares exhausted all the churchs prayers ever he said that close and near a ladys voice was in his ear and that the priest he could not hear for that she ever sung in the lost battle borne down by the flying where mingles wars rattle with groans of the dying so the notes rung avoid thee fiend with cruel hand shake not the dying sinners sand o look my son upon yon sign of the redeemers grace divine o think on faith and bliss by many a deathbed i have been and many a sinners parting seen but never aught like this the war that for a space did fail now trebly thundering swelld the gale and stanley was the cry a light on marmions visage spread and fired his glazing eye with dying hand above his head he shook the fragment of his blade and shouted victory charge chester charge on stanley on were the last words of marmion xxxiii by this though deep the evening fell still rose the battles deadly swell for still the scots around their king unbroken fought in desperate ring wheres now their victor vaward wing where huntly and where home o for a blast of that dread horn on fontarabian echoes borne that to king charles did come when rowland brave and olivier and every paladin and peer on roncesvalles died such blasts might warn them not in vain to quit the plunder of the slain and turn the doubtful day again while yet on flodden side afar the royal standard flies and round it toils and bleeds and dies our caledonian pride in vain the wish for far away while spoil and havoc mark their way near sybils cross the plunderers stray o lady cried the monk away and placed her on her steed and led her to the chapel fair of tilmouth upon tweed there all the night they spent in prayer and at the dawn of morning there she met her kinsman lord fitzclare xxxiv but as they left the darkning heath more desperate grew the strife of death the english shafts in volleys haild in headlong charge their horse assaild front flank and rear the squadrons sweep to break the scottish circle deep that fought around their king but yet though thick the shafts as snow though charging knights like whirlwinds go though billmen ply the ghastly blow unbroken was the ring the stubborn spearmen still made good their dark impenetrable wood each stepping where his comrade stood the instant that he fell no thought was there of dastard flight linkd in the serried phalanx tight groom fought like noble squire like knight as fearlessly and well till utter darkness closed her wing oer their thin host and wounded king then skilful surreys sage commands led back from strife his shatterd bands and from the charge they drew as mountainwaves from wasted lands sweep back to ocean blue then did their loss his foemen know their king their lords their mightiest low they melted from the field as snow when streams are swoln and south winds blow dissolves in silent dew tweeds echoes heard the ceaseless plash while many a broken band disorderd through her currents dash to gain the scottish land to town and tower to down and dale to tell red floddens dismal tale and raise the universal wail tradition legend tune and song shall many an age that wail prolong still from the sire the son shall hear of the stern strife and carnage drear of floddens fatal field where shiverd was

that corpse mistrustfully defaced and mangled though it be nor to yon border castle high look northward with upbraiding eye nor cherish hope in vain that journeying far on foreign strand the royal pilgrim to his land may yet return again he saw the wreck his rashness wrought reckless of life he desperate fought and fell on flodden plain and well in death his trusty brand firm clenchd within his manly hand beseemd the monarch slain but o how changed since yon blithe night gladly i turn me from the sight unto my tale again xxxvi short is my tale fitzeustace care a pierced and mangled body bare

brook the fair cathedral stormd and took but thanks to heaven and good saint chad a guerdon meet the spoiler had there erst was martial marmion found his feet upon a couchant hound his hands to heaven upraised and all around on scutcheon rich and tablet carved and fretted niche his arms and feats were blazed and yet though all was carved so fair and priest for marmion breathed the prayer the last lord marmion lay not there from ettrick woods a peasant swain followd his lord to flodden plain one of those flowers whom plaintive lay in scotland mourns as wede away sore wounded sybils cross he spied and draggd him to its foot and died close by the noble marmions side the spoilers strippd and gashd the slain and thus their corpses were mistaen and thus in the proud barons tomb the lowly woodsman took the room xxxvii less easy task it were to show lord marmions nameless grave and low they dug his grave een where he lay but every mark is gone times wasting hand has done away the simple cross of sybil grey and broke her font of stone but yet from out the little hill oozes the slender springlet still oft halts the stranger there for thence may best his curious eye the memorable field descry and shepherd boys repair to seek the waterflag and rush and rest them by the hazel bush and plait their garlands fair nor dream they sit upon the grave that holds the bones of marmion brave when thou shalt find the little hill with thy heart commune and be still if ever in temptation strong thou leftst the right path for the wrong if every devious step thus trod still led thee farther from the road dread thou to speak presumptuous doom on noble marmions lowly tomb but say he died a gallant knight with sword in hand for englands right xxxviii i do not rhyme to that dull elf who cannot image to himself that all through floddens dismal night wilton was foremost in the fight that when brave surreys steed was slain twas wilton mounted him again twas wiltons brand that deepest hewd amid the spearmens stubborn wood unnamed by hollinshed or hall he was the living soul of all that after fight his faith made plain he won his rank and lands again and charged his old paternal

and slumbers light notes by thomas bayne introduction to canto first with regard to the introductions generally lockhart writes in life of scott ii though the author himself does not allude to and had perhaps forgotten the circumstance when writing the introductory essay of they were announced by an advertisement early in as six epistles from ettrick forest to be published in a separate volume similar to that of the ballads and lyrical pieces and perhaps it might have been better that this first plan had been adhered to but however that may be are there any pages among all he ever wrote that one would be more sorry he should not have written they are among the most delicious portraitures that genius ever painted of itself buoyant virtuous happy genius exulting in its own energies yet possessed and mastered by a clear calm modest mind and happy only in diffusing happiness around it with what gratification those epistles were read by the friends to whom they were addressed it is superfluous to show he had in fact painted them almost as fully as himself and who might not have been proud to find a place in such a gallery the tastes and habits of six of those men in whose intercourse scott found the greatest pleasure when his fame was approaching its meridian splendour are thus preserved for posterity and when i reflect with what avidity we catch at the least hint which seems to afford us a glimpse of the intimate circle of any great poet of former ages i cannot but believe that posterity would have held this record precious even had the individuals been in themselves far less remarkable than a rose an ellis a heber a skene a marriott and an erskine william stewart rose to whom scott addresses the introduction to canto first was a wellknown man of letters in his time he addressed to hallam in a work in two vols entitled letters from the north of italy and escaped a prohibitory order from the emperor of austria by ingeniously changing his title to a treatise upon sour krout c his other original works are apology addressed to the travellers club or anecdotes of monkeys thoughts and recollections by one of the last century and epistle to the

cantos from the french of m le grand court and parliament of beasts translated from the animali parlanti of giambatista casti and orlando furioso translated into english verse the closing lines of this introduction refer to roses amadis and partenopex ashestiel whence the introduction to the first canto is dated is on the tweed about six miles above abbotsford the valley there is narrow says lockhart and the aspect in every direction is that of perfect pastoral repose this was scotts home from to l when he removed to abbotsford lines this notable winter piece is the best modern contribution to that series of poetical descriptions by scottish writers which includes dunbars meditatioun in winter gavin douglass scottish winter scene in the prologue to his virgils aeneid vii hamilton of bangours ode iii and of course thomsons winter in the seasons the details of the piece are given with admirable skill and the local placenames are used with characteristic effect the note of regret over winters ravages common to all early scottish poets is skilfully struck and preserved and thus the contrast designed between the wintry landscape and my countrys wintry state is rendered sharper and more decisive line steepy linn steepy is elizabethan steep precipitous linn gael linne pool as hlinna brook is variously used for pool under a waterfall cascade precipice and ravine the

patriotism stirred and guided by pitt was manifested in the enrolment of over three hundred thousand volunteers prepared to withstand the vaunted army of england in spite of his distinguished position and eminent services pitt died l in debt and his responsibilities were promptly met by a vote of the house of commons lines these picturesque lines with their varied and suggestive metaphors were interpolated on the blank page of the ms the reference in the expression tottering throne in line is to the threatened insanity of george iii lines pitts patriotism was consistent and thorough the anxious troubled expression his face betrayed in his latest appearances in the house of commons wilberforce spoke of as his austerlitz look and there seems little doubt that the burden of his public

note of praise line jeffrey in his criticism of marmion in the edinburgh review found fault with the tribute to fox and cavilled in particular at the expression fox a briton died he argued that scott praised only the action of fox in breaking off the negotiations for peace with napoleon while insinuating that the previous part of his career was unpatriotic only a special pleader could put such an unworthy interpretation on the words lines by the result of the battle of austerlitz december napoleon seemed advancing towards general victory prussia hastily patched up a dishonourable peace on terms inconsistent with very binding pledges and the russian minister at paris compromised his country by yielding to humiliating proposals on the part of france all this changed foxs view of the position and he broke off the negotiations for peace which had been begun in accordance with a policy he had long advocated line there is a probable reference here to nelsons action at the battle of

very naturally passed it on to scott himself the right hon william dundas in a letter to scott mentions a conversation he had had with pitt at his table in and says that pitt both expressed his desire

independence and success like virgil when proceeding to write the aeneid he is doubtful whether his devotion to legendary and pastoral themes is sufficient warrant for attempting heroic verse the reference to the tales of shepherds in the closing lines of the passage recalls the advice given about to his students by prof shairp when lecturing from the poetry chair at oxford to become steeped

and being written in comparatively modern language gives the general reader an excellent idea of what romances of chivalry actually were it has also the merit of being written in pure old english and many of the wild adventures which it contains are told with a simplicity bordering upon the sublime several of these are referred to in the text and i would have illustrated them by more full extracts but as this curious work is about to be republished i confine myself to the tale of the chapel perilous and of the quest of sir launcelot after the sangreal right so sir lanncelot departed and when he came to the chapell perilous he alighted downe and tied his horse to a little gate and as soon as he was within the churchyard he saw on the front of the chapell many faire rich shields turned upside downe and many of the shields sir launcelot had seene knights have before with that he saw stand by him thirtie great knights more by a yard than any man that ever he had seene and all those grinned and gnashed at sir launcelot and when he saw their countenance hee dread them sore and so put his shield afore him and tooke his sword in his hand ready to doe battaile and they were all armed in black harneis ready with their shields and swords drawen and when sir launcelot would have gone through them they scattered on every side of him and gave him the way and therewith he waxed all bold and entered into the chapell and then hee saw no light but a dimme lampe burning and then was he ware of a corps covered with a cloath of silke then sir launcelot stooped downe and cut a piece of that cloath away and then it fared under him as the earth had quaked a little whereof he was afeard and then hee saw a faire sword lye by the dead knight and that he gat in his hand and hied him out of the chappell as soon as he was in the chappellyerd all the knights spoke to him with a grimly voice and said knight sir launcelot lay that sword from thee or else thou shalt die whether i live or die said sir launcelot with no great words get yee it againe therefore fight for it and ye list therewith he passed through them and beyond the chappellyerd there met him a faire damosell and said sir launcelot leave that sword behind thee or thou wilt die for it i will not leave it said sir launcelot for no threats no said she and ye did leave that sword queen guenever should ye never see then

three handy vo vols from the text of this edition is furnished with a very useful introduction and notes lines one day when arthur was holding a high feast with his knights of the round table the sangreal or vessel out of which the last passover was eaten a precious relic which had long remained concealed from human eyes because of the sins of the land suddenly appeared to him and all his chivalry the consequence of this vision was that all the knights took on them a solemn vow to seek the sangreal but alas it could only be revealed to a knight at once accomplished in earthly chivalry and pure and guiltless of evil conversation all sir launcelots noble accomplishments were therefore rendered vain by his guilty intrigue with queen guenever or ganore and in this holy quest he encountered only such disgraceful disasters as that which follows but sir launcelot rode overthwart and endlong in a wild forest and held no path but as wild adventure led him and at the last he came unto a stone crosse which departed two wayes in wast land and by the crosse was a stone that was of marble but it was so dark that sir launcelot might not well know what it was then sir launcelot looked by him and saw an old chappell and there he wend to have found people and so sir launcelot tied his horse to a tree and there he put off his shield and hung it upon a tree and then hee went unto the chappell doore and found it wasted and broken and within he found a faire altar full richly arrayed with cloth of silk and there stood a faire candlestick which beare six great candles and the candlesticke was of silver and when sir launcelot saw this light hee had a great will for to enter into the chappell but he could find no place where hee might enter then was he passing heavie and dismaied then he returned and came again to his horse and tooke off his saddle and his bridle and let him pasture and unlaced his helme and ungirded his sword and laid him downe to sleepe upon his shield before the crosse and so hee fell on sleepe and halfe waking and halfe sleeping hee saw come by him two palfreys both faire and white the which beare a litter therein lying a sicke knight and when he was nigh the crosse he there abode still all this sir launcelot saw and beheld for hee slept not verily and hee heard him say o sweete lord when shall this sorrow leave me and when shall the holy vessell come by me where through i shall be blessed for i have endured thus long for little trespasse and thus a great while complained the knight and allwaies sir launcelot heard it with that sir launcelot saw the candlesticke with the fire tapers come before the crosse but he could see no body that brought it also there came a table of silver and the holy vessel of the sancgreall the which sir launcelot had seen before that time in king petchours house and therewithall the sicke knight set him upright and held up both his hands and said faire sweete lord which is here within the holy vessell take heed to mee that i may bee hole of this great malady and therewith upon his hands and upon his knees he went so nigh that he touched the holy vessell and kissed it and anon he was hole and then he said lord god i thank thee for i am healed of this malady soo when the holy vessell had been there a great while it went into the chappell againe with the candlesticke and the light so that sir launcelot wist not where it became for he was overtaken with sinne that he had no power to arise against the holy vessell wherefore afterward many men said of him shame but he tooke repentance afterward then the sicke knight dressed him upright and kissed the crosse then anon his squire brought him his armes and asked his lord how he did certainly said hee i thanke god right heartily for through the holy vessell i am healed but i have right great mervaile of this sleeping knight which hath had neither grace nor power to awake during the time that this holy vessell hath beene here present i dare it right well say said the squire that this same knight is defouled with some manner of deadly sinne whereof he has never confessed by my faith said the knight whatsoeer he be he is unhappie for as i deeme hee is of the fellowship of the round table the which is entered into the quest of the sancgreall sir said the squire here i have brought you all your armes save your helme and your sword and therefore by mine assent now may ye take this knights helme and his sword and so he did and when he was cleane armed he took sir launcelots horse for he was better than his owne and so they departed from the crosse then anon sir launcelot awaked and set himselfe upright and he thought him what hee had there seene and whether it were dreames or not right so he heard a voice that said sir launcelot more hardy than is the stone and more bitter than is the wood and more naked and bare than is the liefe of the figtree therefore go thou from hence and withdraw thee from this holy place and when sir launcelot heard this he was passing heavy and wist not what to doe and so he departed sore weeping and cursed the time that he was borne for then he deemed never to have had more worship for the words went unto his heart till that he knew wherefore that hee was so called scott line arthur is the hero of the faery queene in his explanatory letter to sir walter raleigh

essay on satire prefixed to the translation of juvenal regarding his projected epic of two subjects says dryden i was doubtful whether i should choose that of king arthur conquering the saxons which being further distant in time gives the greater scope to my invention or that of edward the black prince in subduing spain and restoring it to the lawful prince though a great tyrant pedro the crueli might perhaps have done as well as some of my predecessors or at least chalked out a way for others to amend my errors in a like design but being encouraged only with fair words by king charles ii my little salary ill paid and no prospect of a future subsistence i was then discouraged in the beginning of my attempt and now age has overtaken me and want a more insufferable evil through the change

genius of chivalry is to be resuscitated from the deep slumber under which baneful spells have long effectually held him the appropriateness of this is apparent when the true meaning of chivalry is considered scott opens his essay on chivalry thus the primitive sense of this wellknown word derived from the french chevalier signifies merely cavalry or a body of soldiers serving on horseback and it has been used in that general acceptation by the best of our poets ancient and modern from milton to thomas campbell see par lost i and battle of hohenlinden line to spur forward his horse on an

hexameters each serving to give emphasis and resonance like the ninth of the spenserian stanza to the passage which it closes intensity of expression is given by the triplet which closes the passage ending with line the metrical basis of the movement in the canto is likewise iambic tetrameter but the trimeter or threebeat line is freely introduced and the poet allows himself great scope in his arrangement stanza i line the ruinous castle of norham anciently called ubbanford is situated on the southern bank of the tweed about six miles above berwick and where that river is still the boundary between england and scotland the extent of its ruins as well as its historical importance shows it to have been a place of magnificence as well as strength edward i resided there when he was created umpire of the dispute concerning the scottish succession it was repeatedly taken and retaken during the wars between england and scotland and indeed scarce any happened in which it had not a principal share norham castle is situated on a steep bank which overhangs the river the repeated sieges which the castle had sustained rendered frequent repairs necessary in it was almost rebuilt by hugh pudsey bishop of durham who added a huge keep or donjon notwithstanding which king henry ii in took the castle from the bishop and committed the keeping of it to william de neville after this period it seems to have been chiefly garrisoned by the king and considered as a royal fortress the greys of chillinghame castle were frequently the castellans or captains of the garrison yet as the castle was situated in the patrimony of st cuthbert the property was in the see of durham till the reformation after that period it passed through various hands at the union of the crowns it was in the possession of sir robert carey afterwards earl of monmouth for his own life and that of two of his sons after king jamess accession carey sold norham castle to george home earl of dunbar for l see his

last stand the donjon contained the great hall and principal rooms of state for solemn occasions and also the prison of the fortress from which last circumstance we derive the modern and restricted use of the word dungeon ducange voce dunjo conjectures plausibly that the name is derived from these keeps being usually built upon a hill which in celtic is called dun borlase supposes the word came

milan were famous in the middle ages for their skill in armoury as appears from the following passage in which froissart gives an account of the preparations made by henry earl of hereford afterwards henry iv and thomas duke of norfolk earl marischal for their proposed combat in the lists at coventry these two lords made ample provisions of all things necessary for the combat and the earl of derby sent off messengers to lombardy to have armour from sir galeas duke of milan the duke complied with joy and gave the knight called sir francis who had brought the message the choice of all his armour for the earl of derby when he had selected what he wished for in plated and mail armour the lord of milan out of his abundant love for the earl ordered four of the best armourers in milan to accompany the knight to england that the earl of derby might be more completely armed johnes froissart vol iv p the crest and motto of marmion are borrowed from the following story sir david de lindsay first earl of cranford was among other gentlemen of quality attended during a visit to london in by sir william dalzell who was according to my authority bower not only excelling in wisdom but also of a lively wit chancing to be at the court he there saw sir piers conrtenay an english knight famous for skill in tilting and for the beauty of his person parading the palace arrayed in a new mantle bearing for device an embroidered falcon with this rhyme i bear a falcon fairest of night whoso pinches at her his death is dight in graith prepared armour the scottish knight being a wag appeared next day in a dress exactly similar to that of courtenay but bearing a magpie instead of the falcon with a motto ingeniously contrived to rhyme to the vaunting inscription of sir piers i bear a pie picking at a piece whoso picks at her i shall pick at his nese in faith nose this affront could only be expiated by a just with sharp lances in the course dalzell left his helmet unlaced so that it gave way at the touch of his antagonists lance and he thus avoided the shock of the encounter this happened twice in the third encounter the handsome courtenay lost two of his front teeth as the englishman complained bitterly of dalzells fraud in not fastening his helmet the scottishman agreed to run six courses more each champion staking in the hand of the king two hundred pounds to be forfeited if on entering the lists any unequal advantage should be detected this being agreed to the wily scot demanded that sir piers in addition to the loss of his teeth should consent to the extinction of one of his eyes he himself having lost an eye in the fight of otterburn as courtenay demurred to this equalisation of optical powers dalzell demanded the forfeit which after much

great antiquity the arches are in general strictly saxon and the pillars which support them short strong and massy in some places however there are pointed windows which indicate that the building has been repaired at a period long subsequent to the original foundation the exterior ornaments of the building being of a light sandy stone have been wasted as described in the text lindisfarne is not

died just within the door coming up the three leaders william de bruce lord of uglebarnby ralph de percy lord of smeaton and a freeholder named allatson in their disappointment and wrath set upon the hermit whom they fatally wounded when the abbot afterwards came to the dying hermit and told him his assailants would suffer extreme penalty for their ruthless conduct the hermit asked the gentlemen to be sent for and said he would pardon them on certain conditions the gentlemen being present bade him save their lives then said the hermit you and yours shall hold your lands of the abbot of whitby and his successors in this manner that upon ascensionday you or some of you shall come to the wood of the strayheads which is in eskdaleside the same day at sunrising and there shall the abbots officer blow his horn to the intent that you may know where to find him and he shall deliver unto you william de bruce ten stakes eleven strout stowers and eleven yethers to be cut by you or some of you with a knife of one penny price and you ralph de percy shall take twentyone of each sort to be cut in the same manner and you allatson shall take nine of each sort to be cut as aforesaid and to be taken on your backs and carried to the town of whitby and to be there before nine of the clock the same day before mentioned at the same hour of nine of the clock if it be full sea your labour and service shall cease and if low water each of you shall set your stakes to the brim each stake one yard from the other and so yether them on each side with your yethers and so stake on each side with your strout stowers that they may stand three tides without removing by the force thereof each of you shall do make and execute the said service at that very hour every year except it be fall sea at that hour but when it shall so fall out this service shall cease you shall faithfully do this in remembrance that you did most cruelly slay me and that you may the better call to god for mercy repent unfeignedly of your sins and do good works the officer of eskdaleside shall blow out on you out on you out on you for this heinous crime if you or your successors shall refuse this service so long as it shall not be full sea at the aforesaid hour you or yours shall forfeit your lands to the abbot of whitby or his successors this i entreat and earnestly beg that you may have lives and goods preserved for this service and i request of you to promise by your parts in heaven that it shall be done by you and your successors as is aforesaid requested and i will confirm it by the faith of an honest man then the hermit said my soul longeth for the lord and i do as freely forgive these men my death as christ forgave the thieves on the cross and in the presence of the abbot and the rest he

and were at the abbesss prayer not only beheaded but petrified are still found about the rocks and are termed by protestant fossilists ammonitae the other miracle is thus mentioned by camden it is also ascribed to the power of her sanctity that these wild geese which in the winter fly in great flocks to the lakes and rivers unfrozen in the southern parts to the great amazement of every one fall down suddenly upon the ground when they are in their flight over certain neighbouring fields hereabouts a relation i should not have made if i had not received it from several credible men but those who are less inclined to heed superstition attribute it to some occult quality in the ground and to somewhat of antipathy between it and the geese such as they say is betwixt wolves and scyllaroots for that such hidden tendencies and aversions as we call sympathies and antipathies are implanted in many things by provident nature for the preservation of them is a thing so evident that everybody grants it mr chariton in his history of whitby points out the true origin of the fable from the number of seagulls that when flying from a storm often alight near whitby and from the woodcocks and other birds of passage who do the same upon their arrival on shore after a long flight scott stanza xiv line st cuthbert was in the choice of his sepulchre one of the most mutable and unreasonable saints in the calendar he died a d in a hermitage upon the farne islands having resigned the bishopric of lindisfarne or holy island about two years before his body was brought to lindisfarne where it remained until a descent of the danes about when the monastery was nearly destroyed the monks fled to scotland with what they deemed their chief treasure the relics of st cuthbert the saint was however a most capricious fellowtraveller which was the more intolerable as like sinbads old man of the sea he journeyed upon the shoulders of his companions they paraded him through scotland for several years and came as far west as whithorn in galloway whence they attempted to sail for ireland but were driven back by tempests he at length made a halt at norham from thence he went to melrose where he remained stationary for a short time and then caused himself to be launched upon the tweed in a stone coffin which landed him at tilmouth in northumberland this boat is finely shaped ten feet long three feet and a half in diameter and only four inches thick so that with very little assistance it might certainly have swam it still lies or at least did so a few years ago in two pieces beside the ruined chapel at tilmouth from tilmouth cuthbert wandered into yorkshire and at length made a long stay at chesterlestreet to which the bishops see was transferred at length the danes continuing to infest the country the monks removed to rippon for a season and it was in return from thence to chesterlestreet that passing through a forest called dunholme the saint and his carriage became immovable at a place named wardlaw or wardilaw here the saint chose his place of residence and all who have seen durham must admit that if difficult in his choice he evinced taste in at last fixing it it is said that the northumbrian catholics still keep secret the precise spot of the saints sepulture which is only intrusted to three persons at a time when one dies the survivors associate to them in his room a person judged fit to be the depositary of so valuable a secret scott the restingplace of the remains of this saint is not now matter of uncertainty so recently as th may years after his death their discovery and disinterment were effected under a blue stone in the middle of the shrine of st cuthbert at the eastern extremity of the choir of durham cathedral there was then found a walled grave containing the coffins of the saint the first or outer one was ascertained to be that of the second of the third or inner one answering in every particular to the description of that of was found to contain not indeed as had been averred then and even until the incorruptible body but the entire skeleton of the saint the bottom of the grave being perfectly dry free from offensive smell and without the slightest symptom that a human body had ever undergone decomposition within its walls the skeleton was found swathed in five silk robes of emblematical embroidery the ornamental parts laid with gold leaf and these again covered with a robe of linen beside the skeleton were also deposited several gold and silver insignia and other relics of the saint the roman catholics now allow that the coffin was that of st cuthbert the bones of the saint were again restored to the grave in a new coffin amid the fragments of the former ones those portions of the inner coffin which could be preserved including one of its rings with the silver altar golden cross stole comb two maniples bracelets girdle gold wire of the skeleton and fragments of the five silk robes and seme of the

most laborious curious and interesting publication from which considerable defects of style and manner ought not to turn aside the scottish antiquary cuthbert we have seen had no great reason to spare

victory over his heathen enemies a consolation which as was reasonable alfred after the battle of ashendown rewarded by a royal offering at the shrine of the saint as to william the conqueror the terror spread before his army when he marched to punish the revolt of the northumbrians in had forced the monks to fly once more to holy island with the body of the saint it was however replaced before william left the north and to balance accounts the conqueror having intimated an indiscreet curiosity to view the saints body he was while in the act of commanding the shrine to be opened seized with heat and sickness accompanied with such a panic terror that notwithstanding there was a sumptuous dinner prepared for him he fled without eating a morsel which the monkish historian seems to have thought no small part both of the miracle and the penance and never drew his bridle till he got to the river tees scott stanza xvi line although we do not learn that cuthbert was during his life such an artificer as dunstan his brother in sanctity yet since his death he has acquired the reputation of forging those entrochi which are found among the rocks of holy island and pass there by the name of st cuthberts beads while at this task he is supposed to sit during the night upon a certain rock and use another as his anvil this story was perhaps credited in former days at least the

history he abdicated the throne about and retired to holy island where he died in the odour of sanctity saint as colwulf was however i fear the foundation of the penancevault does not correspond with his character for it is recorded among his memorabilia that finding the air of the island raw and cold he indulged the monks whose rule had hitherto confined them to milk or water with the comfortable privilege of using wine or ale if any rigid antiquary insists on this objection he is welcome to suppose the penancevault was intended by the founder for the more genial purposes of a cellar these penitential vaults were the geisselgewolbe of german convents in the earlier and more rigid times of monastic discipline they were sometimes used as a cemetery for the lay benefactor of the convent whose unsanctified corpses were then seldom permitted to pollute the choir they also served as places of meeting for the chapter when measures of uncommon severity were to be adopted but their most frequent use as implied by the name was as places for performing penances or undergoing punishment scott stanza xviii line antique chandelier scott stanza xix line that there was an ancient priory at tynemouth is certain its ruins are situated on a high rocky point and doubtless many a vow was made to the shrine by the distressed mariners who drove towards the ironbound coast of northumberland in stormy weather it was anciently a nunnery for virca abbess of tynemouth presented st cuthbert yet alive with a rare windingsheet in emulation of a holy lady called tuda who had sent him a coffin but as in the case of whitby and of holy island the introduction of nuns at tynemouth in the reign of henry viii is an anachronism the nunnery of holy island is altogether fictitious indeed st cuthbert was unlikely to permit such an establishment for notwithstanding his accepting the mortuary gifts above mentioned and his carrying on a visiting acquaintance with the abbess of coldingham he certainly

it is well known that the religious who broke their vows of chastity were subjected to the same penalty as the roman vestals in a similar case a small niche sufficient to enclose their bodies was made in the massive wall of the convent a slender pittance of food and water was deposited in it and the awful words vade in pace were the signal for immuring the criminal it is not likely that in latter times this punishment was often resorted to but among the ruins of the abbey of coldingham were some years ago discovered the remains of a female skeleton which from the shape of the niche and

head in his essay on chivalry says in the appeal to this awful criterion the combatants whether personally concerned or appearing as champions were understood in martial law to take on themselves the full risk of all consequences and as the defendant or his champion in case of being overcome was subjected to the punishment proper to the crime of which he was accused so the appellant if vanquished was whether a principal or substitute condemned to the same doom to which his success would have exposed the accused whichever combatant was vanquished he was liable to the penalty of degradation and if he survived the combat the disgrace to which he was subjected was worse than death his spurs were cut off close to his heels with a cooks cleaver his arms were baffled and reversed by the common hangman his belt was cut to pieces and his sword broken even his horse shared his disgrace the animals tail being cut off close by the rump and thrown on a dunghill the deathbell tolled and the funeral service was said for a knight thus degraded as for one dead to knightly honour and if he fell in the appeal to the judgment of god the same dishonour was done to his senseless corpse if alive

scottish inns were not good it was not from want of encouragement from the legislature who so early as the reign of james i not only enacted that in all boroughs and fairs there be hostellaries having stables and chambers and provision for man and horse but by another statute ordained that no man travelling on horse or foot should presume to lodge anywhere except in these hostellaries and that no person save innkeepers should receive such travellers under the penalty of forty shillings for exercising such hospitality but in spite of these provident enactments the scottish hostels are but indifferent and strangers continue to find reception in the houses of individuals scott it is important to supplement this note by saying that the most competent judges still doubt whether dunbar

whence many of the particulars of the combat between alexander iii and the goblin knight are derived gervase of tilbury otia imperial ap script rer brunsvic vol i p relates the following popular story concerning a fairy knight osbert a bold and powerful baron visited a noble family in the vicinity of wandlebury in the bishopric of ely among other stories related in the social circle of his friends who according to custom amused each other by repeating ancient tales and traditions he was informed that if any knight unattended entered an adjacent plain by moonlight and challenged an adversary to appear he would be immediately encountered by a spirit in the form of a knight osbert resolved to make the experiment and set out attended by a single squire whom he ordered to remain without the limits of the plain which was surrounded by an ancient intrenchment on repeating the challenge he was instantly assailed by an adversary whom he quickly unhorsed and seized the reins of his steed daring this operation his ghostly opponent sprung up and darting his spear like a javelin at osbert wounded him in the thigh osbert returned in triumph with the horse which he committed to the care of his servants the horse was of a sable colour as well as his whole accoutrements and apparently of great beauty and vigour he remained with his keeper till cockcrowing when with eyes flashing fire he reared spurned the ground and vanished on disarming himself osbert perceived that he was wounded and that one of his steel boots was full of blood gervase adds that as long as he lived the scar of his wound opened afresh on the anniversary of the eve on which he encountered the spirit less fortunate was the gallant bohemian knight who travelling by night with a single companion came in sight of a fairy host arrayed under displayed banners despising the remonstrances of his friend the knight pricked forward to break a lance with a champion who advanced from the ranks apparently in defiance his

besides these instances of elfin chivalry above quoted many others might be alleged in support of employing fairy machinery in this manner the forest of glenmore in the north highlands is believed to

the ceiling this was followed by the legs the other arm the trunk and the head of the body all separately the members rolled together united themselves in the presence of the astonished soldiers and formed a gigantic warrior who defied them both to combat their blows although they penetrated the body and amputated the limbs of their strange antagonist had as the reader may easily believe little effect on an enemy who possessed such powers of selfunion nor did his efforts make more effectual impression upon them how the combat terminated i do not exactly remember and have not the book by me but i think the spirit made to the intruders on his mansion the usual proposal that they should renounce their redemption which being declined he was obliged to retreat the most singular tale of this

exposure of ecclesiastical abuses in his various satires especially in his complaynts and his dialog powerfully forwarded the movement that culminated in the reformation it would however be a mistake to consider him an avowed protestant reformer he was concerned about the existing wrongs both of church and state and thought of rectifying these without revolutionary measures line the cap of the lion king was of scarlet velvet turned up with ermine lines the double tressure was an ornamental tracing round the shield at a fixed distance from the border as to the fleurdelis flower of the lily emblem of france scott quotes boethius and buchanan as saying that it was first assumed by achaius king of scotland contemporary of charlemagne and founder of the celebrated league with france historical evidence however would seem to show that the lion is first seen on the seal of alexander ii and the tressure on that of alexander iii this is the heraldic description of the arms of scotland or a lion rampant gules armed and langued azure within a double tressure flory counterflory of fleurdelis of the second the supporters are two unicorns argent maned and unguled or gorged with open crowns the crest is a lion sejant affronte gules crowned or c the adoption of the thistle as the national scottish emblem is wrapt in obscurity although an early poet attributes it to a

popular edition in two lyndsay was born about and died about the mount was his estate near cuparfife i am uncertain says scott if i abuse poetic license by introducing sir david lindesay in the character of lionherald sixteen years before he obtained that office at any rate i am not the first who has been guilty of that anachronism for the author of flodden field despatches dallamount which can mean nobody but sir david de la mont to france on the message of defiance from james iv to henry viii it was often an office imposed on the lion kingatarms to receive foreign ambassadors and lindesay himself did this honour to sir ralph sadler in indeed the oath of the lion in its first article bears reference to his frequent employment upon royal messages and embassies the office of heralds in feudal times being held of the utmost importance the inauguration of the kingsat arms who presided over their colleges was proportionally solemn in fact it was the mimicry of a royal coronation except that the unction was made with wine instead of oil in scotland a namesake and kinsman of sir david lindesay inaugurated in was crowned by king james with the ancient crown of scotland which was used before the scottish kings assumed a close crown and on occasion of the same solemnity dined at the kings table wearing the crown it is probable that the coronation of his predecessor was not less solemn so sacred was the heralds office that in lord drummond was by parliament declared guilty of treason and his lands forfeited because he had struck with his fist the lion kingatarms when he reproved him for his follies nor was he restored but at the lions earnest solicitation stanza x line a large ruinous castle on the banks of the tyne about ten miles from edinburgh as indicated in the text it was built at different times and with a very differing regard to splendour and accommodation the oldest part of the building is a narrow keep or tower such as formed the mansion of a lesser scottish baron but so many additions have been made to it that there is now a large courtyard surrounded by buildings of different ages the eastern front of the court is raised above a portico and decorated with entablatures bearing anchors all the stones of this front are cut into diamond facets the angular projections of which have an uncommonly rich appearance the inside of this part of the building appears to have contained a gallery of great length and uncommon elegance access was given to it by a magnificent staircase now quite destroyed the soffits are ornamented with twining cordage and rosettes and the whole seems to have been far more splendid than was usual in scottish castles the castle belonged originally to the chancellor sir william crichton and probably owed to him its first enlargement as well as its being taken by the earl of douglas who imputed to crichtons counsels the death of his predecessor earl william beheaded in edinburgh castle with his brother in it is said to have been totally demolished on that occasion but the present state of the ruin shows the contrary in it was garrisoned by lord crichton then its proprietor against king james iii whose displeasure he had incurred by seducing his sister margaret in revenge it is said for the monarch having dishonoured his bed from the crichton family the castle passed to that of the hepburns earls bothwell and when the forfeitures of stewart the last earl bothwell were divided the barony and cattle of crichton fell to the share of the earl of buccleuch they were afterwards the property of the pringles of clifton and are now that of sir john callander baronet it were to be wished the proprietor would take a little pains to preserve those splendid remains of antiquity which are at present used as a fold for sheep and wintering cattle although perhaps there are very few ruins in scotland which display so well the style and beauty of castlearchitecture scott the ruin is now carefully protected visitors being admitted on application at crichtoun manse adjoining stanza xi line the castle of crichton has a dungeon vault called the massy more the epithet which is not uncommonly applied to the prisons of other old castles in scotland is of saracenic origin it occurs twice in the epistolae itineriae of tollius carcer subterraneus sive ut mauri appellant mazmorra p and again coguntur omnes captivi sub noctem in ergastula subterranea quae turcae algezerani vocant mazmorras p the same word applies to the dungeons of the ancient moorish castles in spain and serves to show from what nation the gothic style of castle building was originally derived scott see further sir w scotts provincial antiquities vol i stanza xii line he was the second earl of bothwell and

bothwell too well known in the history of queen mary scott stanza xiii line the boroughmoor extended from edinburgh south to the braid hills stanza xiv line scott quotes from lindsay of pitscottie the story of the apparition seen at linlithgow by james iv when undergoing his annual penance for having taken the field against his father some of the younger men about the court had devised what they felt might be an impressive warning to the king against going to war and their show of supernatural interference was well managed lindsays narrative proceeds thus the king came to lithgow where he happened to be for the time at the council very sad and dolorous making his devotion to god to send him good chance and fortune in his voyage in this meantime there came a man clad in a blue gown in at the kirk door and belted about him in a roll of linencloth a pair of brotikings on his feet to the great of his legs with all other hose and clothes conform thereto but he had nothing on his head but syde red yellow hair behind and on his haffets which wan down to his shoulders but his forehead was bald and bare he seemed to be a man of twoandfifty years with a great pikestaff in his hand and came first forward among the lords crying and speiring for the king saying he desired to speak with him while at the last he came where the king was sitting in the desk at his prayers but when he saw the king he made him little reverence or salutation but leaned down groffling on the desk before him and said to him in this manner as after follows sir king my mother hath sent me to you desiring you not to pass at this time where thou art purposed for if thou does thou wilt not fare well in thy journey nor none that passeth with thee further she bade thee mell with no woman nor use their counsel nor let them touch thy body nor thou theirs for if thou do it thou wilt be confounded and brought to shame buskins long cheeks asking meddle by this man had spoken thir words unto the kings grace the eveningsong was near done and the king paused on thir words studying to give him an answer but in the meantime before the kings eyes and in the presence of all the lords that were about him for the time this man vanished away and could no ways be seen nor comprehended but vanished away as he had been a blink of the sun or a whip of the whirlwind and could no more be seen i heard say sir david lindesay lyonherauld and john inglis the marshal who were at that time young men and special servants to the kings grace were standing presently beside the king who thought to have laid hands on this man that they might have speired further tidings at him but all for nought they could not touch him for he vanished away betwixt them and was no more seen buchanan in more elegant though not more impressive language tells the same story and quotes the personal information of our sir david lindesay in iis ie qui propius astiterant fuit david lindesius montanus homo spectatae fidei et probitatis nec a literarum studiis alienus et cujus totius vitae tenor longissime a mentiendo aberat a quo nisi ego haec uti tradidi pro certis accepissem ut vulgatam vanis rumoribus fabulam omissurus eram lib xiii the kings throne in st catherines aisle which he had constructed for himself with twelve stalls for the knights companions of the order of the thistle is still shown as the place where the apparition was seen i know not by what means st andrew got the credit of having been the celebrated monitor of james iv for the expression in lindesays narrative my mother has sent me could only be used by st john the adopted son of the virgin mary the whole story is so well attested that we have only the choice between a miracle or an imposture mr pinkerton plausibly argues from the caution against incontinence that the queen was privy to the scheme of those who had recourse to this expedient to deter king james from his impolitic war stanza xv line in scotland there are about twenty palaces castles and remains or sites of such where scotias kings of other years had their royal home linlithgow distinguished by the combined strength and beauty of its situation must have been early selected as a royal residence david who bought the title of saint by his liberality to the church refers several of his charters to his town of linlithgow and in that of holyrood expressly bestows on the new monastery all the skins of the rams ewes and lambs belonging to his castle of linlitcu which shall die during the yearthe convenience afforded for the sport of falconry which was so great a favourite during the feudal ages was probably one cause of the attachment of the ancient scottish monarchs to linlithgow and its fine lake the sport of hunting was also followed with success in the neighbourhood from which circumstance it probably arises that the ancient arms of the city represent a black greyhound bitch tied to a treethe situation of linlithgow palace is eminently beautiful it stands on a promontory of some elevation which advances almost into the midst of the lake the form is that of a square court composed of buildings of four storeys high with towers at the angles the

a forest and in that state was so great a nuisance that the inhabitants of edinburgh had permission granted to them of building wooden galleries projecting over the street in order to encourage them to consume the timber which they seem to have done very effectually when james iv mustered the array of the kingdom there in the boroughmoor was according to hawthornden a field spacious and

kings respect for the fine arts were extremely incensed at the honours conferred on those persons particularly on cochrane a mason who had been created earl of mar and seizing the opportunity when in the king had convoked the whole array of the country to march against the english they held a midnight council in the church of lauder for the purpose of forcibly removing these minions from the kings person when all had agreed on the propriety of this measure lord gray told the assembly the apologue of the mice who had formed a resolution that it would be highly advantageous to their community to

three hundred light axes all clad in white livery and black bends thereon that they might be known for cochran the earl of mars men himself was clad in a ridingpie of black velvet with a great chain of gold about his neck to the value of five hundred crowns and four blowing horns with both the ends of gold and silk set with a precious stone called a berryl hanging in the midst this cochran had his heumont born before him overgilt with gold and so were all the rest of his horns and all his pallions were of fine canvas of silk and the cords thereof fine twined silk and the chains upon his pallions were double overgilt with gold this cochran was so proud in his conceit that he counted no lords to be marrows to him therefore he rushed rudely at the kirkdoor the council inquired who it was that perturbed them at that time sir robert douglas laird of lochleven was keeper of the kirkdoor at that time who inquired who that was that knocked so rudely and cochran answered this is i the earl of mar the which news pleased well the lords because they were ready boun to cause take him as is before rehearsed then the earl of angus past hastily to the door and with him sir robert douglas of lochleven there to receive in the earl of mar and go many of his complices who were there as they thought good and the earl of angus met with the earl of mar as he came in at the door and pulled the golden chain from his craig and said to him a tow would set him better sir robert douglas syne pulled the blowing horn from him in like manner and said he had been the hunter of mischief over long

hare no more credence but shalt have thy reward according to thy good service as thou hast deserved in times bypast right so the rest of thy followers rope jest notwithstanding the lords held them quiet till they caused certain armed men to pass into the kings pallion and two or three wise men to pass with them and give the king fair pleasant words till they laid hands on all the kings servants

notwithstanding all this apparatus james was forced to raise the siege and only afterwards obtained possession of tantallon by treaty with the governor simon panango when the earl of angus returned from banishment upon the death of james he again obtained possession of tantallon and it actually afforded refuge to an english ambassador under circumstances similar to those described in the text

subject of many superstitions legends it is firmly believed by the neighbouring peasantry that the last baron of franchemont deposited in one of the vaults of the castle a ponderous chest containing an immense treasure in gold and silver which by some magic spell was intrusted to the care of the devil who is constantly found sitting on the chest in the shape of a huntsman any one adventurous enough to touch the chest is instantly seized with the palsy upon one occasion a priest of noted piety was brought to the vault he used all the arts of exorcism to persuade his infernal majesty to vacate his seat but in vain the huntsman remained immovable at last moved by the earnestness of the priest he told him that he would agree to resign the chest if the exorciser would sign his name with blood but the priest understood his meaning and refused as by that act he would have delivered over his soul to the devil yet if any body can discover the mystic words used by the person who deposited

the morning of the th september surrey marched in a northwesterly direction and crossed the till with his van and artillery at twisel bridge nigh where that river joins the tweed his rearguard column passing about a mile higher by a ford this movement had the double effect of placing his army between king james and his supplies from scotland and of striking the scottish monarch with surprise as he seems to have relied on the depth of the river in his front but as the passage both over the bridge and through the ford was difficult and slow it seems possible that the english might have been attacked to great advantage while straggling with these natural obstacles i know not if we are to impute jamess forbearance to want of military skill or to the romantic declaration which pitscottie

beg to remind him that when the english army by their skilful countermarch were fairly placed between king james and his own country the scottish monarch resolved to fight and setting fire to his tents descended from the ridge of flodden to secure the neighbouring eminence of brankstone on which that village is built thus the two armies met almost without seeing each other when according to the old poem of flodden field the english line stretchd east and west and southward were their faces set the scottish northward proudly prest and manfully their foes they met the english army advanced in four divisions on the right which first engaged were the sons of earl surrey namely thomas howard the admiral of england and sir edmund the knight marshal of the army their divisions were separated from each other but at the request of sir edmund his brothers battalion was drawn very near to his own the centre was commanded by surrey in person the left wing by sir edward stanley with the men of lancashire and of the palatinate of chester lord dacres with a large body of horse formed a reserve when the smoke which the wind had driven between the armies was somewhat dispersed they perceived the scots who had moved down the hill in a similar order of battle and in deep silence the earls of huntley and of home commanded their left wing and charged sir edmund howard with such success as entirely to defeat his part of the english right wing sir edmunds banner was beaten down and he himself escaped with difficulty to his brothers division the admiral however stood firm and dacre advancing to his support with the reserve of cavalry probably between the interval of the divisions commanded by the brothers howard appears to have kept the victors in effectual check homes men chiefly borderers began to pillage the baggage of both armies and their leader is branded by the scottish historians with negligence or treachery on the other hand huntley on whom they bestow many encomiums is said by the english historians to have left the field after the first charge meanwhile the admiral whose flank these chiefs ought to have attacked availed himself of their inactivity and pushed forward against another large division of the scottish army in his front headed by the earls of crawford and montrose both of whom were slain and their forces routed on the left the success of the english was yet more decisive for the scottish right wing consisting of undisciplined highlanders commanded by lennox and argyle was unable to sustain the charge of sir edward stanley and especially the severe execution of the lancashire archers the king and surrey who commanded the respective centres of their armies were meanwhile engaged in close and dubious conflict james surrounded by the flower of his kingdom and impatient of the galling discharge of arrows supported also by his reserve under bothwell charged with such fury that the standard of surrey was in danger at that critical moment stanley who had routed the left wing of the scottish pursued his career of victory and arrived on the right flank and in the rear of jamess division which throwing itself into a circle disputed the battle till night came on surrey then drew back his forces for the scottish centre not having been broken and the left wing being victorious he yet doubted the event of the field the scottish army however felt their loss and abandoned the field of battle in disorder before dawn they lost perhaps from eight to ten thousand men but that included the very prime of their nobility gentry and even clergy scarce a family of eminence but has an ancestor killed at flodden and there is no province in scotland even at this day where the battle is mentioned without a sensation of

jeffrey the powerful poetry of these passages can receive no illustration from any praise or observations of ours it is superior in our apprehension to all that this author has hitherto produced and with a few faults of diction equal to any thing that has ever been written upon similar subjects from the moment the author gets in sight of fiodden field indeed to the end of the poem there is no tame writing and no intervention of ordinary passages he does not once flag or grow tedious and neither stops to describe dresses and ceremonies nor to commemorate the harsh names of feudal barons from the border there is a flight of five or six hundred lines in short in which he never stoops his wing nor wavers in his course but carries the reader forward with a more rapid sustained and lofty movement than any epic bard that we can at present remember stanza xxxv lockhart quotes from byrons lara as a parallel day glimmers on the dying and the dead the cloven cuirass and the helmless head c line there can be no doubt that king james fell in the battle of flodden he was killed says the curious french gazette within a lances length of the earl of surrey and the same account adds that none of his division were made prisoners though many were killed a circumstance that testifies the desperation of their resistance the scottish historians record many of the idle reports which passed among the vulgar of their day home was accused by the popular voice not only of failing to support the king but even of having carried him out of the field and murdered him and this tale was revived in my remembrance by an unauthenticated story of a skeleton wrapped in a bulls hide and surrounded with an iron chain said to have been found in the well of home castle for which on enquiry i could never find any better authority than the sexton of the parish having said that if the well were cleaned out he would not be surprised at such a discovery home was the chamberlain of the king and his prime favourite he had much to lose in fact did lose all in consequence of jamess death and nothing earthly to gain by that event but the retreat or inactivity of the left wing which he commanded after defeating sir edmund howard and even the circumstance of his returning unhurt and loaded with spoil from so fatal a conflict rendered the propagation of any calumny against him easy and acceptable other reports gave a still more romantic turn to the kings fate and averred that james weary of greatness after the carnage among his nobles had gone on a pilgrimage to merit absolution for the death of his father and the breach of his oath of amity to henry in particular it was objected to the english that they could never show the token of the iron belt which however he was likely enough to have laid aside on the day of battle as encumbering his personal exertions they produce a better evidence the monarchs sword and dagger which are still preserved in the heralds college in london stowe has
