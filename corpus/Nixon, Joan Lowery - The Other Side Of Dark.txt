joan lowery nixon the other side of dark chapter one the dream is too long it slithers and slips and gurgles deeply into midnight pools in which i see my own face looking back it pounds with a scream that crashes into earthtorn caverns and is drowned it surges with the babble of voices that splash against my ears it whispers over words i cant understand i have cried out in my dream i have called and ages ago someone answered mom mama my voice violently shakes the dream i open my eyes as with a trembling roar the dream rushes from my mind and my memory im in bed but this is not my room across the room is a statue of a nurse her pencil is held in midair above her chart her mouth is open enough that i can see some bubbles of saliva on her tongue her eyes are stretched and glazed wheres my mother the statue comes to life oh she says oh my youre awake fluttering like a moth between too many lights she pats at my bed jabs at the controls that rest on the nightstand and trots to the door ill be right back stacy she says she takes a step toward me with palms up as though she wanted to hold me where i am and repeats i will ill be back in a minute then scrambles through the door wheres my mother i call to the empty room i try to sit up but i cant it makes me dizzy my mouth is dry and theres a spot on my left hip that is sore what is happening to me the blanket and sheet have slipped to one side so i pull them up to my chest i gasp as my hands feel breasts that are rounded and firm my shaking fingers slide past my waist exploring as the horror grows i lift my head to look down down at toes that lump the blanket near the foot of the bed and the horror explodes in a scream i am stacy mcadams im only thirteen years old and im in the wrong body my room explodes with people and they buzz like whitecapped bees reaching for my wrist wrapping something around my left arm and squeezing it until something beeps and all the time im shouting go away i want my mother a man with a trim blond beard sorts himself out from the confusion he leans over me studying me from under shaggy eyebrows one hand gently stroking my forehead stacy he says in a voice that pours like dark molasses im dr peterson i dont want to sedate you i want to talk with you will you please stop shouting im trembling so hard it feels as if the bed were shaking and my voice is a raspy whimper wheres my mother i need my mother im afraid of course you are he says but you dont need to be afraid everything will be all right his hand keeps soothing my forehead sopping up the fear until the trembling is gone and the bed is still the nurses have disappeared except for a short round one standing by the door for some reason i notice that her blue eyes are surrounded by crinkly laugh lines so i dont mind if she stays dr peterson sits on the edge of my bed my right hand disappears into his now then he says the members of your family are being contacted theyll be here as soon as they can make it my mother but he hasnt finished youre in houstons braesforest medical center under my care you were brought here after hospital treatment for a gunshot wound i groan and screw up my face trying to think trying to remember relax he says it doesnt matter now if you recall what happened that can come later the fact is that youve come out of what can best be called a semicomatose state a type of coma dr peterson listen to me i clutch both his hands and my voice grates like a rusty gate theres something wrong my body its not right its you were thirteen when you were brought here stacy weve tried to keep you in a good state of health as good as your condition would allow so your body has grown and matured naturally but i am thirteen he shakes his head no stacy youre seventeen when my mother comes shell tell you that youre wrong i dont want to listen to what he has to say i try to tell him to go away but i cant talk and cry at the same time and the tears get in my way he reaches to the table by my bed and hands me a fistful of tissues theyre soft but theyre heavy my hands are heavy my eyes are heavy and the bed is a warm cocoon shutting away the things i dont want to hear and see deliberately i slide into sleep this time i wake slowly scrunching up my eyes stretching and twisting and arching the way i love to do you wake up just the way pansy does my mother always says as she shoos our lopeared cat off the foot of my bed and tousles my hair stacy our other little cat stacy youre awake i open my eyes quickly at the sound of my fathers voice oh daddy youre here youre here i need you he quickly wraps me in a long hug his chest under his smooth white cotton shirt smells cozy and warm but my cheek grows wet from his tears i hold him away puzzled daddy ive never seen you cry there are hollows under his cheekbones and his brown eyes seem strangely faded his hair is thin on top hes my father but he isnt my father at least not the way he was yesterday daddy the doctor told me ive been here four years that im not thirteen im seventeen its not true is it but as i study my fathers face i know it has to be true and i gasp how did it happen to me nobody completely understands it not really you were shot and the bullet did something to you that caused a kind of coma but you didnt need life support you were breathing on your own and your vital signs were good its just that you were in a world of your own and you couldnt or wouldnt leave it the people here were able to help you sit in a chair and walk and even feed yourself if someone was with you you have a physical therapist who has worked with you on exercises every day i dont remember any of this he pats my hand i know sweetheart mentally you werent responding then why did i wake up he shakes his head no one knows exactly they can just guess you fell and cut your hip then last week you developed an infection in the cut and the doctors treated it with antibiotics and even some minor surgery they think that maybe it was the reaction to the anesthetic that brought you out of the coma im doing a bad job of telling you about it i guess dr peterson can do a better job of explaining it to you than i can my father wipes his cheeks with the back of one hand then spots the box of tissues wads one and rubs it over his eyes the door opens and a familiar face peers through donnas the original im the carbon that beautiful dark hair those tilted green eyes dad would say and wink at mom weve certainly got lovely daughters jeanne donna shyly whispers stacy donna i hold out my arms to my sister laughing as she hurries through the door she clumsily bumps against the end of the bed as she rushes to hug me i like your hair that way i mumble against her ear but dont ever scold me again about munching twinkies youre getting fat big sister she sits back and beams at me her tuckedin smile reminds me of so many times when she has been where i couldnt follow her first dance the redhaired basketball player she thought she was in love with when she was sixteen the dorm friends she wrote about when she started college im pregnant she says in just two months youre going to be an aunt my mouth is open and i know im making owl eyes but i dont know what to say last year she says dennis and i were married she glances at dad from the corners of her eyes i had to promise that id get my degree and i will in may of next year see dad im keeping the promise but i wasnt there i wail i was going to be your maid of honor you always told me i could be she holds the palm of my hand up against her cheek shes still smiling but i see a terrible sorrow in her eyes stacy love things were well so different dennis and i didnt have a big wedding just a few people and the priest but you always said when you were married youd have a train six feet long and loads of bridesmaids all in blue and wear the pearls that grandma left to mom dad clears his throat as though he were about to say something but donna interrupts it doesnt matter she says she shakes her head lays my hand gently on the blanket as though it were made of fine china and awkwardly gets to her feet one hand pressing the small of her back i cant wait till you meet dennis dennis kroskey hey youll have to get used to my new name she walks to the door turning to say hes patiently biding time out in the hall because i wanted to see you first dennis enters the room and donna props open the door hes tall with skin tanned the color of his reddish brown hair and he has a summer smell of lots of soap and showers ill bet he plays tennis ive met you before he says when you were sleeping you came to see me lots of times with donna she introduced us and she talked to you about our wedding just in case you could hear her your family talked to you about everything that went on maybe that was part of my dream there were so many voices and they came and went for so long a time i cant remember what they said i dont want to remember hes smiling too so i hurry to add donna told me about the baby im glad youre going to have a baby so are we he hugs donna in such a special way that i ache right in the middle of my chest i wasnt there when she fell in love and when she got married and when she first found out she was going to have a baby i have to get used to all this at once and it makes me feel lonely and shut out no matter what they tell me i take a long breath trying to keep things going right ill babysit for you whenever you want i guess i should say ill babysit if mom gives me a chance shell be so crazy about that baby the rest of us might not get to hold it until its old enough to go to school no one laughs no one answers theres a funny kind of chill like when you open the freezer door on a hot day and the icy air spills over your feet whens mom coming my words plop into the cold where is mom dr peterson is suddenly there head forward his shaggy eyebrows leading the way like the prow of a ship donna and dennis he says well keep your visit short why dont you come back to see stacy tomorrow donna quickly kisses me dennis pats my feet and they disappear before i can protest the door swings shut and the room is silent dr peterson lifts my wrist in strong fingers and looks at his watch i try to tug my arm away from him you interrupted i tell him i was asking a question and i want an answer take this he orders he hands me a pill and a glass of water from the table not now yes now as i obey quickly gulping the pill he nods at my father and dad leans forward holding my hand again his skin is clammy and hot and h has to clear his throat a couple of times before he can talk honey he says all along weve had faith in you we knew you wouldnt give up remember even when you were just a little girl and youd be so independent and set on getting your own way youve always had a lot of courage stacy and daddy tell me now wheres mom he is hurting and i cant help him i dont even want to help him my toes and fingers are warm and relaxed and a numb feeling is seeping through me its like the drowsy wakingsleeping in the early morning after the alarm has been turned off but im awake and i hear what hes saying the day you were shot his words are jagged pebbles on a dry dusty road and his voice trips as he stumbles through them your mother was shot too but jeanne oh stacy jeanne was killed no i answer because i dont believe these strange words that are as hollow as shouts inside a tunnel ringing and echoing and sliding away my father is gray and crumpled and hes crying i try to pat his hand with fingers that are too heavy to lift something is wrong maybe its still part of the dream and ill wake up and tell mom about this crazy dream while were making breakfast and shell give me a little swat on my backside and say for goodness sake stop talking and eat or youre going to be late for school tell me everything that happened i murmur wanting the dream to be complete no one has told me it takes a few minutes for my father to answer his voice seems farther away but i clearly hear every word donna said you were going to the backyard to sunbathe he begins i remember i was wearing my new red shorts and i had pansy with me there wasnt any smog and it was a golden day and i wanted a head start on my tan we dont know what happened next he says donna went to the grocery store down at the boulevard to get a couple of things she came home and found that the front door was unlocked your mother was lying in the den donna said she screamed at jeanne to get up but she didnt move donna telephoned for an ambulance and then she remembered you she ran outside and found you lying on the grass near the back porch steps i hear the words but i dont feel them i am in a tunnel but i can still hear what dad says except that his words get mixed up with the other sounds and voices that are in my head theres a weird noise like a yelp its coming from inside our house but a hand begins stroking my forehead a deep voice says go to sleep now stacy relax and sleep i want to open my eyes but i cant i run toward our back porch and the screen door bangs open somebody runs out he stares at me is she asleep dad asks and the voice murmurs not yet this guy on the porch stares at me i cant see his face but i know hes staring i feel it the way words and ideas i need to know seem to sift through my skin and pour into my mind hes scared i know that too daddy did they catch him dont worry about that now he says but did they i have to know no he says they couldnt find out who it was there were no witnesses its harder and harder to speak theres a humming in my head and it moves dad farther and farther away i whisper wondering if my whisper is real or only in my head im a witness i saw him daddy hush stacy daddy says dont try to talk now go to sleep the sounds in my mind melt together and dissolve the words i am so tired i dont ever remember having a dream in which i felt tired i wonder what my mother will tell me about this dream chapter two when morning comes gray light poking around the edges of the venetian blinds i wake and know this has not been a dream as though a tape recorder were inside my brain part of last nights conversation comes through loud and clear a picture appears i am standing in our backyard im listening wondering what it was i heard mom i call as i walk toward the porch steps are you all right but the door suddenly slams open hitting the siding on the house with a clatter and someone races out he pauses on the second step as we stare at each other but i cant see his face show me your face i say aloud youre someone i know i remember that much the face is blank but theres something in his hand its a gun he points it at me i cant move i cant make a sound i want to cry out mom mom some part of my mind has clutched and hidden what dad told me about mom but now his words spill out and i have to face them i roll onto my stomach and cry the pillow stuffed against my mouth i cry until no more tears will come and dry hiccupping shudders shake my body the soggy pillow smells sour so i push it to the floor ill never see my mother again the door snaps open and a tall angular nurse who matches the crispness of her uniform strides to my bed well hi she says im alice i can tell that shes taking in the pillow on the floor and my swollen eyes but she doesnt react until all the temperaturepulse business has been accomplished she checks under the bandage on my hip makes a note on her chart puts it down and for the first time looks at me as though i were a person how about a shower before breakfast she asks it will help you feel a lot better yesterday i got kind of dizzy when i tried to sit up that was yesterday and that was the medication have i got out of bed to take showers before she smiles every day and im usually the one whos given them to you my face is hot im embarrassed that i blushed but she doesnt seem to notice the shower does make me feel better on the outside i hold my face up to the water feeling its sting on my forehead and scalp but nothing has helped on the inside maybe i cant be helped because a hollow has been carved in there and inside that hollow there are no feelings at all alice making sure im steady on my feet leaves me to toweldry my hair she hums under her breath as she makes my bed theres a small mirror over the sink in my bathroom i drop the towel and study myself in the mirror its the weirdest sensation i feel that im looking at donna the way donna looked when i was thirteen the person in that mirror is different from the one i was used to seeing the face is thinner with shadows under the cheekbones i remember when my best friend jan and i would stick our faces toward the mirror and suck in our cheeks and say this is what well look like when we grow up and are beautiful i wonder how the eyes in the mirror can droop with so much pain when i feel absolutely empty inside alice brings me a short gown sprigged with blue violets the nurses thought youd like something pretty she says adding norma picked it out i dont know what to say i think i mumble thank you she glances at me from the corners of her eyes the shyness doesnt match her efficient look were all so glad that you recovered we really care about our patients especially the young ones especially you stacy youve got most of your life ahead of you and we she stops and the briskness takes over your sisters going to bring some of her clothes for you dont i have any clothes here what did i wear during the day we put you into cotton knit jumpsuits which you could wear when the therapist helped you ride the exercise bike and use the other equipment she reaches into the small closet pulls out a shapeless gray thing and holds it up its arms and legs dangling it looks like an ad showing what happens when you use the wrong brand of soap all i can say is yeech she laughs and tucks me between the stiff sheets cranks my bed until im sitting upright and hands me a hairbrush so that i can brush my hair breakfast is brought in and while im munching through the eggs curly brown edges a girl appears in the open doorway she looks at me as though she were afraid of me and for a moment i dont know who she is stacy she says still in the doorway im jan can i come in jan i know im sitting there with my mouth open but its hard to believe that this tall auburnhaired girl in the pink tailored shirt and tight jeans and makeup that looks like a cosmetic ad is my friend jan briley her knees seem a little stiff or maybe its the jeans she shoves a small package toward me backs off and perches on the edge of the armchair across from the bed its not much she says just some lipstick and eye shadow and mascara and stuff i thought youd need thanks this isnt jan it cant be jan i shiver and push the breakfast tray away you look you look good stacy how do you feel okay youll feel lots better when your makeups on and youve done something with your hair do you have hot rollers she looks embarrassed her fingers are white from gripping the arms of the chair of course you wouldnt have them here i should have brought mine i guess its okay i look at her hair closely you never used to wear your hair like that you used to wad it up in those big brown barrettes to keep it out of your eyes when we played baseball do you still play on the team team oh no she gives a funny little laugh and says theres a mirror in the package why not get it out what for so you can put on your makeup mom lets me let me wear lipstick but i dont know what to do with the eye stuff oh i didnt think about that i just take makeup for granted like brushing my teeth or wearing shoes how long have you worn real makeup well gosh stacy for ages after all im seventeen she pauses and so are you i shake my head ive got to get used to that i still feel like im thirteen i feel like everything took place yesterday im sorry about what happened all of it when they took you to the hospital and thought you might die i wanted to die too i couldnt bear to lose you and then last night your father called me and i couldnt believe it i just sat right down on the floor and cried and cried i was so glad you were going to be all right again jan leans forward forearms resting on her knees do you want to talk about it i cant help it but i feel as though she were one of donnas friends not mine its hard to answer i havent remembered all of it yet oh she says and looks relieved i dont know what i expected sympathy maybe even curiosity this jan doesnt want to know what i could tell her i have no idea what to say to her i guess from the way she starts squirming as though the chair had lumps in it that she feels the same way this is my best friend jan to whom i told even my secret thoughts and now im blank but i make a desperate stab what are things like at school jan sits upright looking thankful as though shed just passed a math test she hadnt studied for oh same old grind suzie you remember suzie lindly anyhow poor suzie got married last week to a guy who is really out of it i mean totally out only everybody knows she had to why did she have to jan blinks a couple of times her mouth open honestly stacy you know because shes pregnant oh i feel myself blushing again and im mad at myself for being so dumb for being a little kid jan takes a deep breath and picks up speed like a train making up time after almost getting derailed and bick is quarterback and is the big thing in the sports section of the newspaper each weekend and has a ton of colleges wanting him next year bick that skinny guy in ninth grade jan rolls her eyes hes no longer skinny needless to say and hes a senior and really something to look at i dated him a couple of times she smiles and i can see that shes waiting for me to be impressed but i giggle im sorry jan all i can see in my mind is gawky skinny bick who likes to make those awful loud burps while were eating lunch remember he sent you a note in study hall one day and got yelled at by mr hadley and you said youd rather drop dead than have anything to do with bick theres a long pause finally her voice comes out as tight as a stretched rubber band id forgotten that was such a long time ago we stare at each other for a few moments until i stammer i guess it was desperately i blurt out well tell me about yourself sure bj talked me into joining the camera club you remember bj dont you the quiet girl with the blond braids jan laughs no more braids and bj really blossomed were all jealous anyhow i went into photography in a big way and got some blackandwhites and one color shot accepted for the yearbook last year so im on the staff this year and bj and i are saving our money for a camera trip in yellowstone park in july bj says sounds like bjs a good friend my best shes so much fun and jan stops of course youve always been my best friend too stacy and when you get back to school we just look at each other i dont feel jealous because this jan is another person in another world this isnt my comfortable foreverandever best friend jan besides the hollow place is still inside me i cant feel anything at all jan jumps to her feet ive got to leave pretty soon let me get some makeup on you first im still clutching the package you dont have to i want to really you can use the little hand mirror to watch she has taken the package out of my hands and tears it open so i dont object i just let her smear on creams and oils and all sorts of stuff obeying directions as she tells me to close my eyes open my eyes and hold my mouth just right so she can add the lipstick she gives me instructions as she goes but its hard for me to pay attention i keep thinking about the friday nights when shed stay over at my house or i would at hers and wed put on our pajamas and sit on the bed eating cookies and cheese puffs and all sorts of junk while we watched tv and rolled each others hair i wish shed go away finally she steps back stares at me and gasps stacy youre really beautiful look in the mirror look at yourself dr peterson comes into the room stands at the foot of the bed and studies me so appreciatively that i dont have to look into the mirror seventeen going on twentysix he says hes not talking to me its to someone else whos sitting here someone i dont even know i introduce him to jan who beams at him like a beauty contestant meeting the judge grabs for her handbag and says i know youre busy and ill get out of your way stick around if you like he says but jan squeezes my hand and rolls her eyes upward in a way i remember meaning isnt he gorgeous and backs through the door saying to me ill see you tomorrow i cant help giggling but it surprises me by sounding like a sob dont cry dr peterson says one thing i learned when i was married is that crying does ugly smeary things to a womans mascara i dont know anything about mascara well youve got plenty of it on for the first time i look into the little mirror and feel even more alienated than before from the body im in want to wash your face i can wait yes i start to climb out of bed then change my mind i kind of like the way that girl in the mirror looks maybe i can save it for just a little while maybe i could get used to looking like that never mind i murmur i tuck the blanket around my hips and sneak another look in the mirror he sits on the side of the bed do you want to talk to me about what about what you remember i know im scowling screwing up the muscles in my face until they hurt trying trying trying so hard to think i dont remember enough dont work at it so hard it will all come back to you what if it doesnt i think it will you said you saw him the guy who shot you i didnt think that you heard me he doesnt answer just shifts his weight making the bed wobble and waits for me to go on i hug my knees against my chest i cant see his face but i know his name its somewhere in my head take it easy one thing at a time if i could just remember i could tell the police i could identify him what if he gets away its been four years already since the crime took place a little more time wont matter why dont you talk to me about the way you feel youve had to make a lot of mental adjustments in the past few hours i dont want to talk about anything id like to talk about your mother no i sound so angry im surprised because i dont feel angry i dont feel anything im a robot with nothing inside but gears that make me move and talk i try to soften my voice and add i cant not yet anyway okay dr peterson says ill be here when you want me my breath comes out in a long shudder i want to go home he smiles he has a nice smile it melts across his face matching the deep syrup of his voice pretty soon he says we just have to make sure youre over the infection and the anesthetic and all that stuff in spite of the way i feel i cant help reacting doctors dont say things like all that stuff oh what do doctors say you know all sorts of professional things that nobody can understand he stands up pats my hand and moves toward the door okay there must be a medical book around here someplace ill look through it and find something that sounds good the door plops shut behind him and the room settles into stillness i remember in grandmas house how shed go through the living room and dining room every evening pulling down the window shades against the dusk one by one shutting out the night shielding the house enclosing it in a whitefringed safety my mind is doing the same thing i know that thoughts should be racing through my mind tumbling over each other i should be rolling in memories wading through pain to all the new things ive seen and heard but bit by bit my mind is shutting itself in shielding itself from everything but one thought who was the person i saw on our back stairs its his turn to die chapter three a reporter comes to my room but donna arrived first with a suitcase filled with blouses and jeans and underwear and a pair of brown sandals so im sitting in a chair dressed in jeans that are too loose and short and a tshirt thats definitely too snug and sandals that actually fit i had to guess on sizes donna said as she tugged at the belt that keeps the jeans from falling around my hips i didnt realize that youd grown so tall and that youre so slender i guess i keep thinking of you the way you were when you were thirteen that makes two of us i answered i wish donna hadnt helped me get dressed i felt the same way i did last year no the year i was twelve and took swimming lessons and all the girls had to change clothes together in the dressing room some of them were starting to grow breasts and id sneak little looks while i was trying to keep my own chest covered feeling miserable hoping no one was looking at me i know donnas my sister but in a way she isnt my sister shes a grown woman with a baby growing inside her and it makes her so different i really dont know her at all theres a quick knock at the door and it opens before either donna or i can answer a woman steps in and takes in donna and me and everything around us with a glance that sweeps the room like a vacuum cleaner seemingly satisfied she looks directly at me hi she says and her grin is broad and full of teeth shes skinny with frizzy blond hair that sticks out in every direction loose strands straggle over her eyes and fly away from her forehead straps for her handbag and camera case are tangled on her left shoulder for a moment donna and i just stare at her so she quickly adds didnt they tell you i was coming im brandi mayer a reporter from the houston evening news she peers at me youre stacy mcadams i watch a strand of hair flop across her glasses theyre huge and round and too big for her she pushes her glasses up on her nose but doesnt seem to notice the hair in her eyes yes im stacy i answer donna steps slightly in front of me taking charge im stacys sister donna kroskey maybe id better call the clinics supervisor no one here told us a reporter was coming i really dont know if you should be here or not brandi pushes up her glasses again and perches on the edge of my bed since im in the only chair communication foulups she says happens all the time drives me absolutely batty she pulls a tiny tape recorder out of her handbag the strand of hair drifts back over her forehead you mind if i tape this she asks tape what brandi says if you dont know id better fill you in im doing a story for the news about stacy my editor is real soft on humaninterest stuff and he thinks that what happened to stacy coming out of a coma and all that ought to make a good feature story but how did he know about stacy donna asks easy brandi says medical news is a regular beat we check the hospitals and clinics all the time and we have people who call us about things they think might make stories she smiles at me okay now that you know what im doing here do you want to talk donna answers not yet im going to call the supervisors office and make sure this is all right but first were going to ask stacy if she wants this interview i shrug i dont care a puff of hair drifts over brandis glasses again she probably doesnt know what a mess her hair is it looks as if she were caught in the rain and then in the wind so i say look before you ask me any questions do you want to comb your hair you can use my bathroom mirror stacy donna mumbles she looks embarrassed brandi just gets up goes into the bathroom and comes right back looks the way its supposed to look she says i worked hard to get it like this i cant get mine to do that donna says i think its the wrong length youre kidding i tell them you mean its supposed to look messy stacy youre being rude but brandi grins its the latest thing kid but you wouldnt know that youre still into what was going on four years ago thats great real readerinterest stuff how do you feel about the new cars and new movies and wait donna says so while donna telephones we sit and stare at each other brand impatiently fiddles with her tape recorder donna hangs up the receiver and says the woman in the supervisors office says its all right but maybe i should try to get in touch with dad and see what he thinks could i just take a couple of pictures and get some basic answers from stacy while youre doing that brand looks at her watch ive got another appointment in less than an hour and its over near the loop its all right with me i tell them so while donna makes the call brand quickly aims her camera at me and snaps a few pictures then she tucks away the camera turns on her tape recorder wiggles into a shouldersback alertness and says stacy mcadams and thats spelled mc and not mac right dads not in his office right now donna says she comes to stand beside me and rests a hand on my shoulder if i ask anything you object to just stop me brand says and without waiting for donna to answer she asks me what did it feel like stacy coming back to the real world after four years asleep the question throws me i i dont exactly know yet theres a lot to get used to new songs new fashions new television shows brandi says sleeping beauty coming back to the world hmmm thats good no thats wrong sleeping beauty slept for a hundred years and everyone else slept with her everything would be the same when she woke up details details doesnt matter brandi says what did you remember when you woke up i close my eyes for a moment thinking trying so hard to think i can see our screen door flying open i can see the guy with the gun running out and pausing as he sees me standing there and i can see him raise the gun pointing it at me but i cant see his face shes getting tired donna breaks in no im trying to see his face and i cant whose face brandi asks the guy who shot mom he ran out our back door the screen door slammed open i was standing there we looked at each other and he raised the gun he shot me i know him i know his name i think thats why he shot me brandi leans toward me eagerly youre an eyewitness you saw your mothers murderer yes so tell me about him i cant remember his face but you said that you know him i do do you remember his name i scrunch up my face trying to remember hurts it aches its in my head its like i can touch it but it wont come close enough brandis eyes sparkle think hard maybe all of a sudden it will all come back to you donna interrupts i dont think we should even talk about it maybe it would be traumatic for stacy to remember we ought to leave it up to dr peterson stacy is all thats important the rest isnt i speak up its important to me to know who that guy is he killed my mother donnas arms are around me shush shush its okay stacy dont get upset i hate him donna and you want to see him get what he deserves brandis eyes are bright yes the hollow inside me begins to fill churning upward with boiling bubbles of anger until there is nothing inside me but a burning red hatred for the man i saw the killer the murderer the person who took my mother away from me donnas cheek is against mine shes holding me tightly stop she says to brandi please stop and get out of here this isnt good for stacy listen to her she wants to remember go away donna stands and takes a step toward brandi okay brandi says she climbs off the bed and smiles at donna as though they were best friends im going im gone she fishes a business card from her pocket and hands it to me thanks for the interview stacy if you remember anything else about this guy who shot you please give me a call okay i just nod and stuff the card into the pocket of my jeans donna follows brandi into the hall and in a couple of minutes she comes back with alice got a little excited did we alice asks before i can answer she wraps a cuff around my left arm and takes my blood pressure she beams at donna and at me very good nice and normal no harm done i still dont think they should the supervisor has a new secretary she didnt know patients should have privacy and i agree i agree unfortunately they dont let nurses make the rules although i get to my feet and the walls of the room lean a little to the left and then to the right so i rest my head against the wall to steady it oh stacy donna says and her arms are around me i can feel the warm bulge of her belly against mine donna i murmur against her hair i want to go home take me home as soon as the doctor says so where is he alice gently pulls me away from donna leads me to the bed and pats me into place mrs montez is your physical therapist stacy shell be in soon she wants to talk to you just be patient honey youll be home in no time task accomplished alice rustles from the room i close my eyelids the anger glows against them i wish i could see his face donna leans over to kiss my forehead she gives a little grunt as she bends and im very much aware of the baby who is making her body so thick in the middle that its hard for her to lean over the bed im going to let you rest now donna says i have to get to class ill see you later her face is close to mine and i can see the tiny beads of perspiration that lie on her upper lip like a glistening mustache donna i say grabbing her right hand and holding it tightly do you remember a couple of years ago when mom was pregnant that was more than a couple of years ago stacy you were only ten i groan ten whenever oh donna i was so excited about moms baby and id rest my hand on her stomach and feel it kick and when she lost it it hurt so much it nearly killed me there are tears on donnas cheeks i know it hurt all of us i struggle to sit up and wrap my arms around her i didnt mean to make you cry im so mixed up i mean i think about mom having a baby but not you and now that youre grownup and pregnant i cant get used to it its like you should be mom and not donna and it makes me feel strange and faraway and oh donna i dont even know how to tell you whats in my head but donna soothes me patting my back and nuzzling her cheek against mine its okay stacy its okay calm down everythings not going to happen at once its going to take awhile for you to get things straight dont punish yourself by trying to rush it just relax just take each day as it comes we hold each other without talking the room is warm the window spills sunlight onto the beige tile floor and the voices in the hall hum in the background like contented bees donna is the big sister the comforting one yet the hurt we share is the same and it flows between us i can feel how much donna misses mom too i begin to realize that thered be questions shed want to ask mom little scary sparks that mom could pat out with a smile and a few words thered be the baby clothes to buy together the excitement to share about the first grandchild as i close my eyes i see our screen door fly open someone runs out and pauses on the steps he stares at me he raises the gun and points it at me but where is his face for donna for me i must see his facet donna leans back holding my shoulders are you all right now stacy i nod the storm blew away some of the clutter in my mind and i found my sister thanks donna whenever you need me ill be here she says i pat her stomach and smile and answer whenever you need me ill be here too alice opens the door in a hurry nimbly stepping back saying stacy this is mrs montez the physical therapist bursts past her into my room leaning forward a little breaking a path with her chin and the end of her nose shes short and solid with clipped gray hair and shes packed into a rose velour jogging suit she checks the chart at the end of my bed grins at it and then at me all that good regular exercise has paid off she says arent we proud of ourselves i dont remember exercising i tell her and im sorry but i dont even remember you her left hand chops at the air as though she were cutting off something unnecessary doesnt matter if you remember or not she says what matters is that i kept you in good physical shape once youre over the temporary effects of your operation youll find yourself in fine condition thanks to my care and skill behind mrs montezs back alice winks at me you may think this all sounds immodest mrs montez says half turning to include alice who blinks and looks embarrassed but the body is like a machine that must stay finetuned in order to operate correctly and keeping you in condition was my job she beams again looking so pleased with herself she reminds me of the cheshire cat in alice in wonderland so she says bouncing a little on her toes if dr peterson allows it tomorrow morning ill put you through your paces then after you return to your home you can keep up the good work do you have a swimming pool no exercise cycle i dont think so rowing machine oh never mind of course you dont have any of the things youll need no one ever does well ill just trot off and see what we can do about it without another word she charges from the room alice smiles sheepishly and whispers to me shes really awfully good one of the best a whitecoated orderly with shaggy yellow hair comes in with a lunch tray his gaptoothed grin is friendly as he arranges the tray on the table by my bed and swings it around in front of me thanks monty alice says no problem monty says and dashes off before alice can hoist me up and plump up my pillows theres nothing special on the tray but im hungry i dont pay much attention to what im eating im tired and after ive finished my lunch i push the table away lie back and go to sleep the dreams dont make sense as they lap one into another trailing through the afternoon i wake to long shadows in a room lit with late orange sunlight the light touches donna in her chair brushing brightness into her hair and on her cheek her head is bent as she reads a newspaper and a little worry wrinkle flickers on her forehead i stretch lazily arching my back and donna looks up youre purring she said i remember how mom said you were like a little cat the way you stretched you always used to purr i must have slept a long time donna sighs and hands me the newspaper i wish i hadnt let that reporter interview you i wiggle up sitting crosslegged the newspaper on my lap there on the front page are two photographs of me one my class picture when i was thirteen and in the seventh grade and the other the picture brand took this morning two girls so very different yet theyre both me one i recognize but the other is someone i dont even know i keep staring at the photos until donna says in the same tone of voice shed use if shed found a roach in the bathtub she even used that sleeping beauty stuff for the first time i read the headline over the pictures and story sleeping beauty awakes to new world does she write what i said about her messy hair i ask donna donna groans read it so i do brandis story is not too bad just a little dramatic and she did put in the part about her hair only she didnt use the word messy she made everything seem more exciting than it was especially the part about how i was the only one who could identify my mothers murderer i throw the newspaper on the bed and complain to donna she didnt write things the way they happened she makes it sound like any minute now im going to remember who i saw but i cant i want to and im trying but i still cant its my fault that story was written donna says i should have sent her away dont blame yourself its not your fault i sneak another look at the girls in the photographs i wonder where she got my seventhgrade picture not from dad or from me donna says she might have got it from your school or from one of your friends maybe jan i study the picture the reporter took am i really as grownup as i look in that second picture donna sighs and mumbles something else about making a mistake so i quickly say it doesnt matter its just a dumb story i bet nobody will even read it of course theyll read it donna says and what worries me is what if i wait a moment watching worry pucker her forehead and turn down the corners of her lips when she doesnt finish what she was saying i ask what if what nothing donna says you were going to say something dont just stop like that i want to know whats bothering you donna tries to smile stacy my thoughts were just wandering around i dont even remember what i had in mind but she stands up and hugs me ive got to get home and put something together for dinner dennis made dinner the last three nights and i promised id take my turn tonight he comes home starving to death and i need to stop by the grocery store and get lettuce because were out donna is talking nonstop not letting me get in another word i remember that technique of hers and i have to smile okay she doesnt have to tell me now what she has in mind shell come out with it sooner or later dad will be here to see you tonight she says as she reaches the door and ill be back tomorrow morning bye stacy the door closes before i have a chance to answer i turn on the bedside lamp take another quick look at the photographs and go to the bathroom mirror as i comb my hair i study my face this is me stacy mcadams and i have to start getting used to it this is how other people see me this is how people who read the newspaper will see me this is how i suck in a deep breath and hang onto the edge of the basin as what donna meant suddenly socks me brand wrote that i could identify the murderer what if the killer reads that what will he do somebody help me i whisper to the girl in the mirror ive got to be able to see his face chapter four the bones in my legs are like jello and chills shiver up and down my spine somehow i make it back to the chair and drop into it trying to think wondering what i can do a voice makes me jump that sleeping beauty stuff was cornball dr peterson i didnt hear you come in obviously what makes you so jumpy did you think i was another reporter no i just had a lot on my mind i i look right into his eyes i was scared i am scared he sits on the bed and rests his elbows on his legs leaning toward me i didnt know that reporter had been allowed to visit you he says we have someone new on the front desk and she didnt understand the situation im sorry it happened no one else from the media will be allowed to see you while youre here its not your fault your sister chewed us all out he smiles what if the guy who murdered my mother reads that story it says im an eyewitness he nods he may not read it that was four years ago he may be thousands of miles away from here he might even be in jail somewhere or dead what if he isnt he shrugs and looks as though he wished he had an answer dont worry about him he manages to say dont worry oh sure i grip the arms of the chair but the telephone rings someone at the front desk tells dr peterson that two detectives from the houston police department have arrived that they want to talk to me dr peterson opens the door wide and leans against the wall arms folded waiting for the detectives to join us you dont have to stay i tell him i dont have anything important to do he answers a head transplant but that can wait i dont need a babysitter doctors never babysit their fees are too high im not going to laugh at your jokes it will only encourage you two tall men block the door for a moment smoothly one steps aside then follows the other into my room they look the way id imagine detectives should look their business suits are taut across their broad shoulders and theyre both big men they have brown hair and one has a mustache its their eyes i think that label them as detectives it doesnt matter that the mustached one has brown eyes and the other has blue i know they really see me every detail of me and theyre trying to probe below the surface poking at the doors to my mind markowitz and johns they tell me and shake hands with dr peterson markowitz has the mustache ill try to remember that a voice comes from the doorway and dad appears what is this stacy are you all right dr peterson fills dad in and everyone goes through the introduction thing again dad shakes his head i dont think stacy is up to this yet but his words come out in a question and hes looking at dr peterson not at me stacy can handle it dr peterson says hey look at me daddy im dressed and out of bed im feeling a lot better honest i stand up and give dad a hug he hugs me tightly awkwardly the shock i feel takes away the comfort i used to feel in my fathers hugs my head once fitted snugly against his chest and now i find myself looking over his shoulder we stand back and stare at each other you might want to sit down stacy detective johns says to me we wont be long just a few questions he shoves his hands in his pockets then takes them out again he doesnt seem to know what to do with his hands i bet hes trying to stop smoking its about that newspaper article isnt it dad asks as i move away from him and sit in the only chair everyone else is standing and it makes me feel kind of strange yes detective markowitz says stacy according to the interview you gave the reporter for the evening news you saw a person run out of your house the person who shot you i nod but its been four years detective markowitz adds how good is your memory if we show you some books of mug shots do you think you might be able to recognize him the sound that comes out of my mouth is a kind of desperate wail and it shocks me as much as it does everyone else in the room i can see it happening in my mind i tell them its almost like a movie running over and over he comes out of the back door and stands there staring at me and i know him i know that i do but i cant see his facet the detectives glance at each other quickly then back at me johns rubs at an invisible spot on his chin maybe it would help if you tried to describe exactly what you saw at the time markowitz says and detective johns adds like what he was wearing jeans a tshirt maybe a white one yes jeans i say quickly but not a tshirt it was kind of a plaid shirt red i think yes red but faded and the sleeves were rolled up markowitz is writing very good what else what else uh he has a gun in his right hand theres a long pause as i try hard to remember help me i beg i have to know who he is he killed my mother and i hate him dr peterson gives me a quick look im startled myself at the bitterness i can taste in my words take it easy stacy detective johns drawls just try to relax well ask some questions and see if you can come up with the answers he uses the telephone on the table next to my bed the receiver almost disappears inside his hand while he makes his call markowitz asks me to go over the physical description i have given and try to add to it he asks a lot of questions did i hear a shot how close was i standing to the back door had i heard a car on the street before it all happened and how old was the guy i saw a few years older than i was i tell him someone you knew at school no older he goes went to high school how old was he i squeeze my eyes shut so tightly that they burn i should know he lives in your neighborhood your mother knew him too maybe oh no i dont think so i dont know i try so hard but i still cant see the murderers face finally markowitz pauses i think thats it for now he says wait let me ask you something i say why was this guy in our house why did he kill mom its listed as robbery markowitz answers he looks at dad and dad nods he took my wifes wallet out of her handbag dad says his voice rises as though he still couldnt believe what hes telling me and it was only ten or twelve dollars she asked me that morning if id stop by the bank on the way home from work ten dollars and he killed her one of the policemen who came after it had happened said he guessed the killer was someone looking for money to buy drugs and he probably thought the house was empty maybe he panicked why did it have to be mom i cry out mom was gentle and loving and funny and kind and she trusted everybody even when i was a very little girl i wanted to be like mom but i wasnt like her at all id get mad and shout and stamp and dad would march me off to my room to think things over and cool down thinking things over never seemed to help much dad sighs honey we just dont know what was in the murderers mind theres no way of knowing well know when we arrest him they look at me and markowitz says to make a solid case the da needs two kinds of evidence an eyewitness to place someone at the scene of the crime and physical evidence that the person was there im the eyewitness im going to remember i am and you must have something from the house i think about some of the detective movies ive seen what about fingerprints could you look for fingerprints dad reaches down and takes my right hand his forehead is wrinkled with worry calm down stacy dont get overexcited he looks at dr peterson as though he were begging for help but dr peterson just gives a barely noticeable shake of his head granted fingerprints can last for years markowitz tells me but chances are any fingerprints were cleaned up long ago i impatiently tug my hand away from dads but what about when the police investigated after mom was murdered wouldnt they have taken fingerprints then markowitz nods well pull the file and see what theyve got there may be a chance they got some prints maybe even some clear ones obviously if they had them they didnt get a make on them but maybe our boys been in trouble since then and well be able to match them there may be some other physical evidence that may help with luck theyll have the bullet that killed your mother we wont know till we check it out what good will the bullet do without the gun it might be worth something it might not its our job to find out will you tell me the minute you know these things take time johns says he turns to markowitz and mumbles got a cigarette the look markowitz gives his partner is enough of an answer okay okay forget it johns says he turns to me well try a computer search may just luck out computer dr peterson smiles youve got a lot to catch up on stacy everyone does everything by computer now what will happen to the murderer after you arrest him hell go through all the legal processes johns says will he get the death penalty dad looks startled but johns takes the question as though hed heard it over and over again depends on the jury he says in texas the death penalty can be given if robbery sexual assault or kidnapping are associated with the murder with this one weve got a robbery charge markowitz tucks his notebook into his inside coat pocket i get a glimpse of a gun in a shoulder holster i remember another gun and i shiver im afraid were tiring you markowitz says as though they could read each others mind he and detective johns turn toward the door at the same time i climb out of my chair and walk a few steps with them im not tired i wont get tired ill do anything i can to help you markowitz hands me his card you can reach me through this number at any time if you need us dont hesitate to call they stride from the room dad follows them so does dr peterson because theyve left the door open i can hear the deep rumble of their voices but only a word or two so i stand just inside the door where they cant see me well yes there is a possibility johns says but its a slim one dad is demanding but he could be a danger to stacy theres a pause and markowitz answers yes its a long shot depending on where this guy is and whether he saw that newspaper article and how his mind works but i suppose we could say theres a possibility that stacy could be in danger then shouldnt we get protection for her dad asks if you dont mind id like to butt in dr peterson doesnt wait to find out if he can or cant and just goes on talking its important that stacy lead as normal a life as possible so that she can get all the pieces together but i think i dont hear the rest of what dad says as they move farther away i lean against the wall waiting for dad to come back to my room im tired im angry and im scared because i dont know what will happen next the guy without a face who murdered my mother and stacy mcadams whos going to find the other first chapter five when dad comes back to my room he tries to hide his worries under a broad smile but his eyes give him away he hugs me again and mumbles against my hair oh stacy you cant know how wonderful it is having you back you just cant know its warm inside dads hug its safe i dont want to stay in this clinic i murmur im feeling all right now really i want to go home with you he backs off and smiles at me dr peterson says most likely you can come home the day after tomorrow only when he doesnt finish his sentence i ask only what for a moment hes silent then he says only youll be home alone and i think someone should be with you i open my mouth to say but mom will be there and i have to remind myself that she wont its still so hard to believe dad is watching me so i manage to stammer school i have to go to school daddy dad takes my hand and leads me to the bed sitting beside me there are a lot of things to work out stacy and school is one of them you were just finishing the seventh grade when all this happened to you but your classmates are now in the eleventh grade you arent prepared for eleventhgrade courses and naturally you wont want to go back to seventh grade so maybe tutors home study i dont know yet it hadnt occurred to me to find out what to do i dont want to go to school at home by myself dad rubs a hand over his forehead and sighs no no of course not youd be lonely maybe theyd let me take exams for the courses i was taking in seventh grade and make up eighth grade in summer school that way id be in high school in the fall ill work real hard daddy and not stay on the phone too long or watch too much television and mom will the word enters us like an ache and we just sit there staring at each other i im sorry dad i keep forgetting he puts an arm around me honey i still do so many times i come home in the evening and for an instant actually expect jeanne to call out to me it hurts so much yes it does will it ever stop hurting i dont know well never stop remembering but i dont know if the hurt will always be part of the remembering i wish i could give you an answer that would help if we had wishes id wish none of this had happened id wish we could go back have a second chance life doesnt give second chances stacy then i dont like life very much dads arm is strong and he tightens his grip a little on my shoulder at some time or another everyone gets hit by problems that seem almost impossible to handle you can give up without a fight or you can climb over those problems and move on because there are lots of good things ahead for you to discover you make it sound too easy dad maybe you could do it but i dont know yet if i can you can he makes a strange sound that startles me i dont know if its a laugh or a sob so i twist to look at him i can see the tautness of the muscles that are throbbing in his cheeks and chin stacy when jeanne died i wanted to run away to hide to do anything in order to escape all the pain but you didnt i did i dont understand youre here daddy and ill continue to be here with you honey i listen to footsteps pass my door and to someone laughing down the hallway it seems a long time before dad continues i drank a lot too much it didnt help me escape anything it just made it all worse it was a stupid thing to do dont say youre stupid daddy it wasnt your fault it was the murderers fault you cant blame him for everything stacy im certainly not going to blame him for something i chose to do well i blame him i hate him hate isnt the answer think about your mother and what a forgiving person she was i cant forgive him i dont want to he shakes his head sadly i dont know why he cant understand how i feel what weve been talking about is all part of growing up of maturing he says those are just words grownups like to use teachers say them t expect you to be mature mature doesnt mean anything yes it does it means a responsible way of looking at things a more thoughtful way of making decisions so if i grow up then ill automatically be mature stacy i dont know how to explain it its something youll feel inside youll find it out for yourself he sighs maybe your mother would have known how to explain these things to you i dont know what to say to him to make him feel better i take his right hand and hold it tightly i love you daddy he gives his head a little shake as though he were trying to toss away a lot of painful memories and says i love you too the door slams open so suddenly that i gasp monty the shaggyhaired orderly bursts into the room carrying my dinner tray he must have startled dad too because dad jumps to his feet standing between me and the orderly what are you doing dad snaps well hey i got to deliver her dinner tray since dad doesnt move he says here you want it you can give it to her no problem dad takes the tray and as the orderly turns to leave dad adds prom now on knock and come in carefully hey they know were coming we dont have to knock on doors around here dads voice is firm i said from now on i want you to knock on this door before coming in understand sure sure monty says and disappears dad puts the tray on the bedside table theres a deep pucker between his eyebrows and he looks terribly tired i dont like that kids attitude he mutters daddy hes okay hes just always in a hurry maybe its part of his job to get the trays around fast he looks at his watch id better grab a bite to eat pretty soon its almost time to get to the office you have to go to your office but its so late uh extra work he says the wrinkle between his eyebrows deepens as he looks at me are you sure youll be all right stacy are you afraid something is going to happen to me no oh no i just meant do you need anything can i do anything for you while im here his glance slides away from mine hes not telling me the truth better hurry so you wont miss dinner i answer he holds me tightly in a big hug then leaves pausing at the door to give me one last searching look and an attempt at a smile im staring at the dented metal top that coven the plate on my tray wondering if i really want to take it off and find out whats under it when a nurse with hair so red she looks like a lit candle pokes her head in the door turn on channel two she says quick i move toward the television set that is mounted on the ceiling but she bounces across the room and grabs a remotecontrol device that was lying behind a large box of tissues she quickly presses buttons until she gets the right channel a man and a woman are tasting spaghetti and rolling their eyes with delight its going to be after this commercial she tells me what is you i sit on the edge of the bed wondering what she means there werent any television reporters here oh they were here they just didnt get in to see you the office put you under tight security security oh didnt they tell you that theres a real cute offduty policeman stationed in the hall to keep out the reporters and photographers normas been walking by him so often shes wearing a path in the tiles but what she holds up a hand to hush me listen here it is the newscaster is saying stacy mcadams houstons sensational sleeping beauty two days ago awakened from a fouryearlong comatose state to announce that she is a potential eyewitness to a murder however she is just as inaccessible to reporters as the original sleeping beauty was to the rest of the world as he speaks the front door of the clinic is shown on the screen so thats where i am its a white onestory building that seems to ramble over a large area and there are lots of pine trees shading it there are people standing on the steps of the building and on the grass some of them carrying cameras a policeman is facing them his back to the closed doors on the screen appear the same two photographs that were in the newspaper called a model student by her teachers the newscaster continues oh no i groan thats not true i wasnt a model student i hated algebra anyhow what he said makes me sound like a creep you cant hear what he says if you dont keep quiet the nurse answers but a picture comes up of a group of protesters at the city hall and the newscaster is off on another story the photographs of the two girls stay in my mind especially the one taken by the newspaper reporter do i really look like that i whisper to myself the nurse hears me sure you dot youre just as pretty as sleeping beauty was too remember the walt disney one with her dark hair and big eyes that was snow white she shrugs and laughs doesnt matter youre a really goodlooking girl youre going to have lots of dates and lots of fun she scurries out of the room its just as well because im suddenly too surprised to talk to her dates i dont know how to date i dont even know what to say to a guy oh sure there were cute guys in my school but jan and i and my other friends didnt talk to them much except when we worked up enough courage to say things like you were real good in the game yesterday and when they werent around we giggled a lot about them and talked about what wed do if a guy wanted to kiss us suzie told us shed been frenchkissed and she described what it was like and a lot more but jody kept yelling yuck yuck yuck thats gross so suzie said we were babies and she wasnt going to tell us any more we didnt care wed all read the same book suzie had jan and i asked our mothers when we could date and they both said not until we were in high school jan and i made a real fuss about it i guess now that was pretty silly since none of the guys had asked us for dates jan jan would know how to date but i cant ask her what to do shed think i was really dumb shes not the jan i used to know and i feel shy with her maybe i can ask donna what to do i flop on the bed nearly overturning my stillcovered dinner tray from where im lying on the bed i can see the bottom edge of the door its open just a crack just enough so that someone must be holding it open just enough for someone to be watching me quickly i scramble off the bed and manage to stammer who whos there the door opens wide and monty blinks and grins hey its just me what do you want your tray he says im collecting them you just brought it he shrugs go ahead and finish he says he comes into the room shoving the door so that it shuts behind him and sprawls in the armchair saw you on tv he adds youre not supposed to be in here gotta take a break once in a while they really work us hard around here i grab the tray and shove it at him here take it you didnt eat anything arent you hungry no he still doesnt move to take the tray youre a celebrity you know that go away slowly monty bends and curls as though it were taking a lot of effort to pull his body together and out of the chair when he gets to his feet he says youre not very friendly i just thought it would be kind of interesting to ask you about what happened i dont mean to be unfriendly i just dont want to talk about it youre scared right but you dont have to be scared of me he moves a step closer you can tell me what did the guy look like do you know his name i cant answer i try to back up but the bed is behind me only the tray is between us montys voice lowers its sort of like a movie you being the only one who can identify the guy who shot you and your mom if it was a movie you know the guy would come hunting for you and it would probably be jack nicholson or somebody and youd try to hide out and i drop the tray and he hops backward grabbing his left foot whadja do that for get out of here i yell at him and i jab at the call button a petite nurse with cropped black hair comes in as monty is picking up the dishes and trying to wipe up the globs of food that decorate the floor whats the matter she asks she did it not me monty complains i told him to get out he kept trying to ask me questions monty stands holding the messy tray he grins at the nurse shes a celebrity i just wanted to talk to her for a few minutes get back to your job she says sternly you could get fired for deliberately annoying a patient she glares until he leaves the room then she smiles at me dont mind monty hes not the brightest person around this hospital but hes harmless he wouldnt leave when i told him to he frightened me he asked too many questions he was just curious she answers naturally the staff has been talking a lot about you and he probably wanted to brag about getting some inside information ill tell the head nurse to chew him out and hell leave you alone want another dinner tray no thanks im not very hungry okay now i guess she leaves and i sit on the edge of the bed thinking about what happened i guess i overreacted and got scared of monty because im scared of so many things now i dont want to be on television i dont want a policeman guarding me in the hall i dont want to be afraid anymore i wish i were still thirteen i dont have time to think about monty or policemen or anything else the next morning when the day snaps into place with doors banging open blinds clattering up breakfast a shower and alice changing the dressing on my hip looks lovely alice says its healing nicely dr peterson will be pleased im pleased i tell her alice laughs thats taken for granted she hands me a clean pair of jeans and a slightly faded tshirt with a strange face on it this was my daughters alice says i thought youd like it is that your daughters picture alice giggles no honey thats glory beans whos glory beans why shes alice stops and stares at me with wide eyes oh my i didnt think you wouldnt know would you shes a very famous punk star all the kids are crazy about her punk whew alice shakes her head i guess the best thing to do is bring you a fouryear stack of newsmagazines so you can catch up mrs montez hops into the room as i pull the shirt over my head fifteen minutes she says i wrote your appointment on the schedule meet me in the physical therapy room on time where is the but shes already galloping down the hall alice gathers her tray of things and heads for the door just turn left and go straight down to the main desk then turn left again its at the far end of that wing you cant miss it i go into the bathroom and brush my hair it needs a trim i could probably use a haircut a new style what are the new styles maybe theres a choice jans hair looked good not like that reporters i study my face im getting a little more used to it now its not too bad i wish my nose werent so long and my eyes were bigger but on the whole i kind of like this face its so much like the face i was used to seeing on donna quickly i get the lipstick from the drawer of my bedside table and run back to the bathroom with it i smooth it on with my little finger there maybe later ill try some of the eye stuff not now i remember mrs montezs order to be on time as i enter the hallway i hear some voices to my right down at what must be the nurses station but the hall to my left is empty what happened to the policeman who was here the hall is long but at the end i can see a desk or counter or something and a lot of potted plants that must be the main desk feeling like a sixyearold whos allowed to cross the street for the first time i start down the hallway following the directions alice gave me suddenly someone swoops up from behind me and grips my upper right arm as i stiffen digging in my heels and trying to pull away a voice says whats with you im just trying to help you escape the mob the voice belongs to monty he smiles at me and i try not to stare at the wide gap between his front teeth i tug my arm out of his grasp what mob down at the main desk as i take a skeptical look in that direction he says well its not exactly a mob but a couple of reporters there are asking a lot of questions about you i dont see anybody theyre by the main door the cop is with them if you go past them theyll see you i have to go by the main desk to get to the physical therapy room not if you use my shortcut thats what ive been trying to tell you it makes sense i dont want to have to talk to any reporters right now so i shrug okay which way do we go he takes my arm again and pulls me down the hall to a swinging door where he jerks me through were in a corridor thats narrower than the main hallway i try to pull away youre hurting my arm dont squeeze it and dont go so fast cmon you dont want to be late i nearly stumble trying to keep up with him the corridor turns and i begin to realize that were going in the wrong direction were heading toward what must be a back door to this building because in the upper half of the door is one of those crinklylooking opaque glass windows and i can see light shining through the window i grab his arm with my other hand tugging and yelling stop when were almost at the back door he does stop so suddenly it throws me offbalance i bang into the wall and the only reason i remain upright is that hes still hanging onto my arm his eyes dart to each side as he nervously looks at the row of closed doors dont make so much noise he says let go of me i try to kick his leg but he jumps aside his face is close to mine i can smell the salty sweat on his forehead hey hold on youll get me in trouble if you dont shut up as i open my mouth wide to scream he claps a hand over it and in a low voice says listen to me will you ill get twenty bucks from one of the reporters if i bring you to the back door the guy just wants to ask you a couple of questions and get a picture of you thats all you dont have to say much if you dont want okay i mean i can really use the twenty bucks he takes his hand away from my mouth and i spit and rub the back of my left hand over my lips trying to wipe away the taste of his fingers well he asks i dont think a reporter would do that look who asks questions twenty bucks is twenty bucks he smiles as though he were trying to put me at ease but his eyes narrow and for an instant he looks away i think hes lying suddenly the knob of the back door rattles and i look up to see a shadow through the glass the door is locked so the person on the other side gives up and presses against the glass trying to see through it the glass distorts his face into a monstrous blob with squashed nose and two dark spots for eyes can he see me those dark spots shift and seem to be staring in my direction the doorknob rattles again chapter six i yell at the top of my lungs and now my kick connects with one of montys shins he shouts an obscenity and grabs his leg two doors fly open and people crowd into the corridor squeezing behind and around each other squishing monty against the wall where he squirms and struggles like a beetle on its back maybe i dont make much sense but i shout at everyone about what happened the policeman arrives and dashes through the back door but he comes back to say that whoever was at the door has got away he grips the back of montys neck and marches him off someone has an arm around my shoulders and is trying to calm me down people are demanding what did she say what happened but a loud firm voice shatters the confusion now mrs montez says clapping her hands into the silence we are already well off schedule and i will have no more of this silly chitchat in the corridor we will all get back to work stacy you come with me i follow her through a room that connects with one of the major hallways rubbing my arm where the orderly had held it i ask if the man outside the door was a reporter he would have stayed wouldnt he he wouldnt have run dont think about it mrs montez says without breaking her rapid pace that is the policemans job your job is to pay close attention to what i will show and tell you we march into a room that is like a small health club with all sorts of exercise equipment some of which i recognize some of which ive never seen before did i use any of this i ask her of course she answers how does your hip feel alice says it looks good i didnt ask how it looks to alice i asked how it feels to you its okay very good stacy then hop on the bicycle there is no question but that she should be obeyed i cant imagine anyone ever questioning her authority i begin to pedal and she sets a timer she acts like the queen of the world but shes really not so bad i can tell that shes made a shell to hide in so that people cant see that she really cares but i look at the warmth in her eyes and i know she does care i pedal a little fester and glance at her and smile and i do pay close attention to what mrs montez tells me shes arranged for the loan of an exercise bicycle and insists that i also walk at least a mile or two a day believe me im going to keep doing the exercises and stay in good shape because ive got a lot to do first on my list as soon as i can see the face of the guy with the gun and they catch him im going to make sure hes convicted of murder the policeman comes by to report whoever was at the back door of the clinic was probably an inexperienced reporter who chickened out when the fuss began lots of apologies that i was upset and please dont worry no real problem except for the orderly who was in big trouble with the clinic manager i nod and make all the right answers but something at the back of my mind keeps nagging uncomfortably that the orderlys answers were too easy i dont believe it was a reporter why would a reporter use such sneaky tactics to meet me but who else would it be dad arrives to check me out soon after i get back to my room dr peterson joins us and alice comes in to help me pack i am starting to get a little shaky thinking about what it will be like to be back in our own house without mom there too when the phone rings its detective markowitz they told me you were checking out will you be able to come downtown this morning to look through some mug shots do you think that will help me remember its worth a try then ill be there ask your father he tells me so i do dad takes the receiver and talks to markowitz then he turns to me are you up to all this stacy its going to be an emotional strain i stand as tall as i can i can do it i have to do it i hate him hate isnt the answer stacy it wont solve anything it will send the murderer to prison thats all i care about there are other things to care about dad says but then norma and one of the other nurses crowd into the room to say goodbye and interrupt him i hear dad tell markowitz hell take me home first then bring me to the downtown station i gather up the rest of my things wad them into a small suitcase dad has brought and say goodbye to the nurses and to dr peterson take it easy stacy dr peterson says and suddenly wraps me in an awkward hug i wish he hadnt when he releases me i stare at the floor and hope nobody notices my cheeks are hot he hugged me really ill tell jan who thought he was gorgeous but i suddenly remember that the jan i want to tell doesnt exist anymore i just stumble close to dad and hang onto his arm as dr peterson smiles and says ill see you in two weeks stacy just change the gauze pad on the incision each day and call me if you have any problems were met outside the front door of the clinic by a couple of reporters and cameramen for a moment i can only stare at them not now dad says he makes a shooing motion with the arm im not clinging to stacy has nothing to say to you now we make a dash for the car dad and i dont talk much on the way home i can tell that hes trying hard to think of just the right things to say and i am too so our wary words back off and circle each other we make tense but thats all you can say for our conversation i enter the front door of our house and walk past the living room back to the den for a few moments i stand with one hand braced against the top of dads reclining chair everything looks the same i wish it had changed i wish someone had painted the walls blue or bought a new chair or put flowered pillows on the sofa anything to make it different its just the way it was when mom was here only mom isnt here now and she wont be back i glance around the room wheres pansy oh dad says i guess i forgot to tell you pansy just well disappeared last year she was getting old she he gulps looking miserable and quickly adds the coopers have a cat thats going to have kittens soon maybe youd like one of her kittens we could ask people usually want to get rid of who are the coopers they live next door in the hadleys house the hadleys moved to dallas a little over a year ago youll like the coopers theyre a nice family three little girls i move to the window studying the backyard which is deep in the ragged color of spring the grass needs mowing and the althea bush is spewing limbs of lavender blossoms with abandon the pink and white geraniums have overgrown their bed and the confederate jasmine vine on the back fence waves loose tendrils in the breeze as though it were deranged in the large oak rests the funny little shack of boards with its open door and oddly shaped windows that donna and i so carefully hammered together with a little help from dad it had been my sanctuary my quiet place so many times in the past i suddenly want to climb the oak and curl up in the tree house now its been so long since ive been in the tree house i murmur to myself but dad is standing next to me and hears dont climb up there stacy it isnt safe now one of the supporting limbs broke off in a storm and the whole thing could come crashing down i should have taken it apart long ago but i just dont seem to have enough time i take his hand im sorry dad its not your fault honey he suddenly brightens ive been talking to donna and dennis and well how would you like it if we set a date for all of us to drive down to padre island for a weekend we know how much you always loved padre island remember we used to go every year i think it will be nice to have a family outing dont you the last thing i want to do is go to padre island it holds too many memories but dad is looking so uncomfortable so hopeful that i smile and say sure a worry wrinkle flickers on and off across his forehead as he asks me over and over again if im sure ill be all right im fine honest im okay i tell him lets go see those mug books the sooner the better it doesnt take long to get to riesner street and on the way i gawk out the car window like a tourist downtown houston is a collection of sharpedged shining new buildings which stretch high over their old ornate brick neighbors like a collection of slender giants and chunky munchkins much of what i see is new to me but the police station squats in a very old part of town and looks as though it had been there forever dad parks in the lot in front of the station i climb from the car and stand there staring at the building all sorts of people are bustling in and out of the front doors would you rather go home dad asks and i realize that im visibly trembling i just shake my head and clutching dads hand blindly follow him into the building and across the lobby with its olive green asphalttile floors there is a sudden crush of bodies as we enter the central room someone pushes against me the shoulder of his plaid shirt is damp and sour with sweat as it rubs against my cheek a woman who is bulging in her faded cotton dress follows the man swinging sharp elbows and talking all the while in rapid spanish she treads on my toes ouch i mutter and stare after her but shes unaware of anything but her own problem beyond her two men are talking a man in a business suit has his back to me and a tall lighthaired guy who is probably close to my age faces me for a second our eyes meet but a fat character in khakis puffing muttering and pushing between us follows his protruding stomach through the crowd an elderly woman and man come through one of the doors clinging to each other looking terrified are all these people here because theyre in some land of trouble this way dad says he leads me into the elevator and up to the second floor just down the hall is the homicide room and detective markowitzs office markowitz tugs a handkerchief from his pocket and wipes the sweat from his face air conditioner went out yesterday hot weather even for houston peek like midsummer already he gives me one of those searching looks and asks ready to get to work stacy im ready markowitz seats me at a table at one side of the room and places five huge scrapbooks in front of me dad sits at the table next to me take your time markowitz says look at each face carefully ill be working here in the room most of the time if you think you recognize the face in one of those photos just call me okay i tell him and open the first scrapbook at first im hopeful but by the time ive gone through the third book im discouraged when i finish the fifth i slam it shut with a groan markowitz comes to the table no luck his pictures not in those books maybe its there but you cant remember him dad stands up the legs of his chair screeching against the floor i think this is enough for now stacy needs to get some rest im not tired i insist but markowitz looks at dad and nods she might need a little more time he says lets put it on the shelf for a few days im going to remember i tell them im counting on it markowitz says but id like to wait and have you remember the face naturally instead of forcing your memory how do you mean forcing it he looks at dad again then back at me well for one thing ive given some thought to trying hypnosis thats a great idea i grab dads arm can you do it weve got some people in the department who are trained to hypnotize and there are a number of mds who can do it but theres a big problem and that is it doesnt always hold up in court but if i could remember he shakes his head id like to catch this guy and see that hes put away so carefully there wont be any technicalities for a sharp lawyer to use like a key to get him out understand i nod so ill get in touch with you next week he says and walks with us to the elevator were in the same squeeze of bodies as we leave the building im glad to get out of that place its good to be home again dad was right i am tired are you sure you dont mind staying alone dad asks of course i dont i lie so he leaves to go back to the bank where he works the aching loneliness of the house soon creeps around me clinging crawling trying to seep through my skin to the hollow inside of me i push myself out of the deep armchair and hurry to the backyard as i walk to the center of our backyard i take a deep breath of the mingled sourwarm geraniums honeyed jasmine and springsharp air remembering remembering and turn to face our house the screen door flies open and someone races through he pauses stares at me his pale eyes frightened and glittering and raises the gun no i shout backing away in terror he evaporates and the memory turns as blank as unexposed film i saw his eyes i whisper furious at myself for giving in to the fear that erased the face i was almost able to see i know i should walk that mile mrs montez insisted on but im reluctant to leave the house finally i find a book to read and settle back into the armchair deliberately forcing myself to concentrate on the book slowly i manage to relax and curl into a cocoon of sound spun by the hum of the air conditioner the sudden jangle of the telephone smashes the silence of the late afternoon i drop the book and jump from the chair staring at the phone wishing it would stop on the third ring i answer and sigh with relief and gratefully flop back into the chair as i hear jans voice stacy your dad said youd be home im so glad im glad too i answer and wonder what to say next it doesnt matter because jan says youre going to a party she doesnt give me time to answer but probably has guessed what my answer would have been because in one long breath she adds youve got to go so dont say no the partys being given in your honor besides its important for you to meet some of the kids jan im not ready to go to a party you are too you just dont know it but everyones different i mean theyre like you theyve grown four years older and hey stacy cut it out were friends remember i wouldnt make you go to this party if i didnt think it was right for you and it is its going to be friday night at tonys house you know tony and hes got this great house that is super for parties and everyone is going to be there not just the kids you remember all sorts of people will be there there always are at tonys parties i mean most of them are really neat but some oh well ill brief you on those and they wont bother you anyway all in all it will be a great party jan listen to me i cant go i havent got anything to wear jan sighs so elaborately i have to laugh that dramatic sigh hasnt changed everyone is wearing jeans you have jeans i know you have youre going i dont have a date you dont need a date its not a date party bj and i will pick you up at eight friday night she giggles that brings me to the best news of all jan listen to me that partys just the day after tomorrow im not ready hmmm jan murmurs thats partly true im going to come over early and fix your makeup well be there at seven so dont argue anymore you havent given me much chance to argue there you see its all settled and ive been talking long enough because youve got to come over to my house right away why she giggles again wait and see jan but shes no longer on the phone the partys a dumb idea i dont want to go who are these people now who used to be in the seventh grade with me what are they like will they think im just a stupid kid i walk into the bathroom and study my face in the mirror no im not a stupid kid who knows i say to the greeneyed girl who is staring back at me the party might be a lot of fun i grab my house keys and make sure the door is locked it doesnt take long to walk to jans house which is just a couple of blocks from ours but the air is humid and sticky and my shirt begins to cling to my back my finger is still on the doorbell when the door flies open and jan says stacy guess what she takes a long look at me and rolls her eyes thank goodness we have time time for what youll never believe this no one will believe it jeff clinton is coming over jan grabs my arm and pulls me inside and down the hallway come on jan make sense i manage to say whos jeff clinton hes a guy at school jan says and were talking real hunk he comes to some of the parties but he doesnt date he told bick once that theres a girlfriend in michigan where he came from and theyre sort of going steady which makes this whole thing absolutely amazing bj will die when she finds out finds out what jan glides into the den with one of her elaborate sighs pay attention stacy im telling you jeff clinton called me and said hed be going to the party and hed like to meet you and one thing led to another and i said how about today and hes coming over in a few minutes so lets get some makeup on you jan you fixed up a date for me its not really a date well just get acquainted and talk and drink some cola and you and jeff can get acquainted wait a minute i back away from her why did he want to meet me jans eyes open wider i dont know maybe he saw your picture in the paper and thought you were cute thats not a good reason honestly stacy thats as good a reason as any she studies me her head tilted to one side whats the matter you look so i dont know suspicious and thats silly there will be lots of guys who will want to get to know you but i want to know why her mouth makes a large pink o i get it it has to do with the guy you saw on your back porch the one who i interrupt jan i still cant see his face he wouldnt be jeff i told you jeff just moved here from michigan last year and anyway you cant go around being suspicious of everybody i lean against the wall and sigh youre right i guess i sound like some kind of nerd its just that jan is looking at me with so much concern that i change the subject when hes here jeff i mean what am i supposed to do i dont know what to say to him oh you will she tugs at my arm dragging me into the bathroom arent you using the makeup kit i gave you i shrug sometimes youre supposed to use it stacy look at you naked faces are not in in what i ask trying to be funny but jan doesnt appreciate my humor shes too busy doing things to my face the doorbell rings and she hisses heres the lipstick quick you answer the door i tell her ill put it on not much she says as she runs from the room just enough to count i stare at my reflection in the mirror startled again by the girl who looks back i like what jan did theres a kind of peach color over my eyelids with a brown eyeliner it makes my eyes look bigger i fumble for the lipstick and put on just a little following jans directions taking a deep breath i give one last glance at the mirror and head for the den where i can hear jan chattering as i enter the room a tall sandyhaired guy pulls himself up from jans fathers reclining chair and faces me his pale blue eyes crinkle at the edges as he smiles at me i cant help smiling back hes wearing snug jeans and sneakers without socks and a white tshirt and a light kind of unbuttoned jacket with the sleeves pushed up to his elbows it looks strange its probably another new style he must work out a lot i wonder if hes on the football team his shoulders are broad and even the jacket doesnt hide the muscles in his arms jan introduces us and says sit down stacy ill get something for us to drink suddenly im shy i clasp my hands together and stare at them wishing i knew what to talk about to a guy have you thought yet about going back to school jeff asks will they let you make up some of the classes in summer school im so thankful that he didnt ask me about mom or the murderer that i stumble all over myself answering his question dad and i were talking about that i dont know what theyll want me to do i do know one thing i cant go back to junior high school id be so much older than everyone else i stop for breath what id like to do is study the things ive missed i could study hard and make up some of the work if theyll just let me jeff smiles its hard to study alone maybe some of the kids could help tutor you and get you ready for exams if you could pass exams they might give you credit for the courses thats a great idea ill volunteer to be a tutor im pretty good in math really youll help me learn the math ive missed maybe its excitement maybe its the way hes leaning forward just a bit looking at me as though i were the most interesting person hes ever seen i feel myself blushing jan comes into the room balancing a tray with three glasses of cola and a plate of chocolate marshmallow cookies she remembered theyre my favorite jan looks at my red face and one eyebrow rises and falls but jeff starts talking about how much he likes math and how he once tried building a computer and it gives me a chance to calm down afternoon sunlight tilts through the window next to him highlighting his face i study it liking it for some reason jeff seems much older to me i cant explain it maybe its something i see in his eyes he seems more knowledgeable more aware than kids his age should be strangely i have the feeling that ive seen him before it cant be but theres something familiar something i should remember i dont know what it could be the conversation has shifted to the party i dont know most of the people jan is rattling on about and jeff begins to look kind of bored he stands up and smiles at me id better go stacy if youll check into the books youll need for algebra and geometry and get an okay from one of the counselors well start on the tutoring anytime you say i can come over to your house every afternoon and work with you both of jans eyebrows go up this time but i dont think jeff notices hes looking at me jan dashes into the kitchen so i walk to the front door with jeff i appreciate it jeff i really do he smiles again see you at the party he says and walks to his car its a plain vanilla gray sedan and looks like the cars i remember so its probably four or five years old stacy jan hisses and i realize im still standing in the open doorway watching jeff so i close the door and hurry back to the den he likes you jan shouts its obvious instant infatuation bj will go out of her mind he just offered to tutor me in math i tell her math is as good an excuse for seeing somebody as any other excuse jan says shes so pleased with herself that she practically purrs the clock in her den chimes five times i automatically count along with it id better go home i tell her say hi to your parents for me mom will be disappointed that she missed you she didnt know youd be here she keeps asking me how soon youll be able to come over for dinner as soon as possible your mom is a great cook jan opens the front door and calls to me when i reach the sidewalk ill see you tomorrow this is going to be some party when i get home i poke through the refrigerator i never really learned to cook oh well i can make grilled cheese sandwiches for dinner donna and dennis come over and donna says next time i have to go back to the police station shell go with me since dad doesnt think he can take any more time off his daytime job and donna has only one class and can skip it thats when i find out that dad has been holding down two jobs so he can pay all my medical bills i hate the guy who murdered mom even more i wish so hard i could see his face how do i explain to dad or to detective markowitz about my weird feeling that if i dont discover the identity of the murderer pretty soon i may run out of time chapter seven earlymorning mists from the gulf slither inland mingling with the pollution from the northeast factories and refineries giving us a day thats gray and grimy with smog donna arrives waddling smugly she puts a covered bowl into the refrigerator the baby kicked all night she complains but she looks delighted she studies the green cotton shirt and jeans im wearing were going to foleys this morning you have to get some clothes that fit you stacy when do you want to go as soon as the store opens later all the way to foleys memorial store she chats about the kinds of clothes ill need jeans and shirts i feel comfortable with those but she gets me a couple of dresses and theyre weird i wouldnt buy you a weird dress donna is firm you just dont know anything about the styles for your age yet trust me youre being bossy i tell her as she pulls out dads charge card youre trying to act like mom but mom wasnt bossy im trying to help you donna looks at me the way she used to when id yell at her that it wasnt fair she always beat me at monopoly i take a deep breath im sorry i didnt mean it i really dont care about the dresses what to wear is just one more stupid thing to have to get used to and right now it seems unimportant donna buys some bras panties and a slip she decides that ive got everything ill need for a while so she drives me home i dump my packages on the sofa in the living room ill hang them up for you she says i can do that myself better do it now so the dresses wont get wrinkled i promised dennis id call him before i started home as she heads toward the kitchen phone i scoop up my packages take them to my room and drop them on the bed a persistent patpat on the window greets me its a loose branch of a scraggly climbing queen elizabeth rose i open the window soaking in the pungentsweet smells of the garden the sounds of a dog barking down the street and the laughter of the children in the yard next door the cooper children they dont see me so i watch them play the two younger girls are playing tag the older girl donna said she was twelve leans against the solid trunk of their old elm tree laughing at her sisters yelling encouragement to the little one whos trying so hard to catch her sister theyre lookalikes with round freckled faces and light brown hair for an instant i ache to join them the twelveyearold she looks almost thirteen would be close to my age she might like to be friends and but im no longer thirteen i turn and see myself in the fulllength mirror that hangs on the door im seventeen in a world i dont want that im not ready for i bang my fists against the wall you with the gun whoever you are i hate you i hate you stacy i hurry back to the front hallway to join donna whos fishing in her handbag for her car keys she has to go and i have to let her i fight the fear i know will come with the lonely house are you sure youll be all right by yourself she asks as she studies my face i take her by the shoulders and laugh trying to sound braver than i feel im a big girl now remember she smiles and hugs me as she presses against me the baby moves so i feel it too i want to keep holding her so that i can feel the baby again sharing it with her but donna steps back and says if you need me just call oh theres a chicken pasta salad in the refrigerator thanks for everything donna thanks for shopping for me if you decide you really dont like the dresses theyre great i say go on youve got things to do the longer she stays the harder it will be to let her leave the blue one is especially i love it get going i throw open the front door and shriek at the face thats staring bugeyed into mine oh dear the woman on our front porch says she brushes back the brown bangs that hang over her eyes and pushes her oversize glasses up on her nose i didnt mean to startle you i saw you come home a few minutes ago and i was just going to ring the bell donna steps up beside me and holds out a hand mrs cooper you must come in and meet stacy she turns to me remember stacy i told you that mrs cooper and her family live next door we say all the right things to each other as donna moves us into the living room i cant stay mrs cooper says i just wanted to greet stacy and tell her the entire neighborhood is glad shes back and feeling good again thank you i say oh i know we werent here before but were so fond of your family and that includes you too thanks and i am planning to send over a casserole or something its just that ive been so busy with the little girls and you do understand i know its just pta and the church society and dental appointments and one blessed thing after another you certainly are a pretty girl thank you so much like donna yes thanks she hardly pauses for breath i was wondering if youd babysit my girls this evening one of my husbands clients invited us out to dinner at the last minute wouldnt you know and wed need you for just a short time could you make it seven oclock we promise to be home by ten so you wont get too tired donna holds up a hand but stacy is i interrupt her i dont want to tell donna that im still feeling jittery about being alone in the house id just as soon donna didnt know ill be glad to babysit i tell mrs cooper i dont have anything i have to do tonight sure ill be there maybe we should ask dad donna says mrs cooper manages to look both puzzled and horribly disappointed at the same time but its just right next door she says and the girls are all well behaved dad will be at work anyway i tell donna and i smile reassuringly at mrs cooper see you at seven mission accomplished shes off and away and donna leaves after one more reassuring hug i start puttering around in the kitchen reading cookbooks as though they were messages from a secret power and i were a decoder with the cia why didnt i ever learn to cook anything besides fudge i peek inside the bowl of chicken pasta salad that donna made whats a pasta salad it sounds terrible to my surprise i find a recipe for a casserole that seems to match up with the carrots and onions and ground beef i pull out of the refrigerator thats such a good start i tackle the puttingtogether part with real enthusiasm after its been in the oven awhile it starts to bubble and actually smells good im really proud of myself i carry the little tv set to the kitchen and listen while im setting the table its the local news and the newscasters talk about a rapid transit system and things i dont know anything about then i hear my name and look up to see that scene outside the clinic did i really feel as scared as i look yes i guess so but theyre off now on a story about a convenience store shooting a couple of times i glance at the telephone i wish it would ring i wish it would be jeff but the telephone is silent dad comes home kisses me and says i think ill just settle down with the newspaper for a few minutes before dinners ready i make a lettuce salad but according to the timer we have fifteen minutes to wait for the casserole so i join dad in the den hes asleep in his chair the newspaper spilling from his lap carefully i pick up the classified section it gives me an idea as i turn the pages they rustle dads eyelids flicker then open he smiles at me guess i had a little nap he sits up stretches then notices what ive been reading before he can say a word i speak up i want to get a job stacy we talked about your catching up on your schoolwork i can do both ill study hard dad i know how much work ive got to make up but theres no reason i cant get a job too i want to help it will be too much for you we wont discuss it we have to discuss it he sighs stacy im afraid you got your stubbornness from my side of the family but maybe thats good because i can be as stubborn as you can dad smiles and i know hes trying to ease things between us as he says i remember once when we met headon about whether or not you were old enough at twelve to go on a date and your mother said the two of us were like that pair of rams in the disney movie banging their heads to the tune of the anvil chorus you won that argument i say im going to win this one too i just want to help you work at the bank in the daytime and do bookkeeping at night and its too much we wont discuss it you already said that you make me so mad daddy all i want to do is talk to you he sits up and leans toward me the lamplight in the room casts shadows that deepen the hollows under his eyes honey i want to talk to you too he says i want to talk to you about your mother my shoulders are stiff and theres a tight place at the back of my neck that begins to throb theres nothing to talk about yes there is im worried about you because you havent mourned her yes i have i think youre holding your feelings in afraid to let go and face what happened thats not good stacy i cant tell him about my feelings how can i explain about the burning fingers of hatred that claw at my mind the oven tinier buzzes so i scramble to my feet dinners ready he studies me for a moment then says okay stacy just remember when youre ready to talk im ready to listen there isnt anything i want to say now theres too much to think about to wonder about my feelings that will come later dad praises me over and over for the wonderful casserole i think it tastes a little flat but he has second helpings so i suppose he really likes it i tell him im going to babysit the cooper kids he starts to frown but changes it to a smile and says its all right maybe hes got a limit of one argument going at a time maybe he thinks hell have his say about the big things and let the little things go by who knows what parents think after the dishes are finished and dad has left i make sure ive got detective markowitzs card in my pocket i leave the lights on in the den lock the house carefully and cross the lawn to the cooper house mrs cooper opens the door she reminds me of one of those dust devils that whirl across the open lands in texas as she darts and swoops into the den introducing me to keri meri teri and mr cooper she points out the emergency numbers in the kitchen and the phone number where they can be reached then she disappears for a moment into a closet emerges with a handbag bobs over her daughters with a good night kiss and is out the door carrying her balding and bemused husband with her the girls stare at me help me get your names straight i tell them knowing that it had to be their mother who had named them think of it as alphabetical the oldest one says k before m and w before t im keri im twelve teri who looks as though she were about six pipes up mom said youre the sleeping beauty are you the real sleeping beauty no i say thats just a makebelieve story i glance around the room it doesnt look a thing like it did when the hadleys lived here everything is flowered chintz with red poppies and ruffles a big bouquet of matching artificial flowers is on an end table and dozens of photographs of the girls are on the wall over the sofa the wall has been paneled in a light birch wood how can this house look so different when our house looks so much the same on the floor nearly covering a round scatter rug are barbie dolls dresses houses cars the whole works i wonder where daddy put my barbie dolls maybe theyre packed away youve got a lot of clothes for your dolls i tell the girls do you care if i look at them wanna play men asks i shrug why not we sit near the edges of the rug and in a few minutes im putting a red net ball gown on one of the dolls and keris doll is driving over to visit mine three movie stars are going to be at the dance keris doll says who cares about movie stars my doll says have you heard the duke of york is going to be there and im going to sing with the band meris doll says im a famous singer you sing like a frog keri says and we all giggle the game goes on until ten steps in the middle of the rug and stamps her foot nobody listens to me i tried to tell you what i saw upstairs you were upstairs im startled and worried because i didnt realize she had left the game i told you i was going to the bathroom im sorry ten sit down our dolls are going to the beach do you want the purple bathing suit for your doll no if youre not going to listen to me then i wont tell you i put out my arms to her and pull her down on my lap hey im sorry ill listen what do you want to tell us about somebody whos in your yard i looked out the window upstairs and i saw somebody trying to look in your windows we all jump up men screeches and i shush her we dont want him to hear us well have to be quiet but we race upstairs ahead of teri whos now filled with her own importance she joins us in the dark room and leads the way to the wide bedroom window that overlooks our house and yard look she whispers i lean over the heads of the three girls straining to differentiate between the shapes and shadows one shape moves and i see it step back from the side of our house where it has apparently been trying to see into my bedroom window in an instant it has slid through the darkness and disappeared around the back of the house keri clutches my arm and i feel her tremble as she whispers hes in your backyard stacy what if he gets inside your house chapter eight i step back from the window pulling the children with me and try to sound calm well call the police theyll take care of it i want my daddy meri is so terrified that teri puckers up and begins to wail that sets meri off and it takes me a few minutes to quiet them down so that i can make the telephone call to detective markowitz the woman who answers my call tells me that detective markowitz is not there but shell get in touch with him so i explain why im calling she says that shell send a squad car out to investigate then try to reach markowitz the cooper children and i huddle together in the living room where we can press our noses against the picture window and watch for the police car to arrive maybe one of us should stay at the upstairs window and watch for the shadow to appear again but were all too frightened we want to stick together lets call mama teri says her lower lip wobbles and i hug her tightly in a few minutes i tell her it will be safer if the police check things out before your mother and daddy get home they said theyd be home by ten keri answers and its almost ten you were supposed to put us to bed at our bedtime meri accuses mamas going to be mad at you so you want to go to bed right now i ask her she shakes her head vigorously i want mama teri whimpers maybe i expected sirens and screeching tires something like what ive seen in police movies but a police car comes quietly down the street and parks in front of the cooper house two policemen climb out one stays in the yard studying our house next door and one comes to the cooper front door i nearly trip over teri who dashes under my feet as i run to open the door but i manage to hang on to her and tell the officer what happened teri keeps interrupting shouting i saw him first just stay put and keep the door locked the officer says well look around he shuts the door firmly we rush to the large window again and see him and his partner walk toward our house flashlights sweeping a crisscross pattern of light ahead of them in a few seconds they are out of sight lets go upstairs and watch out the bedroom window keri says she tries to squeeze past me but i grab her arm not were safer here the policeman told us just to stay put remember theres a little brass clock on the mantel and it chimes ten times its not just the coopers who are due home at ten dad told me that he usually gets home a little after ten oclock too i dont want them to come now not with whoever it was prowling around our house what if someone gets hurt the telephones ring is so shrill that we all jump and meri screams its just the phone i say but they cling to me and shove against me as i hurry to answer it were like a pack of puppies humping and pushing against each other just after the third ring i manage to grab the receiver before keri can snatch it whats up markowitz asks me where are you i fill him in and he says hell be right over tell the officers to stay until i get there he adds the sound of his voice is like a pat on the back an arm around my shoulders everythings going to be all right i tell the girls lets go back to the window as we reach the front window and settle against the glass one of the officers appears cutting across the lawn he comes to the front porch and rings the bell just as the coopers car pulls into the driveway ohoh keri says ohoh is right as i open the door mrs cooper flies across the lawn screeching what happened to my children its all right maam the officer says and at the same time teri shouts her story at the top of her lungs meri rushes into her mothers arms crying loudly and keri yells that theres a prowler outside and everybody should get in the house and lock the door the perpetually puzzled mr cooper appears and dad who has also just come home and the other officer join the scene lets all be quiet dad says in a loud firm voice as he checks out everyone in the group so we can find out whats going on apparently mrs cooper has been counting noses too and is satisfied with the tally so shes ready to listen miraculously she is able to quiet her children by firmly saying hush i wonder if theres an unspoken or else behind it one of the officers explains about my call but we couldnt find anyone in your yard he adds to my father the windows all seemed to be locked and both the front and back doors were secured the other officer speaks up could be your daughter is a little nervous cant blame her and people sometimes think they see things in the dark things that arent really there you know shadows and tree branches moving in the wind stuff like that but we all saw him keri says i saw him first ten shouts it was a him mrs cooper asks teri a boy a man teri thinks for a moment maybe it was a monster theres a pause during which the adults all look at each other then the first police officer says theres no one there now in the tone of voice that implies he doubts there ever was he turns to mrs cooper we checked your yard out too maam just to be sure thank you she says takes a deep breath and immediately begins to order her children inside ask if theyve brushed their teeth why they arent in thenpajamas and have they completely forgotten the rule about picking up their toys before they go to bed i just quietly shut the door and leave with dad and the policemen mrs cooper didnt remember to pay me but it doesnt matter i wasnt a very good babysitter and im not going to babysit again not until the murderer is found and hes in prison i dont know what happened tonight if anything but if im in any danger i dont want to involve anyone else markowitz arrives and talks to the policemen they leave and he checks out the yard himself with a highpowered flashlight he bends and stoops and examines the ground under each of the windows as dad and i follow along behind him if wed had some rain we might have been able to get a footprint markowitz finally says snapping off his light and tucking one end of it into the pocket of his jacket he thinks for a moment then looks carefully at me stacy i think it was a false alarm we saw someone male or female i dont know i couldnt tell why it was too dark it was just a shadow he shakes his head and says thats what i mean it is dark tonight too dark to know what you saw im inclined to think it was too much imagination dad puts an arm around my shoulders and lets out a sigh i thought so but im glad to hear you say it would you like a cup of coffee mr markowitz no thanks markowitz says this was a long day im beat he walks with us to the front door want me to check inside do you think you should dad asks nope your house was locked up tight we would have found signs of forced entry if anyone had tried to get inside markowitz smiles at me take care stacy ill be in touch with you soon dad seems satisfied and so does markowitz but im not what if i begin then dont know how to say what im thinking without getting dad all upset but markowitz knows and he answers nothings going to happen to you stacy well watch out for you youre our star witness is that all he cares about that i might be able to testify against whoever killed my mother maybe thats all that would matter to me too if my job were trying to catch criminals hes smiling but i dont trust his smile because i dont believe everything is as simple as he makes it out to be i know that i saw someone prowling around our house tonight and nothing markowitz or the other officers have said is going to make me change my mind i dont sleep well in spite of the air conditioning the air is sticky and clammy and the sheets are a tangle around my legs i doze and wake alert to every little pop and creak of the house somewhere nearby the sharp trill of a mockingbird shatters the dark and my eyes fly open what is it what every time i close my eyes i see the screen door open the hand raise the gun the face i cant see the face i know im trying too hard but ive got to be able to see it at breakfast the next morning i tell dad im going to make an appointment to talk to the counselor at glen creek high school and i tell him about the party tonight dad looks uncomfortable when donna was your age your mother took care of those things he says i cant remember all the questions im supposed to ask he thinks for a moment then brightens who will you be going to the party with jan and bj i know jan but whos this guy bj dad bj is a girl you met her a long time ago and its not the kind of party where you have to come with a date will this party be supervised i dont know well do you know where it will be tony macondas house do you know him sure ive known him since kindergarten his family used to live just a couple of blocks from us and then his father got to be vicepresident or something in the oil company he worked for and they moved to one of those big houses near the bayou theres something else i should remember about tony something nagging my mind but for now i cant think of it i do remember that he got caught shoplifting once and there was one day when he bragged he had marijuana in his locker only that time he didnt get caught i used to think tony was a creep but then i thought bick was too jan says hes wonderful people change a lot in i tell dad tonys and plump and i lean back in my chair oh dad i dont know what he looks like now okay stacy i know who you mean ive met tonys parents they seem like reasonable people he stares at the table and i know hes trying to think up the other questions hes supposed to ask but im tired of this i hadnt wanted to go to the party but now its become a challenge theres no reason why dad shouldnt let me go with jan at seventeen i should be old enough to make up my own mind about going to a party its just that youre not quite used to the world as it is now he says theres a problem with drugs and daddy i interrupt kids were taking drugs when i was thirteen and you dont have to worry about me im not dumb enough to take drugs he reaches across the table and takes my hands stacy i wasnt intimating that youd take drugs i was oh honey i want to protect you and i dont know how to do it i squeeze his fingers and smile at him daddy youre doing a good job of protecting me just dont overdo it ive got to be allowed to grow up he nods and tries to smile back well youll be with jan shes a good girl and i know where youll be what time are you leaving for the party jans going to be here at seven to help me get ready he looks puzzled do you need something special to wear no dad its informal ill wear my jeans jans going to help me with my makeup i feel so lost he says i wish your mother were here i fight back the hot pressure behind my eyes answering i wish she were here too and adding quickly but youre doing a great job dad and jan will be glad to see you he carries his coffee cup and empty cereal bowl to the sink not tonight im afraid i almost forgot to tell you ill get a hamburger for dinner because weve got to go over some reports that came in from one of the branches its going to mean that ill be there later than usual maybe until eleven or even midnight i may get home before you do i tell him he bends down to kiss my forehead have a good time at the party stacy thanks i answer wishing i didnt have to go in the afternoon a delivery truck comes with an exercise bicycle the moment the deliveryman leaves the telephone rings is everything all right stacy its mrs coopers voice yes everythings fine well you know how it is in a neighborhood everyone checking on everyone else and i saw a delivery truck so i thought she interrupts herself to tell me about some friends who had a delivery truck parked in their driveway and none of their neighbors thought a thing about it except it really wasnt a delivery truck and most of their furniture was stolen this one was a real delivery truck and it brought my exercise bicycle i tell her i guess im just being too careful she says but one thing and another like that excitement last night and that same car that seems to be cruising this street although my husband says im just looking for trouble and what car i have to interrupt i dont know she says just a car next time i see it im going to write down the license number how often have you seen the car oh three or four times what kind of car is it goodness i have no idea what color is it plain you know brown blue yes something like that nothing special theres no point in asking her any more questions besides the car she saw is probably no more a threat than the delivery truck that brought my bicycle one more thing mrs cooper continues by telling me shes sorry she forgot to tell me about the girls bedtime and shes sorry we all got so excited she forgot to tell me that teri has an overactive imagination and she apologizes for forgetting to pay me for babysitting if i come over tonight or tomorrow shell have the money for me by the time we end our conversation i feel like gasping for breath i climb on the bicycle and follow all of mrs montezs instructions working up a real sweat next comes a steamy hot shower i feel good really good as i turn off the shower i hear the telephone ringing wrapping the towel around myself i run to answer it how long has it been ringing whoever is calling must know that im home maybe its donna or dad hi i gasp into the receiver a whispering voice hisses what do you remember stacy who are you the whisper is weird but im too shocked to be frightened its been a long time the voice says why dont you just forget it would be safer for you to forget i hear my own voice as though id stepped outside my body and were looking and listening to someone else i expect to be afraid but im not its as though i were made of glass with a red churning anger bubbling up inside me words drop like chunks of molten glass as i ask are you the one who killed my mother the whisperer doesnt answer for a while so i ask again are you the voice over the telephone is softer now i heard that you dont remember my face but i will i say then ill have to do something about it not if i find you first theres a pause then a chuckle it sounds almost as though he were talking to himself this guy is weird i cant make out the first few words but i hear him say have a friend i interrupt what are you talking about what friend you havent got a chance stacy he whispers theres a click as the line goes dead slowly i put down the receiver i didnt know that hate could be this strong he has torn up my life hes destroyed four yean that belonged to me and most horrible of all hes taken my mother away from us i shiver as i realize i actually hate him enough to loll him chapter nine the lateafternoon sun is rapidly being swallowed by dusky shadows so i hurry through the room fumbling with trembling fingers turning on a couple of lamps the light helps and the movement brings everything back to normal i think about the person who made that telephone call why did he laugh and talk to himself he might have been high on something some weird character who was playing games our telephone numbers in the phone book easy for anyone to find and there are a lot of crazy people who might think a call like that was funny no im sure he wasnt the murderer the murderer wouldnt call me of course he wouldnt the doorbell rings hesitating long enough to take a deep breath i open the door jan stands there beaming at me here we are right on time and ready to make you gorgeous jan announces she steps into the entry hall bj behind her jan looks super but i stare at bj and wish i could go to the party with a paper bag over my head nobody should razzledazzle her good looks like bj its unfair to the rest of us who have to live in the same world my expression must show what im thinking because the corners of bjs mouth turn up and she gleams at me stacy you have great possibilities with a little makeup and a new hairdo well work wonders you should have seen her in the clinic after i did her makeup jan says quickly she holds up an overnight case ive got everything here even hot rollers and scissors and well choose something for you to wear bj adds oh isnt this fun i take a step backward bumping into the wall wait a minute you said to wear jeans im wearing jeans they both examine me slowly from head to toe theyre new jeans bj says besides theyre a little baggy you havent shrunk them yet have you well no i mean why should i shrink them theyd be too tight weve got time to shrink them take them off jan giggles stacy you arent going to wear that flowered cotton shirt i like this shirt jan puts down her case and opens it triumphantly she pulls out a bright red tshirt with short sleeves and a vneck i brought you a present she says handing it to me with your dark hair youll look super in red i try to step back again but theres nowhere to go look i say why cant i just go like i am bj tucks her chin down and stares at me with determination because you have something to live up to stacy youre the sleeping beauty coming back to the world and you have to make an impact on it dont call me that i plead jan grabs my hand and pulls me toward my bedroom we dont have much time lets stop all this talk and get to world theyve got a goal and im it i cant fight the two of them so i give up and follow orders getting into a robe as bj marches to the laundry room with my jeans and jan lays out an array of bottles and jars and cans on the bathroom ledge she shampoos my hair and plops me into a chair that b j has brought from the kitchen im facing away from the mirror over the sink but thats all right because im nervous about what ill finally see i just hope jan knows what shes doing chunks of my hair fall into my lap and i squeeze my eyes shut i may need that paper bag after all she squirts a handful of some kind of foam into her hands and rubs it all through my hair then come the hot rollers so far so good jan says with satisfaction and bj nods approval now for her face bj says and reaches for a bottle they seem to take turns patting and smoothing things over my skin finally i say isnt that enough this seems like an awful lot of trouble keep quiet bj says she picks up a blue pencil if you talk we might make a mistake but youre going to be our masterpiece jan says and she giggles with excitement wait till you see yourself stacy i can wait believe me i can wait wait till everybody sees you wait till jeff clinton sees you i heard the big exciting news about you and jeff bj says from the expression on her face i guess the excitement must have passed her by its no big deal about jeff i tell them he just offered to help me learn math thats all stop talking jan says im getting to your mouth they make enthusiastic comments to each other which i try to ignore finally they step back and grin at me dont look yet jan says she takes out the rollers pulls me from the chair and leads me out of the bathroom back into the bedroom put on your tshirt before i comb your hair so your hair wont get all messed up but where are my jeans here they are bj comes into the room holding them out before her theyre still a little bit warm but theyre dry now it takes the three of us to get me into the jeans i have to lie on the bed and wiggle and grunt and hold my breath until the zipper is up i told you they wouldnt fit me i complain but jan says of course they fit you they look just right now pretty soon youll learn how to put them on by yourself you have to wiggle in just the right way to make it easy youll get the hang of it bj says and she helps me sit up stiffly i swing my legs over the edge of the bed my knees can actually bend good she says now dont move until we finish your hair as jan brushes my hair i sneak a quick glance at the dock by my bed its already eight oclock were going to be late of course we are nobodys ever on time jan says if we get there at eight theyd think we were nerds bj sighs stacy youve got so much to learn jan steps back what do you think bj studies my hair then pokes gently in one spot with the end of the comb perfect she says and reaches for the hair spray i squeeze my eyes shut as the spray hits my hair but jan cries dont ever do that stacy it does terrible things to eye shadow bj takes one of my hands jan the other come look at yourself bj says the sleeping beauty emerges dont call me that but jan interrupts not the sleeping beauty my fair lady thats it stacy is like eliza doolittle no im me by this time im in the bathroom they push me in front of the large mirror over the basin and stand on either side of me well look jan says my hair is shaped so that the front strands barely reach my shoulders and its full and wavy and soft a few tendrils escape over my cheeks and forehead i reach up automatically to push them back but jan grabs my hand its supposed to be that way she says the shadows under my eyes are gone theyre under my cheekbones now highlighting them my eyes seem brighter my lips softer jan was right about the red tshirt red is my color in the tshirt and jeans im snug and straight and so rounded in all the right places that i blush and hunch my shoulders forward a little bj still shines in her own orbit but now i have nothing to complain about i wont need that paper bag after all i laugh is that really me stand up straight jan says and pokes me between my shoulder blades hard enough to make me jerk my shoulders back but i my voice drops to a whisper im so i mean on top i my face grows even warmer you look just the way youre supposed to jan says she studies me in the mirror dont you like what weve done i have to admit it i do i really do i give jan a quick hug and turn to bj but she steps back quickly dont do that she says only grandmothers hug the telephone rings forgetful of everything except the girl in the mirror the new stacy i run to answer its the same voice i heard earlier the same whisper where are you stacy it says the partys started were waiting for you this time i slam down the receiver im not going to talk to this jerk im not going to give him the satisfaction of knowing that hes really getting to me im scared at the sound of that horrible whisper it isnt funny i turn around to see bj and jan watching me is something wrong stacy jan asks somebody i know has a warped sense of humor i answer he thinks hes being runny by trying to scare me what did he say jan asks i shrug nothing much just whispering about will i be at the party real dumb stuff secondgrade humor bj and jan look at each other mort jan asks he thinks hes so humorous and he isnt at all remember when he pretended to throw up in mrs wettidnss wastepaper basket in front of the whole class disgusting bj says but i dont think he was invited to this party at least i hope not buddy likes to play practical jokes i doubt if its buddy it wasnt nice to do to stacy jan says and when we find out who it was well totally ignore him each name pops a face into my mind but i see seventhgrade boys full of mischief loud belches and tide glances with snickers some of them were okay i guess but a few were spoiled mean that was the time of the big oil boom in which some families in houston bought bigger houses and guard dogs and handguns and let their fat wallets spill out all over their kids who grabbed for what they could get and more bj picks up her handbag lets go she says their conversation has made me feel better even though i dont know who they were talking about so i grab my handbag and follow them to bjs car making sure a light in the den is left on and the front door is locked youll have to learn to drive stacy bj says you cant get around houston without a car theres a bus to school isnt there jan and bj give me one of those wideeyed looks were talking about after school weekends doing things bj says oh no i said the wrong thing again embarrassed i slump against the car seat sit up stacy jan exclaims there are a couple of other things youve got to get used to we giggle all the way to the party the onestory maconda house sprawls across an oversize treeshaded lot that backs onto buffalo bayou tony opens the ornately carved front door and ushers us into a huge entry hall part of my mind takes in the marble and gold and mirrored glass so that i remember it later but for the moment i concentrate on tony the chubby little boy i knew in seventh grade has changed into someone who is tall with broad shoulders and is very goodlooking he grins at me so appreciatively that i blush hello sleeping beauty he says you were worth waiting for he steps toward me but bj takes his arm tosses her handbag on a nearby chair and leads us toward the den come on she tells him weve got to let everybody else meet stacy i follow her into a large woodpaneled den stacys here she announces loudly people crowd around me even a woman dressed in a maids uniform peeks out from the door to the kitchen im overwhelmed by the races the voices the curious stares the giggles the questions what was it like being asleep for so long how does it feel to be a sleeping beauty did you have amnesia stacy do you remember being shot i feel as if i were in a nightmare the faces are all familiar yet theyre all different everyone has changed i try to match these faces to the faces i remember and it makes my head hurt suddenly its more than i can stand i dont want to talk about it jeff has elbowed his way through the group and he takes my hand she means she cant talk he says what do you mean cant talk a girl named debbie asks you make it sound mysterious cmon debbie jeff says youve seen police shows on tv you know that nobodys allowed to talk about a caw until it goes to trial oh debbie shrugs and looks at me as though id suddenly gained a new importance a small darkhaired girl in a maids uniform whos carrying a bowl of snack mix pauses for just an instant to stare at me i hate being a curiosity i just want to be myself i glance around the room so many faces some of them are drifting into groups some of them are still staring at me one of the people in this house must be the one who called me trying to frighten me how can i look past all those smiles to find out who it was do you know many of the people here jeff asks no i answer but a stocky guy steps forward he has brown hair and hazel eyes so light they gleam yellow hes wearing a linen jacket with the sleeves shoved up its almost a twin to jeffs jacket for just an instant he glances at jeff and i imagine that i feel jeffs fingers tense i glance at jeff too but hes standing easily smile in place the stocky guy is staring at me dont you remember me stacy he asks and grins no i shake my head he laughs four years make a difference im jarrod tucker i didnt know jarrod tucker well he was a few years ahead of me in school he lived down the street from jan so i saw him around his house once in a while mostly we ignored each other jan didnt like him she said jarrod was spoiled rotten and bragged that he always got his own way about everything hes probably changed too look at bick four yean ago jan and i thought bick was sickening yet across the room shes hanging on his shoulder and looking into his eyes as though he were the most fascinating thing in her life i remember you lived down the street from jan still do he says but youre a lot older i mean this party youre not he laughs again at my embarrassment youre trying to ask why im at the party since im older than everyone here look around not everyone some of the people who were in high school with me are here too im sorry i didnt mean tony and i are good friends jarrod adds you might say im a fixture at most of his parties tony calls out who changed the radio station all were getting is commercials he heads toward the builtin equipment across the room jarrod follows him a frecklefaced girl edges toward me what was it like being out of your head all that time i mean did you dream or what she looks as spacey as her question no more questions jeff says he murmurs to me lets get you away from the inquisition and leads me toward a small library you need a chance to sit down and relax i look around the room i like this so do i and were lucky no one else has discovered it yet so we get a chance to talk i sit on the wide sofa thats in front of a wall of bookshelves and he sits next to me twisting so that he faces me i get the peculiar feeling that hes trying to memorize my face your friends are glad to see you again he says are they i feel like something on exhibit no its not like that your story is new and different and theyre excited about it but i dont want to be different i want to go back to school and just be me it will all settle down soon youll probably get more questions but just hang on he smiles i ought to go home i feel like i used to when i was a little kid looking on at my big sisters party i dont belong here its hard to grow up all of a sudden how do you know that i can put myself in your shoes i can imagine nobody else has tried to do that i tell him maybe they just havent told you i shrug i dont think so youre youre different im furious at myself as i feel my cheeks becoming hot and red im sorry i mean darn i sound like a kid i say all the wrong things he laughs as he stands and holds out his hands to me youll learn in a hurry come on lets get back to the party im reluctant to join the others jeff pulls me to my feet but i hesitate maybe im trying to stall i find myself saying i know most of the people in there but i dont know you tell me about yourself there isnt much to tell when did you move to houston around a year ago where did you live before that michigan come on im hungry arent you somebody said there was going to be pizza did i know you before jeff i thought you didnt like a lot of questions its just that i get the feeling that weve met somewhere where could we have met stacy i dont know he heads for the den pulling me with him maybe im just the man of your dreams lets check on that pizza but as we reach the crowd in the den jeff and i are separated and i see him near the kitchen talking to bj jarrod pulls me off to one side and pushes a styrofoam cup at me youve got to be thirsty by this time heres something to drink i can smell it making a face i hand it back to him no way thats got liquor in it he leans close to murmur in my left ear it tickles come on stacy youre not a kid anymore this will help you loosen up you want to have some fun dont you forget it okay one soft drink coming up he squirms a pathway into the kitchen and is soon back with another styrofoam cup lemonlime okay carefully suspiciously i smell it then take a sip its all right thanks i tell him i start to move toward the kitchen but jarrod says the pizzas arent ready yet talk to me he takes my arm and leads me to a small garden room with floortoceiling glass windows overlooking the backyard and patio with a lighted pool at the far end of the room a couple has snuggled together in a wicker swing hes nuzzling her neck i turn my back on them quickly blushing jarrod grins at me you really are a sleeping beauty arent you dont call me that angry at him and at myself i take a long swallow of the soft drink okay he says youre a beauty anyway he puts an arm around my shoulders i stiffen whats the matter he asks nothing i answer im very much aware of his arm and of the warmth of his hand that is kneading my shoulder what am i supposed to do no guy has ever put an arm around me i wonder where jeff is i didnt mean to say it aloud jarrod tilts his head to look into my eyes you didnt come with jeff he says no i just wondered i he moves a little closer and his breath blows warm against my right ear its a pretty night want to go outside for a little while the swing creaks and the girl on the swing giggles id like to get out of this room so i quickly answer okay by the pool the underwater lights add a glow to the yard that is almost as bright as the lights in this room better yet jarrod says out in front ive got a new car id like to show it to you well dont you want to see it he sounds hurt im real proud of it wire wheels and all sorts of gadgets even a makeup mirror on the passenger side that lights up youll like it come on stacy he puts on a littleboy grin if you knew me better youd know i always get my own way i suppose if i had a new car id want to show it off too okay i say id really like to see your car i look for a place to put down my cup but jarrod says drink up first i take another long swallow thats enough hey i got that specially for you chugalug it its a small cup and theres not much left obediently i take another drink emptying the cup jarrod takes it from me grins and puts it on a nearby table holding my hand he leads me past the couple on the swing who dont seem to notice us we go back through the den and the entry hall to the front door no one seems to notice us jarrod quickly opens the door and as soon as we step through he shuts it behind us the night air is still warm and the light from a large lowhung moon blurs the dark sky the sharp pungent fragrance of early ligustrum blooms is making me dizzy i find that i have trouble focusing my eyes i feel kind of funny i tell jarrod id better sit down and i plop onto the top porch step the bricks are rough and hard jarrod sits next to me get up stacy its just a few more steps to the street i dont know whats the matter im kind of dizzy maybe im coming down with a virus id better find jan dont bother jan youll be all right come on ill help you walk i try to stand up but i cant make it let go jarrod but he doesnt shhh he says just relax just lean against me close your eyes and some of the dizziness will go away maybe hes right i close my eyes and do feel a little better as i relax my head rests against the warm hollow of jarrods neck we sit there quietly for a few minutes then he begins stroking my arm with the tips of his fingers and my skin tingles feel a little better now he murmurs i guess so i dont know what happened to me you just had a little too much to drink i didnt know it would hit you this hard but it wont hurt you what are you talking about i didnt have anything to drink its hard to think its hard to figure out what he means just a little vodka stacy i knew you couldnt taste the vodka jarrod you werent supposed to i say but he interrupts lets go to the car now he says no i think i should go home his voice is smooth okay stacy ill drive you home he helps me up my legs wobble as though the bones werent connected while we make our way down the three or four brick steps as we reach the walkway tonys front door slams open someone leaps down the steps grabs jarrod by his collar and flings him aside i stagger backward onto the grass and see jarrod jump up to the top porch step leave her alone jeff yells i stare up at the porch and into jarrods eyes the screen door bangs against the wall and i can clearly see the guy who has run from our house hes scared i can feel his fear as he stares back at me his eyes are glittering with terror theyre so light and pale theyre almost yellow i can see his face he has a gun in his hand he raises it and points it at me jarrod i scream it was you you killed my mother chapter ten yelling screaming with rage i stagger through a red haze toward jarrod and directly into jeffs path as he leaps toward the porch jeff and i fall legs and arms flailing wildly jarrod jumps over us and runs to a car that is parked on the drive facing the street jeff stumbles to his feet and races after jarrod he slams against the trunk of the car as jarrod takes off with a screech of tires people explode from the house shouting questions and i cant stand it i collapse on the grass my hands over my head what happened whats the matter with stacy jarrod really it was jarrod i cant believe it somebody ought to call the police tell them tell them jarrod keeps a gun in his car how do you know that we were on a date he opened the glove compartment and i saw oh what difference does it make someone should tell the police i dont want anyone to get hurt is stacy all right did jarrod hurt her why does jarrod keep a gun in his car cmon a lot of people do tony does hey keep me out of this anyhow thats my dads gun look everybody what should we do about stacy the questions become a roar and the words dont make sense where is jeff where is jan a hand firmly clasps mine and pulls me to a sitting position open your eyes jeff says jan is getting you some coffee jan arrives with a mug of coffee and helps me drink it i hate coffee i mumble into the cup it doesnt matter jeff says it will help you wake up i can open my eyes now hes watching me carefully okay everybody jeff says to the row of white faces with huge lemurlike eyes you can go inside now im going to take stacy home ill go too jan says you dont need to jeff tells her shell be all right but what if jarrod the last place hell come tonight is to stacys house shouldnt we call the police its taken care of he tells them he turns to me stacy is there a particular detective you should talk to yes detective markowitz lets take you home you can talk to him there it will give you a chance to calm down jan gives me a questioning look so i tell her i think jeff is right as i watch them leave i mumble to jeff i didnt know what jarrod was going to do he wanted me to see his new car i feel as though i have to explain i didnt know about the vodka its okay stacy you dont have to tell me about it im glad you came when you did thanks drink some more coffee the coffee has cooled down a little so i take a big drink you came right away i was looking for you feeling a little better why were you looking for me as i wait for his answer i sip at the coffee i can think more clearly now which is unfortunate because im getting more and more embarrassed to make everything worse i look up at jeff and hiccup his face twitches as he tries unsuccessfully to suppress a laugh home is a good place for you right now he says he puts the empty coffee mug on the edge of tonys front porch come with me stacy my car is across the street my legs are working now but i hold his hand tightly while we walk to the car in a few minutes as we pull away from the curb the nearby streetlight flashes across his face and again i get the strange feeling that ive met jeff before youre different i tell him you said that before i cant explain it its like youre not exactly what you seem to be he turns to look at me youll find out that many people arent exactly what they seem to be stacy what does that mean questions questions he says theres a long pause until he surprises me by asking how well did you know jarrod tucker i just saw him around the neighborhood i knew who he was did you see him with other people i dont know maybe i didnt pay any attention why just asking he says but for an instant he gives a strange smile my turn i sit up straighter do you know jarrod tucker he turns and looks at me ive seen him around you didnt answer my question sure i did pay attention how come you get to ask all the questions when i ask you questions you dont answer or you change the subject changing the subject right now is a good idea what do you want to talk about the party i dont even want to think about the party a large hiccup shudders through me and i clap my hands over my mouth the muscles at the corners of his mouth twitch again hes laughing at me i open my mouth to tell him that hes rude but all that comes out is another hiccup i feel so stupid that i hunch back against the seat and dont try to talk he doesnt talk to me either theres such a muddle of feelings stirring inside me i dont understand them i sneak a couple of glances at jeff from the corners of my eyes i like him i like to be near him but there is something about him i dont understand its like a secret he doesnt want me to discover in a short time we park in the driveway to my house jeff leads me up to the front steps takes the key from my purse and opens the door i look at him and gulp now what do i do will he just say good night what if he kisses me im terrified that he might but at the same time i desperately hope that he will a rectangle of light suddenly spills from the open front door of the cooper house and mrs cooper steps out is that you stacy yes mrs cooper i call back your father said youd be at a party when i heard a car i thought id check i came home early i tell her are you all right just tired i remember my manners this is a friend of mine jeff clinton jeff our neighbor mrs cooper they nod at each other but mrs cooper doesnt go inside she stands there watching as jeff hands me the key and a scrap of paper my phone numbers written on that he says you might want it sometime thanks i answer i wish mrs cooper wouldnt stare at us would you like to come inside from the corners of his eyes he glances at mrs cooper and smiles what would your watchdog say about that i dont care i i wish youd look through the house to make sure no ones there id feel a lot safer no ones there but if youll feel better about it ill check it out i start toward the door with him but he says stay here your watchdog will protect you i lean against the rough brick and smile at mrs cooper hes checking the house for me i tell her she nods good idea she still doesnt go inside i feel as though i should be making conversation so i stammer something about what a warm night it is and she quickly agrees im relieved when jeff appears in the doorway everythings okay he says call detective markowitz as soon as youre in the house how did you know his name you told me i did oh i did you have a good memory yes jeff says i do even with mrs cooper watching he leans down and kisses my forehead youll be okay now he tells me as he starts down the walk toward his car i shut the door and lock it then lean against it thinking about what a nice guy jeff is but why is he such a mysterious person in some ways he doesnt want to talk about himself why and what did he mean about people not always being what they seem to be a thought breaks through the fuzzy fog that has settled on my brain i realize that jeff didnt ask me my address he didnt ask where i lived but he came here as though he had been here before i hear the whispery voice on the phone the voice that mumbled yes i have a friend what if jeff is jarrods friend detective markowitz calls me before i can call him i got the word on your identification he says they told me that someone at your party phoned it in yes i think it was jeff a lot of what happened is kind of mixed up in my mind theres a pause and his voice is deeper quieter how about the identification stacy could that be mixed up too no im sure im very sure then i tell him everything that happened ive got his record in front of me he says minor stuff a couple of charges on possession of drugs but because of his age he was given probation but hes a murderer thats what well have to prove he is i told you he is take it easy stacy i believe you what are you going to do now are you going to try to find jarrod there are a number of things to do he answers im working on them ill get back to you tomorrow you okay yes im okay dont worry about anything its up to us for now i remember that jeff said my house would be the last place jarrod would come to but i cant help asking markowitz what if jarrod comes here he wont he answers go to bed get some sleep are you sure stacy he says and i can tell hes trying to be patient and is probably tired and wishes he could be home in bed as i told you ill get back to you tomorrow when i put down the receiver the house seems awfully quiet as if its listening along with me i shake my head no i cant frighten myself like this ill read a book ill watch something on television i know what ill do ill take a shower a shower is a perfect idea the water is hot and strong i take a deep breath then tilt my face up under the shower head so that the steamy water beats against my forehead when i cant hold my breath any longer i twist and duck letting the force of the water massage my neck and shoulders its warm in here and comfortable and i wish i could stay here for an hour but finally i turn off the water and stretch for a towel thats on the nearest rack the silence in the steamfilled room makes me nervous id forgotten that with the noise of the shower and the bathroom door closed i wouldnt be able to hear anything else in the house but what would there be to hear in the distance the telephone rings i fumble with my pajamas and robe scrambling into them accidentally turning a sleeve of my robe wrong side out in my haste i jab at the insideout sleeve nearly ripping it as i manage to get it in place so i can pull on the robe my hand is on the knob of the bathroom door when i realize that the phone rang only once thats funny open the door dont move wait listen someone must have known it was a wrong number right or decided not to call after all sure thats it but just to be positive i cautiously walk through the bedroom hallway the lights are on in the den just as i left them i take another step and a floorboard makes a snapping sound theres a creaking sound in the den a shadow against the wall and a voice asks stacy daddy my voice wobbles is that you he appears at the other end of the hallway i thought you heard me come in i didnt i was in the shower did i startle you honey i didnt mean to i run to him and hug him its okay i didnt expect you to get home so early the reports they sent us were incomplete so there was no chance to do the work tonight he turns back to the den where i see part of an apple on a plate next to his chair i was having a snack there are more apples in the refrigerator want to join me no thanks i perch on the end of the sofa i thought i heard the telephone you probably did one of those calls where it dawns on someone that he has the wrong number but he doesnt say anything and doesnt hang up until he finally figures it out i saw him tonight daddy saw who the guy who killed mom he was at the party i recognized him dad gives a choking gasp stumbles toward me and grabs my shoulders what happened what did you do does detective markowitz know i hug my father tightly it makes it easier to tell him about jarrod and jeff when i finish dad drops onto the sofa next to me this jeff shouldnt have left you alone he should have stayed with you until i came home id thought the same thing but found myself defending jeff he said id be all right he did check out the house besides detective markowitz told me the same thing who is jeff dad asks have i ever met him daddy he just took me home thats all he said good night while mrs cooper watched us and he left mrs cooper dad suddenly looks guilty did you ask mrs cooper to keep an eye on me well not exactly the conversation came around to you and mrs cooper is one of these concerned people and he stops and sighs stacy im doing my best so is mrs cooper dad laughs and i have to laugh too in a way its funny i have to admit i was kind of glad to see her i tell him i wasnt sure how i was supposed to say good night to jeff with a firm handshake dad says daddy its good to hear dad laugh its good to laugh together but the telephone rings again dad reaches for it hello he says and pauses hello hello he puts down the receiver probably the same idiot but i know these arent just wrong number calls and i can see in dads eyes that what he said was designed to put me at ease he doesnt believe these are wrong numbers either are you cold stacy youre shivering i guess im just tired i tell him id better get to bed as soon as the dark seeps through my eyelids i can see jarrods face im not going to let you ruin my life i whisper to those yellow eyes because im going to ruin yours chapter eleven saturday long after dad has left for work i stretch from strange troubled dreams into wakefulness saturday mornings used to be filled with waking to sunbright windows and the butterysweet fragrance of moms pancakes i almost expect to hear the purr of the lawn mower which would become a roar as dad guided it under my bedroom window tousleheaded id press my face against the window squishing my nose and yell youre making too much noise dad who would follow the game even though he couldnt hear me over the noise of the mower would shout back get up get up youve slept away half the morning no lawn mower no pancakes i make some toast to go with my glass of orange juice at least theres one saturday routine i can continue today after breakfast ill clean the house as i walk into the kitchen the doorbell rings i freeze trying to breathe it rings again i force myself to shove the fear aside and go to the door through the peephole i see a woman standing on the porch shes well dressed in a denim skirt and pink knit cotton blouse but her youthful haircut doesnt match the web of tiny wrinkles that stand out under the makeup around her eyes beyond her a large black cadillac is parked at the curb i open the door and say hi she blinks a couple of times then raises her chin imperiously may i please come in and talk to you she asks why who are you i do apologize i assumed you would remember her stare becomes even cooler youre probably having a great deal of trouble remembering people from four years ago even your neighbors i am one of your former neighbors i still must look blank because she quickly adds my name is eloise tucker im jarrod tuckers mother i think we need to talk i step out onto the porch shutting the front door behind me could we talk out here its warm outside her tone is peevish you dont have to be afraid of me i simply want to talk to clarify a few things the porch isnt large enough to have a porch swing on it so i gesture toward the steps im sorry mrs tucker but she sighs with annoyance and settles on the top step wrapping her skirt around her legs i sit on the same step only as far away from her as possible shes wearing a perfume that reminds me of dead roses she stares at her hands for a moment then says its about the terrible unbelievable situation youve created about your ridiculous statement that jarrod was the person you saw in your house but he was no dear she says youre wrong because during that day it all happened that particular day jarrod was visiting my sister in san antonio he wasnt my sister and a close friend of hers are going to testify that he was theyll be lying it will be your word against theirs it wont do you much good to insist on your version as we all see it she says when this tragic incident happened four years ago it was a terrible shock to you this morning my husband spoke with a noted psychiatrist who feels that it is entirely possible you may have well shall we say some mental and emotional problems that are confusing you i lean over resting my elbows on my legs clasping my hands in front of me mrs tucker are you trying to talk me into changing my mind or are you threatening me i suppose i expect her to get angry but instead she calmly says to quote our minister who said he would be glad to be one of jarrods character witnesses jarrod is a willful boy but he wouldnt shoot anyone he did he shot my mother he shot me you saw the gun is that right yes you had your eyes on it i i guess so perhaps you were watching the gun so carefully that you didnt really take a good look at the face of the man who was holding it but i did that will be hard to prove now i feel like crying but my tears would come from frustration from rage mrs tucker no matter what you say i know who was on that back porch i know who shot me and i am going to testify where is jarrod her tone is sarcastic that is what my husband and i have been asked repeatedly by the police thanks to you unfortunately we dont know she clenches her fingers so tightly the knuckles look like shiny white knobs and her voice lowers and softens as she adds he didnt come home last night i lean back against the railing around the edge of the porch and see from the corners of my eyes mrs cooper busily sweeping her front porch i pretend not to notice mrs cooper a gray sedan pulls up in front of the house and parks behind the cadillac the drivers door opens and jeff climbs out calling hi stacy jeff i jump to my feet mrs tucker quickly gets up leans close to me and murmurs think about what i said jeffs long legs have brought him to the foot of the porch steps he looks at mrs tucker for an instant i think i see a spark of recognition in his eyes before he puts on a smile and a bland look and politely says hi this is i begin but mrs tucker ignoring jeff hurries down the walk jumps into her car and drives away you know her yeah jeff says ive seen her around jarrod tickers mother right his smile is open and charming and i want to believe him i open the front door and hold it wide would you like to come in hello stacy mrs cooper calls i wave back so does jeff im going to come over in just a few minutes she says i made a tamale pie all you have to do tonight is just stick it in the oven thanks mrs cooper i call back shut the door jeff says we can sit here on the steps i settle on the same step not quite as far away as i had sat from mrs tucker i wish i had the courage to scoot over close enough so that our bodies would be almost touching there are all sorts of strange feelings inside me some of which i like and some which kind of scare me because i dont understand them what did she want who mrs tucker she tried to convince me i had the wrong person she tried to talk me out of testifying she even told me that her sister and a friend would testify that jarrod was with them in san antonio i look at jeff could they do that sure witnesses can say anything they want but theyd be lying some people do lie what if the jury believes them and not me that can happen then jarrod could go free yeah i guess so jeff cocks his head as he looks at me instead of asking me all these questions you ought to ask your detective markowitz whos working this case youre right i have to smile i dont know why i just took it for granted that youd know i pause and he fills in because im obviously wise and highly intelligent and probably know all the answers to everything youre laughing at me no stacy i just tried to cover what you didnt want to say how do you know what i was going to say because i have a little brother whos twelve no thirteen last month and he thinks because im older than he is i know everything or ought to know i wiggle the toes of my sneakers and watch them intently i feel so stupid but in a way im glad for what he said you told me that you understand i guess you do the telephone rings i dont care i like sitting here with jeff and i dont want to answer it get your phone jeff tells me its probably not important he jumps up and pulls me to my feet on the other hand it could be are you going to answer it or do you want me to he follows me into the house i run the last few steps and catch the telephone on the sixth or seventh ring hello i shout i take a deep breath and try to calm down hello i repeat trying to be quiet and dignified its detective markowitz we picked him up he says jarrod you did really but his mother was just here did she know were trying to reach his parents no real urgency though since tuckers an adult what did jarrod tell you nothing he answers i didnt expect him to his mother said her sister and friend would testify that jarrod was in san antonio that day but i know shes lying oath or not a lot of people lie trying to save their own skin or someone elses but i saw him im a witness i think i told you stacy placing someone on the scene of the crime is just half of it we need physical evidence to prove he was there and you dont have any we may they did come up with some fingerprints which they couldnt make at the time we have the casing which was found in the room and the slug taken from well at least now that we know what were going on theres a slim chance that we might tie tucker into the scene to be perfectly honest with you though these factors may work out they may not thats all i can tell you you also told me about a computer search what about that zilch im confused and feeling more frustrated by the minute what can we do come down for a lineup he answers thats as good a place as any to start it might help us hold tucker a little longer you mean he might get out depends on the judge and what we can come up with to convince him the guy shouldnt be allowed bail im going to come to the station right now i tell him is anybody there with you what do you mean i mean someone who could drive you oh yes a friend is here but ill call my sister and ask her as i hang up the receiver jeff says ill go with you thanks jeff but id better tell donna where im going i dial her number and give her the latest news i dont know jeff she says i think your family should be with you ill drive you but donna i dont know how to tell her with jeff standing beside me that i wish shed butt out for now that id like to be with jeff ill be right over she says firmly and hangs up i turn to jeff she wants to come with me sure he says and smiles shes your sister he stays until donna arrives she smiles and chats but at the same time she gives him a sharp onceover apparently shes satisfied that jeff is a nice guy because i can see her relax she presses a hand to the small of her back and says stacy wed better be going ill be glad to take you there jeff says its a good halfhour drive im hoping shell agree but donna smiles and says thanks anyway jeff but this is going to be a difficult situation i think it had better be just family sure jeff says he walks to his car and watches us climb into donnas i wish i could turn around and see him drive away hes nice donna says i think so too i want her to say more about him but she talks instead about the party and jarrod tucker and all the things dad told her until we reach the police station on riesner as we leave the parking lot detective markowitz suddenly comes out from the police building and trots down the steps to meet us he leads us through a side door remembering how busy the lobby was the last time i was here im grateful to miss the crowds we enter the homicide room and he bends to look into my face ready for the lineup he asks im ready he nods picks up a telephone punches a couple of buttons and tells someone to set things up he puts down the receiver and turns to me a few other people will be in the viewing room with us one of them will be tuckers attorney he wont talk to you but he has the right to be there to make sure everything is done legally that no one leads you to make a decision understand he has an attorney already we reached tuckers father right after we talked to you the attorney was here within twenty minutes im glad that donna is hanging on to me i dont pay attention to the route were taking i cant see anything except jarrods face which has glued itself to my mind were led into a small room chairs are racing a glass wall and beyond the wall is a stage with a height chart made of horizontal lines painted on the yellowed wall behind the stage detective johns is in the room as are some other men donna and i speak to johns but no one introduces us to the others i wonder which one is jarrods attorney markowitz tells us to be seated and relax the men youll see out there wont be able to look in at you this is a oneway glass he says so dont be afraid im not afraid a door opens at the left a policeman comes in and picks up a microphone then a line of seven men come into the room and file across the stage each one is wearing a number on his chest they all look something alike turn right turn left face forward the policeman drawls as though hed given these commands so often he could say them in his sleep i study the men facing me i spot jarrod immediately his jacket is wrinkled and smudged he needs a shave the men with him must have been carefully picked one of them looks about jarrods age one a little younger all of them have dark or brown hair two of the men are staring at their feet one has his chin tucked down throwing his face into shadow tell them to look this way tell them to look at the window i say to markowitz theres something i want you to see markowitz picks up a receiver and relays my command to the policeman who barks it out the men look upward to the window that separates us i look into the pale yellow eyes of the guy who tried to get me away from the party last night was it an attempt to get rid of me if i had gone would he have succeeded this time in killing me what if i identify jarrod and he is released on bond will he try again you wont have a chance i whisper as though he could hear me donna is startled she quickly turns and stares at me i hear one of the men shuffle his feet another coughs jarrod tucker is second from the right and i want you to look at his eyes i tell markowitz four years ago those awful yellow cat eyes stared into mine just before jarrod shot me ill never forget his eyes never the men in the room look at me sharply and donna nervously squeezes my hand i realize that my hatred for jarrod has made the room come into focus i can smell sour body sweat and stale cigarettes and my tongue curls at the edges with a taste like bitter lemon youre positive markowitz asks he sounds pleased merely a formality one of the men says she saw him at the party last night i twist toward them ill identify him from photographs i say eagerly give me his photograph from four years ago along with others and ill pick him out i promise stacy detective markowitzs voice is low as he firmly squeezes my shoulder its a signal to be quiet it doesnt matter none of them answered me or acted as though they had heard me detective markowitz speaks to the policeman in the lineup room in turn the policeman tells the men to turn around they file out as they came in and the door closes behind them i stay in my chair staring into the room i can still see jarrod tuckers yellow eyes thats all for now stacy detective markowitz says thanks for coming well be in touch with you i stand and look up at him how about the gun was it in jarrods car we found a gun in the glove compartment and it wasnt the murder weapon different size caliber oh i hoped so hard that i take a long breath okay what happens next someone in the district attorneys department will want to talk to you and tucker will be arraigned does that mean the trial no that means the district attorney will bring a brief summation of the charge against tucker before a judge hell plead not guilty and his attorney will ask for a trial then what happens among other things the judge sets the amount of bail for tucker or decides if he should be allowed out on bail i hear donna gasp you mean he might be set free until his trial thats a possibility markowitz says in court well present a strong plea that he not be allowed bail and for now we can hold him for twentyfour hours without a formal charge donna says but even if hes released on bail surely he wont try to hurt stacy hed have to be insane for a moment theres nothing but silence i know were all thinking the same thing who says that hes not will you let me know what happens to jarrod i ask markowitz youll know youre our witness as he talks he moves toward the door donna and i follow him out of the room and down the hallway without warning an intense light nearly blinds me and someone says there she is dont worry markowitz tells us its just a tv crew they seem to be the only ones who wanted to follow up on the story the others on the police beat are covering a convenience store shooting on the north side donna is nervous what do they want cant we get them to go away ill chase them off if you say so he answers but stacy might agree to talk to them for a few minutes theyll just ask her a couple of questions theyve got word by now on the result of the lineup and it wont take long if they ask anything they shouldnt ill step in sure i say its okay a woman with short dark hair is working her way toward me shes holding up a microphone the bright light snaps off so i can see the cameraman with the light and the camera on his shoulder hes right behind her i take a step toward the reporter ducking around a guy who is being steered through the hallway by a police officer the guys face is all scrunched up as though he were trying not to cry i dont think hes any older than i am suddenly theres space and just as suddenly i find myself facetoface with jarrod tucker hes wedged between two sturdy officers his hands cuffed in front of him his eyes turn to narrow slits as he recognizes me detective markowitz snaps get him out of here donna tugs at me the reporter shouts at the cameraman and i throw up my hands against his instant blast of bright light jarrod is jerked past me the officers with him ordering people to get out of the way but he manages to twist toward me through all the confusion i hear only a snarl of words my friend just as quickly i cry at him youre crazy for just an instant before hes pulled away from me jarrods lips part in a wide grin and his eyes gleam donna i shriek but donna seems to be trying to head off the reporter frantically i look for markowitz but he has followed jarrod and the officers down the hall nobodys reacting to what jarrod said to me didnt they hear him am i the only one what did jarrod mean thats the second time hes mumbled something about a friend if jarrod cant get to me will one of his friends try markowitz appears at my side he takes my arm and leads me into a nearby room youre shaking he says sit down he nudges me toward an ugly chrome and plastic chair i want donna ill get her im alone and more frightened than ever when markowitz appears with donna i jump up and run to her i hug her as closely as i can hanging on as though she were an anchor that would keep me from being swept downstream dont be afraid donna says as she strokes my hair stacy honey hes locked up he cant hurt you he said something about a friend i think he was threatening me i think he meant his friends would take care of me he spoke to you markowitz scowls i didnt hear him when they took him past me thats all he said just the words my friend are you sure im positive dont you believe me donna speaks first there was a lot of noise a lot of confusion and you were afraid maybe you just thought the words my friend if thats what you heard could mean anything stacy i interrupt them i didnt imagine it i heard jarrod i think i know what it means donna wraps her arms around me and says to markowitz there was so much noise and we were all distracted it makes sense that stacy heard him and we couldnt okay okay markowitz says he leans against the desk ive seen guys like jarrod tucker over and over again theyre all brave talk on the outside cowards on the inside threats sure hed try to scare stacy out of testifying against him maybe she shouldnt testify donnas chin wobbles and i know shes close to tears i push away from donna take a deep breath and say look im scared he scared me a lot but i am going to testify against him nothing jarrod can do will scare me out of that markowitz nods we wont let him get to you stacy it isnt fair donna says and she suddenly sits on the hard ugly chair there are brown smudges under her eyes and her face looks thin and pale donna are you all right im just tired she says im tired of all this we were a happy family leading normal average lives what went wrong why should all this happen to us im sorry markowitz mumbles and his eyes do look sorry its not an answer but for the moment it seems to satisfy donna may i please have a glass of water she asks she sits up a little straighter and rests her hands on her abdomen her fingers make a little patting motion as though she were reassuring the baby right away markowitz says moving toward the door but he pauses and when youre ready to leave well get you out the back door and away from here no problem thank you donna says but my mind is on jarrod and the words he whispered at me he meant to frighten me and he succeeded what did he mean i know what im up against with jarrod but who is his friend chapter twelve on the way back to our house i tell donna my idea im going to find out who jarrods friends are as soon as we get home im going to call tony jarrod goes to tonys parties i bet hell know it might help donna says her smile cant cut the worry in her eyes but i dont have a chance to call tony as donna parks the car in front of the house a gray sedan pulls up behind us jeff jumps out lopes over and opens donnas door for her he walks with us into the house asking did everything go all right yes for some reason i dont want to talk to him about it want some iced tea i ask him we follow donna into the kitchen she pulls a large covered pitcher of iced tea out of the refrigerator and hands it to me then she pries the lid off a casserole dish and asks why didnt you eat the chicken pasta salad because i dont know what it is she looks at me oddly oh stacy she says i guess none of us did until a couple of years ago theres a knock at the back door and i hear a young voice calling stacy donna opens the door and the three cooper kids tumble inside each one trying to beat the others in coming out with what they want to say slow down i tell them let teri go first ten quickly shouts as though the rules might be changed at any minute can we play in your tree house oh no donna says before i can answer its falling apart girls its really dangerous dad is going to take it down because its a hazard im glad you asked i tell them you were smart to ask we asked you because when we asked our mother she said we couldnt men answers keri speaks up can you come over and play stacy we can play dolls again i gulp with embarrassment frantically trying to think of the right thing to say but jeff smiles at them and answers for me not until she babysits you again shell see you later theyre out the door like a pack of puppies i hear them shout their way to their own backyard jeff puts the tips of his fingers against my cheeks theyre cool against my hot skin when i was a kid one of our babysitters used to play cars with me by the hour he says i thought she was neat thanks i murmur why dont you stay for dinner jeff donna asks dennis will be here soon and dad gets home early on saturday id like that jeff says mind if i use your phone donna waves toward the kitchen telephone jeff dials and says hi ill be here for a while okay sure he hangs up in a way i hope the baby is a girl donna says girls talk to their mothers jeff laughs ill set the table he says in a moment he and donna are laughing together but the telephone call makes me remember i cant call tony and ask about jarrods friends while jeff is here would jeff know that much about jarrod i cant explain it i dont want to ask him dads home on sunday and jan comes over for some reason jeff doesnt show up and doesnt call the maid at tonys house says the family is at their beach house for the weekend shell tell tony to call me when he gets back but they might not return until late sunday night i keep thinking of jarrod and wondering why markowitz doesnt let me know if jarrod is still in jail or is out on bail finally he telephones to say they have a temporary order that will keep jarrod in jail without bond a hearing has been set for tuesday afternoon theres a lot of talk about the case on the evening news but all the discussion about possible evidence seems to be rumor i try all the channels and no one has any real facts monday morning comes and markowitz calls again regina latham one of the assistant district attorneys is going to work on the tucker case she wants to talk to you when this morning ill have to call donna to see if she can take me downtown no need to bother your sister just let her know where youll be ill send a car for you can you be ready in about twenty minutes i guess so okay ill meet you there wait dont hang up whats the matter i i dont know whats going to happen what will she do dont worry about that mrs latham will just go over your story with you probably ask you a few questions no big deal will jarrod be there no jarrods locked up tight dont worry about him i let out the breath i must have been holding ill be ready when your car comes true to my word im watching at the window when the car arrives its a plain dark brown sedan i guess i expected a blueandwhite police cruiser the driver shows me his credentials and i follow him to the car its probably better this way another police car might have worried mrs cooper but mrs cooper comes out onto her front porch she calls across to me stacy is everything all right fine i call back she looks at the police driver with such suspicion that i add im being taken to an appointment with one of the district attorneys whos going to talk to me about jarrods case oh she says nodding as though there were a spring in her neck well just call me if you want anything thanks i dont want anyone especially mrs cooper to keep an eye on me the driver opens the car door for me i climb in and look back as we pull away from the curb she stands there watching until the car is out of sight the driver talks about the weather and a lot of dumb stuff like that maybe its a way of killing time maybe hes trying to be friendly kids dont waste time talking about things that dont mean anything but adults do it all the time i suppose thats one more thing ill have to learn how to do we go through the eastern part of downtown houston and again i gawk at more new buildings that seem to have popped up as fast as the red tulips mom used to plant in the front garden each year markowitz meets the car and walks with me into a building where corridors echo with footsteps and voices an elderly shoeshine man sits just inside the front entrance thats the girl i hear him tell someone as we pass his stand and i walk a little faster as we finally step off the crowded elevator markowitz says to me im sorry you have to go through all this stacy its just part of the game its not a game he nods sorry again wrong word its tough for you and for the rest of your family i know youd all rather forget it his words slap me into awareness of course this whole thing has been horrible for dad and for donna and now theyll have to relive it all again blast you jarrod its not fair markowitz opens a couple of doors and were in a small office most of the desk and the top of a bookcase are covered with piles and stacks of papers behind a clearing in the center of the desk sits a young woman large glasses rimmed in a tortoiseshell brown that matches her short hair shes cool and dignified she stands and as markowitz makes the introductions appraises me the description the press gave her wasnt far off was it she says and for some reason sounds almost hostile would either of you like coffee a coke she adds markowitz accepts the coffee but i dont want anything im too shaky to hold something that might end up in my lap sit down please stacy mrs latham says pointing to one of the two chairs in front of the desk just relax as markowitz and i sit down she continues now stacy you claim that four years ago you saw someone run out of the back door of your house i have to interrupt i did see someone and that was jarrod tucker stacy she says firmly raising her voice a little like a kindergarten teacher whose students wont quiet down and get into line when this case goes to court if it does what do you mean if markowitz leans over and puts a big hand on my arm take it easy stacy mrs latham is an attorney she has to make sure that nothing she says can be misconstrued right now shes trying to make sure shes got a good case thats all she means thank you detective markowitz she says im sure that stacy is old enough to understand the situation ill try i answer she taps the end of a pencil against the desk and begins again all right suppose you tell me in your own words what you claim to have seen on the day that your mother was allegedly murdered and you were shot allegedly shot i mutter under my breath markowitz coughs loudly and i wait until he settles back in his chair then i go through the whole story mrs latham interrupts me over and over snapping questions as fast as jan used to be able to pop bubble gum what exactly did you think you heard what kind of sound do you recognize the sound of a gunshot have you ever heard one before are you sure you heard anything did you know jarrod tucker had you ever spoken to him if you hadnt spoken to him if you hadnt been in his classes at school how is it you could have been so sure it was jarrod tucker on your back porch its been four years since that time for that matter could your uh illness lets say the time you slept have affected your judgment or your memory maybe both i stand up slam my hands on the desk scattering some of her papers to the floor and explode into tears you have to believe me youre the one whos supposed to make sure jarrod goes to prison for murder she looks a little frightened by my outburst you cant behave like that in court she stammers but markowitz gently pushes me back into the chair shes just a kid he tells mrs latham shes not many years younger than i am mrs latham bristles dont forget the four years she has to make up for he answers he fishes a neatly folded handkerchief out of his pocket and hands it to me stacy understand that mrs latham is just playing devils advocate he says whats that mrs latham looks up at the ceiling as though appealing for help then back down to me it means she says that jarrod tuckers defense attorney is going to ask you a great many questions were trying to anticipate some of them we want all the answers before we go to court i blow my nose and lean toward her looking her straight in the eyes okay i want to help in any way i can but theres a better way to do this dont push at me dont snap questions at me the way youve been doing it i came here to work with you and youre acting like an enemy the telephone rings and she reaches for it so quickly she jostles some papers off her desk she wasnt the one being rescued she hands the receiver to markowitz and says its for you his conversation consists of good clear any reaction ill check thanks he hands the receiver to mrs latham and nods as though he were in hearty agreement with whoever was on the line they did have some clear prints they couldnt make at the time they check out now jarrod tucker then youve got physical evidence i realize that im shouting and jumping up and down in my chair so i try to calm down that means hell be convicted right that means our chances are a whole lot better markowitz answers a lot of what will happen is up to the judge and the jury and the prosecuting attorney we both look at mrs latham she sucks in a sharp breath and blinks a couple of times finally she says lets start over stacy maybe i was coming across a little hard and fast i guess i want to win this case as much as you do i sit back in my chair and wait then lets get with it stacy she says and her words are slower more gentle youre very angry at jarrod tucker are you sure that your emotions are not going to cloud this case im not going to let my anger get in the way how about your resultant feelings of guilt guilt what are you talking about i mean the common progress in grief naturally youd begin to shift some of the blame from jarrod tucker to yourself in causeandeffect relationships for example your mothers death if you had been in the house with her if no youre wrong i jump to my feet she stares at me in bewilderment markowitz stands up mrs latham weve probably covered enough for now dont you think id like to take stacy home she talks to him as though i were not in the room with this emotional instability i doubt if shell be a good witness she needs a little time shell have it before she has to appear in court i take a long breath and force my voice to become steady appear in court as what im only a witness remember or have i suddenly turned into the accused stacy markowitz says but i stand a little taller im the victim on both sides mrs latham slowly rises and says to markowitz perhaps you can talk to her father is she getting any type of therapy ill talk to you later he says and pulls me out of the office before i can catch my breath and tell her what else is on my mind he drives me home in his own car and tries to explain that mrs latham is somewhat new in the department and is trying very hard to prove herself and do things right and that i shouldnt react to everything she said its going to be a lot tougher than that when jarrod goes to trial he tells me youll hear the defense witnesses lie through their teeth and youll have to sit there and keep quiet and tuckers attorney will blister you with questions and youll have to take it why because thats the way the system of justice is set up justice for whom dont be bitter its got its flaws but at least it attempts to give everyone a fair chance nothing about this seems to be fair it would have been fair only if somebody had shot jarrod he doesnt answer we drive past the galleria and neimanmarcus and slowly my anger simmers down like a pot of water with the burners turned off detective markowitz i say im sorry i lost my temper i acted like a little kid i wont do it again i try to sort out exactly what happened but one thing puzzles me ill do what mrs latham wants but she doesnt like me you know when i walked in i could tell that she didnt like me and i dont know why he smiles ummm could be a little jealousy i twist toward him jealousy about what but he just slowly shakes his head and chuckles stacy you really are still a little kid youre as bad as she is i mutter i didnt mean to get you riled he says lets change the subject okay i want to talk about jarrods gun i told you it didnt match the slug and casing weve got on file i know but when did jarrod buy this gun four years ago he may not have owned one he might have used someone elses gun probably one belonging to his father he turns to me and smiles were thinking in the same direction granted its pretty much of a long shot but were requesting a search warrant we can see if jarrods father owns any guns and we can subpoena them for testing the houston police department has one of the best ballistics experts in the united states if there is anything to be found out hell find it before the hearing it doesnt have to be before the hearing i want to be there have anyone to take you ill ask donna hes silent for a minute and i know hes thinking of what donna went through in the police station lets leave your sister out of this ill send a car for you the driver will be at your house around two thanks its okay now do me a favor and relax i lean back against the seat and try to relax i really do especially i try not to think of everything mrs latham said but when im finally in the quiet lonely house it comes back to me i pick up the picture of mom that dad keeps on the dresser in their bedroom shes squinting against the sunlight and laughing as though someone had just told her a wonderful joke oh mom it wasnt my fault was it i ask the picture the picture just smiles back i sit on the floor my back against their bed hugging the picture to my chest for the first time i wish i could cry but the tears are locked behind the hard lump of hatred that grows and chokes and burns inside me i cant get rid of that hatred and nothing can help me get rid of it not until jarrod is dead chapter thirteen early tuesday morning jan calls to invite me to dinner i promise to come over to her house around five as soon as jan is off the phone i call the head counselor at the high school i find out his name is mr dobbis oh were right up on our toes about your case he says and i picture him pirouetting around his office in toe dancer shoes come to the office now if youd like to he adds we were going to give you a little more time but ive already met with your seventhgrade teachers and gone over your records and have a pretty good handle on a plan for your future studies will i have to go back to middle school no come on and well talk about what i have in mind dad gives me a lift to the school and shows me a bus stop where ill be able to catch a bus that comes down memorial drive from there i can walk home remember ill be at jans house for dinner tonight i tell him shell bring me home probably around ten then i wont come home for dinner he says dont work too hard dad he just smiles waves and drives off the high school is a mixture of old brick and modern with twostory buildings stretching across a large campus there are lots of trees and a wide grass lawn in front of the school at the side is a gigantic parking lot kids are beginning to arrive for classes and the street in front of the school is almost blocked with a chain of cars trying to get into the parking lot i keep swallowing as i go up the steps of what looks like the main building i have to ask a second time how to find mr dobbiss office because im so nervous i cant remember what the first person told me im in mr dobbiss office for about an hour talking about makeup study and exams and the schools tutoring program and summer school and i leave feeling pretty good its going to mean a lot of work but i can do it he thinks i can and i know i can theres no way i can graduate with my class but i honestly didnt expect to with math and science and four years of english and everything ill have to cram in i couldnt cover it that fast but at least it wont take four or five years i wont be the oldest student in the history of the world ever to graduate from high school i smile to myself as i leave his office hugging the books he gave me and plunge out into the hall its filled with fastmoving bodies and i find myself pushed aside i plaster myself as flat as i can against the wall trying to stay out of the way someone skids to a stop in front of me stacy tony asks what are you doing here tony you didnt answer my phone call yeah hey well i was busy he begins to move off ill see you dont go i grab his arm look ill call you tonight what i have to ask you wont take very long youre one of jarrods friends right the pupils of his eyes flick to each side and he licks his lips not really friends he conies to my parties if you know what i mean no i dont youre really dense it takes just a moment for what he said about jarrod to sink in i tighten my grip on tonys arm as i say youre telling me he has a reason for being at your parties are you talking about drugs i gotta get to class stacy let go answer my questions or ill start yelling and screaming again he seems to check from side to side then leans close so hes a supplier most of the kids know it why hasnt he been arrested proving it is something else he scowls at me and dont go telling your cop friends friends one more question who are jarrods friends a guy like jarrod doesnt have friends you must have seen him with someone he thinks a minute yeah sometimes he comes on the grounds here sometimes ive seen him at places he hangs out ive seen jeff with him remember jeff clinton he was at my party somebody said he took you home i clutch my books to my chest and shiver but a big guy barges into tony knocking him offbalance so he doesnt notice i gotta go stacy he complains a bell rings the hall is emptying fast go ahead tony thanks for answering my questions remember he says keep some of that information to yourself i have to lean against the wall for a few minutes the metal locker is cold and the handle pokes into my back but it doesnt seem to matter everything seems to be all wrong tony must have been lying about jarrods friend it couldnt be jeff i find myself walking down the hallway toward the main doors ive got to go home as i walk into the house about forty minutes later the telephone rings i dont want to answer it but what if its donna what if its dad so i clutch the receiver and manage to say a weak hello its detective markowitz mrs latham has some more questions she wants to go over with you he says do you feel up to it now as soon as we can get you downtown she wants to get more information from you before the hearing there are some things you didnt cover in your first meeting okay he pauses uh stacy shes kind of unbending but shes a good prosecutor if you could relax with her the sentence dangles ill stay calm i promise him fine do i have to testify at this hearing no its just to set a date for tuckers trial give his attorneys a chance to ask for a postponement all that sort of legal stuff you dont even need to be there but i want to be there believe me it wont interest you yes it will really get ready he says the car will be at your house in about twenty minutes i change from my jeans and blouse to a dress i want to look just right if i had a suit id wear that i can be just as businesslike as mrs latham the driver from hpd arrives i wave to mrs cooper who comes out on her porch again how can she be so aware of everything thats going on she calls to me as im climbing in the police car stacy its all right about that car the driver shuts the door so i roll down the window and stick my head out what car tell you later she yells we soon arrive at the courthouse and again its a quick hello to detective markowitz through the lobby with him into the elevator and up to mrs lathams office shes a little less formal with me now and i dont let her officiousness get to me if shes a super prosecutor then thats what i want for some reason she slows down on the questions so i dont feel bombarded and i answer them over and over and go into all the details i can remember it doesnt take long she looks at her watch and says very good i think i have all the information ill need for now ill go to court and see what i can accomplish im going to be at the hearing too mrs latham looks at markowitz who just shrugs some of the media will be bound to be on hand she says i thought they had written enough about it i say it hasnt been on tv or in the newspapers lately it will again theyll cover each new development i dont care i have to be there i cant explain to either of them that i need to know what is happening each step of the way that i need to see jarrod standing before the judge we go to another floor where each door along the hallway opens to a courtroom mrs latham leaves us and markowitz and i enter one of the courtrooms and slip into seats near the door in the third row the room is painted a shade of offwhite and the seats are like padded theater seats a large desk faces us at the far end of the room and i know thats the judges bench flags of texas and the united states hang at one side of his bench there are no windows in the room i feel closed in a little panicky but i wont leave i huddle against the curved molded back of the seat and hug my elbows for comfort a welldressed woman enters the room pauses for just a moment and glares at me its mrs tucker a man joins her she murmurs something to him nodding in my direction he gives me an angry glance then ushers her into one of the seats at the opposite side of the room a woman bustles back and forth between the judges bench and her desk a few other people are in the room and more straggle in four men carrying briefcases push their way through the hinged panel that separates the front section of the courtroom from the seats for visitors they chat as though they were friends then separate going to opposite ends of a long table in front of the judges bench mrs latham arrives and begins to talk to a couple of the men they both look up at me then go back to their conversation i told you this will be boring markowitz mumbles i just shake my head he doesnt understand how much i need to see this happen everything going all right for you he asks so i tell him what tony had said about jarrod and drugs he doesnt seem surprised he just says that wont figure into this case but it shows what kind of person jarrod is the trial will be concerned with whether or not jarrod tucker was the person who murdered your mother whether or not hes supplying drugs now has nothing to do with what happened four years ago you mean hes going to just get away with the drugs thing i didnt say that we have a narcotics department i can pass along what you told me and let them look into it you should work together he stretches out his long legs we do work together well i think i dont have time to tell him what i think because the woman near the judges bench suddenly announces the arrival of the judge and we all stand a tall grayhaired man strides in his black robes billowing around him he sits down and everyone in the courtroom sits down too a door at the far end of the room opens and two men dressed in tan uniforms come through a young man in jeans and what looks like a jogging shirt is between them who are they bailiffs markowitz whispers with one of the prisoners but wheres jarrod on the other side of that door is a holding pen where prisoners are kept until its their turn to see the judge or to be taken back to jail one of the prosecuting attorneys quickly goes through charges against the man before the judge his attorney says something to the judge about the mans lack of a previous record and the judge sets bail of the attorneys go over to talk to the court clerk everyone on the judges side of the railing seems to be talking but i cant hear what theyre saying in a few minutes the bailiffs go off with the man and another one comes in with an elderly woman who looks like a bag lady when will they bring in jarrod be patient i told you this would be boring finally the first two bailiffs return they enter the courtroom with jarrod walking between them hes dressed in a really sharp suit white shirt and tie he looks like a model student here to accept an award they stop at the right end of the table the two men who have been sitting there stand and talk to jarrod i recognize one of them he was there at the lineup jarrods attorney i cant hear what theyre saying they point to a chair between them jarrods mother makes a little whimpering noise and jarrod shifts to look at her his lower lip curls downward and he looks like a spoiled little boy ready to throw a tantrum i think jarrod hasnt noticed me but before he sits down he turns and stares at me one corner of his mouth twists and he glares with such fierceness i gasp i get his message i couldnt miss it but i know it as well as he does without my testimony there would be little way that jarrod could be convicted of murder i know jarrod would like to kill me if he could only get the chance markowitz seems to know what im thinking he puts a hand on my arm dont worry about him he says hes under guard theres no way he could get to you im not afraid i whisper but i am a little even though jarrods back is to me i keep seeing his pale yellow eyes surprised and horrified as we face each other in our backyard and i see the gun maybe id be more afraid if i didnt hate jarrod so much markowitz and mrs latham might think i want to be here because im curious they couldnt know about the hatred that burns and hurts and makes me want jarrod to be punished for what he did i cant quite follow everything that goes on i do hear jarrods attorney claim that jarrod has been arrested four times on charges of possession of drugs hes been given probation in all cases and he has no record of violence the attorney asks that jarrod be released without bail i want to jump up and yell at the attorney but mrs latham is talking to the judge and the judge gives these little nods as if he were keeping time i hope hes agreeing with her but suddenly jarrod flings himself up twists and groans all the people in the court stare at him with openmouthed statues he shudders and makes a horrible retching noise drops facedown on the floor with a loud plop twitches and is still jarrods mother screams runs to him and kneels next to him what did you do to him she shouts the bailiffs have sprung to life one of them crouches next to jarrod the other tries to pull his mother back the first bailiff calls out to the judge hes out cold but hes breathing its not very regular wed better get an ambulance the judge has stepped down from the dais and is walking toward jarrod it looked like some kind of seizure he looks at jarrods parents mr tucker has joined his wife and has an arm around her shoulders does he have some kind of medical history we should know about but mrs tucker isnt coherent she cries and accuses and a lot of what shes saying is muffled against her husbands chest mr tucker looks as though he were going to be the next one to pass out hes got a good pulse the bailiff says paramedics are on their way one of the clerks calls to the judge the judge gives a final nod at jarrod who lies there without moving and strides back to the bench his robes billowing behind him like black sails after hes seated he states when mr tucker has recovered well set another date for a hearing for now hell be taken to the ben taub emergency room and kept under guard a jabber of noise from the hallway bursts through the door with two paramedics they run to jarrod and begin their work someone in uniform secures the door lets go stacy were in the way here markowitz pushes out of his seat and i follow him in the hallway were met with blinding lights from television cameras microphones are shoved in my face i recognize brandi mayer among some other reporters with notepads and tape recorders they surge at me asking questions that confuse me do you still think jarrod tucker is the one you saw four years ago have you had amnesia are you seeing a psychiatrist how do you feel about those lost four years how do you feel about jarrod tucker i dont know how to answer i just want to stand still and scream but markowitz fields for me edging through the crowd tugging me with him answering some of the questions for me until an elevator arrives and we can escape inside there will be a lot of this he says better get used to it i lean against the back of the elevator in the beginning i thought youd just arrest jarrod and there would be a trial and it would be over the elevator doors open and he quickly leads me down a back hallway to the parking lot and into his car when were out on the street he finally answers theres a lot more to it than that there will be a trial but if the verdict goes against jarrod his attorney will automatically appeal it and youll have to testify again ive seen his attorney operate before unfortunately he really knows how to badger witnesses just be prepared for him and for the press theyll be interested in you and your family until all this is over my family but dad and donna shouldnt be a part of this to the media they are why do they ask so many questions its their job but its not fair get used to it stacy as i climb into the car i glance back at the courthouse none of this would be happening if jarrod tucker were dead with all my heart i wish he were dead soon after markowitz has taken me home jeff arrives when i open the door he says your nextdoor neighbor just came out on her porch shall we sit out on the porch or ignore her before i can answer he says lets ignore her its hot and id like a coke he steps in and closes the door i hear the latch click as the dead bolt turns maybe i look startled maybe a little scared because jeff says have to be careful he leads the way to the kitchen and i follow him it occurs to me as i put the cokes on the kitchen table and sit opposite jeff that i could run over to mrs coopers or i could tell jeff what tony said about him i dont do anything but watch jeff and sip at the icy drink jeff raises his head to take a long swallow from the can and i watch the muscles work in his throat id like to reach out and touch his throat id like to be close to him to feel his arms around me id love to have him kiss me ive never felt like this about anyone before i try to explore my mixedup feelings but they dont make any sense jeff puts down the can and tilts his chair back you had a rough time at the courthouse suddenly im cold how did you know what happened at the courthouse it was on the television newscast he answers easily from where i sit i can see the kitchen clock the first newscast wont be on for half an hour must have been on the radio then he says i know i heard it someplace jeff is lying i can tell why would he lie to me i heard that you went to the high school this morning to talk to the head counselor jeff says quickly changing the subject did you get things straightened out carefully i answer for the most part making up all that work wont be too bad i hope you still want a tutor my voice is so low i wonder if he can hear me yes i do his expression changes the smile slips and his eyes become serious tony said you had a lot of questions to ask him i cant answer i dont know what to say jeff leans across the table and takes my left hand i hope he cant feel it tremble stacy he says dont believe everything tony might have told you his eyes look kind of strange almost sad as he adds dont believe in anybody but yourself chapter fourteen the telephone rings and i snatch it grateful for the interruption its brandi she asks if id mind just a couple of questions im sorry i say not now i im sorry as soon as i hang up the phone rings again its another reporter this one calling long distance from a newsmagazine no i say not now it rings again and i just stare at it shaking my head i dont want to talk to reporters i tell jeff you dont have to jeff says he puts a hand on my shoulder hes standing very close to me dont be afraid stacy he murmurs how can i tell him that hes the one im afraid of the doorbell chimes insistently jeff is ahead of me as i hurry to the door he opens it but mrs cooper twists around him to thrust a steaming loaf of bread at me take the potholders too she exclaims the bread is right out of the oven and i dont want you to burn your fingers i remember my manners would you like to come in instead of answering she smiles at jeff and says i thought id just stop by for a visit im sorry i tell her im going to my friend jans house for dinner ill be leaving here in a few minutes ive got to go too jeff says lots of homework see you later as he reaches the walk he turns and adds both of you mrs cooper seems greatly relieved its just as well ive got to get home dinner to make you know she smiles lovingly at the loaf of bread im holding its too bad you cant eat that with your dinner stacy ill love it for breakfast i answer she watches jeff drive off then says oh yes about that car its all right i dont understand what you mean the car i told you i saw driving around and around this neighborhood ive seen it again but with one thing and another i just didnt mention it to you but there it was and i shouldnt interrupt but i cant stand it what about the car mrs cooper its his she says and looks pleased with herself it takes a moment to register it was jeffs car you saw yes she says so its all right enjoy the bread shes off on a trot to her own house i carry the bread to the kitchen its yeasty and buttery and im hungry but ive got something more important to think about than a loaf of bread why would jeff i cant put the question into words im afraid of the answer our telephone rings again automatically i pick up the receiver and a deep voice begins telling me hes with one of the houston television stations and how do i feel about testifying against jarrod tucker what do you mean how do i feel i stammer i want to testify youre not afraid of him jarrods in jail for how long the reporter asks even if he goes to trial and gets a life sentence he can be paroled in twenty years twelve if he gets time taken off for good behavior that cant be true its true check it out how does your family feel about your decision to testify i i dont know i dont want to talk to you anymore the moment i put down the receiver the telephone rings again i wont answer those reporters will have to give up sooner or later i dont want to talk to them i have to think i curl up in dads recliner with an apple taking big angry bites out of it as i try to sort things out whats happening is like a nightmare but its not something that will go away when i open my eyes and its not like the stories i read and the saturdaymorning cartoons i watched when i was a child the bad guys arent caught and carried away so that the good guys can live happily ever after maybe a jury will give jarrod the death penalty maybe it wont how long am i going to have to live with fear of this man who has already robbed so much of my life and its not just me what is all this going to do to dad and to donna and dennis and their baby if i had the chance i would kill jarrod tucker at first the thought startles me and i push it away but it comes back and i examine it turning it over in my mind testing the sharpness of its edges feeling the hatred that makes it strong the phone has stopped ringing and the silence of the house settles around my shoulders late shadows fade the colors of the room like a coating of dust i should have been at jans house an hour ago id better hurry and get ready im suddenly uncomfortable with the silence because through it pop and creak the settling sounds that houses make i turn on the television not listening to words just wanting noise to blot out the quiet the doorbell chimes again but this time i dont answer it i peek through the curtains at the front window to see who is on the porch mrs cooper shes the last person i want to talk to right now she gives up and leaves the porch she cuts across the lawn to her house a marked police car cruises around the corner and slows down as it passes our house did detective markowitz arrange for this i step back from the window but not before i see the police car pull to a stop while mrs cooper runs down her walk to talk to the officers does she have to know about everything that is going on the car moves on and mrs cooper heads back to her house jan is going to wonder why im so late im in the den on my way from the living room to the bedroom to get my handbag when i hear a slight rattling noise close at hand it seems to be coming from the side door that leads to the garage i stand and listen waiting for the sound again but its the words on the television that i hear the announcer is saying in an escape while being examined in ben taub hospital a short while ago a bailiff was shot in the leg when his gun was taken by tucker an hpd spokesman told us that an allpoints bulletin has been put out for tucker who is believed to have stolen a dark blue pontiac and is thought to be heading out of state possibly toward louisiana the noise from the hall door that leads to the garage rattles over the announcers words and i see the doorknob turn i know whos at that door it has to be jarrod hes inside the garage and soon hell be inside our house no one would suspect that hed come here hed have to be crazy but didnt he warn me he always gets his own way for an instant i freeze unable to move desperately wondering what i can do i have to pass the door leading to the garage to get to the front door jarrod will have that door open in a minute ill run right into him i cant hide in the house hell find me if i can make the backyard as quickly and quietly as possible i move to the back door and open it carefully wincing at the slight sounds it makes i shut it and run into the yard now what i hear one of the cooper children complaining about having to come in then the cooper back door slams i take two steps in that direction when i realize i cant endanger their lives this is between jarrod and me in front of me is the oak tree and the nailed board steps that lead up to the tree house jarrod wont look for me there i scramble upward clinging to the trunk and branches my foot slips as one of the boards tears loose from the tree and i skin my elbow im so scared its hard to breathe and my fingers feel tike numb stumps as i pull myself up and drop to the floor of the tree house frantically i tuck my legs inside and shove myself against the back wall but the tree house rocks unsteadily i hear a board from it drop to the grass i inch to the center and sit perfectly still miraculously the house steadies itself my back is against a window but the window is on the cooper side and shielded by a large branch if jarrod comes outside and i dont think he will he wont be able to see me through this window i wait there is nothing i can do but wait forever is measured not in minutes but in heartbeats i can hear the steady thumping pulse in my ears shadows are deeper but time has dissolved into terror then i hear what ive been dreading the back door to my house opens and shuts jarrod is in the yard stacy he mumbles something after that but again as on the phone for now im sure it was him its as though he were talking to himself the voice comes from below me as soft and shivery as the warm night breeze from the gulf i try not to move can he hear my trembling he chuckles and the sound is even more fearful than his voice youve got to be up there he says instinctively i shrink back even farther the boards in the tree house groan loudly and it rocks i could shoot you from down here i hear him say but i dont want to shoot you i want you to have an accident he laughs to himself again i hear the sound of his shoes scraping the trunk of the tree as he climbs toward me stacy he says i told you i always get my own way suddenly a calm sweeps through my mind and i stop shaking i am not going to sit here and wait for jarrod to have his own way im a woman whos able to think rationally to want my own way and i have a plan slowly careful to keep the tree house balanced i slide upward grasping first the rough edges of the window behind me then reaching for the branch outside it i have managed to pull myself out the window with my feet resting against the lower window frame by the time jarrods arms and grinning face shove into the door to the tree house i stare into his yellow eyes i see the gun if im killed theyll know you did it i whisper not if its an accident youre insane he giggles smart girl stacy he says ive set it up thats going to be my defense now lets talk about your accident my friend and i will take care of it your friend this is my friend for just an instant he takes his eyes from me as he gives a little wave of the gun in his hand as hard as i can i kick against the side of the house swinging into it throwing all my weight against it the house with a great groan and crash collapses and falls taking jarrod with it i scramble down and drop from the tree into his screams and curses jarrod is lying on his back some of the boards are under him and the large part of the tree house covers his hips and legs the gun lies near my feet i pick it up hold it carefully in my right hand and slip my index finger against the trigger jarrod has stopped yelling he stares at me i can see the back door of our house fly open i can see the terror on jarrods face the gleam in his eyes i can see his gun pointing at me dont shoot me jarrod whimpers and i realize i am pointing the gun at him if i shot jarrod wouldnt it be selfdefense and wouldnt it end the trials and the questions and the badgering and the harassment and the nightmares and the worries and the years and years of fear carefully i aim the gun chapter fifteen you cant shoot me jarrod is crying and slobbering spittle drools from his mouth and down his chin or is it blood i didnt mean to kill your mother i didnt know she was in the house but she came into the den from the kitchen and saw me and said something to me and i was scared i didnt mean it stacy i try to picture my mother facing jarrod with his gun what did she say to you she didnt say anything at first she was smiling then she saw the gun and her eyes got frightened but she still had a kind of smile on her face she held her hands toward me and said its all right its all right and you shot her he cant talk hes crying too hard i aim the gun at his head just as carefully as he once aimed it at me my hands have stopped shaking but now i can picture my mother i can see her smile too i can hear her telling jarrod its all right tears rush to my eyes with such force im blinded i try to rub them away with the back of my left hand choices were so easy when i was a child good guy versus bad guy and the good guys always won but im no longer a child although i keep the gun pointed at jarrod at the top of my lungs i yell help mrs cooper help i hear her scream theyre coming i already called the police im all right i shout to her dont be afraid ill keep the gun on him until the police get here someone leaps the hedge and lands beside me but it isnt mrs cooper give me the gun stacy jeff says no i dont take my eyes off jarrod stay away from me mrs cooper called the police theyre coming i am the police narcotics squad he says you can give me the gun he reaches across and takes it out of my hand my legs broken jarrod begins to yell again she did it she tried to kill me i look up at jeff how can you be a policeman youre just a senior in high school but as always he avoids my questions he even sounds a little angry he keeps his eyes on jarrod you could have been killed stacy apparently you were home and werent answering the phone why not jarrod groans my back it hurts i think somethings busted get an ambulance its on its way jeff tells him jeff i had jarrods gun i could have shot him he doesnt look at me could you i shake my head no not really i wanted to i hated him so much that i really wanted to kill him i almost did but then i couldnt do it mom wouldnt its hard to explain i hope that jeff understands what i mean i add i really didnt have a choice jarrods life doesnt belong to me i think of all the problems to come for all of us because of jarrod and i give a long sigh the yard seems to be filled with people mrs cooper is talking at a great rate to me i hear the high excited chirps shes making but the words dont come through theres a bass note in my ear as an officer with a notebook peers at me asking me questions but the only words i want to hear are jeffs he has my arm propelling me around the rubble and the police officers through our back door and into the house the familiar dusty smells of the room are laced with the pungency of drying apple core and somehow comfort me i give a huge sigh of relief and lean against the closed door are you all right do you want to sit down can i get you some water jeff asks i look at him carefully and remember something else i know where i saw you before it was downtown at the police station you looked right at me he doesnt answer so i add you can tell me the truth you lied to me i didnt lie he says ive been with the houston police department for two years im twentythree but because i look a lot younger than i am i was put on a special high school assignment with the narcotics squad and they sent me to the school in your area markowitz got worried about you and i was in a logical position to keep an eye on you so you became part of my assignment i was just an assignment dont look at me like that stacy he says i dont want to hurt you hurt seems to be another part of growing up i tell him one more thing to get used to he shakes his head resting his hands on my shoulders i like the feel of them i wish i could tell him so i wish i knew how there are so many good things about growing up you can keep your mind on those and climb over the hurts lake falling in love i think i was beginning to foil in love with you i dont want to be your first love stacy youve made that clear i wont forget im an assignment listen to me he says and moves nearer his hands slip from around my shoulders and hold me tightly pressing my cheek against the base of his throat i asked to get taken off the narcotics assignment just so that i could tell you the truth and i asked because i care about you but you told me i said i dont want to be your first love id like to be the real thing and i can wait my cheek glows from the warmth of his skin through his shirt and i can hear the steady beat of his heart i put my arms around him im stacy mcadams im seventeen and im definitely in the right body
